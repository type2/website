No. If you shift at 3,400 RPM (approximately max torque for the stock  
2.0L) from third gear to fourth gear, for instance, you will lug so  
badly in fourth gear that you will quickly shift back into third.   
Why do you feel that 5,400 RPM is high?  I believe it is safe to  
assume that the original engine designers put a sufficient safety  
margin into their engine design.  I would suggest that when you  
accelerate, you shift well above 3,400 RPM so that you keep the  
engine near the 'sweet-spot' in it's torque curve.

I have noticed that many on the list worry about over-speeding the  
engine.  That's not likely to happen with the stock camshaft and  
valves on any VW engine.  Those of us with type 4 engines should be  
more concerned with over-temperatures (cylinder head and oil).
