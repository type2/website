Subject: Strange Co-incidence about stolen silver samba

 http://www.thesamba.com/vw/forum/album_cat.php?cat_id=53&sid=e963b2ff0135644e0eb2f325acdc5795
 
I was browsing thesamba.com and saw a posting about a stolen 23 winmdow in London.
 
Jan & I took a three week trip to London & Paris in MAy/June 2005 and walking around Islington I saw a beautiful 23 window and took a digipic.
 
As it turned out it is the same bus as opsted stolen and he had no pictures of the completed bus.
So beware of silver buses, it is beautiful.
