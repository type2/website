Subject: fuel filler neck and tube

while sitting arounf waiting for the rust breaker to do its thing on the 
right HE bolts so i can retrieve the flap i dropped inside the HE i 
decided to replace my fuel filler neck, which in turn has raised a few 
questions...

how the heck am i supposed to be able to get a screw driver on the clamp 
to loosen it?  The clamp doesn't seem to twist at all, and what my 
fingers tell me is the screw head is wedged into the corner where my 
little stubby screwdriver won't reach!

the filler neck goes on the outside of the metal tube, right?

thanks in advance.
