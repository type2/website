Beware group,
The past two days I've received no less than 20 bogus emails with a new
strain of virus attached.  Some were addressed under the type2 list.  There
is one in particular that has been circulating under the disquise of the
FBI.

PS:  Finally got the 68 running properly.  #1 son just bought an 01 Aztek.
Quirly to say the least.
