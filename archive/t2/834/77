Subject: A sinking feeling (in #3 exhaust)

Hi,

Well I'm just back in from an attempted valve adjustment. Problem is
#3 exhaust is now un-tunable. I just can't get the feeler gauge in
there. So, it would seem that the valve is either stretched, or the
seat is sinking into the head. Either way, looks like its time for a
head change.

Couldn't find any articles in the library regarding head replacement.
Found a number of emails in the archives and that's helping me piece
together what I'll need.

Any help putting a shopping list together?
I've got:

New stock head
Intake manifold gasket(s)
Exhaust/Heater box gaskets
Push rod tubes and seals
New tin screws

I think I'll also be replacing my oil cooler seals while I'm in there.

This is my first head replacement and my first engine pull. Assuming
the 1/2 head is in good condition is it OK to replace the head on only
the left side?

Any tips on installation procedure? Do I need to lap the heads to the
jugs? If so, is this even possible without removing the jugs? If I
remove the jugs will I need a ring compressor to get them back on?
Tips/tricks on getting everything apart and back together smoothly?
Any online resources with step-by-step procedures? Any special tools
that I'll need? Yes, I have the Bentley, will consult before
continuing further.

This bus is my daily driver so I'm hoping to get this all done both
correctly and quickly. I will however be driving a friend's backup car
until everything is good to go again.

Any and all help is greatly appreciated and thanks are offered in advance.

peace

oh, and I'm pretty sure the whole situation was caused by a leaking
brake booster hose causing the 3/4 side to run lean and hot.
Fortunately that issue is now solved, but I'll have to pay for waiting
so long to fix it. yup, I'm a newbie.
