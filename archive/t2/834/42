Subject: Re: [T2] Heat And Muffled Backfiring

Thanks to all who replied suggesting an exhaust leak-this may very well be
the case, as I had the left heat exchanger off  a couple of months ago, so
I will check that as well. Fiddling around with the idle cut-off solenoid
on the front of the left carb does seem to help though. I removed it and
verified it wasn't sticking.  Thanks again,  Jeff
