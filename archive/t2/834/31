Subject: Re: [T2] Heat And Muffled Backfiring

Hi, this has me very curious. When I bought my 73 Bus, it already had been converted to a webber progressive. It has a mechanical advance distributor, with a series of intake runners that then connect to a 2 barrel Webber carburetor. I am under the impression this is called the "Webber Progressive" setup?

In any case, the previous owner ALSO gave me a set of two carburetors... I don't remember what brands they are. The only thing they seem to be missing is the throttle linkage. But, they appear to be aftermarket and somewhat performance oriented.

My question is, is there any benefit to going with dual carburetors other than having it look factory / original? It seems that everyone has problems with the dual carb setup. Do you get slightly more horsepower with the dual carb setup?

I could be wrong, but with the size and length of the runners, I would guess that the 2bbl Webber Progressive setup probably gives you more off the line torque.. which I figure would probably be more usable with the Bus...

Just curious... I'd like to hear from anyone who has used both...


Thanks!!!
