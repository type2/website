Subject: Re: [T2] adding a light to my engine compartment

Hi Sam,

I added a light to the valence over the rear hatch springs, and built  
a switch to turn the light on when the hatch opens. I used a generic  
console light that I picked up at a FLAPS for $3. This light is very  
helpful when working on the engine, as it shines right down through  
the upper hatch. Then I noticed the same store had a  12" 12V   
fluorescent  trouble-light on sale for $4.44, so I picked up one of  
those and used cable-ties to attach it to the roof of the engine  
compartment, and I installed a two-way switch on the engine hatch. I  
eventually plan to install a tilt switch on the engine hatch so I  
will have the option to make the light come on whenever the door is  
opened, or t keep it off or on all the time.
