Subject: FI piston quench area

Hi, was just viewing Adams teardown for sparkplug fix, and noticed the 
pistons have a large recessed area in their crowns.  Mine do not, and mine 
is a carbueretted, 1974.  Since the motor in question, Adams, is an FI, it 
got me thinking, why the piston crown recess.  I think there was no HP gain 
when VW went from my motor to newer FI, so was it for better "burn", and is 
there any advantage to using the newer pistons in older motors?  TIA
