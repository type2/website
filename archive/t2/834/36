 >Hi, this has me very curious. When I bought my 73 Bus, it already had 
been converted to a webber progressive. It has a mechanical advance 
distributor, with a series of intake runners that then connect to a 2 
barrel Webber carburetor. I am under the impression this is called the 
"Webber Progressive" setup?

Correct. If you peruse the archives you will find that the vacuum advance 
distributor is favoured over the mechanical advance only.

 >My question is, is there any benefit to going with dual carburetors other 
than having it look factory / original? It seems that everyone has problems 
with the dual carb setup. Do you get slightly more horsepower with the dual 
carb setup?

The major benefit from stock dual carbs over the single progressive is the 
superior cold weather performance. The long runners of the progressive take 
forever to warm up leading to fuel condensing in them and the mixture 
getting too lean. I have had a few occasions where my bus has been nearly 
undriveable in cold weather.

 >I could be wrong, but with the size and length of the runners, I would 
guess that the 2bbl Webber Progressive setup probably gives you more off 
the line torque.. which I figure would probably be more usable with the Bus...

I suspect there is a limit to this rule of thumb and the Weber runners pass it!

 >Just curious... I'd like to hear from anyone who has used both...

Hopefully this weekend I'll be in that position! I have swapped over to 
twin weber 34 icts but discovered that the fuel pump couldn't cope with 2 
carbs. I suspect the additional restrictions on the fuel lines were too 
much for an already marginal pump. :(
