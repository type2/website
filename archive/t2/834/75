  Just wondering where I should be shifting at? I hate over revving these little engines. What is a practical rev limit for these? I know they originally came with a 5400rpm rev limiting rotor, but I think that seems a bit high. Where is max. torque developed, as wouldn't this be the best place to shift I would think??
