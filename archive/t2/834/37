I have found a listing for Dealer's Driveline Products
(http://www.automotiveengines.com/lb-volkswagen.htm).  Is anyone out there
familiar with them?

Thanks,

Michael Martin

Subject: [T2] T4 Crate Motors



I've got a 76 Trans and have decided to look for a crate motor to replace
mine
and to do my first rebuild on the existing motor as a spare later.

I am looking for recommendations of where to buy a crate motor and advice for
the replacement.  A couple of points to know...my 76 was converted to a weber
progressive and the FI was robbed.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Thanks,
