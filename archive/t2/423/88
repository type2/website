Ok report:
My bus went from Oly WA to Veneta OR.
I ran out of gas. In town on my way out. My bad. Was about a block from the 
gas station. I cannot trust the gas gauge. 1970 VW sundowner. Thats a westy 
without the poptop. Been working on it for about a year, but I have owned it 
for about 5. Sitting collecting dust, but I got it together, and it was 
sweet. Its got a 1776 and dual carbs. Let me tell you folks, get the 1776. I 
did not drive fast, I went about 55 to 60 mph, but I wasnt afraid of hills, 
and I could pass, when needed. I had a full load of stuff, 2 passengers and 
it ran great. I used to worry about temp but this time, I used an oil 
pressure guage instead. I know it ran hot, but I didnt care. I spent so much 
time on getting it to track right, it just was a pleasure. It was HOT 
outside, but I installed a fan up front that occilated so we kept cool. I 
put a marine batttery in it, so when we were at the campground, I used the 
battery hard recharging d-cells with an inverter, and running a cooler, and 
using a fan occasionlly, we still started back up.
Three days without help on the battery and it still worked.
On the other hand, I have a loud crappy tranny. I bungie corded it the whole 
way. Something to rerplace.
OTOH: Taking some time (it really is easy) before hand to replace any worn 
front end tie rods will make you happy. Steering is little to nil, no 
correction needed. I learned this from my 63 when I rebuilt the whole font 
end. You will like it that way!

I replaced the hand crank on the sink with a electric pump, a nice 
conversion. But I kept the marble.
