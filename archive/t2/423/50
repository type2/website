Interestingly enough, it seems like there are quite a few complaints
about Pertronix.  Now, that could be because the Pertronix have a higher
failure rate, or maybe there is just a small install base of compu-fire
on this list.  Either way, I'm going to switch over to the compu-fire
system.  I like the install and it doesn't require any gap adjustment.

VW busses have been in my family for the past 25 years and yeah, the
points have worked fine.  However, I'd like an upgrade, just like I did
with megasquirt.  There are issues either way you go, but I think that
the benefits are worth not having to deal with adjusting points and
checking dwell.  If worst comes to worst, I can always put the points
back in.  I'm willing to take that chance...
