If your 2.0 FI is losing power on the top end, the 4.57 will just reduce your top speed even more.  Otherwise, it would probably increase it as the 2.0 has a HP peak above 4,000rpm.  But how often, really do you drive that fast?  I don't think I would ever sustain 75mph in my bus, even if I could.

Sounds about right.

Highly likely that it was also the .82

Don't know why you got more speed out of it but I think the ratios were in fact the same as #1.

I would think it would go much faster than that.  Maybe your engine is running out of steam at 3800rpm.  I can't fathom a guess as to why.

I think so too.  I don't see why it would be too tall.

I have posted about this on many occasions.  Finally, someone has backed me up.  :)

But what about the mounting issues?  Isn't it a tight squeeze in the rear mounting bracket?  Any NVH issues from this?
