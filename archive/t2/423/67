Subject: idles but dies part II

Well, I got home and did a quick check on the engine, loose wire, hoses off,
oil or gas leaks.  FOUND that the heat sensor on the #3 cylinder was out!  all
the way out hanging in the air!  SO would that make the engine die?  hard to
start?  die when accelerating?  I replaced it, I think the head is stripped
out.  I put some lock tite on it and tighten it up and ran the bus.  Seemed to
fix it?

So how does one fix a stripped out head/ sensor receptor hole?

thanks

back from fishing and wanting to fix the bus so I can go back!  Walleyes were
biting!
