Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Tank Plugged

Hi Rick
I went through something very similar recently. A piece of the CA 
filler neck known as the "bird's beak" fell off some time and fell
down inside the filler neck thus into the tank. It eventually made its
way into the fuel bowl, and clogged the outlet. The PO converted to
carbs on my '77 bus so it didn't pose a problem until i switch back to
Fuel injection. Took me a LONG time to figure out what was making my
fuel pump buzz, and why my fuel pressure was jumping all around. My 
filter wasn't clogged and I knew the tank wasn't rusty. So i took my
tank out to check it out thoroughly. In your case i could see you using
a spring loaded claw pickup tool like i used. It has a handle on one
end and on the other it has 3 little claws. Great for maneuvering into
tight places and very flexible. In the third photo i'm sending you,
the tool is pictured. Also get yourself a mechanics mirror, looks like
a doctors tool. Its got a small one inch mirror on the end of a 
telescoping pole. Both of these i bought at Auto zone, they aren't hard
to find. As to your question what is the metal bowl? I believe its
supposed to concentrate fuel around outlet and return lines. I don't
see how you could damage anything in there when trying to retrieve the
debris, but be gentle when fishing.

By the way those two tools are great for all sorts of thinks besides
fishing junk out of your gas tank.
