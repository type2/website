Subject: [T2] dual weber or fuel-injection?

Hi all,

having a lot of problems with my dual-solex-carbs-setup on my 2liter '78
westy, I'm thinking of some alternatives and I'm looking forward to getting
some input on them.
Wanting to get rid of the Solex-carbs, there are two ways to go: dual
weber-carbs or fuel-injection.
First of all, I want better gas-mileage (mpg). This is the most important
isssue, since I live in Germany, where fuel-prices are high (1 gallon is 4.7
USDollar). I don't want more horsepower (of course it would be a nice
side-effect). Second most important issue is durability.

So here are my questions:
First the weber carbs:
Does anyone have good experience with weber-carbs and what they do to my
fuel-economy?
What would be the correct size of the carbs?
I heard they come without a cold-start-automatic, is this correct? Does this
matter?
Are they hard to adjust? Any problems with the throttle linkage if the
engine is warm/hot (warping, ...)?

Second the fuel-injection:
VW did not sell any fuel-injected type2's in Germany. The apparent problem
is: Where to get parts? Since I don't want to spend a huge amount of money
to get some non-working fi-system shipped by someone I don't know personaly,
here's one alternative I came up with:
This guy (homepage is in german, but check the pics) put a KE-jetronic in a
type4-engine using the 914 intake manifold and many other parts.

Looks very very neat...
Did anyone ever make a conversion like this?
The KE-jetronic is nice, but what about a L-jetronic?

Please share your experience and/or thoughts about this with me.
