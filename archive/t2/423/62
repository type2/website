Have you completed this swap?  I was under the impression that the large
hole through the frame on the early bus was too small for the later box.
I hope that I am wrong on this, since the late boxes are so much better.

On the mounting bolts, you do need to add the tubes to prevent the frame
from being crushed, but you also have to make sure that the tubes are
firmly held to the frame metal on both ends, either by being bolted or by
being welded to the frame metal.  You can't just drill a big hole, slide
the tube in, and bolt things up, since the big hole will not properly
transmit the steering box loads to the frame unless the tube is securely
welded to the frame on the big hole end.

I've never seen a late model box wear out, so this might be a attractive
junkyard swap.
