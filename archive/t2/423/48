Subject: Re: [T2] automatic torque converter?

You didn't mess up the converter in yanking it with the engine---

What you more than likely did mess up is the front seal of the trans--
I'd almost bet thet you nicked it on the way out-
Replace the seal--lube up the seal and converter shaft with a thin film
of grease--and slide it back in the trans--use some saftey wire to hold
it in there, so it doesn't fall out until it's time to put the engine
back in--

Later,

Terry

 
 Subject: [T2] automatic torque converter? 
well, i might have messed my torque converter up in my haste to remove
the engine yesterday. i neglected to read the manual, DOH! and pulled
the engine with the torque converter attatched to it, what are the
chances that i screwed it up in the process?
