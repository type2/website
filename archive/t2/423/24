Subject: Southern California - Anyone need a Deep Cycle Battery?

Made a lucky score yesterday while picking up my new wheels and tires 
for my under construction Baja  at the local Navy Exchange (I'm retired). 

The gal on the cash register asked if I had a need for a deep cycle 
battery.  A customer had dropped off four Kirkland (Cosco?) Group Size 
27DC.  I grabbed two for me to use, but don't have anywhere to store 
more for very long.

If anyone wants me to grab one or both of the other two email me before 
Monday.  I'll check to see if they still have them and I'll email you 
back.  I probably can't deliver it to you but if you can meet me locally 
(Ventura County just north of Los Angeles county on the coast), I'll be 
glad to snag them for you.
