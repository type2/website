Subject: old Zemco cruise question.

Hi all,

     I got my old Zemco cruise control working.  I have one problem.  I have
a white wire coming out of it that is just hanging.  When the cruise is
switched on there is 1.5V there.  I am wondering if anybody has any ideas?
I am not sure of the model number.  The box is about 3/4" x 2" x 4" with a
adjuster wheel on top for engine size & a sensitivity adjustment on the
front.  Thank.
