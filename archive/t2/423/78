Subject: brake light?

Is there a way to adjust the master cylinder\brake light switch so that the
brakelight is activated sooner?

Bus: 1979 Auto Westy

In traffic (common in Toronto), I find that the brake lights engage about half
way down the travel of the pedal. But, the brakes physically engage sooner than
the light.
