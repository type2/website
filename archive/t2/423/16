Where did 009 come from?

That is only on the 74 with carbs, not on fuel injected engines.

advance at 3600RPM to see the total advance, and it went right off the scale!

This is correct. It IS supposed to do this. It should go to the O in VOR. You add the max centrifugal advance
PLUS the vacuum advance PLUS the initial to get TOTAL advance.
Since you say you are not timing it at 5 after, this tells me you don't have vacuum retard connected.
21-25 + 11-13 + 7.5 = 39.5 - 45.5 degrees total advance. You do NOT have a problem!

> Totally advanced. I've got it timed at 7.5 btdc. I know it's supposed to be 5
 ATDC,

It is supposed to be 5 after WITH vacuum retard connected. The hose for vacuum retard is manifold vacuum. It
is a dedicated hose that comes from the rear side of the throttle housing, below the idle speed screw.
Manifold vacuum is there at idle.

> but, the way it runs that can't be right. I did the test in Bentley and the sending disk is
not returning at all.

What is a 'sending disk'?? If you mean the advance side, do you have the correct vacuum source going to it?
Ported vacuum? Ported vacuum is no vacuum at idle, it appears after you open the throttle.

WHY???  There is nothing wrong with yours. It works correctly on the advance side. I have no idea why you
don't have the retard side connected and working.

> Interesting tidbit. The tube from the adv. nipple on the dist. goes to a tee.

Supposed to.

> One goes to the previous mentioned nip. on the throttle body. The other hose
 goes to a screw plug!?

Fix all the other problems first. That hose with a screw plug in it is supposed to be connected to the EEC
valve on the front of the air cleaner. It probably is bad and you were loosing vacuum advance vacuum. Instead
of replacing that to correct your inop evaporative emissions, someone just plugged the line. Now you want to
get rid of a working part?!?

> I guess all I really need to know is if there's a cutoff valve.

NO!!
