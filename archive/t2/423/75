with the sensor out, your FI computer was dumping massive amounts of fuel 
into the engine.  When you'd go to give it gas, it was just flooding. The 
sensors resitance decreases as it warms up.  More resistance, or in this 
case, infinite resistance from an open circuit makes the computer think the 
engine is cold and in need of a little extra fuel to assist with warm up.


That sensor can make a better cold start vavle than the cold start valve 
parts, but I digress.



It's a 10mm x 1mm thread if I recall correctly. Fairly fine.  I chased the 
threads on my head well enough for it to work for quite a while.  The 
cooling trim may be in the way.  It pulled out again somewhere in Ohio, West 
Virginia, I don't remember.  It was hot outside, so I just grounded the 
wire.  Makes starting harder, but once the engine was warmed up, it was great.

I later made a threaded sleave.  There are probably good threads down past 
the reach of the sensor. Thread a rod into those, then thread a sleave onto 
that rod until it touches the head.  Thread the sensor into that sleeve.
Ideally, the sleeve would be aluminum.

I actually used two nuts jammed against each other on the end of a cut off 
bolt for the sleeve.  Worked fine.


My fix seems hokey until you look at the alternatives.  I'd say try JB 
weld,but I'm not sure it's conductive. Even if it's not, you could tap the 
JB weld and then put a washer (with a wire to the block) under the sensor to 
provide the ground.
