Subject: Re: [T2] automatic torque converter?

well, thank the lord, i was starting to get worried their when i went and
read the manual afterward and saw the correct procedure and knowing that it
is near impossible to find these things anymore.  i figured the seal needed
to be replaced anyway.  on a good note, all the oil i dropped on my
driveway looked really clean.

You didn't mess up the converter in yanking it with the engine---

What you more than likely did mess up is the front seal of the trans--
I'd almost bet thet you nicked it on the way out-
Replace the seal--lube up the seal and converter shaft with a thin film
of grease--and slide it back in the trans--use some saftey wire to hold
it in there, so it doesn't fall out until it's time to put the engine
back in--

Later,
