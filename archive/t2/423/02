Subject: Re: [T2] '79 Fuel Pump Problem

Rob.

Welcome..back!  i'm new here myself.

I recently had a similar problem on my '76 Westy, which the PO had left
sitting for a long period of time.  I found that the double relay (fuel
pump relay) had gone bad.  Not sure why when it was just sitting but it
did.

in order to test the fuel pump, i put the key in the RUN position and
placed a pencil in the AFM to move the flap -- this caused the fuel pump to
run, so I assumed the pump was good.  Next step was to test the double
relay via the procedures in the Bentley (requires a test light) and I found
that the relay was bad.   put the new relay in the bus and she started up!!

the relay is also about half the cost of a new fuel pump.

hope this helps.  good luck.

Chris.
