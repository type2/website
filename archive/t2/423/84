Youd think.
But then again the bus is THE best wardriving vehicle I have found so 
far.......
Inverter, a table, a high roof for an antennae. Cold drinks on hand. The 
laptop just likes it.
I used to drive to some remote place in college and type papers in my bus. 
Sometimes I sit outside the office and do my work while in my bus, its just 
that comfy.


If you dont know what that is, have a google search.

NOTICE: I use wardriving as part of my business. I go in and secure critical 
businesses.
