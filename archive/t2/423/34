Subject: Strong odor of gas upon startup after long period of non-use -

I would appreciate any suggestions as to what to look for in the evaporative 
emission control system that would cause there to be a very strong odor of 
gas when first starting up the engine after a prolonged period of non-use. I 
have checked the hoses to the carbon cannister and the overflow pipes and 
find no leaks. Yet as soon as I start the van the cabin fills with fumes 
which dissipate after a few minutes. No similar fuming is experienced upon 
filling the gas tank, or with any other activity that might be causitive of 
fume generation. I assume that the  charcoal has done its thing, and the 
cooling fan is pushing air thru it so as un-burden the entrained gases. But 
shouldn't that vapor be sucked into the air intake and burned? Has anyone 
else experienced this and found a solution? Would the fan be pressurizing 
the gas tank and driving fumes out of the infamous flexible rubber joint 
between the filler pipe and the tank?
Thanks,
Roland Finston
