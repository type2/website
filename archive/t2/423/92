Subject: RE: Insurance?

Hi, I recently just asked a similar question, but from a different point of
view. However, I did find out a few things that might help you. Some
companies (like State Farm) WILL offer FULL coverage on your Bus. However,
they need to send out an appraiser to your vehicle. You basically tell them
how much you want to insure your Bus for, and they'll base your premiums on
that. 
 
With no coverage except liability / state minimum, they want $98 dollars a
year (which is NOT bad at all). My limitations are that I can only drive it
to car shows, special outings, club meetings, and maintenance runs (like
gas, auto parts, etc). 
 
Geico, and most others however will NOT insure the car for anything other
than what the Kelley Blue Book would value it at. And, well.. despite what
WE make think our cars are worth, the truth is that it is a 30 year old car,
and while 99.9% of the country may see an old car and say.. "OH! I'd LOVE to
have one of those". The truth is, they wouldn't ever conceive of the idea
that they could actually own one, or that they would pay a decent amount of
money for one.. so our cars a devalued significantly. The only value our
cars have is to the collector car market, which the KBB doesn't seem to be
on par with.
