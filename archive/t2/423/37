Subject: Fw: [T2] Steering Box Replacement

You have the older worm and peg type box, which is weak. There are
absolutely no new parts available for it. The rebuilts are uneven in
quality, with Bus Boys being the best bet.  The later worm and roller type
boxes(73-79) are bulletproof, and I just ordered a brand new TRW box from
California Import Parts in BC.  The price at this time is $199USD or  $280
Canadian, not bad for a brand new box. They have free shipping for July,
plus 5% off for ordering online. The biggest advantage is since they ship
from Canada, you won't have to pay any duty to receive it, a big savings. US
orders are shipped from the US, they don't pay duty either.
 In order to fit it to your 72, you will need to drill 2 new holes through
your frame, (1 hole lines up already) and put tubes inside to prevent the
frame from buckling when you tighten the bolts up. You will also need a used
late Pitman arm, and you should get a new steering coupler from your local
VW dealer or anyone with German ones for about $30-$50.  If the leak isn't
bad and the box doesn't have a lot of play, you could also just fill it up
with 90W every couple of months or so.

Hi Folks,

I have a 72 bus and the steering box is leaking.  Can I have it rebuilt
and/or the seals replaced or do I have to get a rebuilt one?

If I was to pick up a low-milage used one what years will fit?

Thanks,

Craig
