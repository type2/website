That should have read:

At 15 mph shift into 2nd...
... at 30 mph shift into 3rd...
... at 45 mph (50 mph if highway) shift into 4th...
... top out at 65 mph (yes, I know that your's goes faster!)

Then...
... at 45 mph downshift into 3rd...
... at 30 downshift into 2nd...
... at 15 downshift into 1st...
