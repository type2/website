hey Rodney, point your browser to www.everybus.com I have only been
fortunate to make it once so far, but it's a great time. The date
is usually late april. Depends on when Chris can get the campground.
But if you are wanting to make a campout soon, it just so happens that
High Country Bus Festival is next weekend. in Boone, NC. Go ahead &
make the trip, I double-dog dare you :)
