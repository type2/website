Subject: dash vents sizes

I have some vent s that came from yhe wall behind my seats....
are these vents the same size as that of the dash vents also...

the only way to know is if i pull the vents out of my dash to compare?

does anyone know without doing that if these would be the same size as the dash vents?

they look the same but want to make sure that they will fit a dash also...?
peace
