Subject: Insurance?

I am planning on getting full coverage on my bus. I have enough money in 
her now that I'd hate to have to start over if something happened to her.

She's a 1971 pop top camper, Riviera conversion. Outside perfect. 
Absolutely no rust or dents. New coat of paint. Underneath is solid. Never 
driven in winter salt season. The camper interior is above average and I'm 
working at making her even nicer.

I'm wondering what she might be worth, if I had to try to replace her. Also 
wondering if insurance companies will insure a vehicle that is over 30 
years old for replacement value.

Does anyone have an idea how to find out
