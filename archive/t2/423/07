Subject: From Atlanta way 2 HCBF ?

I plan to be going to HCBF and in case i get to go?? (yet unknown) was wondering if anyone was comeing up from Atlanta way to go to HCBF down hwy 221 ?
It will be late friday eve before we have a chance to push off.
wouldnt mind the company down the road .
Was a suggestion by someone that some folks may be comeing from that direction.
It will at least be after 8 pm sometime at least...
let me know?
we are also signed up on the carrabus list fullmoonbusclub msn site.

I am off of I-85 Boiling Springs exit.....
right before the hwy 221 exit
peace
