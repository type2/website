Subject: Fuel Tank Plugged

Help. Pumpkin II is stuck.

Background:  In order to enhance my chances with CA smog a couple months
ago, I used tire-patch rubber to fix a crack in my fuel filler restrictor
rubber thingy.

Due to a sudden and instantaneous loss of fuel flow, and the fact that my
rubber patch is no longer in the filler neck, I'm pretty sure that it's
sitting square on the outgoing fuel port in the bottom of the tank. My fuel
guage sender is accessible thanks to a PO and his cold chisel, so I'm trying
to fish the sucker out through the little hole. There seems to be a square
metal object attcahed to the inside of the bottom of the tank where the fuel
oulet/return ports should be. Does anyone know what this square thing is and
how it is shaped? I'm trying to figure out the best angle from which to poke
and prod. Is there anything down there that I'm likely to damage by vigorous
probing?

The inside of my tank is pretty clean, and I've never had any crud in the
fuel filter so I don't think I need to do the tank removal and cleaning
process. Any other ideas on how to resurrect my daily driver without major
dramatics?

Thanks,
