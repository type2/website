I've had full coverage on my buses from Maryland Casualty, Farmers, and
currently with Met Life  prices are competitive, but no full coverage is
cheap

but there is a  Kelly "Green" book which is for "historic and
collector" cars and both the split and the bay are in this book...quite a
difference in price listing even when comparing identical cars in both
books (which seems strange)  I didn't know this book existed until I was
arguing with an insurance company about the value of my bus after a minor
accident....a librarian suggested looking in the Green Book when I was
researching values at the local library...didn't know anything about it
but they had a copy on thier shelves,  as soon as I mentioned it to the
insurance adjuster they immediately changed thier tune, as though they
knew this book was there but hopeing no one else did.
