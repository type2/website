No, the sodium, being a liquid at operating temperatures, moves heat more
rapidly from the head of the valve to the stem where it is transmitted to
the head through the valve guide.  It can do this because the heat travels
by convection, moving with the fluid rather than being conducted through
the metal.

Should you ever try to open one of these valves, be aware that sodium is
very reactive in contact with water.  A 1/4 inch cube of sodium dropped in
a bucket of water will react violently, evolve heat and hydrogen gas,
which will ignite and create a very nice explosion of large firecracker
proportion.  It will also spray everything with corrosive sodium
hydroxide.  Fun for chemistry teachers!
