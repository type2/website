Subject: ??vacuum adv. cutoff valve

It's me again, Hiya

Does anyone know if the 009 dist. has a vacuum adv. cutoff valve? I'm reading 
Bentley
sec.5 p>73. My ' 79 Cal. fi elec. ign. 2L  009 dist. adv. nipple just goes to 
the front
[of the bus] of the throttle body. I'm wondering 'cause I thought I would 
check the
advance at 3600RPM to see the total advance, and it went right off the scale!
Totally advanced. I've got it timed at 7.5 btdc. I know it's supposed to be 5 
ATDC,but,
the way it runs that can't be right. I did the test in Bentley and the 
sending disk is
not returning at all. So..out with the dizzy. Can you still get 205 
distributors?
Interesting tidbit. The tube from the adv. nipple on the dist. goes to a tee.
One goes to the previous mentioned nip. on the throttle body. The other hose 
goes to
a screw plug!? I guess all I really need to know is if there's a cutoff 
valve.
Thanks in advance (jeez)
