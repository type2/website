not much wear seen, the nut was on tight. i was surprised to see it just
slide off. i had the puller on it ready for the big snap and nothing. what
a let down. wow what a day though. steering box, turn signal switch,
ignition lock, 9 pin relay, and dash pod. 90+ in the shade. best thing
about today was taking old list advice in getting the plastic snaps off the
fresh air/heat levers. use a 6mm socket to press them out.  - steve
