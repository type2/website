Rather than spending a lot of bucks on pointless ignition, why not just
put the points back into correct order?  I've driven a very long way on
points ignition.  The only maintainance I do is to put a dwell meter
across the coil every oil change to check the dwell.  I probably have to
make an adjustment every 15K or so.  The hassles I have had with points
have been far less then the hassles I had with a Pertronix that decided
to give up the ghost on the road.  When electronic ignitions go out,
there is no fixing them, you either replace them or go back to points.
