Subject: Shade tree mechanic needed in Waldorf MD

I need someone to help get a vw on the road that was stored the past 10 
years.

I would expect the typical problems, oil, tune up, brakes, and gas line.

I want to be able to drive it 70 miles from Waldorf MD to Springfield VA.  
Thanks.

(Melissa, are you out there??)
