First prove that you are getting fuel from gas tank by disconnecting the
inlet side of the pump. The pump is lubricated by fuel flowing through the
mechanism so don't ruin a good pump by running it dry.

If your gas lines to the pump are clogged then you've got to deal with that.
I often pick up FI pumps at the junkyard for $6-10. I don't know if that's
lucky or not but it's been my experience.
