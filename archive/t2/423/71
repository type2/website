That bus still looks sweet. That cab floor and the condition of the front
carpet: very rare but it indeed looks like it has seen some Manitoba winters
after all...

Now that you've found rust, keep looking. If you can see rust on the outside
there are probably more places rusting that you can't see.

I found body rust in some sneaky places that I wish I had found years ago:

- inner bottom of the front doors where water drips and collects
- bottom edges of front doors
- inside doors below scrapers
- in the hinge area of the front doors
- under the foot steps in the wheel well
- bottom of the sliding door
- behind the rear bumper
- behind the front grill in the fresh air intake
- rain gutter
- under window seals

Everyone knows about the windshield area, battery trays, rocker panels, etc.
