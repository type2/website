Subject: Won't idle when cold

My '71 deluxe won't idle when it is cold but, once it has been driven for 7
- 10 minutes it will idle ok. It is a 34pict carb with the automatic choke
diconnected. I am not sure if it idled on a cold startup before I
disconnected the choke because the choke wire was fried.
