However, I've never had points fail on the road, probably because I
perform a simple dwell check every oil change.  It is a lot easier to
do a simple adjustment once a year or so in my driveway than it was to
un-retrofit the Pertronix in the middle of the Mojave.  With points, I
would just swap distributors if the need arose (and it never has).

I think that most of the problems people have with points are the result
of not checking dwell regularly.  There seems to have been some bum sets
of points out there, but I buy from reputable list suppliers and have
never received a bad set.

All in all, it's a religious argument.
