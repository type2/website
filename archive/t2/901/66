I wonder how   much of this is "because-it's-there" reasoning... ?-(
Once one manufacturer puts a DVD player in their car, it's almost
axiomatic that others will follow and up the ante with built-in cell
phones, etc...
Not to mention the electronics involved with just ABS that has
morphed into electronic suspensions and drive by wire systems...
Now in my personal life I'm selectively luddite, but I can under-
stand how electronics has pervaded auto design, but... It can
have bad long term results when coupled with cost-cutting and
outsourcing to the lowest priced supplier...
I'm on another list, and a former Volvo engineer bemoans the
Ford takeover...Essentially, Ford supplies Volvo with their junk
(his term) and expects Volvo to use it AND expects Volvo
to maintain its reputation for safety and reliability... ;-(
