I think the remote starter is my next move.  Cheers...KR

The very first thing to do since it's so easy is use a screwdriver or remote
starter switch. On my last drive from CO to CA if we stopped for lunch or
dinner the heatsoak would get to things. A "maybe" click and that's it. I
would grab the screwdriver and dive under the bus (after making sure it's in
neutral... 3 times!) and it would fire right up. Interesting thing is that
the Guac's never done it since. Even driving across the Mojave desert in
120* heat for the CA trip I'm on now.

I do like the idea of a remote starter switch in the engine compartment.
Mate that with a separate switch to energize the ignition too. Should be
very simple to do. Just make sure there's some way to lock it so nobody
figures it out and steals your bus. (A locking hatch would probably be
fine.)
