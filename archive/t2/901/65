Re use of vapor recovery nozzles- you have to pull back the 
spring/loaded accordion first and then put the nozzle in and hold it 
that way until it clicks.  The attendants in NJ (a can't pump your own 
state) have never stopped me when they realize they must hold it the 
whole time, or risk the nozzle falling out or poking a hole in the 
rubber neck and letting gas run onto the ground........my daughter pumps 
her own 75 bus here also without a problem.
