Funny enough, last night I watched THE definitive movie about the  
Free Software/GNU/Open Source movement.

"Revolution OS." I highly recommend it.

I guess the largest problem with Open Source cars would be  
distributed manufacturing, though.

Figure out that piece, and the collective dream of a better/cheaper  
vehicle could become a reality.

Nonetheless...the VW platform seems to be about as close to Open  
Source as you can get.

Anton - Beetles and Buses and BSD, of my!
