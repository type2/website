> I'm thinking of re-installing my old arms just to get a feel for how
the install _should_ go.  My thinking: If the old arms can't install,
its a tube issue.  If they can, its an arm issue.

Well, I had the same experience with the old arms, so its either a tube
issue or a meat-ware issue (that'd be me).  I don't know what to do at
this point.  I'm afraid I might have screwed up the tube in some way so
no arm can fit anymore.  Or, maybe, I don't know what the hell I'm
doing.

(-at-)$%#$%(-at-)!  I'm throwing in the tools for a beer, and a hope someone has
a nice pearl of wisdom that'll help get this fixed.  Something's not
right.
