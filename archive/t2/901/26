His best bet is to sell them both as is or doing as little as possible to  
get them drivable and hope he can make some money off them. To make them both  
reliable and make money off them is hard being the resale value is low.  
Converting one into a truck is a huge waste of time. Then he ends up with a  cut up 
van that he can't give away. Cutting the top off and welding a back  section 
on to make a double cab sounds pretty straight forward but, after many  months 
of doing this and not finishing it the "lack of time" thing is out the  
window.
