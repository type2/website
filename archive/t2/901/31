If you think about it, the Vanagon would be beautiful on paper. And even in
testing. It's the decades of use that it's not so good at. Even then, there
are still lots out there. Plus VW had gotten a taste of the 5 year cycle by
then with their 70's watercooled Rabbit and other cars. So they thought the
Vanagon would fall into that same 5year cycle.
