Not coincidentally, emissivity is 1-reflectivity.  I suspect the
reason the pulley (especially if it's one of those shiny aftermarket
types) appears to be radiating so much IR isn't because it's hot, but
because it's reflecting IR from another source, like the sun (if this
picture was taken outdoors).

The trick with these IR pictures is that they don't show temperature,
they show energy at IR wavelengths which may or may not be correlated
to the temperature of whatever you're taking the picture of.

To give you an idea on prices, you can purchase a small IR digital
camera with a 0.058 megapixel sensor for around $7000.  You can lease
one with a 1.5 megapixel sensor for around $1000 per month.
