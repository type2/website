I have a spare points I'm going to pop in today. The dist looked good while
peeking with a flashlight. But I'll pull it today after taking my mom in for
her PET scan.

I'm driving on my spare coil. :( I really REALLY don't want to go buy
another Autozone piece of crap. And the good parts places are closed today.
:(

Would a condensor increase the dwell? Yeah, I guess it could now that I
think about it. It would also weaken the spark. No pitting visible on the
points, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything.

I'm also keeping vacuum leaks in mind, but that dwell being so screwy even
with a .018 gap makes me wonder.

Bad: While test driving last night a hubcap flew off. It made it all the way
here from CO without any problems. Why would it fly off now? I had better
check the phase of the moon...
