Subject: Bug website?

Hi there,I'm in the process of putting a new engine in my '77 westy but in the
meantime I bought a '73 bug to get around in.I'm trying to find out whether
it's a super beetle or not.It has struts in the front plastic dash and a
curved windshield ,1600 cc engine so I think it is.Does anyone have any
suggestions for a decent bug website?
Thanks in advance.
