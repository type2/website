Subject: 69 Westy Oil Filter Plate

Hey guys,

Developed a very small leak from the oil filter (ha, what a laugh  
that is) plate on my nearly new MexiMotor.

I retightened down the bolts...some were just a smidge loose.

Had heard someone mention not to OVER-tighten these.

Thoughts???

Thanks,
Anton
