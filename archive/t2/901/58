Subject: Re: [T2] upper torsion arm won't go in

Well, since posting, I pulled both arms off and compared them to the
ones that I had originally.  The left-side (the side that went easy)
section that slides into the tube is about 1/4" longer than the
original.  I thought that was really weird.  The right-side is pretty
much the same.  It just looks worse now after all that banging. I'm
thinking of re-installing my old arms just to get a feel for how the
install _should_ go.  If the bus-boys arms can't go in like that, I'll
buy new joints and have them pressed in.  

The whole point of getting arms was to make things easier.  Seems like
this time-saver has become a time consumer.  My thinking: If the old
arms can't install, its a tube issue.  If they can, its an arm issue. 
Any opinions about this plan of attack would be appreciated.

I also dug a little into theSamba chatrooms (a resource I really need
to start using), and read that the bus-boys arms have gotten a pretty
bad rap over the last 6 months.  _rolling eyes_ great.  After theSamba
comments, I'm awfully leery of retaining the bus-boys arms.  It seemed
like everyone had good things to say about Scott's (GermanSupply) ball
joints (Brazilian?) and nothing good to say about the "Made in Germany"
ones saying their performance is "tight".  Regardless, vendor
suggestions are welcome.  

Any locals have a suggestion for who to do the pressing once I have the
new ball joints in hand?  I'm going to be up against a time-wall here
pretty soon, so I'll need to remedy this in the next few days.  As
such, shipping costs will have to factor in.  Oi.  I'll be calling
Discount Import Parts in the AM to see what ball joints they carry. 
Who knows, my luck may change, and they may have the GermanSupply ones
(sans shipping).
