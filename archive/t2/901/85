Have you tried that out?  It seems that the IR from the LEDs or lamps
would wash out the IR emission from the engine, which is what you're
hoping to capture.  As well, at the temperatures we're hoping to see,
the peaks of the IR emissions are at a longer wavelength than what
CCDs in digital cameras are able to capture, assuming the IR filter
has been taken off the CCD.

The image of the bug engine was taken with an infrared camera that is
sensitive to the appropriate wavelength, and no IR LEDs or lamps were
used.  The colours are indeed false - the image from the infrared
camera are the equivalent of black and white.

As Richard points out, these cameras are not cheap.

The bug engine IR photo can also be misleading - I don't think there
was any compensation for the different emissivities of the surfaces
being imaged.  As far as I know, this is also a problem for most IR
pyrometers.
