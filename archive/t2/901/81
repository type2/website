Subject: Koni Shocks Question

I just ordered 2 rear Koni shocks from Bus Depot (part # 802220) for my  1969 
bus. The only Koni front shocks that they have available are  for 70-79 buses 
( part # 802110).  Is there a practical modification  that will permit the 
Koni front shocks for the 70-79 models to fit a 1969?   If not what front shock 
would be the best choice to match up with the Koni  rears?   
 
Many thanks....Emerson Smith - Elizabethton, TN
