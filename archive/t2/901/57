I zoomed up to Merced after seeing Karl's post. Needed two spares for 
the '79, same Hankooks as the recent Bus Depot special!  There's one 
left, already off the van. It's flat, so I went for the one with air 
pressure on the front.

Found an ignition module in a nearby wasseboxer, 211 905 351D, 
AEG-Telefunken, if anyone needs one.
