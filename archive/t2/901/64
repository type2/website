Subject: Re: [T2] Top Weekend-lost key scenario

Re cutting out the steering lock- reminds me of the time we lost our key 
to the 71 Westy  at the shore- First, had to break in using a coat 
hangar through a screwdriver pried upper front door corner- then recall 
I removed the entire steering column to hacksaw out the 
ignition/steering lock.  Drove that bus for many years with a separate 
ignition switch and push button starter switch!  Taught me to use a 
magnetic box.  The irony is that I notified the badge collectors about 
the lost key, and the next day got a call the key had been found!
