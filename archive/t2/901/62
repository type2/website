Hi Volks,

I am researching an odd starting issue.  On an '82 aircooled FI, it doesn't
like to start cold.  Runs badly, needs a lot of throttle peddle, and tries
to die.  Act like an overfueling issue.  Once warm, it seems to run well.
Have tried disconnecting the cold start injector, but not sure it has made
any difference.

Looking through the archives, but thought I would post this here just in
case.

Thanks,
Burt
