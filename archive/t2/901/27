Subject: Annapolis MD Mechanic/Body Work Needed

My neighbor (a very talented guy) used to work at Dick's maybe 18 months ago.  
At the time he left, he said the best guys were also leaving with him.  I don't 
know the current status of the workforce.  Would recommend due diligence, 
specifically a strong RECENT endorsement of the shop.... FYI.

Dick's autohaus in Wye Mills go to the intersection of 50 and 213 I think
(either that or 404) and turn left he's just a short distance on the
right.  not sure if they even have addresses in that town.

sorry I could drive right to it but hard to give directions.  there's only
two traffic lights in town, it is one of those, first one I think
