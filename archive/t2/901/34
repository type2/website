I do like the addition of a relay to activate the
solenoid (and a relay for the relay for the relay?)
and if you do add a relay, you can also add a switch
in the engine compartment, providing a full
battery-strength path to the relay... I did have some
times that the voltage was too low 'through the loop'
to activate the relay! A person could use a key-switch
for this if you're concerned about it being used to
steal the bus, but having a separate starter button
helps for stuff like adjusting points where you don't
want the coil powered up.

A side note: I have just recently added a computer
reset switch to my bus. {Not necessary or even useful
for stock FI, by the way} I set it up so that in
normal mode, the relay is closed and the computer has
power. To reset, I just activate the relay via a
switch in the driver area and it opens the circuit for
the computer. After a few seconds, the computer resets
to default mode, gets fresh readings from all the
sensors, and away we go! Yes, it does work (for the
Subaru - and your "other car" if it suddenly starts
acting strange!)
I used a momentary switch and placed it in the front
kick panel but am planning to change it to a mini
toggle switch so I can use it as an emergency
disabling device - able to tap it with my foot as I
bail out!
Earlier plans were to use three switches in a row with
computer keyboard type keys labeled "ALT - CTRL - DEL"

Why have the reset switch? I am not using all the
engine control devices that the Subaru had on it
originally and certain situations cause the computer
to switch to either "last good signal" mode or "limp
home mode" for some functions. It rarely happens -
mostly associated with the lack of any of the
cold-start apparatus
