Subject: Re: [T2] Yet another Not-a-new-bus

In our local VW club we have an SBC engineer who gave me quite an eye
opening chat on the difference between US and German auto engineering and
manufacturing. He said the junior german engineers who work on designs have
to have their work scrutinized by senior engineers who make them justify
everything and be sure all the math was correct for the application,
including how many and what size bolts are used. He said in the US, parts
and labor are cheaper than engineering, so we just throw a bunch of bolts or
screws on and call it good instead of engineering the application.
