If you want a picture like this, grab your digital camera...

get some IR LED's...  You can get an infra-red illuminator
lamps instead, but those are expensive...  just get a bunch
of the IR LED's and wire them up..

start your vehicle in the dark...  point the IR LED's at the
part you want temperature of, and take a picture with
your camera (FLASH OFF)

the picture may require some editing  in photoshop
to get the "neat" colors..
