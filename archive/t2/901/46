Subject: Not another tire post!

If anyone needs 3 nice barely used Hancook RA08 185R14C tires,
and lives in the central valley of California,
and wants to go to Pick n Pull on Childs Ave in Merced.....
Go get them, they are on a 82 Vanagon. Mounted, balanced, and ready to mount on your 71+ bay/Vanagon.

The left front tire is no good.
