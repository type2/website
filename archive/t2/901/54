I think posts like this should be banned if nothing else for the jealousy factor.  
  
  No seriously, sounds like great fun.  I hope to rent a bus and  tour Europe sometime.   I've spent just enough time there  (working on cruise ships) to know that I need to come back when I can  stay longer.  I have a good friend in southern France that I need  to visit.  (He's English but married to a lovely French  girl).  I even find the French to be quite friendly if you at  least try to speak French.  I never ran into the snobbery problems  that most Americans run into.  But then those Americans who go to  France and expect the French to speak to them in English are some of  the same ones who get pissed at a couple of Mexicans speaking Spanish  here in America.  
  
  Back to the bus content.  Did you see many other Type2's?  I  don't remember seeing any when I was there.  But that was only for  a couple of days.  I'm sure there are some good air-cooled  mechanics there.  
  
  Thanks for the post.   Cheers...KR

lovely young (20) friend of ours has a type two that she uses during the
summer, we've known her since she was 12.   During the winter I look after
the van and put it through the MOT etc .. (her dad pays all the bills (He
just happens to be a millionaire in medium sized way)).

Last week she was at a campsite in the Central Massif (France) and while
there were five girls asleep in the bus someone opened the front door (I
wish I hadn't oiled the locks!) and stole her bag.    In it was her
passport, mobile phone, bank cards and most importantly the keys for the
bus.    Her dad called me and I sent the spare set of keys by Datapost
(Small tip here use FEDEX) and when they arrived it became obvious that this
would not help.    When they told the police that they could not move the
van the police had it recovered to a local garage.    The garage cut out the
lower part of the lock and removed the steering lock then they made up a way
that the bus could be "Hotwired" with two bits of wire.   Fair enough ..

They drove to a Chateau near Avignon that her father rented for the summer
... He saw the Hotwires and became somewhat distressed ... He phoned me up
and asked what the hell he should do,  He wasn't impressed with the "Mess"
that the French mechanic had made of it.     I thought about it, Grabbed my
passport and drove to Waterloo, Eurostar to Paris and then the TGV to
Avignon (300KPH and you don't even get ripples on your (superb) coffee).
By 3pm on saturday I was there .. The French Mechanic had (In my opinion)
done exactly the right thing and I explained this to all and sundry.
