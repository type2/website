Subject: Dixie Bus Gathering Page

Hello Folks,
I am soliciting ideas and feedback.  Here is a link to my web page for Dixie
Bus Gathering.  Please take a moment and tell me what it needs to be
effective.  Any and all ideas are welcomed.  I have two Dixie Logos, a third
on its way, and would even take a survey on which to use as on official.
Thank you Floyd Dubart of Chicago and BNB02 fame,and Greg Potts from Canada.
Thank you for your time.
Have a great weekend.

Don't forget, Dixie Bus Gathering, hosted by your ole' friend Chili.
