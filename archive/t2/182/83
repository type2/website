Subject: Re: [T2] Starter bushing

I learned this from a vw tech when i was a kid.  take a bolt about 6 
inches long that just fits inside of the bushing. put a nut on the bolt 
turned up to the length of the bushing.  slide busing on bolt. slide in 
position and gently tap into place.  Works great.  put a little sticky 
grease on the bolt to hold the bushing on better.
