Subject: Re: [T2] Jupiter Tires?

Les Swaub has been selling the Jupiters in the Great Northwest for many 
years. I held out till I found the Conti's at Tire Rack (Thank's Nemo). 
They were $238 delivered for 4. I've seen the Jupiters and did not like at 
all the obvious radial seams I saw in the sidewalls. Guess what? The 
Conti's needed very few and small weights to balance. This is another 
indication of quality specs. I've only had them on the Bus for a few days. 
They sure are a world better handling than the non-spec crap that was on there.
