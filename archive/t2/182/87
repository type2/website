Subject: Re: [T2] Jupiter Tires?

[...]
I've run Jupiters for over 10 years on 2 early baywindow Westfalias, and they have been absolutely trouble free.  They handle almost as well as the best tires I've ever had on a bus - a Semperit model purpose made for VW Type 2s which is NLA in the States.

They've given me ~85-90,000 miles of wear when rotated front to back same side.  The buses were/are daily drivers averaging ~18-20,000 miles/year of mixed freeway and metropolitan travel.  I run them at 32psi front, 42psi rear and the wear is even across the width of the tread.

I was skeptical of quality at first but the low price was very attractive, especially given the heavy duty specs of these tires.  Les Schwab Tires provided [and still does] a good warranty, which added to my confidence.  None of the Jupiters [a total of 10 tires] has needed more than 2 ounces of weight to balance the wheel/tire assembly on Les Schwab's computerized high speed balancer, and I expect much of that was due to imbalance in the steel wheels.

The only drawback is that the Jupiters are NOT branded with the M/S rating so don't qualify as such with the State Patrol on mountain passes.  The passenger version of these tires has the identical tread design, and IS branded M/S on the sidewall.  The Jupiter tire paperwork from the factory lists the bus tires as M/S rated, but lacking that sidewall brand they don't legally qualify.  Despite the bureaucratic nonsense, the Jupiters perform very well in snow, and above average in the rain.

FWIW...  YMMV...  Etc., etc., etc...
