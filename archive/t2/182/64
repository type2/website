Probably came from a Type3 squareback/fastback.... the oil sender was on the
oil cooler.

Hi Guys,
Have a 56' single cab that someone in the past put in a 1600. When pulling the
motor to freshen it up, I couldn't find the oil pressure sender. Upon pulling
the motor found that the oil pressure sender area was never tapped. There's no
machine marks, plugs, etc, anywhere for a oil sender. Any ideas what this
block came out of ? Motor runs great.

MANY THANKS,
Jim In Nashville "Music City"
