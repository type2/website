Another guy and I are working on possibly adding on to the Austin Air
Coolers VW Gang with a Dallas Air Coolers VW Gang.  We are looking for
other interested in a laid back VW gang.  No offense to any other club
intended here folks...  I just happen to like the way this club's
attitude about VW ownership, and the extra effort put into friendship
among VW owners.  If you think you might be interested in a Dallas gang,
please contact me offlist for the details.  

Thanks all!
