Subject: Turn Signals and Blown Fuse

Tricky troubling problem for me. I've found posts with similar problems,
but no solution that applies to my specific need:

Recently bought a 1976 bus. The previous owner had lost the keys, so I
installed a new ignition switch. Success at this led to failure of the turn
signals. Turning left is fine, but turning right ALWAYS blows the fuse
(#12). Windshield wipers work fine. Lights are fine. Hazard switch doesn't
blow the fuse, but the turn signal indicator light holds on (no flashing)
and the outside lights do not come on at all.

Any help would be appreciated!

Thanks,
cv
