I am getting something similar on my '80. The brake light 
comes on when the rev's drop. If I am driving down the 
highway and decide to shift to neutral (for whatever reason) 
the brake light comes on as the revs drop to idle. Even if I 
do not touch the brakes.

I suspect the alternator is on its last legs but that is 
just a guess. Let me know what you find out.

Thanks,
Chris
