Subject: Light Question

Evening, all-

I just noticed this quirk. When I stat up on warm mornings and the engine
idles low for a minute or two, the alternator light stays on until the revs
come up. That is expected. What I noticed is the the little 'B' brake
circuit light also stays on and then goes off when the alternator light
does. Is this typical, or normal? Does this indicate that the brake light is
hooked up wrong?

Just wondering,
