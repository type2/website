When i was still in the TAC side of the air force we had a gen set 
called a dash eight.  We would take insulated safety gloves and  set 
metal coffee pots and canned foods on the exhaust port for very short 
periods of time.  BTW we had a butterbar find out why we put a couple 
holes in the lid of cans.
