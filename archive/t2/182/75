Subject: Re: [T2] bus painting (hippy style) question


Hey ya Mat

Great therapy project! Don't concern yourself about painting a little 
personality or doing anything to a bus that can be undone.  Only those who 
can afford to be purist are....

My suggestion on painting would be to make stencils from cardboard or a 
plastic material and use spray paint in a verity of bright colors.  The more 
talented can be assigned their own panel or portion of panels.  Lettered 
stencils can be used to put positive and affirmative sayings or slogans.

Go for it, take pictures and post it so even when the bus is not near them 
they can access a puter and admire their handy work!
