Loaf owners,
Does anyone know where I can get a dome light for a 71 loaf? It's the =
front light with the 3 way switch. I have a source but they want $35 =
dollars.

Also, has anyone done a analysis of fits for this application using an =
american or some other brand dome light that would fit or be fittable?

Thanks, Joel
