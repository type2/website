Subject: North Carolina to Texas?

Would there happen to be anyone traveling from the west side of North
Carolina to Fort Worth, Texas in the next month or two? I'd like to find
someone who would transport a full length bus roof rack on your roof or
trailer or somehow. It could possibly scratch your roof where the feet
and clamps go, so if you have a very nice bus or paint job, you might not
want to do it. But if your bus is like mine, I'll let you choose from my
fine selection of krylon to touch it up : )  I'll pay $100 in small
unmarked bills upon safe arrival to Fort Worth, Texas. This should cover
your gas and a few happy meals between here and there ( about 1000 miles
)  
Thanks, Chris
