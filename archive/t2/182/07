Hi Guys,
Have a 56' single cab that someone in the past put in a 1600. When =
pulling the motor to freshen it up, I couldn't find the oil pressure =
sender. Upon pulling the motor found that the oil pressure sender area =
was never tapped. There's no machine marks, plugs, etc, anywhere for a =
oil sender. Any ideas what this block came out of ? Motor runs great.

MANY THANKS,
Jim In Nashville "Music City"=20
