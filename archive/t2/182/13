Subject: Re: [T2] what i love/hate about bus ownership

What I hate about my bus:

1)Always wants to break down when I am getting ready to leave for a trip
2)hoping it doesn't break down on my trip
3)when a group of girls going by wave they are 16
4) when a group of women my age go by they think I am 16
5) being nervous about cops, even though I am 100% legal
6) knowing I have learned enough that when I break down I have to have the
bus towed to my house so I can work on it instead of a shop like everybody
else
7) squatting to do most of the work on the engine in my 72
8) only 1 place in town to buy parts and they are expensive

Things I like about my bus:
1) the sound of the sliding door
2) its a rolling hotel room
3) other bus people who wave
4) "I used to have one of those"
5) "when we get to the top of the hill do you want to check your water?"
hehe
6) knowing I have learned enough that when I break down I have to have the
bus towed to my house so I can work on it instead of a shop like everybody
else
7) the list of course
8) and the campouts... like Sunshine Daydream
