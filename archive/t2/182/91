well torque to spec, but one thing that does need to be done is to make
sure the wheel is seated fully, I have seen many that the wheel nut is not
fully down into the recess and it is hung up on a slight imperfection in
the wheel, so after a while the imperfection lets go and the lug nut gets
loose...

no it isn't.... I wonder if the lug nuts comming off was the only
thing.  only time I had the experience the car made a horrible racket for
quite a while before we discovered the loose lug nuts.
