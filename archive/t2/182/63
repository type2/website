Subject: Things I love/hate about my bus

LOVE- When people say "Whaddaya mean there's no radiator?!"

HATE- That all the quality parts I really need have to be mail ordered.

LOVE- The looks I get from kids, the waves from other V-Dubbers, the stories
from all the
            'we used to have one of those'-ers.

HATE- The tire grunts who want to use the floor jack under the 'rear axle'.

LOVE- The big, flat sterring wheel. Perfect for leaning on while cruising a
two lane.

HATE- People telling me the drive train makes a great dune buggy.

LOVE- Tinkering with the engine to hear it purr.

HATE- Teenagers assuming I know where to buy pot.

LOVE- Folding out the bed for a nice nap while traveling.

HATE- Never getting a definitive answer about the best oil for our engines!

LOVE- Arguing about the best oil for our engines.

HATE- Over-stressed SUV-ers riding my bumper.

LOVE- Making  over-stressed SUV-ers ride my bumper.

HATE- Drivers passing me on the right without giving me a chance to move
over even though my turn signal is on.

LOVE- Getting waves from bikers as part of the larger air-cooled tribe.

HATE- Not getting waves from New Beetle drivers even when I'm being nice and
waving to them. (Not often.)

LOVE- Owning, driving, tinkering with, worrying over, talking about my bus!

Just off the top of my head,
Dave
74 Riviera, The best!
