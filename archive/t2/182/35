Subject: Bus seats in St. Petersburg area

I'm moving and, of course, I waited until the last minute to pack.  Anyhow, 
I've decided to part with my two rear seats from the bus.  They are the 
standard brown pieces of... erm... superior craftsmanship... or something 
;)   I plan on bringing them up to the next S.P.A.C.E. meeting if I can 
find the time, but I figured I'd offer them to the list first and 
foremost.  If you're in the St. Petersburg area and wanna' take a look and 
give me a decent amount for them (or trade for nifty VW stuff), let me know 
and we can work out the details.  Thanks, folks!
