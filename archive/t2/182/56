Trey,

Two types of paint on this high traffic pedal will work,and last.

(1) Epoxy paint
(2) Urethane

Seeing as how Imron is expensive and doesn't come in spray can, use the
epoxy paint.

Sand the metal down with 320 paper, and shoot a little spay can primer,
let dry sand lightly with 320 again and blow a couple of coats of black
epoxy paint on it----

Have several beers then.

Let it dry for at least 12 hours, and your good to go.
 

Later,

Terry
