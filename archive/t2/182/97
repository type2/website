Subject: drain plugs on front cab stebs

On my '71 Westy, there is a large hole on each side of the cab just inside
of the outer step. One of the sides has a plastic plug that covers the
hole, and water seems to pool here, partly because of old door seals. The
other side is missing the plug, and I would imagine that water goes down
there...I initially thought it drained into the bumper side support
bracket, but it doesn't seem to go through. 

What are these holes for? Should I plug them or leave them open? 

Thanks! 
Dan Curran
