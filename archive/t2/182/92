Subject: Things I love about my 79 Camper 

I love it when other VW or older Porsche owners wave at me . It's great to
cruise around in . I don't need to drive fast like all the other impatient
sheep . I used to be a Mustang 5.0 owner , every idiot in some Japanese
econobox and every chevy moron had to race me . The last race I was in , I
race a Porsche 911 , I blew his doors because I built my Mustang right .
When we pulled over I asked him how fast we were going because my
speedometer only went to 85 mph . He was at 160mph and I was leaving him ,
that was a wakeup call . Just think of what could happen at 160mph plus . I
sold it , bought my 1979 bus and I love it . Besides there is more
friendship amoung us bus owners than any other car club I've seen . Be proud
of you're bus , it's truely unique amoungst all the mall rovers the masses
of sheep buy . Keep on Bussin !
