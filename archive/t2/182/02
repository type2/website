HAHAHA!!!  I've had a friend scream when I started 
a 'green light creep' towards the car in front, at 
least 3 ft. of room ahead...

Oh, and the ease of parking's good

The VW smell is THE BEST!

Being the designated driver for 6 people is kinda 
nice.  At least the ride there is.

Having lots to talk about with people 30+ years older 
than I.

Ease of repairs are nice.  My buddy was floored when 
he found me dropping the motor alone, with ease!

The giggles of joy and chants from my 5 and 2 year old 
when we tell them we're 'goin' in Speedy'.

And the hits keep rollin' on...

The horror I put my first-time passengers through when
I stop REALLY close to the car in front of me at a
stop light when the passenger is used to having an
engine in the front. heh heh

The feeling of being at home when the wind whistles
through the screens in my louvered windows. 

The authentic VW scent. 

Moving my entire dorm room in one trip.

Envious stares from the owners of those American POS's
