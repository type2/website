Hello,

I have a project bus with a little rust here and there......strong =
motor.  It is a pop top 1975 model..still has the rear bed and upper =
mattress. Pop top canvas has a few tears (could stand =
replacing.......most of the rust is surface rust.  A quick sanding and =
it could be sprayed. =20

Down side...needs shift linkage adjustment....it is not the transmission =
or clutch or cable.  I just can't seem to get it right.Either i have =
reverse and 2 forward gears, then i move it, and i have 3 forward gears =
and no reverse.

I bought this van to help a customer of mine out of a jamb, and do not =
have time to spend to fix it up for resale.  Mechanically it is in =
pretty good shape.  It could be fixed up, or for parts.

The price is $800 firm.......you get the bus, and 2 repair panels for =
the inner front steps.  also a good head exchanger ( one on the bus is =
rusted thru)  This is what I have in it, and with a day of work, you =
