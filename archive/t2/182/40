Thanks to all that responded.

 

I backed off the brake adjusters and started the engine and began rocking back and forth, finally the rear brakes broke loose.

The shoes had rusted to the drums. It seems that since asbestos shoes are NLA there is too much metal in the current type shoes, that when parked overnight wet they will rust solid.

Anyone know of shoes with less metal in them?
