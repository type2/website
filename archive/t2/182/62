Subject: Getting an engine and My Email Was Down!

Hello List,

With any luck, I will be picking up a good used 2L
engine either Monday or Wednesday. I am not quite sure
if it is going to be sold as just a long block or with
the fan shroud, alternator, distributor, ect. 

Everyone, please cross your fingers for me. With any
luck, I should have my bus back on the road by the end
of the summer. I don't plan to have the body work done
by then. My goal is to have the used engine in GOOD
running order, get a set of new tires, and inspect the
brakes and have them in reliable condition. If I can
do that, it will still look hideous but I will at
least be able to drive it (for the first time). This
will allow me to work on the body work over the cooler
months and (hopefully) have it painted before Everybus
next year. I feel that having it as a a good running
vehicle as opposed to a lawn decoration will give me
the motivation that I need to finish the body work.

If anyone has tried to email me today, Please email me
again. I have been gone all day and let my mailbox
fill up by accident. That means that I did not receive
emails for most of the day. Thanks!

David Kelly
