Subject: NC to DC(more extreme driving)

Since we are talking about extreme driving.......

I will be going to Washington DC on July 1st to the FUGAZI show at 
Ft. Reno Park. I was with Chad for the NYC run two weeks ago and 
drove on the DC leg. I think driving a 1600cc bus through DC 
(I*95/I*395 ) would be something close to madness and not the fun 
kind mind you.

What about alternate routes into DC such as US 29? I would be 
arriving midday on Monday and sneaking out of town before sunup.
