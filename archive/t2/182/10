Subject: Re: [T2] what i love/hate about bus ownership

what i love about driving a bus:
-kids love it.
-i love it.
-the looks on the FLAPS employees faces when i ask for parts.
-this list.
-fun to work on. (ok, not always!)

what i hate about driving a bus:
-people flashing me peace signs.
-the fact that my 72 has no upper access hatch.
-people who refuse to turn on their word wrap.
-sometimes people call it a bug. quite frankly i've never understood that.

happy friday,
