I don't have my guages hooked up yet but I typically drive 65-70 in my '78
2.0. It will do 85 if I push it but I don't. I  find my MPG drops off
substantially after 70. At 65 I get 20-21. At 70 im getting 18-19 mpg. I
used to have 72 with an 1800 and always drove it 65. It had the dreaded
progressive and I would get 16-17 mpg. Went to dual webers 40s, got 19 mpg
but never had the carbs set right. I didn't know much about carbs back
then. Love the FI now though. Set it and forget it. Happy Friday!

Consider the Gene Berg Temp Sender ( $20 ).
Easy install ( dipstick ), no dash hack, it flashes the idiot lite.
