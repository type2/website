OK, it's Friday....

There are two that stand out in my mind.

First, Ferndale to Capetown on CA211 in California.  Crossing the coastal
range on a two lane road.  The altitude is not great, but you are doing
2Kfeet in 2-3 miles!  And the drive down is worse... this is the only time
I have ever lost brakes due to overheated pads.  A scary experience.

At the same time, I do recommend this drive highly (with appropriate
caution)! Ferndale is a stunningly beautiful little town, full of Victoian
houses from the timber boom. Hawks soar in the pass constantly and the
descent to the coast is georgeous!  The best part is that after travelling
about 10-15 miles along a totally deserted section of coast, yu re-cross
the coastal range at Honeydew and come into the back end of ther Humboldt
Redwoods, near the upper campground.  I have not yet failed to find a spot
there and they have a bin full of redwood trimmings for use as firewood!
Fill up (subtly) on your way out, and you can have a redwood campfire in
the middle of the Mojave :-)

The second really steep climb is in Wyoming... coming out of Jackson on
Rt. 22.  Route 26, the main N/S drag thru the park is not bad, steep, but
do-able. Rt. 22 attacks the mountain directly and I do *not* recommend it!
thousands of feet of climb in 1st and 2nd for way too long, way too many
cool down breaks, and *way* too far from home in case of a breakdown.
