Ok, racket coming from under left valve cover.  Took them off the adjust
valves.  I am at tdc for #1.  Now, I can not get the locknut loose in
order to adjust the screw.  I have tried almost everything and said
every word in the process.  As well as busted two knuckles.  (Ouch!!)
Are they just really really tight or am I doing something wrong?  Thanks
for the help.  I'll be in IRC too.
