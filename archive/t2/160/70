Yes, I too have several cars... and one of them IS dead... that's why I
decided to ask questions about it.  All I want to do, is try to decrease my
chances of duplicating the failure. For those breezing through the thread,
slow down and read this:  I'm not asking for advice on an indestructible
setup...  I am aware that I have to deal with the consequences of my driving
style, so please no more "well it wasn't meant to do that", "buy something
more suited" or "reap what you sow" advice. I have parents and grandparents
and I can call them anytime for that kind of crap.  I am asking for the type
of advice this group is known for...
With the known facts that I am going to drive it hard, I have 2 VW's and I
don't mind doing the work, what is a practical method for making my bus MORE
suitable for my driving style. I apologize for any frustration you read into
this, I am only trying to get helpful advice.
