Subject: Acceptable speeds (and morning warm-up?)

I  also am the new owner of a 1971 Westy, as you may know by now, and the
PO also fully rebuilt the engine. It is entirely stock as well, no guages
or tach. I used to own a 75 Transporter with a 79 engine in it which felt
like a Hemi-Cuda compared to my new '71!!!

I was also wondering about acceptable speeds and engine life - 55-60 mph
max feels like a reasonable cruise on the highway, and that's fine - no
problem - I'm used to going slow on my aircooled BMW motorcycle - but what
about city driving? Should I be _never_ using full throttle? It seems like
I have serious trouble getting rolling if I don't goose it a little bit in
first or second. 

My second question is about the warmup procedure - the motor seems
veeerrry unhappy when cold - I definitely can't start it up and drive away
like I used to in my '79 - what is the normal procedure for warming up the
engine before driving away? 

Many thanks; 

Dan Curran
