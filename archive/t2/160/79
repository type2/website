Do you think switching to hydraulic valves will give me more life in this
type of use?  I don't really like adjusting valves anyway.  :-)

I've heard people say bad things about an 1835 in a bus...  that it will
overheat more, true?   I figured building a decent T1 over the stock bore
would help me out a lot, but I don't want one that overheats a lot.
I don't really want to "go fast" I just want my bus to cruise on the freeway
pretty well.

I've thought about it some, and I was steering toward a dual carb setup
before my original post.  I really don't want another VW FI setup ( I have
had some trouble with my square already).  I was thinking that building a
little stroker would be good...   but not sure what cam to pair up with it.
Not sure what head options to look at.  There was that build up articles in
one of the VW mags at the end of the year, anyone remember that buildup
being a good design?
