Subject: Acceptable Speeds and Overheating

With all the talk of overheating and max speeds, I wanted to call the groups
attention to the following website.
http://www.lnengineering.com/

I may have missed their discussion because I've haven't been following the
group that long.

These guys have started manufacturing some high dollar Nikasil plated solid
aluminum cylinders and forged piston kits. 

They're due shortly to start manufacturing less expensive aluminum finned
cylinders with cast iron liners.

Either of these will give a lot move heat rejection capability than the cast
iron cylinders that most people use in their rebuilds.

Combine that with a counterweighted crankshaft and a trip to the engine
balancer before reassembly and I think even a stock displacement engine
would be much improved.
