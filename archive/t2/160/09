I hate to bother the list with something this trivial, but would anyone 
have a spare cover (black thing) that covers the windshield washer 
reservoir cap at the kick panel for a 74 type II?  I've searched high and

Thanks, greg

 Hi Greg,
 Yes perhaps widening your search may help....That cover for the windshield
 washer reservoir continued to be used for the rear window washer
 reservoir on the watercooled Transporters all the way thru till the end of
 their production in the early '90s.
 Perhaps there's a few years in there where the first of the T3 shape of the
 early '80s didn't have a rear washer however when they did,the exact same
 cover from the bay window days was used. 
 
 I know a lot of them went missing over the years but if you check a few
 VW junk yards,you should be able to locate one,given the number of years
 that this item was included in VW vans.Potentially from 1968 to 1991
 (in the US)...longer elsewhere.
 Otherwise, perhaps busdepot.com can get you one...?
