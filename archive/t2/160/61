Subject: Re: [T2] way too injected!

Drew,

Gotta be one or more of several things.

The return fuel line is getting stopped up or the pressure 
   regulator closes and won't open...equals 125psi + on injectors
   and fuel ring.

The injectors are hanging full open or pressure is forcing them open...

The afm is sending a signal that says I am at WOT(wide open throttle)..and
the ecu believes it and starts opening the injectors a lot.

You really need to bite the bullet and go buy a "real" fuel pressure
gauge that you can hook up and look when it goes full rich.
Hi pressure when it dies means regulator getting stopped up or failing.

I suppose when this happens, you could pull the gas line between the
regulator and the gas tank, put this could be a serious high pressure
gas spill...and dangerous....

I had the opposite problem for a while from garbage in the tank, but one 
of the listees had my type problem from a gas line getting kinked when 
warm.....there's a thought.....

Cheers, dave

I think I've checked everything as per the VW FI trouble shooting manual, 
but obviously I've missed something.

fuel line around it (no fuel to cold start valve).  
When cranking no fuel comes out the vacuum port on the fuel pressure regulator.  
The flap on the air mass sensor seems free (I checked the resistance on the 
terminals of the air mass sensor previously--they seemed alright.  
I tried a different FI computer (thanks again Karl). 
That didn't help.  What in god's name is pumping all that fuel through the injectors on and off??????

Then it usually starts right up and runs fine for a while.  
Lately it goes fine for 6-8 miles and goes full rich and dies.
