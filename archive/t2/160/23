hmmm, you seem to have a winner here,  I would check (and you may have)

.  presure regulator could be set too high or malfunctioning
.  restriction in the return fuel line back to the tank
.  sticking injectors (staying open)

I would remove one injector trigger wire at a time to maybe pinpoint the
cyl that is putting out too much gas.

.  intake valve staying open too long (not likely)
 
good luck

I disconnected the cold start valve by running the fuel line around it (no fuel to cold start valve).  When cranking no fuel comes out the vacuum port on the fuel pressure regulator.  The flap on the air mass sensor seems free (I checked the resistance on the terminals of the air mass sensor previously--they seemed alright.  I tried a different FI computer (thanks again Karl). That didn't help.  What in god's name is pumping all that fuel through the injectors on and off??????
