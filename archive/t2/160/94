Subject: RE: [T2] Acceptable speeds

That's a good point  George...   I only estimate how fast I'm driving by
what I know to be the flow of traffic around me (based on driving out
Mustang).  I've never actually verified how fast I am going in my Bus other
than asking someone on the phone or something.  My speedo seems to be about
10MPH optimistic at 60MPH.  I had the speedy at 70MPH when I was driving it
quite a bit, so I may not have been driving it quite as fast as I normally
would.  But that was for 1 hour durations and such.

Another factor is the accuracy of your speedo and we all know that VW
speedometers tend to be optomistic as they age.

My 58MPH figure is actual MPH.  It's more like 70 on the speedo.
