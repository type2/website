After reading everyone's posts about speeds, I think it is pretty apparent
why I did damage to my bus, and it is need of a build.  I tried again to
check the valves, and even though I can't turn the pulley 360 degrees, I can
get it close enough to the top on each stroke to tell that there is
something really wrong on #1.  Congrats to those of you who said I was
probably having valve trouble...  you are probably right.  That means
rebuild time.  I like David live in the Dallas area and will never be able
to stop driving like that...  so my related question in all of this is:  how
do I make my bus more suitable for the way that I drive?  Type IV?  V-6
Conversion?  Beefy Type I?  It's a 70 stocker right now. Turns over but
doesn't run for those who don't remember any of my "not running" posts.

Thanks for any guidance.
