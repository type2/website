I'll answer since I am the 1/4 throttle guy.  Of
course you can use full throttle to pull out. 
But try using less a few tims.  I rarely exceed
1/2 throttle and have no difficulties.  Not much
difference in the engine's response.  

The real important thing is to avoid full
throttle for anything other than brief
engagements.  Especially avoid flooring the thing
going up hills on the highway. 

Unless you plan on going 85 mph.  Then you need
teeny teeny teeny tires, I would suggest
195/60/14, a late tranny, and full throttle. 
Your speedo will then probably read 85, if the
hill is big enough.
