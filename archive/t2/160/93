Subject: Re: [T2] dent puller


Usually, holes are drilled into the body at a selected few places, and the 
puller is 'screwed' into the hole and is used to pull a low spot higher.  
Another method involves welding or riveting 'posts' to these spots, and the 
puller is then used to raise the low points.  In the former method, the 
holes are filled, in the latter, the posts are cut and ground smooth.
