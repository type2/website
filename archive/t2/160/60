How fast do you want to drive?  One thing I can say for sure, if you want 
to cruise at more than 60mph reliably, you are talking a big investment, 
like in the neighborhood of $2k.  Probably best to sell the bus you have 
and buy a 76-up bus with the 2.0 and Fuel Injection.  What's more, with the 
'70 you don't even have disc brakes, and you really want to be able to stop 
well if you're going to be driving that fast.  Sorry I don't have a more 
pleasant answer.  :-/
