Not too sure about why the locknut is so tight, but if you are at TDC for
#1 you should be looking under the right (front is front) side valve cover.
Left side is #3 and #4. Try rotating the engine to those positions to
adjust left side valves. You may try a 13mm 6 point socket with a long
wobble extention (not swivel extention) and that way you can get away from
the knuckle shredding parts. The lock nut doesn't need to be screaming
tight, just tight enoug to do it's job of locking the adjuster.

Ok, racket coming from under left valve cover.  Took them off the adjust
valves.  I am at tdc for #1.  Now, I can not get the locknut loose in
order to adjust the screw.  I have tried almost everything and said
every word in the process.  As well as busted two knuckles.  (Ouch!!)
Are they just really really tight or am I doing something wrong?  Thanks
for the help.  I'll be in IRC too.
