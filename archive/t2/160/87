1. Back out (counter clock wise) the CO screw on the AFM. Mine takes an 
allen wrench. Remember the number of turns. If this is the problem (it gets 
you running)follow Bentley in adjusting the idle. Do not over do it and run 
too lean.


2 Measure the resistance of BOTH heat sensors through the ECU the connector. 
This way cables or connectors are included. Sensor 1: pin 6 to 27. Sensor 2 
pin 13 to ground. Both should be around 2500 to 3500 ohms cold and much less 
warm.  If you can, warm them (hair dryer?) up to see if the resistance goes 
down.

3 Measure the fuel pressure. If the regulator fails to work pressure can be 
excessive. There is a test port on the fuel manifold (drivers side).

If you don't have the tools to work on the FI system buy them.

A fuel pressure tester, CO tester, tach, and volt ohm meter can be had thu 
ebay or JCW for less than $350. The last time I bought a T4 engine long 
block it was over $2000.

Good luck.
