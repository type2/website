Subject: Re: Wheel rivets

that is both easy and hard, first you need a rivet
anvil to mount in your vice, then you buy steel rivets
and basically hammer them in.  hard part being the
buying of a rivet anvil.

Has anyone ever figured out how to rivet on a hub cap 
clip, on a wide five
wheel? Tried yesterday, what a nightmare.
