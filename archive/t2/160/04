Yes, you should have vacuum advance and retard,
021-905-205J to be exact.  

Ronny is kind enough to put all the dizzy
information we will probably ever need here:

Here's is the proper distributor for your bus,
assuming manual trans:

Bus & Pickup 1973 * 1700 Manual Trans 

Distributor: VW 021-905-205J, Bosch 0231 173 009
or 010 > 021-905-205N, 0231 181 005
Can Use: VW 021-905-205N, Bosch 0231 181 005
Points: 01 011
Condensor: 02 054
Rotor: 04 033
Note: Originally equipped with Speed Limiting
Rotor 04 016 (5400rpm)
Cap: 03 010
Coil: 00 015 (Blue Coil: 00 012)
Vacuum Can: 07 113
Ignition Wires: 09 171
Spark Plug: W8CC
Timing Set At:: 10deg ATDC (-at-) 800-950rpm w/strobe,
vacuum hose(s) connected
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 7-12deg Adv,
16-18deg Ret; Centrifugal: 9-14deg (-at-) 2000rpm,
21-25deg (-at-) 3400 rpm 

However, just looking at the advance numbers all
the 72-79 bus dizzies provide a very similar
curve and will give you around 40-44 max advance
at wot.  Any of these would run your bus fairly
nicely, especially compared to a 009 or 050.
