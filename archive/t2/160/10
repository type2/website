Subject: More Ball joint/torsion arm Questions

Hello list,

I've been following the resent threads regarding ball joints. I just got the 
bus-boys torsion arm set up the other day and hope to put them on my '78 
Westy tomorrow (friday). BTW No core charge and and they look great. I too, 
have never done this procedure before and have some additional questions.

1)Do I have to do both sides at the same time? Is there some tension thing I 
am missing? Seems like I am (step 19 Mike Gensler, in Library)

2)My upper Bus-boys pre-pressed balljoints don't have the hex shaped 
"eccentric ring" on the upper ball joint. Should I be concerned?

3)Are the torsion arm seals NLA? Do they usually need to be replaced? And 
what about the needle bearing? (Bentley 2,18 Fig 7-16) Does a 78 have this? 
and is it NLA? or usually worn to the point of needing replacement?

4)Should I use anti seize on anything when I put it back together? Is it 
worth getting a socket that fits the ball joint nuts for proper torque? And 
What kind of grease should I buy? Brand, type?

Also, I ordered (Bus Depot) tie rods, all four shocks, all new brake 
pads/shoes and rear clyinders, front brake hoses, plus other stuff. Every 
rubber seal/boot in the front end of this bus is shot. Now I find myself 
wondering if I should do the front wheel bearings and swing lever bushings 
while I'm at it.

5)Would this make sense? (bearings, swing lever bushings)

I have no clue as to how many miles the bus has on it as the speedo was 
broken when I bought the bus in Feb (milage "exempt" on title). The bus was 
not well cared for either but, has no rust and will someday take the place 
of my rusty '79 westy. I want something that will last a long time, 
reliable....

6)Finally, any tips for the stabilizer bar clamps? the one with the slide on 
clip. C-clamp maybe?

Thanks in advance and sorry this turned out to be so long. I'm sure things 
will become much clearer when I start ripping things apart in the morning.

Thanks a million,
Brandt
