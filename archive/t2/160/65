Who said anything about a payment car?  You can pick up a used 5.0 Mustang 
for $2,500 and have more power than most people ever need, bone stock.  You 
won't find reliable transportation for much less than that, period.  Then 
you can drive the bus on days when it makes sense (rain, snow, hauling 
stuff, road trips, busma-recharge, etc.).  I've had this arrangement since 
1988 and it has worked well for me.  It's also cheaper than one "payment car".
