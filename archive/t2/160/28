Dan,

Nothing wrong with an occasional to the floor get going move----

But holding it there is sydasue---

I try to keep my 74 at no more than 3800---4000--rpm for any length of
time---

I learned the hard way-----burnt #3 valve trying to hold it at 75 on
I-90 for about 6--7 hours---

I don't have any inclination of doing the heads again---

PHOOEY---!!

65--70 seems to be an acceptable speed to cruise at for any length of
time---

Live and learn---

Later,

Terry

I also am the new owner of a 1971 Westy, as you may know by now, and the
PO also fully rebuilt the engine. It is entirely stock as well, no
guages or tach. I used to own a 75 Transporter with a 79 engine in it
which felt like a Hemi-Cuda compared to my new '71!!! 
I was also wondering about acceptable speeds and engine life - 55-60 mph
max feels like a reasonable cruise on the highway, and that's fine - no
problem - I'm used to going slow on my aircooled BMW motorcycle - but
what about city driving? Should I be _never_ using full throttle? It
seems like I have serious trouble getting rolling if I don't goose it a
little bit in first or second. 
My second question is about the warmup procedure - the motor seems
veeerrry unhappy when cold - I definitely can't start it up and drive
away like I used to in my '79 - what is the normal procedure for warming
up the engine before driving away? 
Many thanks; 
Dan Curran
