Who is claiming that?  I only think the bottom end is indestructable - the 
heads are a weak link IMO.

I appreciate your position.  I've got well over 100k of bus-driving under 
my belt now and my driving varies from one extreme to the other.  If I'm on 
vacation, cruising down a the open highway just before sunset with the 
windows down and no traffic, I am happy with 55mph for hours on end.  If 
I'm late (and come on, it happens to the best of us) or upset about 
something like coming back from the vet after I had to put my cat down, I 
will sometimes keep it floored through the first three gears and sometimes 
even into 4th but I have full instrumentation and even then I know full 
well what it could lead to and I accept that.  If it dies, it dies and if 
something is ready to break, better to have it happen near home than on a 
cross-country trip.  There are also those days here in Dallas where we have 
25-35mph winds out of the South and when they are with me, the bus feels 
like it has an extra 20hp.  Once in a while on those days I like to take it 
up to 80mph briefly and pretend I'm driving Mike Gensler's bus.  :-)

Happy Friday,
