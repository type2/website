unfortunately I do,  some years ago when I first got my current 78 I had
did all the body work myself then painted it also myself...metalic Blue
lower bright white upper not VW stock colors but I liked it....not a month
later on I-81 near Wilkes-Barre PA at cruising speed I was passing a
tractor trailer on a steep upgrade when suddenly he started drifting
towards me.  I tried to slow down and moved left, and left onto the
shoulder and still he kept coming,  taking out my right side front and
rear corners...driver fell asleep at the wheel....state police said I was
lucky to be alive.    didn't even break my windshield but sure did a
number on the quarter panels and paint job.   ;8*{
