Subject: Re: [T2] What is the toughest climb you ever drove?

OK Im a flatland woosie (sp?) and High Country is the worst Ive ever done
in a bus. Thats enough for me I just dont seem to have sea legs er...
mountain butt.
Why dont you all come down and well camp in the Keys and swim and eat
Florida Lobster tails....
