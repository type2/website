Subject: Re: What is the toughest climb you ever drove?

Hi All:
A few uphill bus climbs immediately come to mind, although I know there are
more but can't think of them yet.  (1) One is the southbound "Grapevine"
section of I-5 just north of Los Angeles, where the grade climbs right up
from the valley floor with no real letup until the top.  Ascending this was
35mph in 3rd gear all the way and even though its probably not as steep as
others, it was my first real significant climb in my first bus. (2) The next
is the quite hairy section of Mexico Highway 1 in Baja California that
climbs right up from the coast just north of Santa Rosalia -- very steep,
very narrow, very curvy, potholed, no shoulder, very impatient truck drivers
usually in front and behind, very steep dropoff to hundreds of feet below
just a few feet from the pavement (with crushed cars visible far below), and
a twisted guardrail that is either there or not there depending on where you
are.. A second-gear climb the whole way; this one is almost as scary coming
down as it is going up. (3) The steady climb on I-82 that rises up out of
Yakima WA heading north up into the rolling mountains. Very slow going, and
even more so due to an ever-present crosswind.  At the mid-climb rest area
it was funny seeing all the overheated water-cooled cars with their hoods
up, radiators steaming, and drivers fuming while my girlfriend and I sat in
the back of mine having sandwiches & ice cold microbrews as we watched the
drama.
