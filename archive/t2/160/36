The CA only left heat exchanger, crossover pipe, and cat converter are
different from the 49-state version.  The heat exchanger (tiny little
bugger, hardly worthy of the term) was still available new last time I
needed one, but was not cheap.  The California-only crossover pipe is not
available at all.  The cat converter on a California-emissions '79-83
interchanges with the one used on a watercooled Vanagon, so that's readily
available.

By replacing the left heat exchanger with a 49-state version, you can fit a
49-state exhaust system to the CA '79-83 bus or Vanagon. This eliminates the
no-longer-available CA-only crossover pipe and expensive CA-only left heat
exchanger.  You can see a diagram of this setup at
http://www.busdepot.com/partsimages/exhaust28083.JPG . The cost is $285 for
the complete exhaust system, plus $189 for the left heat exchanger and $95
for the cat. (Prices reflect listmember discount.)

The only problem with the 49-state setup on a CA model is that most CA
models have an 02 sensor, which the 49-state exhaust system does not provide
a port for. But there is an easy fix for this.  Use a 1.9L watercooled
Vanagon cat and muffler in place of the stock '79-83 49-state cat and
muffler. This adds a port for the 02 sensor that would otherwise be lacking,
and it is a direct swap (no modifications required as they are the same
size).  In fact I can even send a modified '79-83 kit with this change for
the same price as noted above, on request.  This would allow you to keep all
of the California smog gear while using 49-state parts (which are still
available new, unlike some of the CA-only parts).  Functionally it would be
the same as the CA setup. (Whether it would pass the visual inspection in
CA, I don't know, as it would still look slightly different.)
