Roger,

As an experiment (and possible permanent mod), try this...  disconnect the
vacuum retard hose from the dist.  Cap the hose, but leave the nipple into
the vacuum can open.  Retime your bus to 7.5 BTDC at idle, vacuum advance
line attached. Try those hills again.

As I understand it, (from Karl (who will, I hope, correct me if I am
wrong)) at speed, the manifold vacuum and ported vacuum signals are near
equal and you get only mechanical advance. W/o the retard plugged in, you
should get some ported vacuum pulling advance and a bit more advance under
load.
