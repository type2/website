Suspect defective injectors. Verify fuel pressure in the
high pressure circuit with a gauge, and examine injector
spray pattern and ability to hold the pressure without leaks.
Since you have bypassed the cold start valve,
too much fuel comes from the injectors, doesn't it ???
I know of no other source of fuel in your system.
The primary function of the ECU  is to turn on the injectors,
the only malfunction i haver ever noted is where it doesn't.
