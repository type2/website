Subject: Re: What is the toughest climb you ever drove?


The Coquihalla Hwy is tough and I know one person's van that died there,
but for me the worst was the highway in Guatemala on the way up to Lake
Atitlan.  The roads seem to get higher and higher for days.  (We often had
to just plain stop because we couldn't make it any higher, but in the
morning we always made it over the peaks - thank Jah).

The roads from Vancouver to Alaska seem bad too.  I had trouble getting a
good distance North past Pemberton, then had to turn around and head
South-East to the Okanagan.  Good thing, because we ended up going South to
the Pacific Coastal Highway towards Central America & had the adventure of
a lifetime.
