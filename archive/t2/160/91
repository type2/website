Subject: Downshifting and RPMs (was: Acceptable speeds)

I agree with George (usually do :) but I want to share my experiences with
hills and downshifting to see if my experience is shared or anomolous.

For some reason, downshifting in my '80 Vanagon does not net me the
benefits I would expect.  My "driving style" in mountains goes as follows.
As the grade increases and speed starts to fall, I floor it and let the
speed keep falling until it is below 50.  When it will not hold speed
above 50, I downshift to 3rd but also drop my speed below 40.  I have
found that both 3rd and 4th between 40 and 50 on a hill produce very high
oil temps.  In 4th, lugging and lack of air thru the fan explain what is
happening, no sweat.  However, I would think that I *should* be able to
hold 45-50 in 3rd w/o a problem, but I can't. It isn't a lack of HP, but
rather that if I try, the oil temps climb rather rapidly.  My thinking is
that the mechanical friction of spinning the engine overcomes the increase
in air thru the fan as trying to do 50 in 3rd even on the flat will raise
the oil temps significantly.  There may also be an air/fuel mix problem,
but the O2 sensor is not reporting one.

Any thoughts on this?
