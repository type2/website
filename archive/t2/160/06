Congrats to Tony (for pressing) and to Bentleys (for coming thru) for this
one!!!!  and that's not all, volk!  If you look in the directory for the
type2 stuff, they also have a 2-CD set (also $99.95) that contains the
'68-79 fiche!!!!  Yeehaw and whoopee!!!!

I will bet that (Hey... Ron... BIG HINT coming :) one or more of the list
vendors might well start carrying these at some discount off the Bentley's
list price.  I kinda hope so, because I *know* I want both the Bentley and
the fiche CDs for both the '68-79 and '80-91! and even at $599, I am very
tempted by the 1969-1994 12-CD set covering *everything*!!!
