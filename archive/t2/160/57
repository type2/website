And it is sound, but not practical advice. If I go back to a payment car...
my VW's will be forced to rot.  Not enough money to go around.  I'm not a
"fast driver", but in this part of the country, if you don't put the pedal
down quite a bit, you'll get forced off of the road!

And BTW:  we do have a Mustang, but that is what the lady is driving...
it's the VW's for me.
