Subject: Re: [T2] More Ball joint/torsion arm Questions

I apologize if I was a bit to particular on the "Do both sides at the same
time" question...  I envisioned you running back and forth from side to side
due to some mystical force that required each component of the procedure be
offset by the same thing on the other side.  Of course I agree with Steve.
I would never do just one side and then cruise around hoping to do the other
side at some other time.

Good luck,
Bill

p.s.  Good point on the squeezing the bushing thing.  I forgot to mention
that.  Helps a lot on reinstall too!
