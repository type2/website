Subject: Re: [T2] Potential Trailer Hitch Info

That's what I was able to find out when I searched the web.

Who got the equipment and patterns?

Maybe somebody would give up the patterns and we could make them ourselves 
(or at leas distribute the patterns in .pdf form so folks could make our 
own). Less liability that way.

Frankly I don't want to pull my hitch and bumper off. It's a two person job 
(you need a helper to hold the other end while you bolt it up). I did it by 
myself last time and was making up words you can't repeat in polite 
company.... More related to my abilities (...lack of) and not the design of 
the hitch!

Really simple though!
