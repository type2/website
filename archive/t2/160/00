We are going to have a great time at the Bug Blitz, Bus Blast sponsored by
the Kansas City MoKan VW club on May 31, June 1 and 2.  We sure hope you can
join us.

This is gearing up to be one of the largest VW events ever held in the area.
We are literally getting people from all over the country from California to
Florida.

Buy a chance to take home the 1600 dual port rebuild at the charity auction
along with many other nice prizes.

The campout Friday and Saturday night will be another fun bus campout.  Some
of the Buskatiers will be bringing instruments for some fire side music, so
feel free to bring your's along too.

Sunday morning, the KC Kombies will have pancakes and some wonderful Kansas
pepper bacon for all the campers.

Sunday will also be the "drive the track" day around the world famous
Heartland Park road course.
