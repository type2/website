Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for Alternator Conversion Kit for 71 Westy


	Just out of curiosity George, why do you believe that a powerful auto 
stereo would have to be 'annoying'?  I have personally installed dozens of 
automotive audio systems, and I have never designed one that I would 
describe as 'annoying' to listen to, let alone "very_annoying".  As for 
amlifiers drawing power in terms of wattage, they are actually rated as 
drawing amperage.  A typical, high current, class A/B two channel amplifier 
will draw between 30 and 50 amps(apples) of current at full output of its 
rated wattage(oranges).  (This is only at peak levels as you correctly 
state, but the averave current draw may still be rather large, compared to 
the rated output of the alternator, especially when you account for lights 
and other accessories.)  Much of that power is lost as heat, but the thermal 
resistance is not really a factor for this discussion.  Running two or three 
of these(not uncommon) in a triple crossover design would triple the current 
draw from the battery.  Add an air conditioning compressor's charged-clutch 
coil(30 amps), and what you have is a severe deficit in supply relative to 
demand.  True, a power inverter is usually active when the vehicle is not 
running, but it is another load on hte aforementioned batttery.  Adding a 
second battery(typically a deep-cycle) is a good idea, as they are more 
specifically designed for heavy current draw, and deeper load cycling.     
My statement that a larger alternator would be a good idea, especially if 
you are adding  multiple loading devices to the charging system, seems (to 
me)to be 'sound' advice.  Oh, the statement that a 75 amp alternator doesn't 
charge a battery faster than a 50 amp alternator, is as correct (when taken 
to extremes) as stating that a 1 amp trickle battery charger doesn't  charge 
a battery any faster than a 30 amp battery charger.  While it is once again 
true, that a battery has thermal resistance to too much amperage, the 
difference between the two alternators output, when considered in 
conjunction with the load(or loads) placed upon the battery in question, 
should still be considered when making 'upgrades' to a VW aircooled 
electrical system.
