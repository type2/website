Subject: [T2] More Ball joint/torsion arm Questions

Brandt,

i have answered the ones i know. don't know about #2, tho.

>>1)Do I have to do both sides at the same time? Is there some tension thing
I
am missing? Seems like I am (step 19 Mike Gensler, in Library)<<

sounds like a good idea. get that bump stop removed & then use a prybar to
pry that arm 'over the hump'.

>>3)Are the torsion arm seals NLA? Do they usually need to be replaced? And
what about the needle bearing? (Bentley 2,18 Fig 7-16) Does a 78 have this?
and is it NLA? or usually worn to the point of needing replacement?<<

i got the torsion arm seals from Bus Boys, IIRC. not sure about needle
bearings.

>>4)Should I use anti seize on anything when I put it back together? Is it
worth getting a socket that fits the ball joint nuts for proper torque? And
What kind of grease should I buy? Brand, type?<<

no anti-seize needed. & YES get a deep socket that will fit. a torque wrench
would be helpful too. i used just plain-ol all-purpose high temp grease.

>>5)Would this make sense? (bearings, swing lever bushings)<<

sure. anytime that many components are off the bus, it would be a good idea
to check bearings, etc.

>>6)Finally, any tips for the stabilizer bar clamps? the one with the slide
on
clip. C-clamp maybe?<<

bend those rusty tabs back & beat that thing with BFH to get it off.
obviously you will destroy the original clamps/bushings doing this.


also, look at the ends of the torsion leaves after you remove the arms.  if
they had spot welds on them before, you will likely need to re-weld. the
leaves must be lined up before they will go back into the arm.

good luck,
