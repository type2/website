Subject: Re: [T2]tire broke inward this morning on me

Guys seriously I really appreciate the concern that this could have been bad.
  I am though GratefuL that it was not serious and that i was driving 1-4mph guessing when it happened if i know what that feels like SLOW thank goodness.
   It happened pretty quick and only with a knock of raw metal bumping uglies twice or thrice maybe and then clump.
   
  For the record no i did not have alot of cash at all.
  i was told before it was tacked that it was going to be tacked and was letting me know.  I was within reaching distance of the ball joints only when nothing was being turned or burned.
  I stood back for the show of that ....
   
   
  I wasnt very sure of the whole procedure here and about the arms and such but i once again did not have alot of money and still needed to get home. 5 hours +. YES
  I dont blame no one and if anyone is to blame here let me Take it for not researching everything well enough.
   
  They shouldnt of came out but that one did.
   
  I am beaten and bruised over this and my head hurts real bad.... i feel like that  yep glad i dont look like i feel. I gotta get this fixed but i also know that these people that fixed her wont let me or the bus go unhealed. Longs i got the tools i can fix it. Maybe that sounds awful nieve of me? Again i except the blame rather than start finger pointing. 
   I believe it will all work out. To many times now have i put blame where blame had no place to begin with.
   
   
   
  If its arms it needs hell i might as well go ahead and do it.
  rather have new arms than tacked. I do know that for sure now. This day taught me plenty.. 
   
   
   
  They have already sent me a new/good used passenger side/BOTTOM arm out on its way in the mail to me.
  yeah it sucks i wil have to fix it and only hope i can.
   
  So can i get some feedback on how to go about fixing it. I wont be able to take it to a shop. If i gotta rent the toolz then so be it ...
   
  Right now i need some help getting her fixed...
  send that this way and then i will be able to get up and going.
  this is very unfortunate but i am trying to keep my spirits up.....
   
  AS i walked home this morning carrying biscuits in hand for me and the mrs right after i knew what happened or suspected a song came to me and as i walked i sang.
   
  Aint no sunshine when she's gone.. aint no sunshine when she goes away....anytime she goes away.... ...
   
  strange how someone can grow such a attachment to ? "JUst a vehicle" guess thats what makes it a Bus~!~
   
   
   Really happy I wasnt going any faster.... Bus AnGeLs.....
  and timing. could a been awhole lot worse.
   
  try this link for pics now....? i think i made it for viewing now... ooops sorry i dont know how to work all this stuff to well no more. maybe i never did?

Hey Howard Man this is what burns me. Somebody jumping on their soapbox 
and mouthing off without any facts. Fact he was 5 hours from home, fact he 
was shown the problem, fact he had no more money, fact there wasn't another 
torsion arm around. fact he had to get home. fact the choice was his to 
make and he knew what could happen. he made the choice. He choose to weld it in 
place and take his chances. But what you are saying is that you wouldn't have 
done anything but push the bus out the door till he could get another arm and 
some how more money. sounds like you need to keep taking lefts till you do 
get a right later mark
