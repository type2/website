I've been using this technique since I first read one of George's  
posts to the list. I've been leak free for over 3 years now. Some  
tips I've learned along the way:

- you must remove all traces of silicone and adhesives from the  
sealing surfaces. A brass wire brush or those 3M metal "scouring"  
pads work well.

- use cork gaskets from a good vendor.

- bend the two gasket holding tabs back into position.

- replace that rusty old bail with a new one.

- new valve covers are now $42/ea.

- bead blast and repaint your old valve covers.

The cork gaskets harden and shrink a little. Muir said to use grease  
and lots of people who don't use silicone follow his advice thinking  
that the grease is supposed to help seal the valve cover and allow  
the gasket to shrink evenly but I've seen the opposite:

The grease just helps the engine suck in the gasket and cause  
premature leakage.

Hylomar is stickier but it's primary usefulness is as a non-curing  
sealant. I believe the tightness of the bail and the fit of the valve  
cover matters most.
