Subject: Mini skirts

Piston weight matching to the gram.

I had three pistons at exactly the same weight. One was 6 grams
heavier. By the time I removed enough material from the base of the
piston to match weight, the skirt had lost both its longer flanges. In
other words the side away from the rings is now flat. In other words
it looks like the top of an open ravioli can. I touched only the
flanges. The rest of the surface is at the original level.

Is there a problem with this ? When I think of how the piston moves,
it seems those longer flanges would help the piston to follow its
movement parallel to the cylinder walls, as the angle between the rod
and the piston pin changes.

Engine builders, let me know.
