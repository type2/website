Subject: Granny Grose's Buses II (Update)

Just an update about the campout.

*We have 23 reservations. 18 Buses, 4 Bugs, and 1 Thing.

*Being that we are getting more reservations than electric sites that are
available, electric will be first come, first serve. There will be a discount
for Buses not using electric. Water can be shared & used by all.

*I made reservations for 50 people at the seafood buffet. PLEASE RSVP for the
seafood carabus.

*A few volks have emailed about donating door prizes. THANK YOU and keep it
up!

*Be sure to think of something good to make for the Saturday morning potluck
breakfast. I will be flipping tons of pancakes.

*Tshirts will be available for pre-order starting this week. Sizes Toddler &
Youth will be $15, Adult Small-XL will be $17, and XXLs and XXXLs will be $19.
Shirts at campout will be $2 more each. The shirts will be tie-dyed when
ordered. Pre-orders will have a choice of Red, Blue, Green, Purple, or Orange
tie-dyes. They'll be a two tone design of what color you choose. The campout
design will be available within the next few days.(check back!)


Thanks!!  SteelersBus
