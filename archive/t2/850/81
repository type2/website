hello Antonia  The only race engines I build are Formula Vee  which is based 
on the old 40hp VW engine.  They are allowed some changes but not much but 
enough to get about 62 hp from them.  They will get at least one season or more 
from an engine . The blocks aren't solid and they do get hot as they don't have 
any fans but relie on the forced air thur scoops. They don't do much changes 
to the pistons as they aren't interested in too high of RPMs  , they run max 
6800,  later  mark Dearing
