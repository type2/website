Yahoo truncates long hyperlinks when it wraps the words to fit on a  line.  Then the link won't work.  To fix, copy the link part that's  underlined and past it into a new window's url space.  Then the copy  the part that didn't get hyperlinked and paste it on the end of the  part that you previously pasted.  Works fine for me.
