Provided that the gear drive is 100% efficient!  Probably a bit less,
otherwise.

I prefer the time honored "measure 18 inches along the wrench, then stand
on that spot with my 180 pounds" approach.  A long piece of angle iron
bolted to the flywheel keeps it from turning.

This approach works fine for breaking the nut loose too, with a cheater
over the wrench.
