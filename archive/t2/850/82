Hey Howard    Man this is what burns me.  Somebody jumping on their soapbox 
and mouthing off without any facts.    Fact  he was 5 hours from home,  fact he 
was shown the problem, fact he had no more money, fact there wasn't another 
torsion arm around.  fact he had to get home.   fact  the choice was his to 
make and he knew what could happen. he made the choice. He choose to weld it in 
place and take his chances.   But what you are saying is that you wouldn't have 
done anything but push the bus out the door till he could get another arm and 
some how more money.   sounds like you need to keep taking lefts till you do 
get a right   later  mark
