Subject: Re: [T2] Where to buy fuel line clamp

In the meantime I found that my local pep boys sells two of these
clamps for 8.50$. (That is half the price of the fake seller). The
thing about pep boys is if you ask one of the employees, they won't
know and tell you first thing they don't have it...
