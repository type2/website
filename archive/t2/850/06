Subject: Type 4 flywheels

I am trying to understand the difference between the flywheels for the
type 4 engines. I know the early transmissions need to have the
bellhousing clearanced to receive the larger flywheels, but I
originally thought the flywheels were larger in diameter, but since
all the flywheels seem to work with the AT starter, it would seem the
diameters are the same. I am thinking therefore that it is just the
reach of the flywheel into the bellhousing that is different, which
would seem to agree with what I have seen in the picture showing the
different lengths of the starter shafts.

Can anyone clarify this for me?

Thanks,

John
