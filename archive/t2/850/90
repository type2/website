Fact,

A professional mechanic has a duty to do professional work.  Sometimes
it means refusing to do a job.  There is no excuse for something like
welding a ball joint in place.  As we see here, it was done, it got the
car home, and it broke.  It was not safe.  A cab or bus ride home would
have been.  The mechanic with the welder was flat out wrong to do it.

BTW, I am an ASE certified tech...
