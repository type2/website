Subject: Re: [T2]tire broke inward this morning on me

thats fnny bob
  actually i just got off the phone with a another bus driver here locally that has some wheel dollies like youre speaking of... came from harbor freight and we use them quiet a bit in his shop. it was only thing i could think of also to make hopefully work they are strong but the wheels are bad aboug turning sideways on them so i got to be slow no matter what and will be doing this by myself so even more dangerouos but if not it will be very late tonight before the wife gets home.
   
  he is going to bring me one of them at his lunch break and i am then going to do exactly as you said and drive carefully home i do have a small curve but i am just going to have to take it really really slow i got nothing but time when if if time it takes to keep from tearing my bus up...shoot shes hurt not even limping i mean ....
   
  thanks Bob

for immediate "get it off the road help" you could go to your local FLAPS
and get a "wheel dolly" you jack the bus up and put this under that tire
and VERY VERY VERY slowly tow it home. the only way you could drive it
would be to find some way to LOCK that axle so it would not turn other
wise you would cause additional damage.

hopefully someone else has a better solution
