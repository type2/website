Richard,
Of course that depends on which engine builder one works with, and how
much is spent on the engine. It seems that 1g for a daily driver
engine is already pretty good. Muir says 5g. VW spec is nowhere close
to that I've read. There were 20+g difference on the rods when i
opened my engine. However it was getting 18mpg.....

These guys :

the basic balancing ($140) offered by these pros includes
- rod balancing to the 1 gram
- piston balancing to the 1.5 gram

Of course for the racing (350$)
- rod balancing to the 0.01 gram
- piston balancing to the 0.01 gram

I've thinking about pulling the formula to find the Force exerced by 1
gram at it's higest acceleration at TDC at, say 4000rpm. No time so
far.


> I was simply asking the other engine builders if they bother with a scale
that is accurate to 0.1g.
