Subject: dash conditioning

Hello Tom, 
I also have a 72 money pit. I previously used Back to Black... didn't seem to 
do much.  Wanted to get some Wolfgang Vinyl & Rubber Protectant.  Has anyone 
on the list used it?  Abit pricey.

After searching for a while, I found a uncracked dash for the bus on samba
that meets my standards, I'm kinda picky I guess.
Does anyone have something they swear by that will condition it and help
prevent, instead of premote, the cracking?
