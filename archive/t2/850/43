No "maintenance-free" sticker? :)
Might as well find a valve adjustment procedure.
The adj. specs are different for solid vs. hydraulic lifters.
You wouldn't want to make a mistake with that.
Little or no gap would be very bad for solid lifters.
Hydraulic lifters require steel pushrods, solid have aluminum
pudhrods with steel tips. A quick check with a pencil magnet
on the body of the pushrod will verify that.
Lifters are fairly easy to remove for confirmation during
the valve adjustment procedure by removing the rockers,
pushrod retaining wire clip, and pushrod tubes.

  We are trying to figure out what engine we have in our 1976 bus.  The
   engine has a "rebuilt in Canada"-type sticker that is on top of the engine
   code stamped on the case.  When we peel back the sticker a bit, we can see
   that the code starts with "GE".  Which should mean a 1978 or 1979 engine
   with hydraulic lifters...
