Hi Mark

Race cars have solid blocks that don't suffer from thermal dilatation as much.
Moreover, a race engine doesn't last as long. You need to rebuild it after a
few races. F1 cars have a new engine every race. So that's the trade off,
power/efficacy vs long lasting. You don't care that the race car cant go for
100k miles before a rebuilt, but you want it to be as efficient as possible....

Has far as machining goes, I don't claim that I know about how they manage hold
such tight tolerance. But things that can be check for are dimensions, shape
(cylindericity) and positioning (Perpendicularity) with respect to the
interface between block-head. All this is hard to apply to the air-cooled
engine since the piston sleeves are not solid blocks; the shape of the sleeve
is greatly influence by temperature.
