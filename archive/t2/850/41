Subject: RE: [T2] New brake woes

     Make sure your rear brake shoes are adjusted close to the drum.  Make 
sure your calipers have squeezed in all the way to the rotor, sometimes 
after you have expanded them for the new pads it takes several pumps to get 
them to meet the rotor.  Manually bleeding them helps with that too.  make 
sure no hoses are leaking.

Just some ideas, you may have already checked them!
