Subject: Spark then nothing

Hi Folks, 
 
Where to start...Or actually,  can't start anymore. 
 
On a Cold Winter night - 20C, I had to "great Idea" of trying to start my 77
transporter, I guess it was on on those Drunk stories....
 
To make it short... short indeed, it sparked under need the dash.....then nothing...
no. light of any kind, no fuel pump noise.. nor fan.
 
I check under the dash... all fuses are fine... but really I can't do further
diagnostic with a lil help.
 
Where should I start looking in this particular case.. any idea would be most
welcome, as spring is on it's way.
 
 
regards
 
Patrick
