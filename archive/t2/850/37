   FWIW, I had the same prtoblem and bled the brakes a few times in that
sequence with
the same results (even with a bench-bled master cylinder). What worked for me
was
the sequence left front, right front, left rear, right rear...I know, I
know...opposite of
what it "should" be...;-(
   Give it a shot, it's only another pint or so of brake fluid...
