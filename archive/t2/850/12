Subject: Generator "endplay" question

Folks,

I am building up my newly rebuild longblock and noticed that the generator 
has some endplay in it.  I replaced the bearings on the generator after 
noticing this, and same result.  Endplay is between 1/8" and 1/4 "......I 
never noticed this before.  This is with everything disassembled from the 
fan and fan shroud..........but i did notice, as well that when installed 
without the belt on, if i pushed/pulled on the alternator pulley i could 
feel it move.............
