Subject: Bus Depot Now Hiring

The Bus Depot has an immediate opening a for full or part time position.  We
are located roughly between Philadelphia, Allentown, and Reading PA.
Starting pay is entry level, but we do offer a good health insurance plan
(if full time) and all the parts you need at cost! :-)  Knowledge of VW's
helps but isn't neccessary; we can give you responsibilities that are
appropriate for your knowledge level while you learn. Please email me
directly, or pass this on if you know of someone who might be interested.
