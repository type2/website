I brazenly stole this link which shows how the torquemeister works. The
ratchet turns a small gear which is engaged in the flywheel teeth which is
what causes the multiplication of the leverage to loosen the nut. Simple but
brilliant. This fellow has an adapter made from a flywheel to loosen axle
nuts. http://www.356registry.org/Tech/axle_nut_removal.html
