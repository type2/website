You have a Motive Power Bleeder or a Mityvac attached to the bleeding  
screw? I find the former fairly foolproof.

It sounds like you didn't have a good seal on the hose against the  
bleed screw and you were letting air in during the bleeding procedure.

The bottom screw is useful for removing the particles (fluid  
contamination) for the caliper. The top one is useful for removing  
the air.

Except they often press the pedal to the floor too often. Another  
solution is to install speed bleeders.

Very important to stomp the pedal 5 times before you start bleeding.
