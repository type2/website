       << 3M yellow weather-striping glue is by far the
way to go.>>

Yea, the weather stripping adhesvie will work--
BUT after a short period of time the stuff becomes as hard as a rock and
brittle, and will leak where you applied it.

The Cat high tack stays soft and pliable, and dosen't leak.

It's made for this very application-- engnes--the weather stripping
adhesive isn't.

If you can't locate the Caterpillar high tack, use Permatex.
