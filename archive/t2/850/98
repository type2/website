Subject: Re: [T2]tire broke inward this morning on me

Mark and Howard, time out here!  I never saw that Chai said he had this 
done 5 hrs from home as an emergency.  The reason for the work was not 
spelled out.  Neither is it clear it was told to him this was dangerous 
or not.  If it was an emergency they surely should haver spelled out the 
danger of tacking in any joint, but NEW joints-???? a waste of time and 
for that the shop is at fault.  They were lazy and noticed the fit was 
loose, it seems to me.
