Subject: New brake woes

 Like my mentor, Rodney Dangerfield, nothin' comes easy for me!
  
  I have a '74 bus, discs in front. State inspection sez no good, one caliper shot, other one going soon, need new hoses, etc.
  
  So I thinks, can't be that hard, simple R&R job. Replaced both front calipers & put on new hoses, no problemo.
  
  It wasn't bad, until I got to the bleeding part. Am I doing something  wrong? I've got a Mity Power Bleeder attached, go to RR, bleed it  first, comes out nice & bubble free, as I would expect, not having  messed with the rears. LR, same deal. RF, got a lot of air out, but  eventually bubble-free. Same on LF. Get in, pump brakes, all the way to  floor!!! No pressure! For cryin' out loud, how difficult can this be??
  
  Hep me, pleeez!
