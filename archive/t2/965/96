I agree with those that said you are better off with no cover than a poor
one. A makeshift but sturdy tarp/carport would server you better, but codes
and environment can dictate cost. I have seen PVC pipe and blue tarp jobbies
over boats with guide qires and lots of securing work withstand snow loads
up here (PA)... Mostly.....
