Hey Ron,
How are the Bosch ones?  Also, I noticed that you noted that they need 
bulbs.  Do you have a link to the correct bulbs for the bosch lights? 
I'd like to get a pair.

Also, like you mentioned, they're not street legal - why is this?  Are 
they obnoxiously bright?  They do have normal/bright lights, right?

Thanks!
Mike
