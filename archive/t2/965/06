Subject: weatherstripping for 1973 adventure camper windows

I'm looking for weatherstripping or window seals for the windows
in the rigid-raised top of my bus.  These are the windows that have
a crank and lock.  undo the lock/ turn the crank, and they open
like a garage door (hinged not rollup).

is there some type of HW store item I can use?  or where online
can I buy them?
