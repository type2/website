The answer is yes and no.  Yes it can if it's still pliable with no cracks
but I would not.  I would not for two reasons, first, the chance for leaks
is very high and, second, the chance of breaking your $100+ windshield to
save a $15 (at bus depot) seal is way to high for me.  I cut the seals when
removing the windshield and save myself the grief.
