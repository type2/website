	Here's a typical answer to an inquiry from a T2 listee. 
Only the names have been deleted to protect the guilty  :-)

	If you get a water/fuel ratio in the range 5 - 10% you'll get 
most of the benefit without needing a huge water-bottle or refills 
between fuel fillups.

	Snap out of that digital worldview, bwah.  This is an 
analogue process -  the suction in the inlet pipe (before it splits 
into a manifold) varies according to need, so the only variable is 
the needle size and you're done.  Most likely a tiny needle e.g 
0.51 mm ID will do.  Make sure needle point is in middle of pipe so 
as to prevent induction bias.

	Not a show.

Let me know how it goes
