Subject: A Real Squeaker

My 78 Bus has a squeak.  It's obviously from the wheels as it increases as rotation does. It's there when I first start off, but after the first mile, it goes away. And then it doesn't come back until Gretel is parked for a while and then I start off again...squeak....squeak.....squeak....

I'm guessing the bearings, but I wondered if it could be something else?

Thanks.
