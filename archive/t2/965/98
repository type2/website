Subject: water injection on a fuel injection engine

Hey all,

I've seen the recent postings and read Robert Mann's missive on water 
injection, and I'm very much intrigued. I have a 78 2L engine, pretty 
much all stock with the exception of compufire ignition. Any thoughts on 
where we would inject the water?

Thanks,
