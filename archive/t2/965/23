Do a web search for "LED Bulb Replacements" and you will find a bunch.

However, LEDs make a poor replacement for incandescent bulbs due to the
difference in lens and reflector design for the two light sources.

The proper way to use LEDs is to mount them in the lens, all pointing in
the desired direction.  This is a fairly involved process.
