Subject: RE: [T2] How do I mount this thing??? - I'm done.

I am sorry I made this public. Next time I will be
sure to take this up with Ron (or whomever) privately
in the future.

Ron, I am sorry for making this public and I apologize
for the frustration. I guess I was just a little hot
over the whole transaction and acted a little
prematurely.

I do look forward to doing business with you in the
future.

-Jason
