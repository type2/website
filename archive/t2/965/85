Welcome, brother Jason :)
I'm a new-born right-lane on the I-5 sitter myself.  I found the
biggest difference is how much more I see.  Out my driver's window, I
see the angry faces of tailgaters and lane changers fighting to get one
more car length ahead.  Miles down the road, when I hit my exit ramp, I
see many of the same faces a few feet ahead of me waiting at the same
light.  I'm still smiling and they're still frowning.  Life is the
journey, not the destination.  Too bad they haven't figured that out
yet.
