Subject: Front Door Locks

I have had my 1977 Westy for 14 months, I have removed the front door locks (locks = cylinder +  latching mechanism) twice in this time and cleaned them up and had them working perfectly.

Last time I put graphite on everything, the guy at the locksmith by my house said that we should not use graphite in the PNW, it works great in Arizona (he thinks he is funny and witty), they recommend some type of aerosol oil that they sell, I think it has "triple" in its name.

At this point I need the wisdom of an experienced bus owner, how can I make the next time I pull the locks the last time in at least 10 years?

Thank you,
