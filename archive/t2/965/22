Not true in most cases.  The reason that H4 headlights were originally not
legal was that they weren't sealed.

Most H4 lights were designed for use in Europe, where they have even more
stringent headlight regulations than here in the states.  If the H4
headlight has the "E in the circle" symbol it is certified for use on
European roads and will work fine here in the US.

I've not heard of anyone getting dinged for properly installed and aimed
H4 lights.  These days the cops are looking for the ricers running
Japanese spec (RHD) HID headlights, not for old round H4s!
