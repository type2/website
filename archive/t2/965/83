I made that mistake many years ago with my first car -
a '74 Thing (man I miss that car...). The cover that I
got closely resembled a wet t-shirt when it rained -
Zero protection.

The one from the Bus Depot has still not ripped even
though it has gotten caught on things that should have
shredded it by now.

Love your toys - protect them properly. That's why my
Harley is in my brother's garage.
