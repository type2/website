Many after-market H4 lights are no good and the government is right  
to want them off the road.

The H4 headlights with the ECE beam pattern illuminate the road signs  
better and do not blind on coming drivers unless you get H4 made for  
RHD countries and put them in a LHD vehicle or vice versa.

The sharp cutoff prevent blinding.

I've been using Bosch 0 301 600 118 H4s for 4 years and they are  
simply excellent. High quality reflector and very bright lighting  
from stock 55/60W bulbs.
