Hi uj,

This is for the State of Arizona registration, right?

Thanks for passing this along.

Starting this month,  April,  your 1967 and newer car With Collector car
Insurance. Will now be emissions free.  If you get your registration in 
the
mail, and you have Collector Car Insurance  it should say "no emissions 
test
required"    If not, then take your registration papers and your proof of
Collector Car Insurance to MVD and they will correct it.  Happy day !!, uj
