And they are dollar store quality.

The last one I saw fit on a car, reduced the nice red glow of the  
tail light to a dim red appearance with an intense circle in the  
middle. Even worse when the brake was applied and not visible except  
from directly behind.

There are some really good LEDs that you can buy now but if you look  
at a modern vehicle they are using a combination of LEDs and  
reflector design. Just dropping in a 1156/1157 isn't effective IMHO.
