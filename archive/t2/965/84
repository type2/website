Subject: Friday Post - Driving the Speed Limit

I thought that when I turned 30 I wouldn't have any ridiculous sudden maturity issues, turns out I was wrong.

Last week I was cruising along enjoying a good song and noticed that I was in a really great mood and that I was going somewhere between 54 and 55 miles per hour.

I am from a long line of crazy aggressive speeders, my dad is in the Bonneville 200 mph club, I calculate my driving time in seconds, I drove a 1971 Torino with a 429 to high school and college during which time I rarely had a day I didn't go over 100mph.

Since buying my bus I have been successful at giving myself pep talks before actual trips about taking it easy and enjoying the drive, but on my commute I was an animal, a real warrior, I will take you out, I was running F350s with tires as tall as my bus off the road and pushing my motor real hard.

Suddenly last week this all seemed so ridiculous.  What the hell is my problem?  (I was never the middle-finger, scream and yell, you wanna pull over and settle this type, more like Dirty Harry actually)  I have seen the light, better gas mileage, less wear and tear, lower blood pressure, no fear of getting caught by the law, I can't remember why I was speeding everywhere.

By the way, my email adress isn't because I actually think of myself as a warrior on the road, its because I am the kind of guy that thought it would have been cool if my computer had quit on Y2K and I have always loved the movie, watching it was one of my earliest memories.

Thanks,
