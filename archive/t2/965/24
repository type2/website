Subject: 1974 engine in a 1972 bus

So I think I went out today and did the right thing. My bro found a VW
engine on craigslist. 250 bucks was the one I ended up with. A 1974 1700
motor. It comes with everything just like it was just pulled from the bus
only a little dirtier. I checked everything I could valves, carbs, hoses,
action on the crank oil in the case, everything I could think of. The man
who sold it to me was a nice older gentlemen who seemed to know a lot about
mechanics. Then I told him my goal was to fix it up as little as possible
and put it on my bus and go. I asked him what he thought about in his
experience and he told me that it should be fine for that and if it does not
work for me that I could bring it back to him and he would give me my money
back. It seemed to me like he had been doing this for a long time. So I took
his word for it and we loaded it up into my buddys truck and took it home.

So now I could use some advice about what to replace what to really work on
I think im going to put new seals on the carbs and valve covers. Get a new
dizzy cap and rotor, I have new plugs and wires.  I am going to clean the
valve covers out well. Change the oil.



Any other ideas.



By the way if you check out my flicker this engine already looks WAY better
then mine. Mine is leaking oil from everywhere this one is rather clean
