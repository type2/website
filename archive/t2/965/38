I am sorry I made this public. Next time I will be
sure to take this up with Ron (or whomever) privately
in the future.

Ron, I am sorry for making this public and I apologize
for the frustration. I guess I was just a little hot
over the whole transaction and acted a little
prematurely.

I do look forward to doing business with you in the
future.

I love deadlines. I like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by.
