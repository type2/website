Subject: RE: [T2] How do I mount this thing??? - I'm done.

Jason,

I just got your email yesterday.  We do ask that you allow about a day for
email response (maybe a bit longer if the question requires research). The
reason I hadn't gotten back to you yet is not because I've was ignoring you,
but because I was working on it for you. Within a couple hours of receiving
your email I contacted Just Kampers in England (the supplier) to see if they
have an instruction sheet, and am awaiting a reply. The mounts do not come
with instructions, yet we have not received any other mounting questions
from others who have bought them (and we sold many).  I guess other people
are just lining it up and drilling accordingly. From looking it over it
seemed relatively straightforward to me, but perhaps Just Kampers does have
a sheet. I figured I'd email you today, hopefully with the instructions, but
J.K. did not get back to me yet. I would expect to have a reply from them by
tomorrow one way or the other. There is a large time difference between the
U.S. and the Europe so replies are often not instantaneous.  You are welcome
to to return it - email me if you'd like an RA # - but if any instructions
exist I should be able to get them for you.  You just need to allow me
enough time to research your question!
