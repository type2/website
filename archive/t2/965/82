Amen to that---

I have Covercraft cover's on my Bus's and Vans, cost about 200 each, are
guaranteed not to fall apart / rot for 5 years, they breath, and fit
like a glove.

Maybe fo $50.00 you can buy a roll of Saran Wrap, and get the job
done---
I dunno---

For a half a Charlie you aren't going to be buying much.

Don't think that a blue Wal-Mart  cover is going to be a good deal.
The vehicle will rust away under that plastic tarp.
