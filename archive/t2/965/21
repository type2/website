Two things I remember.

Cows and other animals sleeping on pavement after dark.   Branches that you
have to drive around after dark, usually means a problem up ahead.  Maybe a
vehicle on the road with no lights etc etc.

All windows closed when pulling up for gas. One person jumps out to  check
the gas pump is at zero while  the other person tries to do the filling
themself.

Many other things, you lucky guy John.
