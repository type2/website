Subject: Bus Cover

I'm looking for a cheap cover for my bus. The lowest I could find was about
$80 shipped from here
http://www.wolfsburgwest.com/cart/DetailsList.cfm?ID=ZVW81
Are there any known covers that aren't made for a bus that would fit well
anyway. All the local auto stores don't carry a lot of van covers around
here. I'm trying to not spend more than $50. Thanks.
