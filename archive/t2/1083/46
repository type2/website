to say i am bit jealous of people who live near the surf doesn't even  
come close. about 90% of the reason i bought my first VW bus (25  
years ago) was because i thought i wanted to be a surfer, which was  
hard for someone from ottawa, ontario. the closest surf beach is  
about 2,000 miles away. my windsurfing buddy had a bus and took his  
boards to the riverside sailboarding spot in it. i had to have one  
after seeing that. a few years later i bought a 1970 kombi. the bus  
made me feel something like what i wanted to feel. truth be told i am  
to this day still dreaming of becoming a surfer. one day it will  
happen. i've been surfing twice in my life and you're so very lucky  
if you can do it.
