It is on the top of the engine towards the left rear, just to the right 
of the distributor and in front of the fan shroud (front is front).  It 
will have a breather box clamped onto the top of it with a hose attached.

I don't know of another way, sorry.

Probably not necessary, unless you feel that failure of the other cover 
is imminent.

Should the cover clips also be replaced?

If you don't have any oil leaks at the valve covers, then no.

I've never been clear on whether or not that also applies to type IV 
engines or just type I engines.  I think I tightened mine more than 9 
lb-ft and I never had a problem but I would like to know the answer too.
