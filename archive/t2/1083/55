You didn't give us much information.
What kind / number of carbs do you have?
Has this been since Summer started, or is it always the 
case?
What kind (grade) of fuel do you use?

These answers will help a lot in diagnosis.

When do you want to go to Haiti?  I can make it happen.
Christ lays opportunities to serve him at our feet every day.  
We can choose to pick them up or expect that someone else will.
I choose the first.
