Well a list administrator can4t administer and empty list.  This place
was dying not long ago and many people offered help and services to
save it.  I not sure why admins would so concerned about this post or
any other general automobile post that can relate to a type 2.  I
think for some reason they are also against people posting for sale
ads they have seen. I usually find it helpful to find out that a BN4
is for sale on ebay that I might have missed.  So we have all charter
full of rules about what we can and can not post. When something is
posted related to type2 inevitably some troll asks if you searched the
archives. They wonder why the list use has dropped so much?  I also
love the post about the trips people have taken, camping gear (like a
Kooltron) and general question that could be applied to other
automobiles.  It seems redundant to have to say (here is how you work
on VW type 2 disk breaks( vs (here is how you work on disk breaks(
just to fly under the admin radar.
