I am heading the van south on Saturday though. 2 days worth on the way 
to Denver via a night stop at the KOA in Billings Montana.

Have fun

Goin' to San Onofre tomorrow morning early. Going with my neighbor in his
beater 66 kombi, a bunch of surf boards, beer, soda, fish, corn and a
hibachi.

Anyone else going?
BYOB YMMV :-)
