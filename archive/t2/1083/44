Subject: UK Weekend Road Trip:  Checklist & V-dubbers En-route

Hello,

We'll be taking our first road trip this weekend in our Beige Bus.
Just curious if folks have any recommendations for Type 2 spares & tools to bring along that are not in the John Muir book.
A search of the archives advises to go along with what's in the book, but I was wondering if folks have found some other items indispensable other than beer.

Our route will take us from Lincolnshire to Edinburgh via the A1 with a stopover at a campground south of Newcastle.
We'll take in the outstanding multitude of events during the Edinburgh Festivals and meet some friends.
ON Sunday we'll be heading to a VW festival outside of Leeds, then head back home to Lincolnshire.

So I was wondering if anyone out there can recommend any Type2/VW specialists or helpful enthusiasts along the way in case we run into trouble.
I checked the AIRS list for the UK, but didn't see anything.  However, I did submit my name even though I'm a novice!


Any info would be appreciated!

Thanks,

Josh
