It "usually doesn't happen here" because most people understand the 
rules.  Sorry you have a problem with the list charter, Matt but this is 
NOT a forum for free speech.  If you want that, go start your own list 
and see how fast it degrades into useless fluff.

This list troll has been poked enough for one day so let me be clear: 
This thread is killed.  If you want to discuss it further e-mail me 
privately.
