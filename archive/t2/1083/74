Subject: Nutty idea #78

We have this '78 VW Westy resting the garage. It's the typical VW van. Kind of cool inside in the winter... 

I also most (if not all) of an a/c system for the bus that eventually I'll install. 

I've seen some clever a/c ideas from the Corvair list. One was a fellow who built a custom a/c system and put in rear air. In other words there was dash air and then in back there was another evaporator, fan and temp knob for the back seat. Simply relied on a expansion valve (I think) from a minivan. 

My nutty idea was what if I took a reversing valve from a heat pump and plumbed it into the system? 

Reverse the valve and we'd get heat from the a/c right? Now I know that heat pumps don't work very well below 25 degrees but for that 32+ degree weather when the stock heater needs a boost... 

And I suspect it would not consume any more fuel than a gasoline heater would...

I plan to speak with some of the HVAC guys working around my work place this week.

Other alternative would be some sort of electric compressor. Dunno what their current requirements are though. 12 volt DC motors or big honking inverter + a/c motor... 

I know some of the electric vehicles that have reached the market in the past ten years have had heat pumps. Of course they also have vehicle electrical systems going up past 200 volts in some cases...

So between stock heat, a heat pump booster, an oil cooler fan plumbed into an insider heat exchanger and fan, recirculation heat, booster fans, gas heater, electric blankets, and so forth we ought to stay warm in the bus... (just kidding, have not added any of that - yet).
