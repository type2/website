Okay I read up on the achives.

It appears that people don't like the 34pict3 carb. Also they don't like the 009 dist.

Is this correct? I also read up about the Fix for the 34carb with a 009 
dist, on aircooledtech.com. Does it actually work? Would it be better
 to just put in a vac advance dist.?

Thanks
Richard
