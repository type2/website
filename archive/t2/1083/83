Subject: Oil pressure control valve location. 78 westy 2.0 FI motor

So ever since I installed an oil pressure guage.(7 yrs) I have noticed my oil pressure bouncing around a lot. Esp after warm up. Engine has always and does run great. Oil temps stay good no oil consumption etc. I want to check the oil pressure control valve and spring but can't seem to find it. I see the pressure relief valve but not sure about the control valve. Bentley refers to both but in one scematic it shows the control valve as discontinued after 75? Do I need to pull some tin off the bottom of the motor? My other thought is that its just my old guage which is much older than 7 years, but all contacts are clean and tight. I don't have a mechanical guage or I would try that.

As an aside anyone ever have a mechanical guage go bad on them in an older mercedes and get hot oil dripping from the dash?

Thanks,
