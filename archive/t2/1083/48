Subject: Autostick Bus?

Is this possible?  Without spending cubic bux?  Is there a front mount on
the autostick trans that will mate to the bus body ('69 bus, BTW)? I know
that I'd have to change the output flanges on the trans to match the bus CVs
or use a bug CV on the inboard end of a bus half shaft (are the ouput shaft
or half-shaft diameters the same bus to bug?)  Has anyone tried this or seen
one at a meet?

I have a sweet running, but rusty '74 autostick superbeetle and will be
salvaging the engine, but wondered if the trans was transplantable as well,
as I rather like the autostick system.

Steve
