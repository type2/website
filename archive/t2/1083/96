Hi Matt,

I've been running Michelin Agilis 185s.  Great tires.  A bit pricey, but I 
think
they are well worth it.  OTOH, I've not used some of the other tires that 
folks
on this list swear by, so I'm not trying to promote one over the other. 
Just to
say I've been extremely pleased by the Agilises.

And you defnitely do want a stiff tire suitable for a bus, not a passenger 
car
tire.  Makes all the difference in the world in handling, plus they are 
safer.

Cheers,

John
