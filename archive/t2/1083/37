Subject: Re: [T2] Kill This Thread (Re: [T2] Poison Gas Warning Article)

I'm going to make a few points here, that should be easy to  
understand.  Note that I'm not trying to be a troll, and neither was  
Dave.  Take the names elsewhere.  It's not needed here.  Also note  
that I'm doing my best attempt to not come across as a prick.

1. "Kill this thread" means do NOT reply!  I don't expect this thread  
to see another reply beyond the one I'm making here as an admin.

2. If you feel you must reply, reply to the admin that said to kill  
the thread, not the entire list.  Or, take the couple minutes to read  
the url's listed at the bottom of every list email to figure out how  
to contact the list admins directly.

3. I've suggested to the admins the thought of having a poll for list  
members to weigh in on their thoughts about the current charter.  If  
something comes of this, we'll let you know.  DON'T reply to this  
thread to ask about it's progress.

Peace, Troy
