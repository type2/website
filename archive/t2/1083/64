Well, it's not just that people don't like them. VOA issued so many
technical service bulletins about modifying the 34 carb that it is not
worth messing with when you can step back to a 32 carb.

The 009 distributor won't run your engine correctly. It is intended
for industrial engines running a fixed RPM or race cars equipped with
cars with no vacuum signal or the incorrect vacuum signal due to
changed throttle position caused by more available power when highway
cruising.

Your ideal solution is to run the correct distributor and a 32PICT
carb. Otherwise, yes, the aircooledtech fix does work for the 009, and
you can time your 009 either at 27 BTDC at 2500 RPM or for easier
starting at 7 BTDC at idle. Neither setting is optimal.

Best of luck,

John
