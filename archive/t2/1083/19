On the contrary, I think it has a lot to do with buses.  If this post were part
of a thread spawned from a query I made about beginning welding only a few
weeks ago, no one would have said anything.  Welding, while not directly
connected with buses, are still closely related.  If you haven't welded on your
bus, you either paid someone to do it or are one lucky son-of-a-gun.

This wasn't a "Watch out for the milworm virus" or "Help stop world hunger"
email.  It's a link to an article from a guy who apparently is an amateur
mechanic (like most of us around here), and he made a pretty big mistake.  Glad
I could read about it on one of the few forums I frequent as an amateur
mechanic.

Cheers,
Paul
