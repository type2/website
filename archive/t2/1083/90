Hi Linda,

Best advice I can give if you are planning on rebuilding an aircooled
VW engine is to get a copy of Tom Wilson's book on the topic. It will
tell you how to recognize the parts inside the engine so as to know
for 100% certain if the 1.8 case has been upgraded with 2L innards in
the 30+ years since it left the factory. The Bentley is also an
excellent reference but it does not go into detail on the rebuild
process like the Wilson book does.

Even if you aren't doing the work yourself the Wilson book will help
you better understand the process, and a better educated consumer will
usually get better treatment from a supplier.

Here's one source, or use the ISBN number to get it through your local
bookstore if you prefer.

Happy Trails,

Greg
