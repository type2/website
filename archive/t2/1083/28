Well, this is not a list troll. It is a list administrator/moderator
and we have to respect his ruling. I respect those who expressed a
contrary opinion to the administrator. They are human too and can make
a mistake, but the ruling is binding on the list and we must respect
that too. He has asked twice for us to kill this thread, and so we
must kill it.

 someone post something irrelevant and some forum troll (or in this
 case a list troll) jumps all over them.  I see many email messages
 come through here that do not interest me. I ignore them and go on
 with my day.  The people that have a problem with this post have
 missed the whole point of this list.  We could have moved to a forum.
 How many email list like this are still active? I treasure this list
 and its valuable information and good spirit of the members.  What I
 don4t appreciate is list trolls quoting the charter like someone
 violated a human right.
