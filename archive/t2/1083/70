Hi Bob,

The early tank shouldn't be overlooked if you can find one...

Yes, it's a single outlet, BUT...

The outlet on a 68-74 tank has a threaded fitting to connect to the  
fuel outlet. When Jamie Rivers upgraded his 74 westy to a 2L FI engine  
he was able to adapt a dual-pipe outlet onto this threaded fitting.

Me, I also had an early tank with my FI conversion but in my case I  
went with a simple T-fitting made from a scrap chunk of FI rail. It  
has worked flawlessly for me for about 5 years now; with no fuel  
pressure or delivery issues whatsoever.

Another thought... Have you checked with bustedbus?

Happy Trails,

Greg
