Subject: 2.0L rebuild or refresh?

HI trusted friends,
Question or 2 here.what is a good book to work with to do a re-build?
And should I do a re-build or refresh? I dont really know what a refresh
entails, I assume its re-build light!
Compression tests reveal all cylinders 106-to110. I plan on having the heads
sent for recutting and such.
So this winter Ill have the engine indoors to replace the clutch , overhaul
the FI system and general beautification with painting and detail cleaning,
should i rehone the jugs and re-ring the pistons as well? check the cam?
Anything else come to mind that 'while i have the engine out' should be done
? of course all fuel lines and fuel filler neck will be done.
Thanks Volks..Joe
