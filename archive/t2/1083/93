Hey all. I blew a tire today.  I'm going to need to replace all the
tires on the free speech mobile. When I got the Van it had 185s I
bought a used set of 195s years ago and have been running them. What
are most people running. Also is there any tires rated for more weight
at that size than regular passenger car tires?
