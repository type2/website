Now if you post a useful, detailed article about one of those subjects  
and throw in an anecdotal note about using proper jackstands, that is no  
big deal.  Posting ten paragraphs of stuff you copied from the internet  
with no bus content and nothing added by you is a no-brainer charter  
violation.

very true dave  but all he would and should have done was add bus  
content., saying welding on a bus instead of diesel tanks. for those that  do a lot 
of welding on old VWs  Buses  it is a damn good thing to  be aware of  later
