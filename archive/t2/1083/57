Hi Richard,

If you can start it with it floored for a long time, that is an
indicator of serious flooding. Since you have an electric fuel pump, I
would suspect it is putting out too much fuel pressure and overcoming
the needle and float in the carburetor. I would think you would have
black soot in the tailpipe due to this condition as well. It's also
not healthy for the engine because the excess fuel will dilute the
engine oil on the cylinder walls, and eventually dilute the crankcase
oil as well. I would check the fuel pressure and add a fuel pressure
regulator if so indicated. If pressure is normal, look into a bad
float or needle in the carb(s).

This not being the case, other things can cause hot start problems.
Too little fuel can be as much a culprit as too much, which can be
caused by problems such as vapor lock and clogged fuel system
components such as filter, carb jets and passages, etc.

John

fine in the morning, when cool.  If I try to start it after sitting hot for 5
to 10 minutes it starts fine .  If I try to start after letting it sit for
longer it doesn't want to start.  If I floor it and let it turn over for more
than normal start time, it will start eventually.
