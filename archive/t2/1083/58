Subject: Re: [T2] Hard starting when hot

I just started driving the bus more in the last few months. So yeah it's been super hot here at least 100F.  But it did it today and the temp was only 87F

I use the highest octane I can get which is usually 90. 

Thanks
Richard

Has this been since Summer started, or is it always the

What kind (grade) of fuel do you use?

These answers will help a lot in diagnosis.

When do you want to go to Haiti?  I can make it happen.
Christ lays opportunities to serve him at our feet every day.  
We can choose to pick them up or expect that someone else will.
I choose the first.
