Well, I'm glad to see that there is life left in the list.  Hi, guys.  
I've been out of the country for most of the last two years.  I've been 
lurking for the last few weeks and have not previously been able to 
post.  I recently switched to a Macbook and if this goes through, I have 
solved the problem. 

 Concerning this issue, I found it interesting but it is does indeed 
have no direct bus content.  I have to agree with John on this one.  But 
would it be appropriate to just include a link to something like this 
that may concern many members?  Forgive me for not re-reading the rules 
to find out for myself.   But it gives me a chance to say hello.  And 
you guys make me REALLY jealous making the campouts.  Now if I can just 
find time to work on my bus and get it going again.  I'm looking for 
someone to do some body work while I'm gone next time.  Still playing 
music for a living, thankfully.  I'm thankful to have any job, quite 
frankly.  But I miss driving the Bopmobile daily.  Keep up the good 
work.  Ciao....KR
