Subject: Hard starting when hot 

I have a 69  westy that has a hard time starting after it's hot.  It starts fine in the morning, when cool.  If I try to start it after sitting hot for 5 to 10 minutes it starts fine .  If I try to start after letting it sit for longer it doesn't want to start.  If I floor it and let it turn over for more than normal start time, it will start eventually.  

Why?  

It's a 1600 with a electric fuel pump.

Thanks
Richard
