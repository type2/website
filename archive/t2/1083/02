Subject: BOTC 2009 Is over and done... Here are some numbers for you.

In this stat-crazed world it's all about the numbers. So here are the 
numbers for BOTC 2009.

37 buses containing over 100 persons in total came from Ontario, Quebec, 
Connecticut, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania; Access 
Bob Reuter was the winner of the long distance award after traveling 588 
miles from Baltimore in his 78 bus.

54 BOTC T-shirts got tie-dyed along with many other unofficial items 
including blankets, shop coats and underwear.

$50 was raised to support type2.com before we ran out of 50/50 draw tickets.

15 Dozen cobs of fresh Ontario corn were consumed at dinner Saturday.

3 trailer loads of firewood were oxidized in campfires over the weekend.

The Oldest bus attending was a 67. The newest was a 2005 Rialta. There 
were no eurovans at the event at all this year.

Endless thanks must go out to the many people who helped make the event 
a success. Colleen and my household teen squad, My parents and brothers, 
Adam, Bryon and plenty of others are well deserving of praise.

BOTC 2009 will be remembered as one of the most laid-back and relaxing 
events we've had at that site many years. Next year will be the tenth 
annual and I heard plenty of offers to prepay the registration.

I also want to say Thanks to all who came out; seeing people having a 
good time is what makes the effort worthwhile.

Happy Trails,
