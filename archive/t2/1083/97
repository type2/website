read the type 2 library FAQs on tires, more info than you ever wanted
to know. but to cover the critical issue our buses MUST have tires
with a load range of C or D. passenger car tires are unsafe under the
bus, no matter what the tire jockey at the local discount shop says.

there are plenty out there that work, Bus Depot sells a good tire and
the tire rack I believe will install them. I run Michelin Agilis tires
on my bus but these are expensive and hard to come by but NTB will
order them if you insist. best all season radial in my opinion.

read the FAQ and then get back with any questions.
