your timing couldn't be better on that,  been trying to find a "New"
FI gas tank for my 78 bus.....
I thought that the Fuel Injection 2L engine was avaliable in Europe as
an extra cost option.  is that correct?

the fuel Injection gas tank has two fuel outlets (yes I know the work
around) but wondering if a NEW FI tank may be avaliable from any of
the soources you know in Germany

thanks and again welcome home
