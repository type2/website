I'm California native. Always said Sacramento was great because it was
about the same drive to the coast or the Sierra Nevada. Love to drive
my bus down the coast highway. Surfer wannabe. Got the bus, got the
surf bus t-shirt, but I can't swim!! So you are much closer than me to
realizing the dream. Loved Surf's Up. Kinda captured the spirit....
'Nuff Friday talk!

 to say i am bit jealous of people who live near the surf doesn't even
