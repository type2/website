No, it was never available here.

If it isn't even available where the buses did have FI, I seriously
doubt it might be where they didn't.  However, if you have the part
number, try http://www.volkswagen-classic-parts.de/bestand/index2.html
-- click on "Zugang ohne vorherige Registrierung", then enter the
part number in the field "Teilenummer" and click "finden!".  If they
have it, mail me and we'll arrange shipping and such.

Good luck!

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
