Subject: Re: [T2] Poison Gas Warning Article

We still have rules around here, and one of the most important ones is 
not to post articles that do not have bus content:

 From the charter (www.type2.com/type2charter.html):

--Do not EVER post virus warnings, or messages about important issues
that you think should concern everybody in the world. Do not post
messages unless they have legitimate bus content. If you think the
message you're sending is so important that the "bus content" rule does
not apply to you, that means that you should ==NOT== post it.

This poison gas post is a perfect example.
