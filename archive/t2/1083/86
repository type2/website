After a half inch of play removed it might be time to re-read the 
part in Muir's book about driving with a broken clutch cable or maybe 
changing it and keeping the old one as a spare.

Reminds me of the couple of weeks I drove the '63 without a cable, 
after getting stuck in traffic going up a hill (Hwy 101 going into 
Marin county after crossing the GG bridge) I 'found' the time to 
change the cable. All in all it would have been a better idea to have 
changed when it first broke.
