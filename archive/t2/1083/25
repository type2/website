Subject: Kill This Thread (Re: [T2] Poison Gas Warning Article)

I'll tell you what I told Chris.  I understand where you are coming from 
- really.  But the admins have discussed this ad-nauseum for the past 
15+ years.  The problem with your argument is that there are so many 
things that we as bus owners could do that are dangerous.  We could try 
to mount tires using lighter fluid. We could clean our upholstery with 
tainted Chinese upholstery cleaner, and the list goes on.  If we allowed 
people to post dire warnings for every conceivable thing that could go 
wrong, it would completely clog up the list and the archives with non 
bus-related stuff.

People are members of this list because it is a great resource for 
specific bus issues such as how to adjust valves, fix the alternator 
light in the dash or repair their brakes.  They are not members so they 
can be bombarded with stories about burning themselves on hot surfaces, 
shocking themselves with live electrical wiring or wheel jack safety.

Now if you post a useful, detailed article about one of those subjects 
and throw in an anecdotal note about using proper jackstands, that is no 
big deal.  Posting ten paragraphs of stuff you copied from the internet 
with no bus content and nothing added by you is a no-brainer charter 
violation.

Here's the key paragraph from the charter again, I think it is pretty clear:

"If you think the message you're sending is so important that the "bus 
content" rule does not apply to you, that means that you should ==NOT== 
post it."
