I'm not sure about the timing.  (Monty if you see this will you respond with
what you set my timing at.) 

I have a stock 1600 with a single boscar 34pict-3 carb, and 009 dist. with
electronic ign. 

I just changed the fuel pump yesterday because it would get very loud at
random times.

Thanks
Richard
