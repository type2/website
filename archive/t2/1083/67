Subject: I'm back (again...)

Hi Volks!

Having been more or less offline for about a year, and sadly having first
wrecked and then sold my last Type 2, I nonetheless am back on line and
on this list.  And the future isn't all that bleak: my Type 2 is going to
be rebuilt by the new owner, and chances are that once it's done, I'll 
get the chance to buy it back.  (Strange arrangement, I know.  I don't
have the resources to have it rebuilt myself, though, so we went this
way.)

Anyway -- if, being German, I can help anyone here with translations,
looking up stuff at the local VW dealers', or anything else, please don't
hesitate to ask.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
