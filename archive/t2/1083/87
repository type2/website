Subject: engine size?

Hi from the newbies,,
Firstly, thanks for allowing me on this list.  We have already learned a 
lot.  We have 2 engines ,,need rebuilding.  One is an 1800 and one a 
2000..can someone direct me to a web page or help me to determine which is 
which.  I have ordered a Bently Manual,,maybe the info will be there?  when 
it arrives..I have an engine number...GD037171 and 2nd one is AW030859.  Any 
help would be appreciated.
Cheers
LInda and Ben Rodgers
