I had taken 20 about 10 miles south but mostly the same scenery.

I have thought similar things, mine apparently is having gas tank
issues itself.   those 20 year repairs the DPO put on 25 years ago are
failing...Don't know anyone selling these new. seems like Bus Depot or
any one of the folks out there should be able to get a fuel tank from
South Africa or Brazil or someplace, would buy one in a heartbeat if
it was even half good.

  the boat industry has stainless tanks in a myriad of sizes and
shapes and often wondered if anyone had modified one to fit a bus.  I
have poured over the West Marine catalog and the tanks are not cheap
but if I could find one that fit it might be worth it to find a way to
get it in there.

glad yours was a fairly simple side of the road fix, and you didn't
have to get the dreaded hook.
