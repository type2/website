no not overlooking it and a source in Germany has them brand new at
374 euros plus shipping but again is not FI

used tanks are avaliable at reasonable prices, I've bought from
bustedbus and am a satisfied customer.

but start my quest for new and work down from there..  seems like I
remember the Brazilian and South African buses were fuel injected even
with a water cooled engine so I've wondered if those tanks would work,
don't know if it was CIS system or some other that didn't need a
return line.

a good used tank has been offered and is being considered but it is
still 30+ years old any way you look at it.

just seems like someone like Ron S who travels to these exotic places
and brings containers full of "stuff" back to these shores might have
run into fuel tanks.  don't know how it is up north but around here
scrappers have to remove and  destroy fuel tanks so junkyard ones can
be scarce.

again thanks for a great week

until I get my website up do you want to post any of my photos from
