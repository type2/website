Subject: Re: [VB] stud welder

One of the greatest things for body work, I have had my stinger stud welder 
 for over 10 yrs and 100 cars later it still works great.
 
The mistake most make when repairing a dent is that around the indentation  
the metal will be raised, so when pulling the dent out you need to tap the 
metal  around down.
