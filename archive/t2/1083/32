Subject: Re: [T2] Kill This Thread (Re: [T2] Poison Gas Warning Article)

It would be better to use judicious judgment and kill threads which are
genuinely not bus related, such as politics, etc. 

The needless, and if I may say so stupid enforcement of rules just
because they are in the charter runs contrary to common sense if
indeed not just plain decency.

Charter rules, like laws, should be enforced when there is a reason 
to do so.

In this case, there is no reason to object to a thread of genuine and
real interest to bus owners and shade tree bus mechanics simply
because of how it orginated.
