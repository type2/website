Dunno if this applies to you Steve- at least on the older Bays (mine is a
79) the foam compartment seal seal has a "shiny" side and a "not-so-shiny"
side. The shiny side is supposed to go down (towards the road)... I suspect
that side might be more heat-resistance and better at repelling water, dirt,
oil, etc... Cheers, Mike
