Subject: 69 sunroof bus for sale...

I'm slowly moving out of VW's, need more utility out of a vehicle (hard to find 
one !) [need A/C, camper that can sleep 6]; I've recently sold my 77 automatic 
Westy and the last to go is my 69 sunroof.

I'm in Kansas City, if someone on the list is interested, i'm asking 3K obo.

The bus is solid, but has some damage on the inside of the body on the drivers 
door (door is fine) and cancer around some lower portions [more pictures to go 
up soon].

Rebuilt engine by Vee Village about 15K miles ago, new clutch and throw out 
bearing, have extra parts that go with it (new clutch, bumpers, front kick 
panels).

Thanks to the list for years of support on my busses, if anyone is interested 
contact me...
