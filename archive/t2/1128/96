The rear axle nut does not need to be removed to disconnect the
parking brake cable - loosen the cables at the adjustment point so
that you've got enough slack to just pull them off the connection
point under the brake drum.

It's 46mm or 1 13/16". PS: they stock the SAE equivalent at Tractor
Supply, if you've got one of those stores near you.
