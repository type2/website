Subject: Camping Checklist

I am trying to compile a "Camping Checklist" for things every VW bus owner
should have on a camping trip or in preparation for a trip.  I've pulled the
list below from posts that were on The Samba website.  However in compiling
this list, I have begun wondering if the list hasn't "gone too far".  While I
don't believe you should be foolish or relying on your MacGyver instincts, I
don't believe you should have to take everything in your garage and half of
the stuff from your kitchen and bathroom to go camping.

Wanted to see what you all on the list had to say.

Peace,

Michael in Montevallo
