	I'm sure that is all good stuff; but this WizBangPlus.com 
seems to be an additional method.
	I've now bought one.  The instruction sheet sez

input voltage 4.5 V DC  -  16 V DC

output voltage  60V  10 microsec pulse every 1 millisec  approx.

freq   0.8 - 1.2  kHz  depending on temperature and input voltage


So it is some pulsed overvoltage beyond the 16 V which the archives 
rightly extol.

I'm taking the gamble 8-) of sending this before Friday, because 
lead-acid accumulators do feature more in campers than in ordinary 
cars.  The refrigerators, lights, swamp coolers, etc etc which we're 
tempted to use while static can drain batteries, making it difficult 
to start the engine when we wish to move on  ...
