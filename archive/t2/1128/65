Subject: Repairing the roof rack

So a couple weeks ago I was stowing a bunch of stuff on the stock roof
rack of my 71 Westy.  Pushed a tent bag from one side to the other
underneath a cargo net, it got a little stuck and I pushed harder.
Found out when I later unpacked that I'd broken the rivet on one of the
bars - more accurately, I tore one end out of the fiberglass top.

So what's my best solution to fixing it?  Could a fiberglass repair
work?  I'm a little disappointed that I ruined a perfectly good top, but
I need to be more careful with 40 year old fiberglass...

Thanks,

John
