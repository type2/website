Subject: Droopy Rear Hatch Repair (Warning!!! Not for the meak at heart)

Hello List,
 
I have owned my 68 bus for the past eight years and something always bothered
my about my bus. The rear hatch would not stay open. Maybe there are others
who share this same problem. When I bought the bus, I wrongly assumed that
this would be a simple repair. After doing much studying and research, I found
that it is impossible to remove the rear hinges and torsion bars without
cutting and welding. I finially bit the bullet and have started my repair.
 
I ended up cutting the rear roof section including the hatch hindges out of a
71 doner bus. I have spent the last 2 days measuring, cutting, grinding and
welding in the new roof section. I will post pics when I have them. I am not
finished welding yet, but I do have some tac welds in place to keep the
position of the clip. So far, so good. I have a lot of welding left to do.
This is not an easy job, but it has not only allowed me to replace the faulty
hinges, it also allowed me to replace the rear gutters at the same time, which
had been rusted, bent up and cut by the previous owner.
 
Hopefully, tomorrow, I will have more of the welding finished. Anyone who has
used a MIG welder on sheet metal knows that the entire weld job will consist
of hundreds of tack welds, poke-o-dotted around the seams until there isn't
room to put another tac weld in. Then comes hours of grinding, dynaglass, and
mud work until it is ready for primmer. Wish me luck folks. This is just the
first stage in my ole buses' face lift.
 
Take it easy!
