Subject: Friday poem from Unca Joel Walker

Bob Hoover

the sky is dimmer now ...
a star is missing from our view ...
but, oh, how bright it shone, the light we knew ...

the wind is quieter now ...
a voice no longer speaks ... the clear
unvarnished truth is silent ... gone, i fear ...

the earth is sadder now ...
a man of note has left her care
and passed beyond our meager deeds of prayer ...

I, too, am sad, and quiet now ... my selfish grief will pass and fade away,
yet still, within my thoughts, the light and voice will stay.


unca Joel
