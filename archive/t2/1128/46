I should have elaborated... if the lamp dims,, there is a voltage drop,, and
quite likely you have a wiring problem in the circuit, from a bad
connection... you can start looking at the fuse, it may have poor
connections at the fuse panel.

If the lamp doesn't dim.. then you know the voltage is good ,, the horn is
probably defective.
