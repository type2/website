Subject: 1600 upright engine

Hi Folks
             My 1973 Bus appears to have a 1600 upright engine, the two 
pipes from the fan shroud had been sealed and the connecting holds in the 
panels around the engine have also been plugged. I have opened up the 
outlets on the shroud, and was surprised with the volumn of air produced. 
Not sure what to do about the plugged holes in the panels if I open them up 
and fit hose the air would just blow out under the van, there are no heat 
exchangers. Any recommendations???
                          Cheers Ben  irishrover
