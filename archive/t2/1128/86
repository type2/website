Bought from this one:

These are what I use.  Both the wall wart kind #12117and the 5 amp with solar
panel kit #SCC005.  The factory has, in the past, given a good deal if you
call direct. There are some good discounts to be had online.  The wall wart
WILL discharge your battery if it comes unplugged from the AC. This is true of
the wizbang kind if left any time without running the vehicle.  I find they
work well in intermittent vehicle use set ups, much better than trickle
chargers. Particularly, I install them on boats that are used only for a 3
month fishing season, and parked for the rest of the year.  I have also used
mine to bring back my van battery from the "dead".  The batteyminders only
work when the battery voltage is above 11 vdc, so you need to use a regular
charger to get the process started from very low voltage.   I did a lot of
research before I bought my first one to replace a conventional "automatic"
charger that had killed two van batteries in three
 years.  At that time I was living in my van 24/7, but not driving it
regularly.  These days I would also recommend a Xantrex Truecharge 2 which has
three charge rate settings and is optimized for use in a house system running
largely off AC.  It is a more expensive product but living in the bus more
than saves the "difference", let alone the cost of replacing batteries.  Their
charger-inverters are an outstanding product too.

For running multiple batteries, more and more folks here are going to Blue
Seas ACR battery combiners (SI series).  http://bluesea.com/category/2  Very
reliable and with the option to use the house battery for extra start capacity
if needed (and) without using jumper cables.  If you go to the ML series they
will take "any"(well...really..., only 2500 amps ;) ) amount of cranking
current.  The SI series for around $65 are far, far, superior to any of the
relay kits offered by VW vendors.
