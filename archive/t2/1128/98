If you have no heat exchangers (I assume they were replaced with "J-tubes), the you must keep those outlets in the fan shroud plugged, other wise you will lose all that cooling air which should be blowing over the cylinders.  As for the holes in the cooling tin where the fresh air hose would normally go before connecting to heat exchangers, you can just plug those up to keep the hot air from under the engine from entering the engine bay (just cut out a piece of sheet metal, even an aluminum can, and pop-rivet it over those holes.)
