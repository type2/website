Subject: RE: [T2] Camping Checklist

I'll have to admit, having everything properly preloaded, as much as possible,
is my goal.  Anything to make it easier on me.

My wife and two girls (8 and 9) aren't that much help, really.  We just went
on a camping trip and I remember telling them as I was packing up camp one
morning (with it already in the 90s and humidity high) as they were all
sitting in their chairs watching me, I said, "Isn't camping fun!"  :-)
