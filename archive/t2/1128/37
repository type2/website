Subject: horn grounding

Hi bus addicts (myself included),

A previous owner has installed a separate horn button on the dash of
KK-Louise, a '71 Westy. A few years ago the horn stopped working. I
decided to make it work today, so of course, I am seeking guidance.

I pulled the horn button from the dash and traced the wires. My hot
wire goes to a male connector that is connected to the body of the
front sheet metal where a female y connector also sends power to the
wiper motor. A separate blue wire goes from the switch all the way to
the horn.

Since nothing was working I removed the blue wire (ground) and
brown/white wire (hot) from the horn and wired the horn directly to
12v and a ground. While applying 12v I intermittently would get the
nice aaoogaa. This leads me to believe the horn is good. I then
cleaned the connection on the ground on the horn and put a new female
push-on connector on the ground wire. The brown-white hot wire I
cleaned with emery cloth and reattached.

When I press the button I now get a very faint chirp from the horn. At
the hot wire I am only measuring 11.4v. Does the horn need 12v+? Is it
possible that the switch is bad and thus not giving a complete ground?
If so, how would I test that? Can I cross the ground and hot wire to
see if the horn sounds?

Looking through the archives it seems that having a ground wire on the
horn should not be necessary. Rather, it should be grounded to the
body. The archives also indicated that the horn is the most irritating
circuit in the bus, it might be.

Thank you for any ideas, tips, guidance, or thoughts,
