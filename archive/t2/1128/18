Subject: Re: [T2] Camping Checklist

I'd love to add something like this to my camping supplies.  Someday

I have pretty much everything stored in the bus and ready to go.  All I 
have to do is fire up my Engel fridge, load it with beer and some food, 
and roll on out.  It's great being ready to go at all times.
