Subject: OEM Bay Steering Couplers

I installed the new OEM steering coupler, available from Old Volks Home.

In order to do this, one must first remove the steering wheel.  This  
was made difficult by the fact that the aftermarket coupler has a lot  
of "give."  Pulling up on he steering wheel pulls the entire steering  
shaft up about an inch.  That ain't right.

Having taken the aftermarket coupler out, I can bend it double with  
the fingers of one hand, whereas the OEM coupler takes a great deal  
more effort (two hands).  I feel much safer now behind the wheel.
