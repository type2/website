The lamp would never dim unless you added something else in *series* (in 
front/behind) of the horn/test-lamp circuit.  That is the only way you'd 
get a voltage drop to occur for that parallel circuit.  Because the 
horn/test-lamp are wired in parallel to each other, the test lamp will 
not encounter a voltage drop due to the horn working or not working.

In a series circuit, you add up all the voltage drops to get the total 
voltage (because current is constant).  In a parallel circuit, you add 
up all the current drops to get the total current (because voltage is 
constant).

Now, if you were to add a light (or some other device) somewhere else in 
*series* in the circuit (i.e. between the end of the ground wire and 
ground), light would dim.

Like I mentioned above, the light will always stay at the same 
intensity, regardless of whether the horn works (whether it's broken, 
malfunctioning, or functioning).  It's just telling you that the circuit 
is good, not necessarily the status of the horn.
