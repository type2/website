No Doubt! My Makita side grinder is my favorite tool. IT is so versitile. I
use the cuttoff wheels for cutting the sheet metal on my bus, the metal
grinders for shaping metal and grinding down welds, the bell brush attachement
for eating out rust and paint (works great), and the regular wire brush for
getting into tight places. I have had my Makita grinder for at least 8 years.
It has been used and abused but still runs like a work horse. A drill with the
same attachments is no match. It is definitely a must have for any bus owner
who needs to do body work.

Good advice and look at all the nice products that Eastwood has to make the
attachments easier.  And don't forget a good 4 - 1/2" Grinder, it is our
