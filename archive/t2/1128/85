Subject: Re: [T2] horn grounding

The horn I believe is bad. After removing it from the front of the bus
I wired it to a battery where it eeked out a sound. Then it would do
the normal horn sound and then eeked out more sound for a bit. While
shaking the horn the innards rattle. I may go through the smart light
idea above, or if I can find a used horn, I will try that too.

As always, thanks for the ideas and tips,

Max
