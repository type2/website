I don't *think* that should matter, but you might try running the engine 
and see if it makes any difference.  That's kinda low for your battery, 
though, as a full charge should be at 12.6.  Regardless, it shouldn't 
really matter...

That's weird.  You should be able to ground it and have it make a 
continuous sound.  You might try playing with the adjustment screw 
(refer to bentley on this).  You can also check the internal horn 
circuit by using an ohm meter across the horn terminals and you should 
have resistance across the terminals.

The horn itself is not grounded - the wire that goes to the switch 
provides the ground.  Now, the circuit inside the horn could be bad, but 
a test with an ohm meter *might* verify that.  What could also be 
happening is that the horn is vibrating and the circuit inside the horn 
is intermittent and the vibration is causing a break in the circuit.

You can also wire a bulb in parallel with the horn so that you know 
voltage is going to the horn when the horn is not sounding.  The easiest 
way to do this would be to use an automotive test lamp.  So what you 
would do is connect the +12v wire to one terminal of the horn, and then 
any loose wire to the other terminal of the horn (this will be your 
"switch".  Then take your test lamp and connect one lead to the +12v 
terminal of the horn and then connect the other end of the lamp to the 
other terminal of the horn.  Then ground the loose "switch" wire and 
both the lamp and the horn should be powered.  If only the lamp goes on, 
then you know the horn's bad.  If neither works, then your circuit is bad.
