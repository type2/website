as long as you have play ,, and know how to work a clutch pedal.. you won't 
have problems. 

I have worked on many fleet vehicles... and some head mechanics love to have 
all the clutch play set up like yours was,, LOTS of play.. the pedal barely 
gets off the floor and it is fully engaged... that is so the drivers that 
leave their foot on the pedal arn't "riding" the clutch any more.. they have 
to depress it a lot further to actually disengage ...
