Thanks, I think that is what I was looking for. 

 

I recently repaired my horn wire, and while doing it- noticed that the
steering coupler was also bad. I replaced that as well. It was a tough job,
as I could not open things up as much as I wanted-my steering wheel was
stuck on, so access was limited.

 

I have since gotten a steering wheel puller. If I go back into this area of
my bus, I will pull the steering wheel, and really open up that area.  I
know that the spacer was in rough condition, and may need to be replaced as
well, so I like to get the parts in advance, and put them aside for when I
am doing it, instead of opening it up, then spending a week trying to find
the part and get it shipped to me.
