Hi Chris,
           Thanks for the tip on the waxed paper.  My mom used to use it for
"gaskets" on corks and bottles.  never thought about it since then.  Good
idea.

The battery sulfation/sulphation issues are worst in seldom used batteries. 
Daily drivers don't have that problem.  Their problem is under/overcharging. 
Equally as bad, but in the opposite direction.  If you want to improve/solve
that problem get an external, 3-stage, temperature-compensated, voltage
regulator for your alternator

For those that have very large 12vdc current demands, these folks may have
some options for you.

Vietnam era helicopter batteries were probably early NiCad's, somewhat
overbuilt as they hadn't learned how to make them to the ragged edge yet.  May
still be working if exceptionally well maintained. 
Phone/cell/signal(railroad) solar system use very heavy-duty, long-life, 2v
AGM cells.  With good electronics, and good care and feeding, they last nearly
indefinitely eg 20 to 50 years.  I have personally seen ex-submarine,
water-cooled, flooded lead acid cells re-used in solar thermal power systems.
Last forever in that application.  Perhaps thats more than you need for your
van but I bet it would start every time :)

What does this extra level of maintenance get me? I'm already getting
six years out of daily driver batteries. Not jerking your chain, just
honestly curious.

I'd love to hear back that these things would extend my battery
lifespans to ten years or something like that.

I've heard from the EV crowd (electric vehicle and electric bicycle)
that not all batteries are created equal. Some insist that the Optima
yellow top batteries were derated several years back so that they wear
out quicker. I also hear that someone out there is riding around on
Vietnam era helicopter batteries on their electric bike.

yeah I'd really like to have batteries that lasted and lasted and lasted.
