I assume you put that in the 3rd port on your dash pod? I have a clock in
mine, although my radio has  a clock, so I don't really need this one. Then
again I prefer an analog clock to a digital one.

 

Did you fabricate that place as well, or is that the standard blank plate?

I just had to post my recent gauge install pic. I used the blank see link.
and yes its a CHT

i cut a rough hole and used the drill press here at work and a carbide
de-bur bit to finish it to the 2/16 it needs to be.

I thought I may goto a oil pressure gauge. but I will keep the CHT
