Subject: If a tree falls ...

If a tree falls and warps the roof of your 2001 GTI, will the  
insurance company total it out, sell it back to you for salvage, and  
give you a check with which you can buy a 1982 Vanagon Westfalia?

Yes, yes, yes.

The Vanagon started life as a diesel, but got an aircooled transplant,  
so I'm back on type 2. Someday I'll transplant the 1.8L turbo from the  
GTI into it, but that's in the distant future.

It has been far, far too long a time to have been without a bus.

Name? Peregrine Fille
