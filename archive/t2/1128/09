Two recent additions to the list were:

    * A crank/solar radio from ETON, which also has a weather Cd band
      and charges cell phones.
    * LED Lantern with a crank from FreePlay
    * A large First Aid kit from REI which has fresh everything and
      snake bite and animal bite remedies as well (in CA!)
    * Second battery on relay plus a 1000 watt AC inverter for computers
      and other things.
    * Propane catalytic heater. (Mine is a Coleman but there is another
      brand which has "buddy" in the name.0
    * Amen to the cabinets.  I couldn't camp without them.  It's all there.
