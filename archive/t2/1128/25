Subject: Re: [T2] tough gauge install

I just had to post my recent gauge install pic. I used the blank see link.
and yes its a CHT
i cut a rough hole and used the drill press here at work and a carbide
de-bur bit to finish it to the 2/16 it needs to be.
I thought I may goto a oil pressure gauge. but I will keep the CHT
