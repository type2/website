HI John,
           How sad that for 50 cents, the cost of a scrap of
 aluminum, you
are willing to risk an even more damaging failure to your
 aging top.  Adding
the metal to the repair laminate will take no more 
time.  You need a backer
to get the repair matrix to stay flush with the
 original surface.  Might as
well incorporate some strengthening and 
load distribution, instead of using
cardboard.  When I repair 
fiberglass, which I do as part of my business, I
remove all laminate past the end
 of every crack.  I bet your hole is cracked
2 inches out from the rivet
 point, if you look closely.  Old glass is brittle
in general, and 
extremely prone to fatigue cracks from point loads. Just
patching the 
enlarged hole is not a satisfactory repair. 

There is no other repair than "for the long haul".  As a buddy says, "There is
nothing so permanent as a temporary repair".  Might as well do it right the
first time.

Wow, good solution for the long haul.  I think I'll probably try the
basic solution of a simpler fiberglass repair to start, and when that
fails again :), go with your reinforced solution.  I use the luggage
rack only occasionally (actually this was the first time, but now have
more camping gear, including an 80lb tent, which perhaps given your
assessment of the remaining rivets, I should stow inside the Bus).
Thanks for the tip on the urethane adhesive!
