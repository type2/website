Subject: Re: [T2] horn grounding

You have a signigicant voltage drop to the front-I,m looking for the 
writeup I read on voltage drop testing, but it sounds like you have 
either a bad ground or too much corrosion in the connections to the 
front. Usually I always test from the item in question, so first give it 
  a direct feed to make sure it works at all.
    Because of the drop, try grounding the horn via a bypass wire right 
to the negative terminal of your battery, bypassing the switch.  Does 
the horn sound now? If not, try feeding it a direct 12 volts from the 
battery or the big terminal on the starter. What is the voltage now with 
the bypass?. Did you clean/spin the fuse feeding the horn?
