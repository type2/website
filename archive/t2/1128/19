Subject: Re: [T2] Camping Checklist

Among the useful things I found on my almost six-month camping trip in my 
Westy was a silk sleeping bag liner.  It's warm and lightweight and except 
on very cold nights is  fine on its own.  It's easy to wash  and dries 
quickly and is very strong.  On very cold nights I put a lightweight blanket 
on top and was toasty warm.  It does help to have a warm body next to you.

Happy Busing,

John
