Subject: Bob Hoover (was Re: [T2] Friday poem from Unca Joel Walker)

A number of years ago, when Bob Hoover's "Sermons" were no longer
available for purchase, I managed to obtain a copy from a helpful
list-member.

I was floored.  The material was great: well thought out, amusing,
and included an engineer's approach to both testing and cost.

Given my general support for "Shareware" and/or the concept of 
paying people for content that they've created - even if you've
obtained it in ways that might not have been appropriate, I somehow 
managed to track down Bob's snail mail address and sent him a check 
for $15, expressing my thanks and apologizing for the way I obtained
his no-longer-in-print book.

The check was never cashed, but Bob added me to a mailing list he
had created for mods to type-1 (and other aircooled) engines.

He will be missed.

Drive on,
   Avocado Tom
