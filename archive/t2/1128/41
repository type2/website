Subject: Re: [T2] horn grounding

Thank you for the informative writeup. I messed around with it again
today and have continuity along both wires. Still I do not have a
healthy 12v at the horn, 11.4v, battery is 12.16v. I can ground the
horn to the body. I do not always get a good horn sound. Dragging the
ground wire along the head of a bolt gives chirps and occasionally the
real horn sound. If I hold the ground wire to the bolt head I get no
sound.

I believe I am back at a grounding issue. I know that this horn does
not need to be grounded but the circuit does. Is it possible for the
horn to be defective where it does not always complete the circuit?
