Subject: Door Panel Data

I had my door panel ('77 Bus) measured in a laser scanner this morning so I
can cut new ones out on a CNC router.

If others are interested in the door panel drawing I can send them a dxf,
dwg, x_t or many other file types.

Just let me know if you are interested and I will email the file.

I had been trying to figure it out with a tape measure and was really
chasing my tail, I would cut out what i thought was right on the CNC and it
would be off somehow every time, I got my companies gasket vendor to throw
it on their laser scanner and I had an actual drawing in minutes.
