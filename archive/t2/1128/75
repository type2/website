Subject: battery desulfators

	A cobber has salvaged back to active service several 'written 
off' batteries in cars & boats with this device:
http://www.wizbangplus.com/
	This is the only device of this type that I know of.  I have 
no connection with any commerce based on them.

	Keeping lead-acid batteries in good condition assists safety, 
reliability, and the bank balance.  If this gizmo is as claimed, it 
can soon pay for itself, especially for those who have lead-acid 
accumulators not only in their bus (content 8-)) or camper which 
tends to demand more amp-hours than a car, but also in other 
applications.

	I'd be glad to hear from any who have evidence for or against 
this type of device.
