Pretty comprehensive!
Only suggestions I have:
1) Superglue for the first aid kit - works well for kids who are active or
hate bandages on them; perfect for sealing small cuts and keeping more crap
out.
2) Spices for cooking - Salt, pepper, garlic, basil, oregano, cayenne - the
bare essentials at least!
