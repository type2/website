works much better if you have a canoe on the roof to give you a little 
more headroom.  my poles are a couple telescoping PVC pipes.
   I long ago gave up on "fancy" camping and go bare bones most of the 
time.   gotta have my big fancy air mattress but that gets a sleeping bag 
over it.
   breakfast is often just some pastry (little debbie lasts forever) lunch 
is out of a can or prepackaged and dinner is often the trucker "Heater 
meals" that heat themselves up.   (get at truck stops)  can almost always 
"Borrow" enough hot water for coffee. if not well there is always Mountain 
dew for the caffine fix.   can't remember  the last time I took a cooler 
or fired up the stove...... more time to admire everyone elses ride...

I watch Greg and the gang from Canada and setting up camp for those guys 
reminds me of when I was in the army and set up camp.... by the numbers 
but a "LOT" of numbers....  the nice thing is everyone does it thier way 
and these old buses just go along with it...

probably why I like the ride and the riders...
