Subject: Re: Repairing the roof rack

If you want to do skookum repair job, bond a 3 inch square of sheet aluminum
inside the fiberglass shell instead of just repairing the laminate and
re-drilling the hole.  As you found out, fiberglass does not like point
loads.  Spreading the load out with some 1/8" sheet metal will make any
riveted/bolted connection to a thin fiberglass laminate much more durable. 
Rough up the metal with 60 grit, clean it very well (MEK or alcohol) and
incorporate it as part of your repair lamination.  If you want to do something
preemptively on the other riveted joints, and did not want to get into
fiberglass chemistry, you could use one of the urethane adhesives to bond a
metal backer.  I use 3M 5200, available at any marine dealer, which is made
for this application (amongst many other uses). It is easy to use, very
strong, and has a long successful track record.  There are other structural
adhesives used by the pros in the bodywork industry that are at least
 as good, or possibly better.  If you broke one riveted joint, chances are the
others are close to failure.  The damage was likely done with long time
overloading of the rack, and road shocks, rather than one time extra force. 
YMMV.
