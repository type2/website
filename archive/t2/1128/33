Subject: upcoming 25th BNNTA camping weekend...

"Buses Nowhere Near The Arch #25 (B.N.N.T.A.)

when:  Friday September 3rd thru Monday September 6th, 2010

where:   the entire "group" campground at the Indian Creek Recreational Area,
located right on huge Mark Twain Lake, which is about 30 miles west of
Hannibal, Missouri.

Any and all VW's are welcome to enjoy this BNNTA family-oriented camping
event. Featuring VW camping on a 22 mile long lake, an informal VW Bus show, a
fun and highly competitive best individual and best group campsite decoration
contest, a scenic countryside caravan on Saturday over to discover the sights
of historic Hannibal, MO (the childhood hometown right on the Mississsippi
River of Samuel Clemens, a.k.a. "Mark Twain"), Bus show awards and door
prizes, campfire activities, slow drags, etc.  Lakeside campground, so bring
your watertoys (canoes, kayaks, etc.).  BNNTA is held in a beautiful Corp of
Engineers built/managed campground with very nice facilities, clean bathrooms
and nice shower facilities, a playground and a huge covered pavilion for our
sole use.  We restrict access to the campground to only VWs, so you won't wake
up in the morning staring at the side of a motorhome, just the beautiful sight
of VWs of all types sprawling off into the distance!  The "total"
event/camping fee for each VW for the entire four day weekend is only $30.
Yep!  A total of only $30!  You can check out our simple web site for more
details and info:   http://www.bnnta.com

25th BNNTA event T-shirts will be available this year.  Also, there will be
coverage of the event in a future issue of Hot VWs magazine...

We hope to see some of you soon for all the festivities.  Please drive safely
and enjoy the ride!
