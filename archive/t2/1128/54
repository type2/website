The heat from the welder will cause the metal to resemble bacon and "oil-can".
It will also blow a hole through the metal if you stay in the same area for
more than 2 seconds (literally). What I have learned to do is move around. Put
a tack weld here and there. If you are only working in a small area, put a
couple of tac welds down and wait for the metal to cool before continuing.
Eventually, you will fill the entire area that needs to be welded.
 
TIG welding may allow you to put in small beads of weld, but you still have to
be aware of the heat you are generating. I have a MIG welder, because that is
all I can afford. If you use Ar/CO2 gas with it instead of trying the flux
core wire, it will shave a lot of time off your job and make it more
enjoyable. I just bought a Ar/Co2 cylinder for mine and I am happy with it.
 
I have made the mistake of getting the metal too hot on many occasions
(including this bus). I had this problem when I overheated the metal
of the sliding door on my old bus when I replaced the bottom 4 inches of it. 
I spent hours and hours chasing an oil-canny area around the roof of my old
bus when I was trying to fix some dents up there. It isn't fun. Of course,
those dents were caused by people walking on the roof. ;) Anyhow, I will stop
rambling.

I didn't know that! Is that because a MIG is not capable of laying
down a bead, or because the heat will deform sheet metal?
