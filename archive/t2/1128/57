Hi John,
 
I am glad you were able to fix yours without a bunch of cutting and welding.
Mine had multiple problems. The hinges holes in them where the torsion bars go
through. On mine, these holes were worn into an oval shape. One of the pins
had also been replaced with a small bolt. I think the torsion bars were also
weak. Besides that, when the hatch was closed. the hatch stuck out
about 3/4-1" making it leak. It was a mess. I wish mine was an easy fix. Wish
me luck!
 
Thanks,
David Kelly

David, perhaps the '68 is different, but I know the '78 Champagne westy I once
had, had one hinge was broken and I replaced it in the bus, some little
bushing had disintegrated, etc.  But I only have a truck here at the moment so
I don't know now days.  YMMV on year.--- John Anderson
