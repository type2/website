 gotta have my big fancy air mattress but that gets a sleeping bag over it.
  breakfast is often just some pastry (little debbie lasts forever) lunch is
 out of a can or prepackaged and dinner is often the trucker "Heater meals"
 that heat themselves up.   (get at truck stops)  can almost always "Borrow"
 enough hot water for coffee. if not well there is always Mountain dew for
 the caffine fix.   can't remember  the last time I took a cooler or fired up
 the stove...... more time to admire everyone elses ride...

> I watch Greg and the gang from Canada and setting up camp for those guys
 reminds me of when I was in the army and set up camp.... by the numbers but
 a "LOT" of numbers....  the nice thing is everyone does it thier way and
 these old buses just go along with it...
