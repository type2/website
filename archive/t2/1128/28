If you are not going to use the clips, then you may need to drill new holes in
order to use a small sheet metal screw.  Another idea may be to look for screw
inserts or what some places call "hidden nuts".  The inserts would go into
existing holes and are threaded for a screw (kind of like those sheet rock
plugs you buy to hang pictures and stuff on your walls at home.  Go to your
local hardware store and be prepared to just spend some time looking around
with your imagination.

Peace,

Michael in Montevallo
