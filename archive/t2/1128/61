Subject: re:Door panel attachment

I remember going through this with my '65. I didn't like the pop rivet type
things, and wanted to screw my panels in. I ended up using plastic wall
anchors. IT was ok, but not great. 

Later on I found an insert that appeared to be a rubber type thing with a
metal threaded center. I believe you could get one that would squeeze into
the existing holes, then when you put a screw into it, it squeezes the
piece, causing the rubber to expand and grab the metal. I thought this would
work, but didn't get them. I figured when I was ready, I should be able to
find them again.now I forget what they are called.

If I find them, I'll let you know. It may be something to look for.
