I bought some "vector" (now black and decker) battery charger from Pep 
Boys and it does battery conditioning (probably similar to this device) 
and also equalization (charging with a high voltage).  I checked with 
Interstate and they recommend to do this once or twice a year to keep 
the battery in top shape.
