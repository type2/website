Hello all!  My name is David and it has been a few years since i've been on
the list.  Hope all is well.
 
I am currently tearing down a rebuild by other, and have noticed numerous
errors ( I think), but am mostly concerned with the piston skirts.  
 
This is CB case with 2.0L piston/cylinders and 1.8L heads, dual carb motor.
 
The front skirt (front of bus) of the piston appears to have been "hitting"
the cast bump of the case.  Has anyone seen this before on a new rebuild that
has been nothing but trouble.
 
Any advise would be appreciated.
Thanks in advance.
