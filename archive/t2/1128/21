Subject: Door Panel Attachment

I am going to cut out my own door panels for my '77 bus and install an
InWall TMM style speaker vertically along the front edge of the door.

The speakers will be like this
http://www.triadspeakers.com/products/iwm4lcr.html but I am moving the
tweeter to the top and putting the woofers together underneath the tweeter
because of the listening position.

My real question is about the attachment of the new door panel.  I don't
want to use clips, I want the panel screwed down tight to create a tight
seal and to make the whole door more rigid and to cut down on noise coming
through the door.  I am going to cover the inside of the panel (and speaker)
with an adhesive backed rubber used for casing windows in commercial
buildings.  It should act as a seal, sound barrier, and keep the new panel
and speaker from getting damp.

I have thought about using the existing holes and finding an insert that
would work well in the existing holes, do they make something that goes in a
round sheet metal hole that still works well?

I have thought about drilling new holes between the existing ones and
attaching the panel with sheet metal screws.

I know there are rivet type inserts, can someone recommend that direction?
 Do they require a different type of rivet gun?
