Our very own Type2.com library has an article on battery equalization,
though it is in the section on deep-cycle batteries:

"Although routinely overlooked in battery manufacturers' literature and
 in many reference, most deep-cycle batteries (with the excpetion of the
 gel-cell and other sealed varieties) are benefited by a periodic
 controlled overcharge, which is often referred to as an equalization
 charge mode.  To equalize a battery, the charging is allowed to continue
 well after the point at which the battery is normally considered to be
 "full", taking care to avoid excessive battery heating or electrolyte
 boil-off.

 In a typical equalization cycle, the battery voltage is allowed to rise
 to approximately 16 volts, where it is maintained for up to eight hours
 by adjustment of the charging current.  This process helps to mix up the
 electrolyte, which otherwise tends to "stratify" (i.e., separate into
 overlappying layers of acid and water), and is also useful in removing
 some sulfate deposits.  When performed properly, equalization doesn't
 make the battery boil over, but does produce fairly vigorous bubbling.
 At the end of this cycle, you can expect to add some water.

 Most battery manufacturers consider one equalization charge per month
 to be appropriate for batteries that are in a continuous state of charge
 and discharge;  less often is adequate for batteries that see a lot of
 standby service.  Due to the generation of considerable gas that
 accompanies this process, equalization shoud NEVER be performed on a
 sealed or gel-cell battery."

Google also turns up several articles like this one, which also
specifies deep-cycle batteries only:
