Subject: Castle nuts on the rear wheels

Good morning all,

I'm almost done stripping the donor bus down. I want to remove the rear
suspension, but in order to do that I have to disconnect the Ebrake cables.
The largest socket I own is for the castle nuts on the bug. I looked in
Bentley, but I couldn't find the size I need for these castle nuts. Does
anyone know what size I need?

Thanks in advance.

Bob
