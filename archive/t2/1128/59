Spent an hour at the local Home Depot.  According to the resident 
expert, most of the fasteners rely on a 1/2" wall width.  Toggle bolts 
are darned expensive.

Given the thinness of the metal wall, the best solution seems to be a 
grey plastic "triple grip" anchor made by Cobra.  Make sure you buy the 
grey one made for a #8 screw.

Tried it on my baywindow and it works beautifully.  Only issue is that 
when you drive a screw in, the anchor wants to spin around in the 
hole--easily fixable with a dab of hot glue or epoxy.
