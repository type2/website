What does this extra level of maintenance get me? I'm already getting 
six years out of daily driver batteries. Not jerking your chain, just 
honestly curious.

I'd love to hear back that these things would extend my battery 
lifespans to ten years or something like that.

I've heard from the EV crowd (electric vehicle and electric bicycle) 
that not all batteries are created equal. Some insist that the Optima 
yellow top batteries were derated several years back so that they wear 
out quicker. I also hear that someone out there is riding around on 
Vietnam era helicopter batteries on their electric bike.

yeah I'd really like to have batteries that lasted and lasted and lasted.
