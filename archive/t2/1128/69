Look through McMaster-Carr or MSC Industrial Supply.

Hundreds of ideas and their whole catalogs are online.

You can even gather the lingo from the online catalog and then go to a 
local industrial supplier (yellow pages) and ask by name for what you want.

I've been known to take my laptop or Nokia N810 and show the local guys 
a PDF of the catalog page that contains what I want.
