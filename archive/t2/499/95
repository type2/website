I retract anything bad I thought I should have said about you Tony--

I thought you were laying on me that this guy Ernie Marrs sang the song

Turns out this wild man wrote the first rendition of it--and ole Paul
did sing another version in the movie--

Whew--
I was almost crushed--:>)

Here's another good traveling tune for Busland----


Take Care--
