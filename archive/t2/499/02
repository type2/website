it's usually not a electrical short that causes problems like this.
Not to say it can't happen, but not usual. Do you have a dwell meter?
if so set the dwell to 50 degrees then watch it. It should remain
pretty solid. if it moves (especially when the timing changes) it's
likely something w/ the points. This could be not tight enough, worn
distributor or other things. 

are there some other reasons you question the electrical system or is
the messed up timing the problem?

My advice is just to dive in. it will all sort it self out. and it's
never junk :)
