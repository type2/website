that's what I thought!!  It just seemed that in other replies to my TDC 
question earlier, people were saying that you could just put #1 at TDC 
and install the distributor drive shaft.  That's just not right because 
it leaves a 50-50 chance that you'll get it installed correctly with 
respect to the cam timing.
