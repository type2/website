Subject: Bus Cooling Tin Buy List Derby

My 71 bus - the Wonderbus -- is missing vital cooling parts.

I have clambered around the installed engine as best I can, and taken 
such pictures as I could. My goal is to identify all missing parts, 
including mounting hardware, and order whole shebang, so that when I 
pull the engine, everything I need will be on hand. This bus is used to 
ferry the kids to school, so minimum downtime is required.

If anyone wants to offer a suggested list of parts it looks like I will 
need, gaze upon the (pretty terrible) photos at www.ariaaudio.com/VW.htm 
and help Rocket J Squirrel figure out what parts to order!

Many thank!

Mike Rocket J Squirrel Elliott
