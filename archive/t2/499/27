Subject: Re: [T2] Towing a bus

Hi Steve,

I would suggest you forget about a two bar, and use a dolly or a full 
trailer instead. Tow bars are a PITA, and uhaul rents dollies for 
cheap. Hint: rent the dolly locally, and tow it to the bus. Getting to 
your destination to suddenly discover that the Dolly they reserved for 
you is broken or unavailable is not good. Uhaul is cheap and 
ubiquitous, but they have a very unreliable reservation system. And IMO 
the one-way rental upcharge is not worth it.

I towed my pre-conversion westfakia 700 miles on a U-Haul dolly behind 
a Ford Tempo and had no problems. Dad used the same Tempo to haul his 
Vanagon home from WV. It helps a lot when the tempo has a 3L V6 and a 
5-speed stick though. If your Volvo is an automatic then be sure to get 
a tranny cooler installed.
