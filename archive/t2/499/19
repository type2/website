Subject: Towing a bus

Hey guys,

I need a sanity check.
I want to two my bus about 800 mi.

I plan to strip it down, drive train, interior, windows, boat top.
Can I use my Volvo 850 Turbo Wagon and a tow bar to do this? 
The Volvo can tow about 3600lb, I think??

If this is just nuts I need to start looking for an alternate vehicle.

Thanks
