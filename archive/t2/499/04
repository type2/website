Subject: It's been a while, but a few ?'s

It's been quite a while since I've been on here, on a
count of my accident and wrecking my bus.  I'm slowly
getting back into it, scrounging up enough money to
get a new one and looking up on the best ones to buy. 
I was wondering if anyone in the new jersey east
coastish area knew of anyone that is selling a bus or
are selling a bus themselves.  Any help would be
greatly appreciated.
