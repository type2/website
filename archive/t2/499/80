Subject: Re: [T2] friday topic   new bussing song compilation

The ID3 tag on the mp3 file says JB Ritter

Quick google search (well, not so quick -- lots of hits on a Doctor Ritter
and on John Ritter the [late] actor) brought the link below, which goes
nowhere because mp3.com has gone away (sort of) but suggests the artist is
from Talahassee. May be more links out there but that will take some
serious refinement of the google search criteria.
