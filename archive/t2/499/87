Ok--"Riding on the Dashboard of my car--Doin' 80 I ain't scarey long as
I got the Virgin Mary"----
Tell me who sang that song Jim--

One of my goofy sister's--( can you believe their goofy--??) for
Christmas gave me a spring loaded Jesus--and he's on the dash of my new
found 89 Carat.

I looked at her when I opened the box--with the like "why me" kinda
look.

She say's--your always singing that song--I think--"Oh Boy-"-

The whole house was up for grabs--the whole family was waiting for my
response--
I just shook my head and laughed too--

I'll have to get a picture of this one posted--

Later,

TK
