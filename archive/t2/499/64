1. You can probably still get 120 minute casettes at Radio Shack -- but
they were always known for a short lifespan - tape had to be thinner to fit
the same reel size as shorter tapes.

2. You can get one back with the hubcap by mailing a copy to anyone in
Havasu before next weekend. Keeping it there ... depends on who carries the
puck. Driving a bus does not guarantee honesty and probably DOEs guarantee
some degree of "absent mindedness" (ever got to where you were going and
just sort of forgot to get out of the bus for an hour or two -- just
sitting there "feeling" the peace?) The original is probably in the "Play"
side of someones duplicating boom box where they put it before going on the
hunt for a long tape.

3. CD's hold 80 minutes of audio.

4. Burn two CD's -- continuing the them you started with the two sides of
the tape -- 80 minutes of acoustic and 80 minutes of electric

5. Drop an MP3 cd in there as well -- 10 hours worth (roughly) of mp3 files
saved at 128bit.
