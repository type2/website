Sausalito Summer Night by Diesel


We left for Frisco in your Rambler
The radiator running dry
I4ve never been much of a gambler
and had a preference to fly

You said "forget about the airline,
let4s take the car and save the fare."
We blew a gasket on the Grapevine
and eighty dollars on repairs

(chorus)
All aboard (Sausalito summernight)
All aboard (Sausalito summernight)
All aboard (Sausalito summernight)
All aboard

Hot summer night in Sausalito
Can4t stand the heat another mile
Let4s drop a quarter in the meter
and hit the sidewalk for a while

I4ll have a burger and a root beer
You feed the heap some of the grape
A shot of premium to boot, dear
We4ll get across the Golden Gate

(chorus)
All aboard (Sausalito summernight)
All aboard (Sausalito summernight)
All aboard (Sausalito summernight)
All aboard

Cashin4 all my checks
?Straightenin4 out my bank?
Spend it on a Rambler
with a wormhole in the tank

Look out over here
Watch out over there
Can4t afford a blowout
4cause we haven4t got a spare

(chorus)
All aboard (Sausalito summernight)
All aboard (Sausalito summernight)
All aboard (Sausalito summernight)
All aboard
