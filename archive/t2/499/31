Hi Bob,

On December 16th, it was reported to be in the hands of Buskatier Mike 
Hancock. He posted the following pics to the Buskatier list:

Word from Mike is that it will be appearing at Havasu... It's been 
making its own way from bus to bus undirected for a couple years now. 
I'd love to see the entries in the logbook, it was a fun read back in 
2000 when I had it.

Happy trails,
