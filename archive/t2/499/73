Subject: RE: [T2] friday topic   new bussing song compilation

What about the Burnt Bus Blues - Artist Unknown?  

I don't remember where I found this song, but if you haven't heard it then
you can download/listen to it at www.tedsgarage.com.  Hopefully none of us
will ever have to sing this song!

Apology to the copyright owner for posting it on my site as it is relevant
to the conversation topic.

Does anyone out there know who wrote this?
