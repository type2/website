Subject: Rattly Lifter!!! VERY MAD!!

Ok, I'm a bit frustrated here. My Bus NORMALLY never gives me an attitude. Normally when I start my Bus, it rattles for a split second while it builds up oil pressure. However, the last time I started it, I noticed a rattle on one of the lifters that didn't go away. So I drive the Bus about a mile hoping that the lifter would pump up, but still no, it STILL rattles.

I have hydraulic lifters, 1800cc motor, in a 1973 Bus Type2.

WHAT, oh what can I do to make this lifter stop rattling????

Please help, it's killing me, and my Bus.


Thanks!

Todd
