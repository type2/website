Crosby, Stills, Nash (and the other guy) :-)
--------Deja Vu

LONG MAY YOU RUN 
---------------- 
 We've been through some things together 
With trunks of memories still to come 
We found things to do in stormy weather 
Long may you run. 

FOREVER YOUNG
---------------
May you build a ladder to the stars
And climb on every rung,
May you stay forever young,
Forever young, forever young,
May you stay forever young.
