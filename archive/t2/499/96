Subject: Friday Topic What I learned about driving in Snow!

Hi All,

It's been a colder Winter than the last few since I
bought my first Bus 3 years ago.  I bravely decided to
try my hand at ski instuction this year in the
Mountains near Seattle. At 2000 feet they aren't the
Rockies but the snow is heavy and wet.  My first time
was good: Sunny sky's and fun. The Bus handles GREAT
ON snow. But I soon discovered DO NOT drive an
unheated (noheat will survive getting to that cab in
20?F.) Bus IN a snow storm. I headed up to the pass
one morning and the snow not only hit my windshield
but began to freeze and stick to it! Not good. Sheet
ice was forming. Yikes! 

Well, not only is ski instuction off for this year:
I've added some new things to my Bus TO DO list: Buy
one of these plug in window defrosters I found on JC
Whitney, add a Cig lighter to plug the defroster into
(does anyone know if these realy work??), put in some
MORE insulation in the front, not to mention boosting
and insulting the heating system. I'm an avid skier so
these are now must do's.  

Yes, VW type 2's are great on snow, but not in snow,
that is if you like seeing out the front window!!!
