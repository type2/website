Subject: Re: [T2] Towing a bus

The towing capacity of a 1996 850 Turbo Wagon is 3300lbs.  The curb wight 
of a 1968 bus (standard) is 2723lbs.

Are you going to be towing on flat terrain or are there 
hills/mountains?  The Volvo should have enough power to tow the bus, but 
the wheelbase is short for a tow vehicle.  If you have fwd, that is also a 
negative, awd would be preferred.  And the big issue is brakes, but the 
stripped out bus shouldn't weight too much.  If you have an automatic 
transmission a transmission fluid cooler would be good.

I once towed a TR-6 with a 1986 GTI from South Carolina to NY.  This 
certainly was not a recommended thing to do, but it shows what can be 
done.  And in Europe they tow with cars we would never considering towing 
with in the US.  For a one-time trip you should be able to do it.
