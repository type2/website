However, the last time I started it, I noticed a rattle on one of the lifters that didn't go away. So I drive the Bus about a mile hoping that the lifter would pump up, but still no, it STILL rattles.

Give it some time with gentle driving. It may take 10-15 minutes. I don't know the history of your bus that well, but when I've had a stuck lifter from the bus sitting a long time it's taken up to 30 minutes for the lifter to pump up while idling.

If I had more work space I would probably bleed any lifter in this condition rather than let the parts make all that noise.
