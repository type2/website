Hi Dave,

I'm now looking at a short as a possible cause because
I've replaced the points 3 times last month (gaped and
timed one a week or so), replaced the spark plugs and
wires 2 times in the last month (just forked out big $
for Bosch pug wires) and STILL a missfire. I'm pulling
my hair out. So, I'm down to the wiring as my next
possible cause. I forgot to mention in my first post
(did in a reply) that I DO have a serious short
somewhere in my turn signals and head light wiring. So
strange fact that when the headlights are on and the
engine is running, If I turn off the ignition and pull
the key out my Rudy Bus still keeps going (engine
still runs)! So if it's causing the missfire I don't
know. But I gotta stop the 'headlight hotwiring' thing
that's going on. How very strange! Has anyone ever had
THIS happen? With headlights on and engine still runs
without the key??
