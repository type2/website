Some 4-stroke engines do fire the plugs every revolution, "wasting" every
other firing to simplify the ignition system.  It allows the ignition to
be attached directly to the crankshaft instead of having its speed cut by
half in the cam or distributor.  Most engines that do this are in
motorcycles.

However, most engines that have distributors fire their plugs once every
two revolutions.
