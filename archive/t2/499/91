Subject: Re: [T2] Electrical Short

After this explaination of whats what--I'd be checking out my ignition
switch--

Any time for soe wild reason --( years ago) when, and if I hot wired any
vehicle--the points would always fry--fast--

Sounds like the points are always getting juice--regardless if the
switch is on or off---which will burn them--

Hi Dave, 
I'm now looking at a short as a possible cause because I've replaced the
points 3 times last month (gaped and timed one a week or so), replaced
the spark plugs and wires 2 times in the last month (just forked out big
$ for Bosch pug wires) and STILL a missfire. I'm pulling my hair out.
So, I'm down to the wiring as my next possible cause. I forgot to
mention in my first post (did in a reply) that I DO have a serious short
somewhere in my turn signals and head light wiring. So strange fact that
when the headlights are on and the engine is running, If I turn off the
ignition and pull the key out my Rudy Bus still keeps going (engine
still runs)! So if it's causing the missfire I don't know. But I gotta
stop the 'headlight hotwiring' thing that's going on. How very strange!
Has anyone ever had THIS happen? With headlights on and engine still
runs without the key??
