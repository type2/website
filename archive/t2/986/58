Subject: front seal

HI,

There seems to be very little room to get the fan off the front of the engine 
at the back door so I can replace a badly leaking seal, so much so that my bus 
is undrivable.

I can't seem to get the fan off to start with.

Is smacking it with a rubber mallet OK? 

Or is there conventional wisdom out there.

I already understand how to remove the three pointed holder on the shaft with 
I think 3 pieces of metel or what ever.

So, how do I get the fan off.

Alan
