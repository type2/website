That is a good point Bob.. some heads have the step cast into them,, some 
don't and should... so you need to install the shims between the head and 
the barrel.. 

I guess that is something that should be measured along with all the other 
dimensions ,,, before assembly.. 

the heads I was working on had the step cast into them,, and didn't need the 
shims,, so installing the shims would have lowered the compression ,,, 
especially that I would have required 2+ of the 1mm shims,, 

One head had genuine Vw head numbers in the casting,, unknow how many 
rebuilds on it.. and the other head had T.A.E cast into the rocker box ,
