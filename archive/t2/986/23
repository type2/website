Subject: Re: [T2] Did a Bay Really Have to Die?

Someone was making fiberglass bay replicas in the past.  There was one 
inside the local mall.  It looked pretty good from a few feet away, but 
when you got close you can tell it was a copy.  They were selling 
shirts or jewelry or something like that out of it.
