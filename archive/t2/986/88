I just did mine last night on my '77.  I removed the oil fill tube top (the
plastic part), the tin and oil fill tube.  Wiggled the boot on both the
dipstick tube and the fill tube and reassembled everything.

Hey all,

I found an oil leak on my '76 Westy (there may be more). The dipstick boot
is torn. What is the best way the replace this?
