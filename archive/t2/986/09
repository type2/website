Subject: RE: [T2] I killed the hot dog bay.

The hot dog guy specifically wanted a bus that was basically on the way to the
crusher. Do I feel bad about what I did to this bus or that I can go across
town and buy a hot dog out of it? Hell no. I see it as recycling, this bus
will continue to live on unlike so many that are crushed and turned into dildo
motors.

I sold this bus to the guy knowing what he was going to do. I bought this 71
Basketcase for $175 bucks, very rusted underneath. Sat for years and year -
electrical ripped out. No title.  Both the engine and transmission were
rebuilt and are running in my Westy (drive it everyday). Other things like the
fuel tank were cleaned up as well. 8 CV joints out of the two buses yielded 4
good ones. Glass, interior parts, random mechanical parts and even things like
screws that were missing are now in/on my bus.

I had to move suddently and no longer had room for the bus. The hot dog guy
randomly came up to my house as he spotted my Westy looking for a bus exactly
like what I had.

And sure someone with a welder and loads of time and cash could have saved it
but those buses are really common and few people want to save bays like that.
And sure I could have had my bus down for a long period of time and shelled
out alot more cash for parts but I'm cheap that way.

Peter, how many rusted out basket case buses have you saved and are now
driving today? If you need some more I know of probably 6 within 50 miles of
my house that are perfect for you.
