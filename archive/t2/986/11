Subject: RE: [T2] I killed the hot dog bay.

Ah, to think what Bernini could have done with a Bay!  Gotta get me one of those hot dogs.  Been meaning to plan a road trip to the Gerst Haus in Nashville.  The oyster rolls are heavenly.  If somebody wants to join me, let me know and we'll hook up.  And a hot dog on the way out of town!  Cheers...KR


Whether it be folk art, high art or advertising or something not yet
discovered; taking these buses and extending their life is a honorable thing
- In My Opinion.
