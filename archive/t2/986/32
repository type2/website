Including the big connection on the solenoid that supplies power to 
the front (which is then fed back to the coil, etc)? This is a bit of 
a linchpin in the electrical system and tends to pick up a fair 
amount of road grime.

starter fluid).

Sounds like the connection I referred to above or the ignition switch.
