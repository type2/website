Subject: Who was Tie-dyed seller at Everybus?

Since they had VW related shirts (Grateful Dead with busses), it's sort 
of a Fri topic- my daughter has a friend who wants a tie/dyed item 
(pants) she got at Everybus this or last year.  It it the same outfit 
that has a http://www.tie-dyed.com site?  We will be at West River 
Westies and High Country BF.
