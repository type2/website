Had to rescue nephew and his hotrod 55 Ford 1/2 ton the other night after it
quit. Next day inspection, coil oil had been blown over the motor, coil wire
out put nose cone, had been blown askew to one side, dizzy was loose, and no
ballast resistor with points dizzy.  Did the lack of ballast resistor, aloow
coil to explode?  Huge yard long flame out of exhaust ports just before it
died.  Any comments?  Thanks.
VW content:  We have this type of ignition.
