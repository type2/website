   Not to mention that the Chinese company used the "FTS" in the identi-
fication numbers of tires that FTS may or may not have brokered...
   I hate to say it, but this is "globalization' perhaps not at its worst,
but
up there...
   FTS will probably disappear...The Chinese factory will sell tires thru'
an-
other broker with new names and just maybe they'll add the adhesive strips
(at least for a while) and the consumers will either replace their own tires
or
wait for the next blowout... ;-(
