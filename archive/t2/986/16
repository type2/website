Mike,

West Coast Metric is right next to the 405 and 110. Pretty close.

WCM http://www.westcoastmetric.com/directions.php

Wolfsburg West is further, but in your "neck-of-the-woods".

Wolfsburg West
2850 Palisades Dr.

Hey Everyone,
Does anyone know where I can get one?  My steering coupler just decided 
to shred itself and it's the 4th tomorrow and I can't drive :( :(

Anyone know where I can find one today?!

THANKS!
