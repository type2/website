Subject: Bumper replacement and windshield update

Since it was brought up I thought I might update on whats shaking.

You may remember I was getting my windshield sill fixed up and I am
glad I took it to a body shop. They broke the windshield but Im ok with
that since it was stuck in there good. They sandblasted the sill, fixed
8 holes I didn't even know where there, fixed the sill lip / pressweld
and even eruathaned the rubber on the inside of the gas cap tube
for me (it was wearing).  Add a new windshield and a nice new
paintjob it cost me $523.00 canadian. $123 over quote which included
the windshield cost added.. pretty good deal.  The nice paint job
makes me want the rest of the bus done.

The bumper is looking good, not quite finished since it has to only
be functional by friday for the trip. But looks really good. Reciever
and such.. If you want I can take a picture sometime in the future
for the nonbelievers.

James

Hi Terry,

The back bumper is also very handy when a tree runs out in front of
you as you're backing into a campsite....
