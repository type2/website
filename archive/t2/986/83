Subject: Re: [T2] Paper gasket alternate for FI intake at heads

I have had good luck with Black Permatex High Temp..  Probably the same as 
the Red RTV.
A thin coat on the blocks and no leaks..   Just has to be high temp stuff.
As long as the block, intakes and spacers are not scored..

Good luck.
