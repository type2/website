Subject: Engine cooling air

While cleaning and replacing FI parts and sealing up my
engine department, I was surprised how much air came
up through the spark plug holes in the tin...even with
seals. I just replaced mine today. The old ones were
almost brittle and fell apart.

To check yours, start your engine cold and stick your
hand down through the mass of wires and hoses above the tin.
You can feel cool air coming up through any openings.
The majority of the air in my compartment was coming from
the spark plug seals.

I'm considering using aluminum tape to tape down the
spark plug seals.
