Are you talking about the seat floating,, or valve float ? 

as in.. the seat is loose,, but still retained in the cavity in the head,, 
therefore the compression reading may fool you .. as it does seat 
statically...  but when you warm up the engine the "floating " seat causes 
the engine to run odd. 

or.. over reving the engine to the point the lifter goes up and down faster 
than the valve does... 

I took it to mean the seat was not secure in the head
