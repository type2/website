Subject: Fwd: Starting problems with 78 2L FI

Hey all,

Sent the note below last week. Got back up to the bus the other day and
changed out the pertronix to the points. No start. We then tested the coil,
and found pretty large resistance readings which were out of the normal with
the Bentley manual. We changed out the coil today, and it wouldn't start. We
found low voltage from the reverse light feed (I think that's what its for).
Cleaned all contacts, and still couldn't get consistent readings, or
consistent spark. As for spark, mostly it would spark on initial starting,
but no more, and then again once I let the key off. We cleaned contacts on
that and replaced some of the connectors, but still no consistent spark or
voltage at coil. We then took a direct line off of the battery to the coil,
and we were able to achieve consistent spark and get her to fire over (with
starter fluid). I drew some gas out, and it does smell a bit like varnish,
but I had put stabilizer in before I put her away. My plan is to drain the
remainder of the fuel and replace with fresh, but I'm wondering if anyone
can see an holes in my logic, maybe something I'm missing.
Thanks,

Ned

Hi all,

I have a 78 with a 2.0L FI engine with Pertronix ignition. This has about
10k on it since a rebuild by Boston Bob. Normally, she runs beautifully. I
put her into storage last year, and it was running fine. When I went to take
her out, she wouldn't fire. I pulled the air cleaner and made sure the AFM
flap was free and was activating the fuel pump. I used starting fluid, and I
got no response, except for twice when she backfired and blew the AFM off. I
looked for any egregious vac leaks, but couldn't find anything. My plan is
to  go and change the plugs and possibly the coil. I may also try to static
time it. All vac lines are hooked up, and all electrical appears to be in
place and working.

Thoughts on what simple thing this might be, or where to start? I know the
AFM is something I swapped out a few years ago, and I think I remember
pulling off the cover and bending the armature to avoid the inconsistencies
of the groove.

Thanks in advance.

Ned
