Hi Sam,

In summer of 2000 my bus was used to film a trailer that is used for  
the VW-sponsored "Discovery Award" presented at the Toronto  
International Film Festival.

I went along with the bus for a VERY busy day of shooting and  
pocketed $350 for my troubles. Pretty good money for one day's work.  
I posted a write-up of it here:

Happy Trails,
