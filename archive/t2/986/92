    You won't make any money...The guys who make money rebuilding cars
are the guys paid to rebuild 'em. There was an outfit some years ago called
"Golden V" (IIRC) that specialized in rebuilding Beetles and selling them 
with a limited warranty...Even with the VW's low prices (then) on parts the
company folded... ;-(
