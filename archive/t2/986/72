up through the spark plug holes in the tin...even with

almost brittle and fell apart.

I had a similar experience. My seals were completely inflexible but 
not brittle.

To create a better seal with the new seals I pushed them down 
slightly on the spark plug connectors. I also read on the shoptalk 
forums that you can replace them with some obscure part from a Toyota 
Landcruiser (IIRC) that seals much better than the stock VW seals.
