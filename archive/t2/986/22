Subject: RE: [T2] Did a Bay Really Have to Die?

I don't know.  I've got the spam filters at my domains set to pass the spam
through, but to mark the subject line.  I filter it into my deleted folder
and check to see if anything important got marked inadvertently.

There are just missing posts.  Hate it when it's a post that I find
interesting...
