I went to Pull-n-save yesterday, hoping to find any busses at all.

There were 3. A 71 Westy (with a complete mustard vinyl interior in
good shape), a 79 7 passenger, and a 78 7 passenger with the BA6 that
I snagged. There was also a 70-ish squareback with full tin and fuel
injection (minus AFM), several bugs, etc.

All of the FI vehicles were minus the AFMs but little else was
missing. It was a sad sad sight. These busses were all in drivable
condition except the 71 missing an engine. The SB and wrecked the
front end. Interior was nice, etc.

I'm saddened by these vehicles being there. Folks just gave up on 'em.
