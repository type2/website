Hi Alan,

The fan sits on a tapered shaft, and can sometimes be quite difficult  
to remove.

I would be very careful here, because that bolt in the middle of the  
three is attaching the fan bracket to the crank. If IT breaks, you  
could be in a world of hurt.

My usual treatment to remove the fan is to use two claw hammers to  
pry the fan away from the bracket. I gradually work my way around the  
perimeter of the fan, and eventually it lets go. This may not be the  
official approved practice, but it has worked for me OK so far.


Happy Trails,
