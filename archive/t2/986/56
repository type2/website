This may seem counter-intuitive, but check/replace the alt belt. Check
tension, and/or install a new one if yours is old.

I know it sounds like it's coming from the other side, but it's a
cheap check. My 73 was driving me nuts with a noise I couldn't locate.
Until I installed a new belt, then it went away.
