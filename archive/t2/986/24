Yes they did, and I actually have a set of Westlake tires on my bus.  They
are sold under other brands, but the DOT numbers of all brands start with
"7D".

Don't panic if you have these tires, because it's likely that they are not
covered by the recall.

One point is that the recalled tires all have an "LT" designation in their
size.  The Westlake tires specified for our buses are designated 185R14C,
which does not have the "LT" designator.  I believe that the recalled
tires  are all in larger sizes for SUVs and Pickups.

Another point is that the DOT code ends in "02" through "05", which I
believe designates the year of manufacture.  Mine are "06" and I got a
set from the first shipment my tire store received in January of this
year.  There may be older Westlake tires out there in 185R14C, but I
doubt it.

Of course, at one time I was suspicious of an Asian off-brand called
"Hankook"... :)
