Subject: Window Seal and headliner

Much discussed topic I know.

68 Double Cab.

Q: Which comes first the headliner install or the window install? Can the
headliner be installed after the window is in?

Just trying to get my scheduling down for my project.

Also K,HUGE props to Chris and Jon at BustedBus. They spend most of this
weekend helping me get all of my windows, rubber and  trim IN. Not only is
it in, it is installed perfectly and professionally. I can't stop grinning.
Pics very soon.
