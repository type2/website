Subject: Re: how do I install a baby seat in a bus 

Hello, My son is older now. But when he was young, I was told by a policeman 
that it was illegal to have a child in the "back" of a camper.  It was however 
legal if an adult was in the back.  Has anyone else ever heard of such a 
thing?  I had to place him in the front seat when we were alone.  This could be a 
RI only issue or just some bad instruction.
