Subject: Re: [T2] Window Seal and headliner

Install the headliner first, then the window seals.  Usually the edge of the
headliner material is attached over the flange of the windshield opening on
pickups (not sure about the rear window).

On Beetles, Ghias, Notch, Square&Fastbacks, the material edge attaches to
the quarter window and rear window flange openings.
