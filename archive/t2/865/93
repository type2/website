Subject: vw restoration (fwd)

Hello,
   
  I saw your website and was wondering if you could help me out. I have a 1967 bus that needs some work. Its mostly little mechanical things that need to be fixed, but i'm having a hard time finding a person or business that can work on old VWs. Can you let me know of any businesses or people that could help me out? I live in Richmond, Virginia, but if you know anyone close to Virginia that could help that would be great.
   
  Thanks,
  Coralee
