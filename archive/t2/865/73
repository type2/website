Check Delrin too. We use it as wear surfaces on lot of the automated
equipment we custom design for customers.

On my Transvair implant I am using regular old nylon electrical conduit
for a shifter bushing. I think if it is kept clean it should last for a
long, long time. I plan on figuring out a way to add an accordian boot
so it is sealed against road debris (sand, water, grime).
