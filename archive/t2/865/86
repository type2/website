(Front Brakes tend to squeak until I punch the pedal). Can any of you 
in the area tell me which is flatter- 29 or 81, as that would affect my 
choice?

Mike, first of all, why do your front brakes squeak? Mine did the same,
after I replaced EVERYTHING, except the old crusty retaining plates that
fit in behind the pads. I finally found new retaining plates at a VW
dealer, the are the same ones as the Vanagons used. Anyway, I too, over the
years have debated the Rte. 29 vs. I-81, and I always end up taking 29.
Yeah there are a lot of lights, (Cville is the worst), but there are more
services available for unexpected events (read breakdowns). Like last year
in Lynchburg finding wheel bearings for a trailer. As for distance, I have
done both I-81 and rte.29 when heading to Greensboro on business, and it is
exactly 300 miles either way. ANd the truck traffic, as mentioned, can be a
pain. I only felt comfortable driving 81 when I had my Vanagon, as it
didn't get tossed around like a Bay. I will be heading down the rte.29 way
Thursday afternoon.     Have a safe trip!  Jeff
