Subject: Dakoto Digital CHT setup

Most of my major interior work is done on my '72 Bus and I am about to start on the A/C installation.  One of the things I wanted to add first was a CHT gauge.  I plan on using SLX-11-1.  The longest sensor wiring listed is the SEN-11-7 which is listed at 18 feet.  Will this be long enough?  Also, the ring size is listed at 1/2 inch, not the correct size needed.  Does Dakota Digital make a proper wiring set for the Bus or will I need to stretch the ring?  The archives don't really discuss this or I missed it.
