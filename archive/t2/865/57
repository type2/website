Thanks for the info.

I looked again at the new heads from BusDepot and dont know why i was
thinking they were german heads....they dont mention that these are AMC
heads...

Does any one have any experience with the new heads - or the busdepot
rebuilt heads? I want to go new, but they are REALLY expensive....at least
for our budget

I am running the stock L-jet for the engine - and i know when we first took
it to M&M's they did a full tune-up and said it was running lean they
adjusted the timing.....

Is timing the only thing that can effect the richness/leanness of an engine
with the L-jet? I am familiar with the parts and functioanlities of the FI,
but i did not know of a specific way to adjust the FI to get leaner or
richer - I do know that there are many things that can effect that (vacuum
leaks, incorrect fuel pressure etc etc) Maybe this FI stuff should move to
another thread, but what is the difference between the CA and the standard
FI?
