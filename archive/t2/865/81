29 is much flatter but is one red light after another....from NJ I would
HIGHLY recommend crossing the Del river bridge and following the RT 301
signs and going down thru Delaware and the Eastern shore of Maryland
crossing the Chesapeake Bay bridge (free south bound) and continuing to
Bowie MD turning South continuing on US 301 thru Waldorf and La Plata
(where I believe a few other bussers may be linking up for a carabus from
La Plata) over the Nice Bridge over the Potomac River into VA and on to
Bowling Green VA. at that point I would go straight turning off of 301
another 12 miles to I-95 and then South on I-95 to Petersburg VA and I-85
direct to Everybus.   I have taken that route when I go to Everybus and it
is relatively traffic free, decent services and about as flat as you can
get.  the Steepest hill may be crossing the Bay Bridge.  (if you want to
camp over night there is a really nice campground in Ft Smallwood State
Park near La Plata that is right on the Potomac River)

to give you an idea, I ski and Route US15 and I-81 are both routes I use
to get to the ski areas.   I-81 is a MAJOR TRUCK ROUTE while I like the
road it is one truck after another and I mean major truck route it is how
the truckers go North/South and avoid the tolls of the I-95 bridges and
turnpikes....

wish I were going this year but bus needs some work and I couldn't get off
of work......  envy envy envy envy, have a bowl of chili in my honor.

enjoy
Bob
