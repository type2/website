Subject: How to lower Co emissions with AFM adj?

Well, the exhaust leaks I fixed -only reason it failed last May) , but 
600 mi later now all passed except the CO emissions- 3% is allowed; it 
was 3.23.  This was I suspect due to the long line today that lets the 
bus cool down too much- in the past I'd come back for a sidebar 
reinspection- no waiting; bus was nice and hot and passed every time. 
Another reason I may have passed last time was that the exhaust leaks 
somehow can lean out the emissions from air leaking in??
    Now they did away with NJ sidebar reinspections and you gotta wait 
in line again.......so someone refresh for me how to lower the CO by 
adjusting the mix on the AFM? (I can always adjust it back after passing 
8-).  Overall it runs rich (the u pipe I replaced was pretty black 
inside) but that may be why it's still running after 246,000 mi and no 
rebuild?
