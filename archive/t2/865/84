Well, I've been looking into putting in my sound system.  I got a  deal on a couple of Blaupunkt speakers for the holes that were cut in  my doors when I got the bus.  
  
  Question:  How was the Saphire XV that is in my dash originally  wired?  Good old terminal 7 on the fuse block?  And mine  evidently never had a radio antenna.  Where was the factory one  originally mounted?  Just for grins I'm going to hook it up and  use it until I can afford the rest of my ambitious system.  But I  couldn't find anything about on Ratwell.com and the T2 archives are a  mess.  Way too much info and can't find just what I'm looking  for.  
  
  Cheers...KR
