Subject: [T2] Weber progressive jetting

    , the jetting for my weber progressive running on a 2l is as 
follows:

Primary 2ndry
Main 135 140
Idle 60 50
Air Corr 170 180


  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   
  that was sent to me awhile back...
  anyone have a good idea what the best jets would be to use on a weber 32/36 defv....1800 engine~!~ 76 transporter...and is this setup above the best so that i got something to go by?
   
  not sure my jets are right ,? not sure they are wrong but i do use alot of gas it seems.. dont know if that measn thare are to big or even if the gas consumption is coming from jets....and not something else....
   
  thanks
