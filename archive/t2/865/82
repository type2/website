down 81  to 220 OR stay on 29- I've 
done the 81 route, fairly hilly.  29 looks  like many towns, 


Hello Mike    As Bob said I81 is a major truck rt. but the  traffic flows 
pretty fast and it is normally heavy going south on Thur and north  on Sunday . 
no big hills unless you go pass Roanoke which you wont be doing. If  you do 
come that way come by as I am about 5 miles off I81 at the first salem  exit 141 
. We will be leaving on fri at noon and you are welcome to join  us.  I like 
rt 29 a lot but it does have its problems  C ville and  lunchbag  have a bunch 
of lites and there are some speed traps. If you do  Rt 220 becareful outside 
of Roanoke in Booness Mill  major speed  trap.  later  mark Dearing
