Volks,

I have just been given a Type1 engine out of a '74 autostick beetle to
put in my '67.  The engine is supposed to run but has sat for four years
and is, at present, not turning.  I put a wrench on it and moved it 1/4"
or so to see how frozen it was and it's not bad, but I intend to try to
revive it without rebuild, so I'm going slow.  I've shot some spray lube
(generic light oil) in the spark plug holes 3-4 days ago.  I was
wondering about something stronger if that does not free it up.  So let
me ask, has anyone shot PB Blaster into a cylinder and started the
engine?  Any adverse effects?

After it's turning, I intend to rotate it with the starter for a couple
minutes to lube everything before hooking up ignition and gas, then fire
it up.  This has worked in the past but I know it's a 50/50 thing.
Advice?

BTW, If all goes well, I *hope* to see all of you at EB this weekend!
