 Just thought I'd pass along a heads up to the list. 
 I went to Wally World
 today to check out the Ozark Trail 11'x8' 'Dining
 Canopy that Kevin Roberts
 talked about a few weeks ago.  It has been marked
 down to $17!  Of course, I
 picked one up.  Get them while they last.

Can you post the UPC code or stock # of it?
