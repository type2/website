Subject: Rear shift rod bushings

Hi All,

There's been some interest in these bushings.  The gist of it is that 
they replace the worn (or in my case, missing) rear shift rod bushings.  
Seems the engine and transmission must be removed to replace it, and 
that's just too much work for me, especially as I have no good reason to 
pull it at the moment. 

So I made a bushing out of HDPE that is a 2 piece deal.  No need to 
remove anything big at all to  install it. 

If I can get measurements of the inner diameter of the shift rod tube, 
and the shift rod itself, I'm not adverse to making up a half dozen or 
so and selling them for a wee bit more than I have into them.  If I end 
up with enough extra cash to buy a 6 pack of my favorite beer, I'll be 
happy. 

The catch is... I don't know how well these will wear, nor how long they 
will last.  My gut feeling says they should last quite a long time, as 
HDPE is referred to as the Poor Man's Teflon. They *should* last quite 
awhile, especially if you use a bit of good grease on 'em.  The plastic 
I'm eyeballing is a UHMW HDPE, with oil impregnation.  It's designed to 
be used for bushings.  I'm also looking at a better retention mechanisim 
than screwing it in place. 

So, if you're interested in being a guinea pig, and don't mind parting 
with a few bucks to help me pay for materials, contact me off list.  
I'll need a few people to send me measurements of the shift rod and 
shift rod tube, and tell me if their shift rod tube has the two holes at 
the end to retain the original bushing. (I'm guessing they all do, but 
I'm new to the Type 2).   Once I have a half dozen interested people, 
I'll order the plastic and start making parts. 

Personally, I like the idea of not having to yank the tranny to replace 
that bushing. 

Thanks!

Shad H.
