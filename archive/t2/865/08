Subject: 79 type 2 fuel mileage

Hi, I have a friend with a 79 type2 window van, 2L FI,
4 speed, catalitic converter. He has not had it
serviced in a while as his mechanic retired or moved.
I am trying to help out long distance, he lives in a
National Forest 30+ miles of bad road, no phone,
electricity and communications are by ham radio.

He is getting real bad mileage, 6gal=60 miles. He also
thinks his o2 sensor may be bad but will try and check
it with a voltmeter. I am planing on going up there
soon to try and fix it but I want to gain all the
insight before I go on a hundred mile trip. 

Planing on new plugs, rotor, cap, fuel filter to
start. I saw some old posts about a shielded wire from
the chassis connector to the ECU. Can someone describe
exactly where this is so I can pass the information
and he can look for a short there if the o2 sensor
shows output. 

I am also going to have him examine the vacuum lines
for cracks or leaks. Any other thoughts. 

It's been since about '78 last I worked on a VW air
cooled and never as I recall on anything injected. But
I am a ASE mechanic, just trying to help a fellow ham
and not have to take several trips to town once I get
there. 

Thanks in advance for any help/comments/tests we might
try before I go see the self proclaimed "philosopher
of the forest"
