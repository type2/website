Subject: Shoulder Seat Belts

I have a 76 Walkthrough bus and two kids (ages 4 and 5).  For now I have
the kids in a car seat belted in with the stock lap belts in the far
back seat.

It won't be long now, however, until the kids are going to be to big for
the car seat and are going to need to move into a booster.  In my new VW
Bug, of course, that is no problem (there are shoulder seat belts).

What are the suggestions out there for my bus?  What type of belts?
Best vendor?  Attaching points? Etc...

Thanks,

Michael Martin
