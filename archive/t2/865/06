 True curb feller story...

I was drivin my Bugeye one day and stopped for a light...There was a "very"
inebriated curb feller more-or-less standing at the curb. He lurched off and
circled my LBC, ending up at my door leaning on the windshield. 
"You shouldn't be drivin' this around," he said.
"Why not?"
"'Cause it's waaay too small. You get hurt drivin' this...What you want is a
Buick...That way you have an accident, it's like it's in another country!"
