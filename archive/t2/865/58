When I needed a head for a Type IV ('80 Vanagon) that we used to have, I
got it from J&J Werkstadt here in Albany. It was an AMC head, and
reasonably priced. They also had it in for me the next day.

The #3 valve seat was gone..which is a very common problem in this engine.

I replaced the head without pulling the engine. It was the 3/4 head.

As far as I know, that head is still going today.

(Have a said recently that I hate Type IV engines???)
