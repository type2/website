<<Hey, I use that stuff in my Rolls-Royce (bought with the money I made 
from buying the "How To Make Millions in Real Estate With No Money Down"
as seen on TV books...Unfortunately, the cash was deposited in a
Nigerian bank so if you'd like to help me recover it, send me your bank
account number and I'll split the take with you... ;-)>>

Did you get all this done Tony after you sprayed the back of yor head
with the as seen on TV Top Coverage???

You wouldn't want to have the back of your head shining while motoring
about in that Rollscanhardly that was probably waxed with the as seen on
TV Duroshine with the hood in  flames too---: )_


Yea--go ahead and forward that million or so into my Pay Pal
account---forget the bank--it's faster---

LOL---
