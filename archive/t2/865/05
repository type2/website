<<NO! I'll add a Turbonator too while I'm at it! 10 more horsepower! The
ad said so!>>

The curb feller's I got at JC Whitney gave me 20% bettter fuel economy
too Don--the catalog sez so--- ;-)

<<I really hate WD40 as a lube.>>


As a permanent lubricating agent, I agree with you Don--it doesn't stay
around very long .

A light cam ignition cam lube ( Lubi Tech is good ) is the best for
keeping the weight flying open on the advance.

WD-40 is Ok for what he was doing with it though--trying to break them
loose.
