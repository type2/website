Subject: Pre-68 wipers?

This is a tough(ish) one:

After going to several well-respected VW shops in town, they could not
give me a good source for wiper blades on my '65 bus.

There were a couple bug wiper blades they thought were correct, but were
not sure.

So, anyone have a good "cross" to FLAPS wipers? Somewhere, sometime, I
read the they are "common".

Thanks!
