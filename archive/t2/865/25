Ok--Moby Dick went south for the winter---

Where in the heck did you go from tapioca Capin' Ahab to Diamond Jim
Kolisimo in one wave of your arm??

Where did you get the Guacamole Mobile??

Where did you find it?

How did it find you??

This story jumped a couple of pages here real fast, and I'm just
curious--did you move to a farm where there is more room for vehicles,
shoot the old landlord, or locate a abondoned mine that panned out?

Put this 78 record back on 331/3rd.
