Subject: Re: [T2] Brakes Squealing

Confession to the list: my rear brakes squeal. The shoes are chamfered
and the drums are turned. They do not squeal if actionned by the
handbrake. The hardware kit is new and i'm pretty sure it's installed
right.

They only squeal when braking pressure is low to medium. Higher baking
intensity makes no squeal.
happy squealing
