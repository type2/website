Subject: Brakes Squealing

Hey Volk!

Got new brakes on the '79 all around.

Went on the shakedown camping cruise this weekend and they squeal a loud
ringing squeak that is very loud.  Had a great time camping, bus ran great,
weather was beautiful as was the lovely little Tippecanoe River.

Found this on Ratwell:


Breakin tips:

If you put on new pads you must "bed the brakes" to get them to bite.
There's a procedure for it somewhere that says what speeds to reach before
braking but there seems to be debate on whether to do it gently or heavily.
Some vendors publish guidelines and others do not. My advice is to go with a
series of successively hard stops. Stomp hard on the brakes from 20 mph,
then 40 mph, then 60 mph twice. Be sure the brake caliper bolts are torqued
up to 116 ft.lbs before you attempt hard braking. If you feel heavy
vibration the bolts are loose.

Instructions regarding breakin varies because the pad material varies from
manufacturer. Some rotor manufacturers, like Brembo even give instructions
on break in. Regardless of that, what's important to understand is that for
the rotor and pads to work effectively as a pair some of the brake material
must transfer from the new pads to the rotor. If you are too hard on your
brakes during the first 150 miles, you may glaze the pads and this will
reduce breaking force. Once you've bed the brakes within the first few hard
stops be gentle with them during the rest of the braking period.



My question is:  Do you bring the Bus to complete stop, or just stomp on the
brakes briefly to get it to 40mph, then 20mph?  Is this all it takes?



Thanks for any info!
