Subject: Ozark Trail 11'x8' 'Dining Canopy on clearance at Wally World

Just thought I'd pass along a heads up to the list.  I went to Wally World
today to check out the Ozark Trail 11'x8' 'Dining Canopy that Kevin Roberts
talked about a few weeks ago.  It has been marked down to $17!  Of course, I
picked one up.  Get them while they last.
