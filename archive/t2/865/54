..::blushing::... yea they look like T4 heads to me too.... missed the T4
valve cover shape the first time....

dont know what the cost is - have never called internationally before? I
will shoot them an email...

BTW what is the stock T4 valve sizes? Are they the same from 1.7 to 2.0 -
oval to square port?
