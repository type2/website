Last list discussion I recall stated that the 18 foot wire was
adequate for the bus. I just had to slightly dremel out the inside of
the 1/2 inch ring connector to get it to fit over the spark plug.

on the A/C installation.  One of the things I wanted to add first was a CHT
gauge.  I plan on using SLX-11-1.  The longest sensor wiring listed is the
SEN-11-7 which is listed at 18 feet.  Will this be long enough?  Also, the
ring size is listed at 1/2 inch, not the correct size needed.  Does Dakota
Digital make a proper wiring set for the Bus or will I need to stretch the
ring?  The archives don't really discuss this or I missed it.
