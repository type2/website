Subject: Re: [T2] How to lower Co emissions with AFM adj?

This sounds familiar...

I got 3.16%. Pulled around the parking lot and backed the afm screw out 2
full turns. Pulled in and got 1.01%.

I've since put it back to where it got 3.16%. Just runs much better. Vacuum
leak probably. I get to go leak hunting this weekend. ;-)
