So, any  comment and suggestions on that matter would be appreciated.

hello ben   I glad to see you doing some homework.  You  should be able to 
get at least a hundred suggestions at EB just walking around  the groups:)  Come 
find me and I'll be glad to give you my opinion.  I  will be in the Doglimo  
an 85 tan westy with a roof rack on the pop top and  the dash covered in 
artifacts. I normally set up in the middle field but at EB  it is first come first 
serve and I can't leave the shop till 12 noon Friday and  it looks like more 
and more are getting there early this year there is no  telling where we will 
be . I am thinking that Sandra (my wife) will want to be  on the outskirts this 
year .Ask around if you want to find me , somebody will  know where I am.   
later and have fun  Mark  Dearing
