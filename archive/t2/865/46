Compare the heights of the valve stems. Unless they have all dropped by the exact same amount (unlikely) you should have an indication.

They were from the factory but not anymore. I suppose it's possible to get a set of heads from a rebuilder that lack the hole for the temp sensor II but you can always tap it.

New heads from the vendors usually come from AMC in Spain. Where did you see German heads unless they were a unique NOS pair?

If you just bolt the head on you might have different compression ratios L to R.

YMMV. Some heads fail prematurely because of poor workmanship. Others are great but with the engine out of tune they burn up anyway.
