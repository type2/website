Only if the vehicle supports it. Here's a quote from the site you found:

"*Can I still use a LATCH carseat it in a vehicle that does not have
LATCH?*  Yes.  All new carseat models will be backward compatible with
seatbelt
installations."

I actually contacted Volvo America to see if my 244 could be retrofitted. I
was told no. Seatbelts are just as safe, but not as easy to CORRECTLY
install the seat. Cops do car-seat checkpoints every so often in Orange
County, CA, and I was told that only 1 in 10 are installed correctly. (BTW:
Mine passed!)
