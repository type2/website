Subject: Attn DC-Va bussers-re route to Everybus from NJ

 From NJ, we plan to take 76 to 15 and go past Gettysburg; the area SO 
wants to go by to qvoid the DC-Richmond crunch.  From there Ww can stay 
on 15 and take 340 to Winchester and down 81 to 220 OR stay on 29- I've 
done the 81 route, fairly hilly.  29 looks like many towns, and the old 
bus may not be happy using its brakes that much, but would run cooler.
  (Front Brakes tend to squeak until I punch the pedal).  Can any of you 
in the area tell me which is flatter- 29 or 81, as that would affect my 
choice?
