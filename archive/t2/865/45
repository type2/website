Subject: leaky master cylinder grommets

Hello List,

I replaced my master cylinder about 10 months ago with a brazillian 
unit. It appeared to be better quality than some others I've seen 
floating around. The bus is a '74. At the same
time i also replaced my faulty servo, stop light switches and crusty old 
brake lines.

About 2 months ago I noticed it was low on brake fluid. I got under 
there and saw it all over the new master cylinder. I thought it was 
leaking at the resevior to reservoir line. I suspected those
rubber sleeves to be bad so I ordered some new ones.

Today I got under there and noticed that it wasn't the line at all but 
the rubber grommets that connect the master cylinder to the resevoir had 
fluid all over them. All those parts were new.

How dangerous is this? Can I go a little while just filling it up as 
needed as its leaking very slowly, or should I put this on my priority list?

I followed the bentley procedure for replacing the master cylinder with 
new rubber grommets... is there something special you need to do in 
order to get a good seal here?

I have another resevior and line sitting around. I might swap them out 
just to get those new rubber sleeves in there and hope (for some reason) 
a different resevior will stop these leaks. I appreciate
any advice.
