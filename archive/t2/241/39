Barry,

8 watts would be more like 0.7 amps.  Still not a lot.

Assuming a reasonably sized battery in good shape, 12 hours at 0.7 amps 
shouldn't be a problem.  I still prefer a second battery.  :)

I don't know the conversion figures but in general an 8 watt flourescent 
light will put out considerably more lumens than a 7 watt incandescent 
night light, and the 8-watt flourescent is already set up to run on 12V.
