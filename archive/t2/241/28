========================>
Pete,
The description is somewhat long, so I will abbreviate the sentence 
structure, hoping it makes sense.

I used a pod and mounted the pod on the dash right over the existing 
dashboard speaker holes.
I aligned to one of the speaker holes with a pod mount hole and used a 
plastic sheet rock mount and long screw to hold it down.
All meter feed wires were run through the speaker holes, being hidden 
within the pod housing.
Entire installation required no drilling nor any dash destruction to achieve.

Back in the engine compartment, I hooked up to all required sense points 
and ran those wires to a Cinch-Jones female 8 conductor plug which I 
positioned way over on the left side of the engine compartment.

Wires to be run up to the meters consisted of one 15'-20' run of Belden 8 
conductor cable which is made up of 8 insulated wires surrounded by an 
outer insulation.
This cable assembly (wire) was easily routed through the existing fire wall 
grommet access and then along the under carriage to the cab.

In the engine compartment, I connected the individual wires to a male 
Cinch-Jones plug.
I doubled up the wires on their connections to OP, OT, and Tach so as to be 
running two wires in parallel, and used the remaining 2 wires for the 
double connection run required of the CHT.
Three double runs + two single runs consumed the total 8 wires in the cable.
(Tach sense off of the Coil=1 connection, OP=1 connection, CHT=2 
connections, OT=1 connection)

Now, when I pull the engine, I just undo the plug and do not have to 
individually worry about the wires.

Meter lighting supply came off of the light switch on the dimmer side of 
the connection.
Works fine as it should.

Actual meter voltage, which must be a "switched" power source, was 
originally taken from the windshield wiper switch, but when the wipers were 
run, the meters jumped around due to the voltage drop feeding the string as 
the load was being applied to the wipers. This may have also been a back 
EMF thing, but I did not check as I was after a cure, and not a definitive 
analysis.
The cure was to tap the meter B+ off of the switched power feed going to 
the flasher switch so I tapped into the large B+ (green) wire that ran to it.
This works great, and no meter bouncing or voltage drop is encountered.

Meters work great, and no holes were required to mount all.
The engine can be pulled without having to undo a bunch of wires and 
tagging same.

If you want, I can take some pictures later today and send off to you.

Clear as mud ???
