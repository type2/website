Well a 75 "Westie" is just a 75 transporter with a camper kit installed; so most things will be interchangeable.
However these are things which I know will not interchange.
Steering column switches
sliding door (same size but different locking)
panel containing fuel filler
fuel filler cap.
probably heaps of others too.

The engines (assuming both type 4) and ancillary parts should be interchangeable but this will depend on what markets the transporters were originally prepared for.

Good luck
