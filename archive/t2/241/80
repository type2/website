Subject: Torque Converter Interchange

List,
I need to know if the torque converter from a bus
manufactured in august of 1975 will work for Karl
Favoritner, who recently posted that he needed one for
a 1982 vanagon.
I originally thought this was from a 76 bus, but i
remembered the sticker saying 8/75...

I can't find a part number on it anywhere.
I don't want to sell him something that won't work.

This message says 76 to 91 are the same.

Will this one work if i give him the flexplate too?
What is the difference in the 75 and 76 model TCs?

Danke volks and please use 'reply all' so karl will
get it as well,
clark
