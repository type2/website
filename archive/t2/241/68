Subject: Eureka Springs show

Folks,

Saw *lots* of nice buses at the Eureka Springs(Arkansas) show this 
weekend...including a turboed bay window that was one of the cleanest 
installations I've seen.

Also saw a bus their with a Buskatiers front license plate, but didn't
have time between events to go back and try to find out who it was.  :-(

Anyone on the list?  Really sorry I missed them!

Cheers, dave
