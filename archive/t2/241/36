I need a new type I longblock. (for my super beetle)
I can't afford Berg parts and don't want to build an engine
anyway.  BtlMex takes too long to ship its mexican longblocks.
Who can I trust to build a 1600 or 1776 long block with a new case?
Not Mofoco.  I've been warned.  What about Bap?  Gex?
Is there anybody with a solid reputation?

p.s. I'm still looking and learning before I buy a camper for next
year.
