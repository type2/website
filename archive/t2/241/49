====================>
Naw,
The VDO senders and meter combos seems to be ??? and a bit more ???
Even more ??? as a function of sender [placement and mounting.
Damned algorithm of installation !?

What I am going to do is:
Take the CHT platinum sender and immerse it in a pan of oil that is gonna 
be on the burner.
I will use a lab thermometer to measure temps and try to get them to 
correlate to the meter as an accurate reading.
Will adjust a series or parallel resistor combo to make the meter do a 
proper reading; log the resistor value; add a high wattage fixed value same 
as, and then have a meter and sender combo that reads together in proper 
scale (within some minute value of linearity tolerance)  close to where all 
components were set and calibrated.

Will do same for Oil temp sender mounted to the sump.

Now then, on the oil temp sender mounted to the sump.......
Is oil temp being measured ?
Is oil temp being measured at a dropped temp value because of the sump 
plate dissipating heat with air flowing by while on the road ?
Is the sender accurate ?
Who knows, but using a thermometer in the dipstick, I will find out, and do 
same as outlined on CHT calibration technique above.

I figure that a thermometer in the dipstick will read accurate, and I will 
adjust the sump plate cover/sender/meter to do a same value reading at the 
thermometer read calibration number.

I suspect I am going to find my oil running at 220-230 on hot Texas days.
Right now, my oil temp reads 180-190 as a highest number, and I am sure it 
must be a bit higher than that.
A Berg dipstick switcher goes off every once in a while at it's set point 
of 227, so what the H... ??

Something ain't right as to reading and sending, but I am gonna sort it out.
