Subject: the feel of foam pads vs sisal fibre pads in seats

I've got a 78 Westy and used the horsehair seats in a 71 and in the 78,
until I switched to vanagon foam inserted seats.  I feel the foam seats
are actually firmer in terms of depth sink when you sit on them; The
springs in the original seats allowed a deeper "bouncier" give.  On long
trips, if I want to move around on the seat, the foam seems to allow
less give.  However, one can "feel" the bumpiness of the
springs/horsehair combination, probably due to the fact that most
original seats lose their horsehair to age and mice, causing this feel. 
Any comment on the feel of a newly fibered seat vs an all foam one??
