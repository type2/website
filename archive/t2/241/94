I know this is an interesting concept. I like it. I just wanted to say, with 
no affiliation.....that the Busdepot   www.busdepot.com has a sale on for 
the 2 battery conversion. You have to supply the second battery. I do not 
have one myself, so I am speculating that it would be nice, but I will say 
this.....I use a marine battery and it  sure whips the llama. Or to put it 
more bluntly: a marine battery can handle recharge. And ive never let a 
battery sit like this one, with full juice comming strong every time. It 
likes to charge back up. 2 of them would rock.
