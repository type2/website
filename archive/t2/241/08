Subject: Any Distributors close to Aircooleds SVDA??

Just wondering if there are any production dizzy's that would be reasonably
close to Aircooled's SVDA dizzy? I think John has a really great product
there, but am wondering if anything that is stock comes close to it ? Anyone
have any knowledge on this? Anyone know the SVDA timing specs?
