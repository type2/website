Subject: 82 Vanagon Gas Tank Seal/Installation Question

Hi All:

I just received the 68 mm opening replacement gas tank for my 82
Vanagon. This tank is designed for the 68 mm fuel filler grommet for use
with the 58 mm fuel filler tube. I noticed that the new rubber grommet
(VW part # 251-201-139) does not fit as tightly in the nominally 68 mm
fuel tank opening as it does on the old tank. The metal fuel filler
tube, when fitted into the new grommet on the new tank, seems to have
more play and does not appear that it will seal completely.  I measured
the new tank opening with a pair of calipers and it is 69.6 mm as
compared to the old tank at 68.2 mm. Thus the new tank allows the
grommet to move more and hence does not appear to fit as tightly around
the fuel filler tube.

Anyone know what type of sealant I could use that will stay flexible to
ensure that the tank does not leak around the grommet?
Bentleys also indicates that the grommets on the gas and vent tanks
should be "sealed if necessary". Anyone know what VW originally used?

When I pulled the caps to the vent tanks, I noticed a tar like substance
around the cap, presumably sealing it. Reminded me of some of the
roofing tar that they use under shingles. Any idea if this is what was
originally used?

Thanks for the help in advance.

Regards,
