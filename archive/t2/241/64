Since there is no data available from Bosch, the only way to determine 
specs would be to compare to a new unit, then hope to get the tension 
uniform by comparison. I would never suggest to a client that this could be 
done for less than the cost of a new unit, because you could dink with it 
for weeks and end up with bad results.

Yes! An exhaust gas measure is the only way to verify mixture correctly.
