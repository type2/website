Note that if the fan nut was torqued on too tightly in the first place,
this procedure might be completely impossible.  The first time I tried
to remove the fan nut on my bus's engine, I discovered that the
generator pulley (which, we recall, is trying to turn against the blade
of a large screwdriver) will most definitely break when you apply more
than 100 lb-ft of torque to the fan nut in an attempt to unscrew it.  I
then took the whole mess, broken pulley and all, into a machine shop and
watched them roll their eyes, then remove the nut effortlessly with an
air wrench.

As a complete novice, I have no idea how common this is.  Still, don't
be too surprised or disappointed if you can't get the fan nut loose with
a ratchet.  And don't be afraid to take it to the nearest garage with
five bucks to have someone take the nut off with an impact wrench.  It's
cheaper than a pulley.
