I posted about an estate auction last month near Conrad Montana, 50+
vintage cars, sold by a big auction outfit.
I couldn't even afford to get in to watch (letter of credit from bank)
but a buddy of mine from Great Falls was up there and bought an old
Buick or something.
He said the '65 23? Window with <45k miles went for ~$18,000.00!   the
72 station wagon with 55k miles went for $5,000.00.
I don't feel so bad about not getting up there to witness it now.
