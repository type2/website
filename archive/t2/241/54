Well, there's a lot to be said for a bolt-in solution.  However, the price
(3500 exchange, and I'll bet the additional core charges for bad heads
aren't low) is pretty steep.

I'd be very tempted to opt for the Kennedy Subaru conversion.  The initial
outlay would be about the same for the kit and a low-mileage engine, and
the result would be more powerful and reliable.  The next engine
replacement would be much cheaper and available with the subaru (almost
every subaru imported to the US has the same 2.5 litre engine these days).

Subaru has built their entire product line on their wasserboxer engine and
it is much more refined than the abandoned VW wasserboxer.  They routinely
get 200K miles from an engine and a subaru isn't much lighter than a
vanagon.
