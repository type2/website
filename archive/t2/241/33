There is a species of mold that only grows in and on old VWs - not sure if
any scientific study has been done on it yet, but I'm fairly sure it has
curative properties.

simple green (NOT soilent green) is the answer- spray it on, wipe it off,
nice and clean. Bleach works too, but probably isn't so good for the
headliner.

Subject: [T2] Cleaning the Headliner


Hello all!

As I plan on having Tunes, the 1978 Bus I'm working on back Monday, I want
to clean the Headliner. It has sat outside for about 3 years before I got it
with a window slightly open. It appears to have mildew on the headliner, but
I'm not sure. It does not smell like that...It may just be dirt. The
headliner is very good shape otherwise, and has not tears. So what is
recommended for safely cleaning the headliner without having to remove the
whole thing (something I would rather not do)??

Thanks!

his bus....Get more from the Web.  FREE MSN Explorer download :
