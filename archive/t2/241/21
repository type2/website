Your 15 /50 is more than likely 10/40 at that point. 

well unless it is a quality synthetic which will not break down at that
point or temp.

Funny thing--- 
on page 52 of my 1974 VW owner's manual is mentions; 
Hot season--SAE 40
Cool season--SAE 30
Summer--SAE 30
Winter-above 5 degree--SAE 20w 20 
<<The FACTORY recommends multigrade's-->> 
I must have been reading a Citron owner's manual here----or somehow the
factory owner's manual I have must be a =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 misprint. 
well may I suggest the Bentley manual, Chapter 9 pg 4 section 2 which
begins "because of the recent improvemnets in the quality of
commercially avaliable lubricating oils, COMPLETELY NEW OIL
RECOMMENDATIONS for VW cars became effective in 1975.......You will
find, however that there are many advantages to be gained in adopting
the new recommendations, ONLY the new oil reccommendations given in this
manual should be applied to 1975 and later VW's" 
"single grade engine oils such as SAE 30 WERE FORMERELY recommended for
use in VW engines because of the unreliable quality of the then
avaliable multi grade engine oils. The new high standard for engine oils
that conform to the API service rating API/SE has made such multi grade
oils suitable for use in the VW engine, Car owners will find that these
high quality multi grade oils offer many advantages in convience,
performance, and economy - EVEN IN OLDER MODEL VW's" 
=A0=A0=A0=A0Table "a" on page 5 shows many multigrades,.including a
15w-50 which as far as I know is (was) only avaliable as a synthetic. 
NUFF SAID,!
