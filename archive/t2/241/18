Subject: re: Any Distributors close to Aircooleds SVDA??

Not sure if any stock dizzys are close to aircooled's SVDA...the timing
specs are totally different for my stock '71 distributor and the aircooled
SVDA, because the SVDA is "S"ingle "V"acuum, and my stock '71 is dual
vacuum - retard and advance. 

The timing specs for the SVDA dizzy for my 1600 dp are as follows...time
to 7.5 deg BTDC. Full advance, hose on is about 40-42 deg. Hose off should
be 30 deg BTDC. 

The high advance number is for part-throttle cruising conditions, where
aircooled figured out that the engine needs more advance. It backs off to
the standard 009 30 degrees of max advance at full throttle. 

I can't comment on how it works yet - I haven't got it working on my van! 

I'll let you know in a few days. 
cheers
