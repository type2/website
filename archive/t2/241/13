Subject: Re: [T2] auto tranny ???


Friday my 78 auto tranny (stock) started shcreeching,  Bentley says either
Torque Converter one way clutch OR auto tranny 1st gear one way clutch....

I have both a spare TC and Tranny BUT there is a VERY BIG difference in
the amount of work to swap one out and if I swap out the TC and it turns
out to be the tranny it is an awfull lot of work to do over.

does anyone know a way to check one out which is the probably
cause???  had to be away this weekend so I guess first thing is to drop AT
filter pan and see if there is any evidence...but since the same fluid is
used in both tranny and Torque converter so I'm not sure what that will
tell me..of course if it is burned or something else shows it may help
determine the problem.

???????

Thanks

Bob
