>I have a 1970 Westfalia with the BN4 gas heater in the 
engine compartment.  I need to replace the gasoline 
resistant "quad ring" in the top of the old style aluminium 
fuel filter because it is leaking.  The question is where do 
I find this part?  I have called some local auto parts 
places around Vancouver, BC and they haven't even heard of 
such a thing.  Has anyone found one and where?  Perhaps it 
has another application that it is used for.  Thanks for the 
help.
