Subject: ADJUSTING THE AFM (inside)- ANY TIPS?

I have been tinkering with my airflow meter ever since
it got stuck wide open and I had to open it up and
replace a spring on the swinging flap.  ever since I
have tweeked the tension on the spring and the angle
of the arm that moves along the resistance surface,
trying to get best performance and mileage.  as these
things are factory sealed for a reason, does anyone
know a way to test the settings, or reset this?
p.s.  the bypass screw has also been dicked with and I
don't know where it should be set.  all emmissions
long gone.  do I need a gas analyzer?

thanks in advance.
