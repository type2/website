Subject: Re: [T2] Light additions, inverters

  I put a chain style 3 bulb light (off a 71 Westy)  over the sliding
door (to the left, so rear passenger can reach it); very handy when
entering at night.  The incandescent bulbs take a lot of current
compared to a fluorescent.  I believe I measured the 3 bulb light as
around 4 amps.  (A 20 watt bulb wound be 1.6 amps, ie). I'd put a
fluorescent in if using such extra lights for any length of time camping
without hookups, as they give more light for about 1/3 of the current. 
If you like to camp when it's freezing out, fluorescents do lose their
lumens. I keep a 12v a fluorescent 2 bulb auto trouble light in the
Westy; handy in particular for the upper bunkers; hang it on the poptop
rail.  To power this and fans (which use very little current), add extra
outlets to the side of your sink cabinet, wired to the aux batt. if you
have one.  The surface mount style with 2 screws are handy.  For camping
with hookups, I have a 50 Amp converter under the rear seat and all the
12 volt stuff used for camping is routed through this via a double throw
switch.  On our 71, years past, I mounted a tractor light on the roof of
the Westy facing the rear; handy for parking at night in campgrounds
with trees around.   Some states frown on this.
    Re using an inverter, I used a 500 watt version to run dremyl tools,
shavers, christmas lights, laptop, videogame, and dvd player run to the
dual volt TV.  Keep it well ventilated and provide it's own wire to the
battery if using 300 watts or more.   Remember that to run a 300 watt
tool is drawing over 20 amps from the battery itself.  A dremyl is 138
watts; that's 11.5 Amps of 12 volt usage.
