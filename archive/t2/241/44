Barry, Dave is right about it being no problem running an 8 watt drain
all night.  A typical battery you can stuff in there should list it's
amp-hour capacity. Divide by 10 and you have its capacity for 10 hours. 
Since it's safest to run about 25% of its capacity to prevent sulfation
in a non-deep cycle batt, divide that by 4.  If it's recharged right
away, I use the voltage drop rule; my electric fridge "killswitch" cuts
the power at 10.5 volts, and that will leave enough juice when battery
recovers to start the vehicle.  Fridges take 4 amps and for a typical
battery can be run about 4 hours.  These switches can be had in camping
stores or even cell phone outlets.
