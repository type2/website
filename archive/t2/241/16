I think it would be easer to pull the engine and work
on the gen/alt swap, it will be out where you can get
to it without hurting yourself, I'm old and battle
scared, I like to do things with the least amount of
pain. With the engine out it will give you a chance to
fix the wires up, you can just sit inside there and
have all the fun you can stand.  Phil
