Subject: engine case crack?

Hi folks,
quick Q. is it possible that I have a case crack if
oil is leaking withouth the engine running for an
extended period of time? Ie, I leave the bus sitting
for a week and there is a puddle underneath. From what
I understand the pushrods are above the oil line and
so is the oil cooler. right? so unless its coming out
of a split in the case or a crack what other options
are there? Thanks for the help and sorry for my
ignorance.
