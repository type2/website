If you can't crack it that way and are too afraid of loosing the washer into
the fan housing, then remove fan belt first loosen the fan housing screws,
disconnect thermostat under engine, take off gen strap, lift up the fan
housing and wedge two pieces of wood under either side under the housing,
now loosen fan to shroud screws
and work the gen/fan combo out. Once out lock vice grips on the pulley end
of
generator which in turn is wedged to the ground, step on that combination
and slip
your 36" socket on fan nut + big breaker bar then pry or crack the bar with
a 5lb sledge.

Assemble the fan onto your alternator the same way, and resinstall. Good
side of the road
job is your red light comes on and you have a spare generator.
