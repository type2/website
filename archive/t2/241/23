Subject: WTB: Cooling Tin/Heat Shield 82 Vanagon

Hello All:

I am removing the old York AC Compressor from my 82 Vanagon and I need
the replacement engine cooling tin for the left rear section of the
engine compartment. The VW part number is 071-119-521. Also on the
lookout for a good condition heat shield, part number 070-119-227A.
Anyone have some lying around or know where I can find them? Thanks in
advance for the help.

Regards
