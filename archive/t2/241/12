Hi everyone,

Wow!  Five days to the start of "Busses Nowhere Near The Arch #18"!  We'r=
e pretty much ahead of schedule in preparing for the Type 2 festivities t=
o come.  The trophies, door prizes, the signage, ballot box, tents, and a=
ll the other event supplies are either loaded into the '59 Double Door Pa=
nel, or are in a pile by the door ready to go out.  Kathryn and I will be=
 bringing four of our VW's up to the Lake, and by e-mail and phone conver=
sations, it sounds like a lot of the Buskatiers, the DBG folks, the Misso=
uri Micro's and many other NEATO and LiMBO members are getting ready to d=
escend on Mark Twain Lake in a few days from now.  Susan (Crandall) Dolvi=
n of Drain, Oregon is already on her way to BNNTA and will probably take =
one of the "longest Distance driven to the event" awards home to Oregon i=
n her Westy!  What might you win?

Several attendees have asked if the "group" campground where we host the =
BNNTA event will be open for early arrivals, say on Thursday.  Last year =
the Corps of Engineer park rangers opened the locked "group" campground g=
ate on Thursday afternoon to allow for the early arrivals to set up camp.=
  Ranger "Chuck" and I discussed this again a week ago, and we both belie=
ve that it worked out very well last year.  Naturally, "if" I can arrange=
 to have it open early, any early vehicle staying in the "group" area wil=
l need to pay the normal one night camping fee per VW vehicle to the rang=
ers when the rangers occasionally pass through.  I lease the entire place=
 from noon on Friday through noon on Monday.  So for those of you who mig=
ht want to get in and set-up and have an early start on all the fun, I ma=
y be able to make the same arrangements for you again this year.  I will =
call on Monday to try to confirm this, and I'll try to have another e-mai=
l post to "the Lists" by Tuesday evening to confirm that it will indeed h=
appen.  Even if for some reason I couldn't arrange the above plan, all ea=
rly arrivals could still stay in the nearby "regular" campground and just=
 move over on Friday.  But I think we have a "lock' on the Thursday open =
gate thing!  I'll update this info on Tuesday night.

So pack up those Type 2's, grab the slow lane, and drive safely!  Hope to=
 see ya soon!
