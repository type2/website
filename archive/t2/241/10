Subject: Where can I find dual Solex Kadron Carbs? 

I'm not gonna have the money for the weber IDF's. Does
anyone know where I can get a good price on some new
Solex 40mm dual single barrel Kadron carbs for my 1700
cc engine? Also, I'd like to find a set with the brake
servo hookup adaptor.
                                  Thanks,
                                  Paul Deatherage
