Subject: test for vacuum leaks

On my 1600DP engine, I would like to do a test to separate vacuum 
leaks in the manifold from those in the 34 PICT 3. I thought of 
removing  the carb, replacing it with a blank flange, installing a 
vacuum gauge on the manifold, and turning the engine over ten times, 
the way one does to test compression.

Does anyone know if a static pumping by the cylinders is enough to 
establish a vacuum in the manifold that can be measured?

Thanks, jack
