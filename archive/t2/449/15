A better product for cleaning chrome (and lots of other surfaces) is called Never Dull. It comes in a dark blue round metal can and probably the best place to look for it is at a kitchen gadget shop. Inside the can is what looks like a big wad of
cotton. Its soaked in some kind of oily liquid that cuts through years of grime without scratching the surface. Its really the cat's meoww for polishing chrome.
