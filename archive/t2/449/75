You can test the fan by using a jumper wire from the B+ pos terminal of your
battery to terminal A... disconnect the blue wire temporarily, install power
from B+ .. and make sure the switch on the dash is in "max" position to close
the ground circuit.

OR... start the engine, as soon as the alternator gets to about 8 volts, the
blue wire will trigger the relay to close, and if the switch on the dash is in
max, then the fan should run,,

sometimes you have to coax the fan by spinning it by hand, they seem to get a
little stuck in old age
