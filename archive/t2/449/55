It's not that simple. as usual VW Trends isn't the best technical
source out there. octane is just it's resistance to knock. higher
compression will raise the combustion temps. Temperature is one of the
things that can cause knock, so it is related. It's just not a simple
graphing solution though. There are some guidelines out there, but it
really seems that experiments are the best way to tell. there are some
known good combos of performance engines out there that have been
tested for years and work well together. (i.e. 1776).

I haven't read it, but I'd just guess they are saying that "usually"
people running x.x CR need to run xx octane fuel to keep from
knocking.

it doesn't exist. not untill we can control how hot the combustion
chamber can get :)
