Subject: What is this hole?

http://www.shagadelic.org/photos/pod/mystery-hole.jpg

On my bus (78' Westy) it is the reverse. I have a hole on the left side of
the fan housing (not crankcase) and a male nipple on the top. I plugged the
hole with silicone and attached my clear vinyl hose to the nipple. I used
the same type hose as you did for my charcoal canister. It is located on
the right side of the engine compartment next to the tail light and mounted
vertically. I am not sure what the extra hole is for but speculate that it
could have been something to do with an air pump for emissions crap.
