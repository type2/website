Subject: Split an early bay parts

It is Friday already on this side of the Atlantic, so I figured it would be
OK to offer a few NOS parts to list members before I post them on the
nameless auction site.

All these parts are NOS German

Push Button door handles with keys (I think T2a, but maybe T1 - they do have
the old VW boxes):
Aussendruecker 211 837 205 J
Tuergriff 211 837 205 K

Front axle link pins (or king pins - I am not sure what Bundbolzen
translates to):
Kit 37  4x Bundbolzen 211 405 521, 4x Nadellager 211 405 421 A, 40x
Scheiben 211 405 527
Kit 37a 4x Bundbolzen 211 401 401,  4x Nadellager 211 401 323 B,  40x
Scheiben 211 401 405  (looks exactly like kit 37 but the parts numbers do
not show up on the BD site - maybe a misprint on the boxes)
Kit 37 without the washers (Scheiben)

ATE/FAG Bus Wheelcylinders 1955 on
3 2725 1102 3 v re oben  (front right upper)
3 2725 1101 3 v re unten  (front right lower)
3 2725 1001 3 v li unten 3x  (front left lower)
3 2725 1002 3 v li oben 4x  (front left upper)

Please p-mail me with offers if you need any of the above. I'll be
travelling back to the U.S. on September 28 and can either bring some parts
in my luggage to save shipping cost or ship them immediately.

Marcus
