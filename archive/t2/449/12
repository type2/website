I've used to the wiring diagram to create a continuity testing procedure for
when I go scrounging for them at the junkyard. I don't believe any current
passes through when the switch is in the off position.

This picture shows the wiring to the switch:

The bottom lead is normally connected the grey/red instrument wire but I
disconnected it to take the photo.

I think you need to get out the VOM and see what's wrong. In general the
area behind the dash is a scary place because VW used only the minimum
protection for hot leads.

Be sure to disconnect the battery before doing anything back there and
reconnect it only as you see that it's safe to do so.
