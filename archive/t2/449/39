Subject: Re:Type 4 tin assembly :-P

I found all the tin I needed in an old bus full'o'engines where I got the
new only slightly bent almost-NOS German muffler (which I straitened out in
a hydraulic press :)  and '74 heat muffs.  I also got myself a cylinder temp
probe too as I ruined mine when removing it.  The sad thing is that this
"engine bus" has a very clean body...way better than mine!

Thanks again for the tin help.
