Subject: Westy Trailer

Dear fellow listees, especially you franken-bessers out there:

Has anyone modified a bay window westy for towing as a camper? I'm talking
no engine, no tranny, modified interior, a hitch on the front to couple with
my Dodge truck, etc. Anybody done it? Anybody know of anybody who's done it?
I'm just looking for info, here, chasing out a stray thought.

Thanks,
Dave
