Pertronix dwell is around 54 degrees.

True.

The air gap is a source of misinformation on the web. It only has to be
large enough not to rub.

As the rubbing block wears, the gap gets smaller. The page you referenced
explains:

Taking it to extremes, excessive dwell means that the points close too soon
after opening, cutting off the magnetic field collapse before it delivers
all its energy. Too little dwell gives the magnetic flux insufficient time
to build up to the maximum. Both conditions give a a weak spark which gets
even weaker as the engine RPM rises and produces misfiring at normal
operating speeds.
