Subject: Melling oil pumps and type IV motors

FWIW...

I have a Melling in my 2.0 type IV engine...from BD...I have no
complaints other than a little seepage that I caused myself....

During final assembly, I had left the breather off the top of the
engine, and something fell down inside...I removed the oil pump in my
search, and didn't replace the gasket between it and the case as it was
new...lesson learned....don't ever re-use paper gaskets....

OTOH....I have heard from an engine builder in my area that the
tolerance between the case and pump sometimes lead to leaking under
pressure, and he won't use them for that reason...

Personally, I have never had any problems with Melling pumps in type I
or type II builds that relate directly to the pump...and my next build
(called getting more HP for an automatic)will have a melling, as I
already have it in hand..

My $.02...

Den.
