Subject: Friday Poll: Vanity plates

Hi Volks,

Last week I polled the list about parts that didn't break. Response was 
limited, so I will try something with wider appeal this week:

Best bus vanity plate. Submissions must be something you have seen in 
person, not dreamt up off the top of your head.

Personal favorites include Jamie Rivers "2SLO 2BAD"  and Collie Corner 
has "WEB GEEK", which is also very apt. I saw a Maryland bus at 
EveryBus 2003 with "CANABUS" -- I would love to put that plate on my 
camper, but it would probably make for a hassle getting across the 
border. (My bus is very Canadian, but not chemically enhanced).

Please email me with your plates. If you're the owner of a plate I will 
list you by name on the final report, which will be posted later this 
weekend.


Happy trails,
