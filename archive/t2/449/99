Subject: Re:Air Horn

Hi Folks,
    Now here's a topic I want to chime in on.  While the regular
electric horn works on our bus, I've always wanted to mount a set of
airhorns too.  Actually 2 sets, one set in the front and one set in
the back, and each set operating independantly from the other.  My
plan envisions one horn mounted on each corner of the fiberglass top.
The 2 front ones would be small and point forward.  The ones mounted
in the rear would be large, loud, and pointed to the back.  The front
horns would be used in the normal fashion to get the attention of
people ahead of me.  The rear ones would be to "complain" to those
people that drive too close behind because our bus is slower than
their ride.
    But alas, the wife says NO WAY.  And since the bus is in her
name..............
