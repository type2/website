Well... no oil comes near that hole, as far as I can tell.  I misspoke 
when I said "crankcase".  I believe it's really the fan housing (note 
it's directly behind where the coil mounts, which is on the fan 
housing, right?).

Several people have suggested that I should just plug it.  What's the 
best thing to use to do that?  Cork + permatex?
