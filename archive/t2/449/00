Subject: "hot" wired

I've noticed that the hot lead into my headlight switch runs hot to the touch.  
I almost think it's going to melt the insulation it's so hot.  Here's what's happening
- when the bus is running, the lead is warm/hot on the headlight switch.  When the
lights are on, the lead is frickin' hot to touch.  At first  I tought that the switch
was bad (too much resistance?) because I only noticed it when the lights were on,
but I've noticed that the lead is hot when the ignition is on.  Any ideas/hints 
to how to trouble shoot this.  Any experiences with this before?

Mike
