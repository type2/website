Here in Virginia you can select different styles of plates the one we pick
has a little red heart before the letters so we put in "CAMPINN" so it looks
like "LOVE CAMPINN" . We had to add the 2nd N as CAMPIN was taken. still
looks cool. but the best I have seen driving is right after state budget
cuts they closed down alot of DMV's around here and I think a former
empolyee got this one with some help from the inside " DMV SUX" I love it
and now with 4-6hour wait DMV really does Suck !!

Hi Volks,

Last week I polled the list about parts that didn't break. Response was 
limited, so I will try something with wider appeal this week:

Best bus vanity plate. Submissions must be something you have seen in 
person, not dreamt up off the top of your head.

Personal favorites include Jamie Rivers "2SLO 2BAD"  and Collie Corner 
has "WEB GEEK", which is also very apt. I saw a Maryland bus at 
EveryBus 2003 with "CANABUS" -- I would love to put that plate on my 
camper, but it would probably make for a hassle getting across the 
border. (My bus is very Canadian, but not chemically enhanced).
