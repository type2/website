Check with local state law on license plate frames, as some states they are
illegal.. With mine being one of them.. South Carolina.

Just trying to help someone from being pulled.

YMMV but if the frame obscures the exp sticker then it is usually illegal.
Most cops probably wouldn't pull ya. But there is always the stickler...
