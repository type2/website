Subject: Air Horn

"When I need a horn, I just poke it out the
driver window and trigger the briefest  blast that can be managed....sort
of a bleeep.  Don't know if such equipment meets the legal requirement for
Ohio, but that is what I am doing."

That is freaking awesome. I have one of those horns on my boat that can be
refilled with air from a compressor. I think it would be much more
effective than the electric anyway! Thanks for the tip.

"I probably toot that air horn once or twice each year. This is not one of
those occassions."

I think I'll be using mine a bit more often, but then thats just the kind
of jerk I am...
