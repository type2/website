Subject: FS: Seats and gas tanks cash and carry

I have two "78 tanks and a '82 tank gathering dust.    Anyone need these?

$45 each Fob SLC..... $25 each cash and carry

I also have two westy plaid driver and passenger seats.  Plaid is 
faded and drivers has a small amount of foam showing but with some 
$20 per pair seat covers these will be good replacements for a pair 
of dying vinyl Bus seats:
$25  each cash and carry (OBO)

I am trying  to schedule trips to Portland, Oregon; Ventura, 
California, and possibly western Colorado where I could possibly meet 
interested parties half way  (or more)

Hate to trash good Bus parts but I am moving and I am narrowing down my stash.

Lot's of other parts headed for the trash, what do you need?  (short 
block, 77 head, case, engine tin, flywheels, starter motors, doors, 
windows, fresh air blowers, heater boxes, etc)

Thanks,
