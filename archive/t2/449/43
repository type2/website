Subject: YEAH! It works!!!

Well, dunno if you guys remember, but I said that my wheels were
shimmying when I would drive my Bus. I've actually found out that... the
wheels start to wiggle back and forth when the wheels are COMPLETELY
straight! This tells me that my tie rods, and well.. my entire steerling
linkage is probably shot. I had similar issues with a 1976 Camaro LT-350
I used to own a few years ago. The whole front suspension was SHOT. When
I would jack the front of the car up, I could actually spread the wheels
apart to the point where they would be facing opposite directions within
1-2 inches off center for each wheel! I'm worried that PROBABLY the same
thing has happened to my Bus. When I purchased it, most of the difficult
stuff was already done to it, new paint job, brand new motor and
transmission, the brakes were ALL brand new, among other things.. the
entire rear suspension and the drive shafts, etc.. all new. The front
though is completely untouched.

Anyway, I purchased a few items from the Bus Depot, one of which was a
new steering damper. I installed it last night at 9:30 pm (couldn't wait)
and took the transporter for a cruise. It drove MUCH better. I still know
that I need to replace the steering components, but in the mean time,
this allows it to be at least drivable!

Thanks!

Todd
