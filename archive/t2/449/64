Subject: anyone ever fix a hole in heat exchanger??

i have yet to pull it out but im almost definite that
i have leaks/holes in my heat exchangers..

has anyone any luck patching/welding them shut..

I know its hard to get a weld to stick to something
with carbon buildup, has anyone any
suggestions/materials such as epoxy or jb weld that
has worked for them..

thanx,
rob
