Rob,

The por-15 guys have some sort of epoxy they call fireseal or something 
like that that sounds perfect for this sort of thing.

You might go look at their faq/instructions section and see what you 
think.  I personally have not used it, but am thinking that it might be 
good to add thickness back to t1 heat exchanger pipes so that they
fit the muffler pipes properly.

Cheers, dave
