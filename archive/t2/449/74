Subject: tie rod ball joint removal

I assume you already have the tie rod out of the steering knuckle.

Sorry to tell you, but sometimes those "tie rod ends" are really stuck.
Especially if you are turning them the wrong way. Some are regular
righty-tighty-lefty-loosly right hand threads and some are weirdo left hand
threads which tighten and loosen in the "backwards" direction. I have had to
use pipe wrenches and an oxy-acetylene torch to get some out. Your liquid
wrench soak is a good idea. Whenever I have to get a front end alignment, I
start soaking the tie rod adjustment threads with a penetrating "liquid
wrench" every day for a week, at least, before I take it to the shop. Some
of those front ends guys are really destructive with their pipe wrenches and
torches and long cheater bars and sledge hammers and etc.. I want those tie
rod ends to turn easily for them.  When you do get the bad ones out, please
wire brush the tie rod inside female threads and use an air hose and googles
and blow out the crude. Then coat the inside female threads with a spray
marine grade anti-sieze compound. Use the included brush of your jar of
anti-sieze compound to coat the male threads of the new part. Don't be a
cheapskate, slather on a lot of anti-sieze compound; it should goosch out
when you tighten the parts together.  Good Luck
