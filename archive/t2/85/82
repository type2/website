Tom,

What Karl suggests is SOP on the Vanagon engine removal.  I have not tried
it on a bay, but I see no reason it would not work.  One thing on the bay,
though... do remove the shift rod from the nose of the trans before you
swing the trans down!  If you don't, it will really bind on you! You also
need to support the bell housing lest it fall on the floor.  A couple 2x4s
should do it.
