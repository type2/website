Subject: Re: [T2] Platinum Plugs

Steven and all;
   FWIW, I installed four Bosch platinum plugs in to my daughter's '77 Baja, with
a rebuilt by us 1600 DP in the summer of '98. They're still firing as she blasts
about the deserts and mountains of New Mexico in search of a college degree...at
6,000+ altitude. (Dunno if this is a factor).

   The following May (1999) I installed a set of the same in my butt-ugly,
freshly resurrected from the grave, '69 Bug (with a 1500 SP). Still lighting off
at the first turn of the key.

   They work for me.

'78 Westy that's really buggin' my butt to get finished
'69 Bug, all over the place, every day.
And a bunch of other VW projects...(are those voices I hear audible to
others?...hmmmmm)
And cats, fat cats, roaming the place in search of prey.....
