Mark,

I went thru the same thing with my 78 that had been sitting for 8 years.

Tank had *not* been drained...a royal pita.  I found out this wekend that
something is still floating around in it and I am going to have to pull it
anyway.

I replaced the fuel pump, 4 rebuilt injectors, 1 new cold start valve,
pressure regulator.  *ALL* fuel lines. It fired on the 6th turn.

Start at page one of the fi part of the bently manual and do *all*
the checks.  

You might try soaking the injectors in injector or carb cleaner, but after
seeing what sad shape my fuel lines were in, I decided to replace all
instead of going with carbs.

Cheers, dave
