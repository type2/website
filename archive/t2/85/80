Jason,

Years ago, shortly after Bosch started making these, I bought a set for a
1600 DP T1 engine.  I had a very bad experience, fouling, running hot,
missing etc. etc.  I was told by a mechanic I trusted that they were "a
bad thing" in the T1 engine, so I ditched them and have never looked back.
As I (vaguely) remember, his take was that the thin electrode in them
fouled too easily and that the heat range was wrong for the T1 engine.

The caveats to this story are:
(a) it was *not* a new engine;
(b) it was a long time ago, so the plug design may have changed.
