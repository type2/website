Subject: Audi/Vanagon seats in a '74?

I have heard numerous times that Audi or Vanagon seats can be used in a
baywindow.

I am new to the baywindow scene with a '74 Westi...  Granted I have had a
'66 Westi for quite a while and is my primary work horse which I enjoy :)
Also I tend to end up doing most of the maintenance on friends' '71 and '73
Westis' so I am somewhat familiar with these "newfangled" models.

So the question is how or what seats will directly fit into a '74 westi?  I
know the early bays had a weird passenger seat layout where it snaps in on
clips instead of being on rails, not sure when it switched to normal tracks
though.  Again people claim the Vanagon seats can fit right in, but I am not
sure.

This '74 needs some help here and there, but should be great with a little
TLC.  Really the main concerns in the short run are the seats and a few
window seals.  The camping interior is in excellent shape!  The big downer
is that it does not run at the moment, but figure a few days work and I will
have her purring again (I am pretty good with motors).  

I tentatively plan to bring it out to Edisto Freeze Yer Toe in SC in late
Feb and if I get lucky the Dead of Winter campout in northwest GA in early
Feb.  Otherwise I will camp in the '66 like normal. 


Thanks,
