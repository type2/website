Probably works.

An even bigger BUT...... you cannot use Calif ECU's in a Fed bus. You cannot use
Fed ECU's in a Calif bus. In 1979 year buses.
Yes you can swap a Cal auto trans for a manual trans ECU and not see any
difference. You can swap Fed auto and manual ECU's and not see any difference.

California buses do NOT have the resister pack on the gas tank panel. The
injector resistance is built into the EFI harness and ECU. Calif buses have an
O2 sensor. Calif buses use a different double relay.
79 Fed buses are the same configuration as 78 buses.
