For the cost of converting a VW Bus to nuclear, you could go with a lot of
different things...Rolls-Royce V-8s mounted right behind the front seats,
General Electric T-700 turbines for that extra little zing (add swaybars if
you go this route, the T-700 puts out 1565 shaft horsepower), a Richard
Childress engine like Sheriff Hege has, a Richard Childress engine like
Robby Gordon has (though if you get that one make sure you can get it out
easily; they're not made for long-term dependability), Detroit Diesel 6V71--
the mind fairly boggles at the possibilities!
