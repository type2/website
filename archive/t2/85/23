Tony, the late Baywindows, ' 76-' 79, had Stainless Steel Exhaust manifolds, 
with Factory installed sheetmetal sandwiched "wraps" around them. The 
sheetmetal rusted away, the SS manifolds did not. These exhausts benefit 
greatly from the Cool Wrap application. Don't believe me, look at the pix of 
the above mentioned manifolds in the Bentley or Haynes manuals. You'll see 
the heatshields.
