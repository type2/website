Subject: Re: [T2] Audi/Vanagon seats in a '74?

"What did they cost you? "

At a local pull-a-part any seat is $25 each.  This weekend they had two nice
sets of Vanagon seats up for grabs one navy blue and the other maroon, also
a few middle and rear bench seats in Maroon cloth.  No baywindow stuff
though.  This is at the Atlanta location of pull-a-part.

I imagine the other bone yards would have similar prices.

Also from all the feedback to the original question is that '76 and newer
can use the Vanagon seats directly.
