Wow - never saw a 2.0 with stainless steel pipes. Are you sure? I have seen 
a friend's '78 2.0 with the thin OEM sheetmetal wraps still intact (at 
least they were last year). I am driving the bus for a few weeks so I'll 
take a look and see if they are still there. The heat isn't what it was 
last year so I suspect something is amiss.

I had decided that if I stayed with VW power and not gone Corvair I was 
going to create a heat shield to keep the cold wind off of these pipes in 
the winter and remove them once warm weather arrived again.

My plan was to have a larger diameter (2" ?) exhaust bent to match the VW 
pipe and thin cut / split it so only the leading side of the pipe was 
covered. I was going to use muffler clamps of some sort and spot weld the 
wind break to the clamps and bolt it on.
