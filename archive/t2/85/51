I have a Type 1 engine in my '74, just the way it came from 
VW. I have a nice picture of the engine compartment, and 
some of the rear most tin piece that sits above the exhaust.
Email me and I'll send you the pics, or better yet, let me 
know where to send them so someone can use them on a Bus 
website.
