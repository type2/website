Subject: Re: [T2] Engine-neering - combustion chamber question

I thought that was the reason car makers at that time were adding air 
injection pumps to motors - to keep oxygen levels in the exhaust high 
enough that the exhaust by-products would continue to combust and thus 
clean up the exhaust emissions. As I recall the air injectors were in the 
exhaust manifolds someplace.

Was it wasteful? Dunno - however I do know that my 120 HP 1966 Mustang with 
a 200 c.i. 6 cylinder was much more powerful than my 90 HP 1981 Mustang 
with the same 200 c.i. 6 cylinder. In other words they choked the engine 
down with emissions equipment to make it cleaner. It had the air pump too. 
I doubt that they would have reduced the HP if they didn't have to make it 
that way. Gas mileage was a bit worse than the 1966 which was very worn out 
and geared lower.

I'm learning...
