Howdy,
I have a 78 westy with early 80s (not sure of the exact year, pulled from a
wrecking yard) vanagon seats. If I remember correctly, they slipped right in
without a problem . I did, however, remove the armrests because in the forward
position they crowded the aisle and did not allow the passenger seat to be
reversed (door clearance problems) for camping. I removed the armrests and the
mounts (requires cutting/grinding) when I reupholstered. They look and work
great.
Regards,
Chris
