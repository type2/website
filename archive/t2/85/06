Nemo, Adrian and all...

I have some very direct experience in this and respectfully but strongly
disagree with Adrian.

On April 1 (yes April Fools Day) I bought a 73 panel that had this
conversion using a 68 bug engine.  I new that there should be a engine
mount in back (this did not, only some thin sheet metal welded to the
extractor and bolted to the frame), but didn't think it was a problem
because bugs hang the engine from the tranny.  I knew this van had a bad
tranny so I pulled the engine.  What I found was the upper (only rear)
tranny mount and carrier had pulled almost all of the way through the
frame and was hanging by only about a quarter of an inch on either end! 
This I discover after towing it home 150 miles.  The whole weight of the
engine and most of transmission were hanging from this thin thread.  It
should have been all over the freeway except for blind luck.

I was able to easily find the correct "mustache bar" engine mount at
Roscoe's in Ventura, Ca. along with the EMPI oil pump adapter.  It all
worked very well.  One hint though.  Don't use Ny-lock type nuts on the
mount to adapter bolts.  The heat there will cause the nylon to melt and
let the nuts back off.  BTDT



BTW, this is my first post.  I've been following along through the web
site and finally got around to signing on.  Very educational for this
first time dub owner!  Thanks!
