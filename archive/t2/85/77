Hi Andre
Chuck here in BC
I can't speak for the eastern leg of your trip but I'm up and down the west
leg every couple of months. You'll find the rest stops in Calif,Oregon and
Wash to almost all be clean and safe. Everyone I've been too has be well
populated especially at night when they become truck towns, thank God they
separate the trucks and cars. In Oregon and Washington you can usually find
free coffee at most of the stops. One nice thing is away from the cities
you'll find on about every 50mi's. I think I've managed to hit almost every
one in the past couple of years. 'Course if you manage to hit the Island
there's alway my driveway where you can hide amongst the buses.
