Subject: Any listees in NZ?

    I'm thinking of taking a vacation there this year, wondering if
anybody has contacts where I could rent a Westy or something...

    If we like it in person as much as we like the pictures, my wife and
I are considering emigrating there, so if anybody has tips on
immigration-specifically on how difficult it would be to get a US '78
Westy in-that would be interesting too...
