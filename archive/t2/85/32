Did not realize I could do that! I imagine that the trans. pivots on the front

Is there any alignment concerns with getting the trans. back in exactly the same

Thanks Karl! This sounds like a great idea. Might be two weeks before I can try it
though, weatherman predicts snow for the weekend in Northern Arizona : (
