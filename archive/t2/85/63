Subject: in need of piston and exhaust valve

A bus brother is in need of a 85.5 mm piston and a 35.5 exhaust valve.  He
would prefer used to match the ones already in the engine, but still in
usable shape.

He (Derek) has had his bus off the road for months.  Please help him to
drive a bus again.

Please respond to me and I will get the message to him.

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
