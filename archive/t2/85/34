Subject: Fuel Injection problems

Hello Fellow Bus Friends:

I have been trouble shooting my 78 for several months
now (I bought it from a guy who let it sit for 5 years
after letting all the gas out of he
tank)(surprisingly, little rust)  anyways, I have been
following bentley pretty good but I am in a tough
spot.  

I had to replace the fuel pump because it was seized
up, replaced the fuel filter, all fuel line.  The
results I know of so far: the cold start valve works
because the thing fires at the little bit if fuel that
the valve supplies.  I pulled the injectors, none of
them fire any fuel.  The hot lead is working just
fine, because if I ground a test light elsewhere, it
lights.  I understand that the negative is switched
for the injectors.

Can anybody give me any leads, any secrets?  I have
tested most things on the long plug thingy, don't
remember what it is called right now, they all seem
fine.  I have a few more to test.

Help? Anybody?

Kindest Regards

Mark
