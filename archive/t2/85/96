happy to buy them.

The handle is being repo'd and sold by almost all on-line vendors.

But you lost me on 'all 4 side turn indicators'......
If you mean the rectangular side markers. The 2 orange ones on the front doors
are just reflecters. The 2 red ones on the rear corners are just side marker
lights. None of them 'flash' with the turn signals.
