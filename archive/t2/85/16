That fiberglass wrap is usually used to cut down the temperature in the
engine compartment--race cars have used it for years.

You want cooler air, get one of those cold air induction things which is
basically a hose sticking out the front of your car with a funnel on it to
guide the air into the hose. (I would show you one on a Miata, but the guy
took it off his site.)
