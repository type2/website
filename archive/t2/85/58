Subject: emissions afterburner was Engine-neering - combustion chamber question

They are a crude form of additional emissions control, some unburned fuel
makes it to the exhaust no matter what, it contributes to photochemical smog.
This is especially true on a carbed engine which is far less efficient in
terms of fuel delivery.  it is cleaner to burn the fuel then spray it out.
theoretically anyway. so yeah that IS inefficient, that is gas that could be
used to make the car go and money that could be in your wallet and pollution
that could be avoided, good reasons to keep FI and keep it in good shape for
which ever reason is closest to your heart - money in your pocket or a cleaner
car.
