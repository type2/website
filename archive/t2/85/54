Subject: BBB VI, another great raffle prize

   I just got the word from the guy that makes the fiberglass ribbed bumpers
for me that he is donating 2 bumpers to our raffle. These along with a TURN
KEY rebuilt 1600 (IT RUNS), 2 not 1 rebuilt split bus transmissions, A SCAT
bus shifter, TMI door panels, kick panels and front seat covers of your
choice, EMPI duel port big valve heads, Bus side step from Bus-Boys, Pop-out
frames from Wolfsgang,complete GERMAN window rubber kit from OE V-Dub, a
BEAUTIFUL split bus quilt from Patricia Bell (LBB member) and the list go's
on. This is just a small portion of what we have had donated to help the
children. For those of you who don't know, all the profits from this event
are GIVEN to Arizona Children's home for abused children. The money donated
stays in Lake Havasu to help these children and without all the generous
donations and all  of you buying  raffle tickets, paying your entry fee and
BIDDING high in our Auction this wouldn't be done. With the events of
9/11/2001 funds for other charities have dwindled, so with all of you let's
see what we can do for the kids, OUR FUTURE BUS DRIVERS
