Subject: Front panels for sale

Hello everyone,

I have a spare driver side and passenger side front
door panels for a '70 something bus for sale.  They
are beige with very few marks.  I can send pictures of
them and I also have the window handles, bracket
thingies, and door handles as well.  $60 plus shipping
takes them all.

Have a great day,

Tesa
'75 Buster the Big Blue Bus
