And so can thick headers.  It just takes longer for them to warm up 
due to the added mass.

The heat has to escape somewhere or else heat up the pipe.  If you 
insulate the outside of the pipe, the pipe will heat up to the 
temperature of the exhaust gas, as little of the heat can escape 
through the insulation.

The bus pipes may last longer than thin headers, but it will 
definitely corrode faster internally than unwrapped headers.  The fact 
that metal corrodes faster at higher temperatures is not affected by 
the thickness of the metal involved.
