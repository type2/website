Check the above story out, someone must have been trying to regain a stock 
look for an old military thing! oops.

Additionally, I keep trying to send this letter to the list about this new 
adventurwagen we have, and some issues we have been running into with it, 
but it never makes it.

I never seem to get any returned mail about it either, is there something 
wrong with using the word adventurewagen to the list?
