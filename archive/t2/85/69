Subject: Cheap 1/4" 25000rpm electric die grinder - 16.99 

I ordered one of the 1/4" 25000rpm electric die grinders from Ebay for 16.99
to play with my heads a bit more and knowing full well it was Chinese and
probably not great. Well it arrived just now, and being a gear head I took
it apart to see what I were buying. Imagine my surprise! It has 4 ball
bearings supporting the shaft in all the right places to take the side load
and a pretty good assembly. Definitely not a Bosch, but DEFINITELY a Makita
clone. Time to go and finish porting those 040 heads! Thought you guys and
gals might like to know.
Regards,
Courtney
