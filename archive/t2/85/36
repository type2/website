Looks are deceiving.
The tin heat shield will rust. The crossover will rust.
The exhaust pipes will not. But the flanges on the ends will.
Get a magnet and check the 2 exhaust pipes coming off the heads and going to the
U pipes.
And the U pipes are stainless also. They have a tin shield on them also that
will rust.
