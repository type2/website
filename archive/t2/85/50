Subject: Platinum Plugs

Hi Folks,

A friend of mine has a '71 Westy with a rebuilt 1641, and has a question 
about platinum plugs.  Please reply to him at: whoajesus(-at-)hotmail.com

Does anyone have any experience with "platinum" spark plugs in the 1600
engine? Muir says don't use them (but doesn't say why); but Bob Hoover
recommends them -- mostly because they last longer between plug changes and 
fewer plug changes means less stress on the head over its lifetime. I've 
noticed the carbureted 1600 engine tends to dirty its plugs up faster than 
modern FI engines -- and today's plugs with captive washers don't take well 
to being cleaned and reinstalled (they're more prone to leak when the washer 
is reused). So, my question is this ... do the platinum plugs resist 
deposits and fouling better than copper electrode plugs? In other words, 
will they actually last longer WITHOUT being removed to clean them. If so, 
can anyone provide a platinum plug part # that's equivalent to the Bosch 
W8TI that I usually run in my '71 bus engine? Thanks.
