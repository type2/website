Hello,
A few months ago I purchased a rebuilt head from Bus Depot for my 78
Westy. I ended up getting a good used motor from
another listee out of a 76 Westy. So I never used the head or even took
it out of the box. Will this head I bought  for a hydraulic lifter motor
work on mine with the solid lifters? Are they the same? Knowing how
often our buses drop valve seats I don't mind keeping
this as a spare. I know it's heavy to carry around in the camper as a
spare, but I could always have a relative overnight it to me
if I broke down on the road away from home.

Thanks,

Bill M
