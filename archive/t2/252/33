"Will this one work on my 77 2.0L FI engine?  Or do I
need an special
attachment like on the 7827?"  

you won't need a special attachment for a 2.0, it
takes regular spark plug size and the compression
tester comes in metric and standard.  I have a normal
compression tester and it fits the 14 and 18 and fits
my 83 2.0 perfectly.  And yes, 11.99 is a really good
price, they are usually $20 -50 at autoparts stores. 
Really good piece of equipment to have - I bring one
and a spark plug wrench every time I go to check out a
car for possible purchase.
