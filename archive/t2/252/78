Subject: Re: [T2] Imported Mexican Busses

[...]
In one of the newsgroups a while back i posted the exact inspection 
standards that a vehicle of new manufacture must pass to be imported 
into the US.  There are over  23 failure points on the inspection  
lists regarding safety issues.  trying to sneak one in through canada 
probably wont work either because the US and  Canada have very similar 
import laws.
add to that is that the required sample vehicles have never been 
submitted to any of the test  labs that the DOT uses to  establish what 
needs to be changed after they fix all of the known problems.
  I have recently  also run accross some stuff that suggests that VW is 
not happy that those vehicles left South America.  I think they are 
going to run head on into the new microbus in the UK
The vehicles are  legal  under certain licensing in the UK.  UK people 
have to sort that out with the licensed importers of the vehicles.
