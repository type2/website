Subject: RE: Asbestos?

This talk of asbestos make me a bit nervous as I believe the tubes (from the
fan to the heat exchanger entrance) in my engine compartment are original.
Do these have asbestos??  Please NO!!!
I can visualize all the times I've removed those to get at the air cleaner
and AFM.

Yup. Put a do not disturb sign out to hang on the door handle under there.

This is what's there, two white collars:

There are NLA which means now lingering asbestos. ;-) I saved this
information below from the archives last time I asked about them.

1) The asbestos parts can be replaced with late beetle (76-79) collars, VW
p/n 111 819 945, or you can replace the entire flex pipe assembly. The late
beetle units are made of rubber; last week I got 4 of them from a VWFLAPS
used for $CDN10.00 . New units are available from a VW dealer for $CDN15.

2) Subject: RE: Accordian Heater Tube
The vanagon gasket fits just fine,

from 80-83.5 vanagons they had the same style heater accordion tubes but
with a silicone gasket instead of an asbestos one.

Probably still available from VW.

That is because they are, dealt with many times, get the red or black
silicone rubber grommets from a junkyard Vanagon.  The vanagon has
one straight and one bent one, you need two straight ones so find two
vanagons.  Last forever and seal a whole pile better than the asbestos
did to boot.

my 78 has hyd valves and I'm not sure this is as big a problem, BUT I have
temp guages and I know that at any speed over 55 or so the temps start
climbing.  in cooler temps I can do 65 and the engine stays within the
limits I have set for myself (230 slow down, 240 slow down to 55, 250 pull
over and leave engine run at high idle while it cools down, if it goes up
at all, shut it down and get lunch, have never gotten to 250 following
those rules)

A people carrier about 15,000.00
And for a Dormobile type camper about 18,000.00.
