Subject: Re: [T2] '78 Westy Camper prices - again

.  Even rigs with major body damage & rust, and/or needing expensive =
repairs are listed with prices of $3,000 and up.

Asking and actually getting those prices are two different things. I =
recently tried to sell my '77 Westy which has NO body damage, NO =
significant rust, and needs NO repairs that I am aware of. In fact, it =
has new canvas, new window rubber, new door seals, and 4 fairly new =
Michelin LT tires, plus lots of other new/extra items. I was pretty firm =
on 4K, but while I got lots of responses, none were serious. Now my ads =
have expired, and luckily I've decided to keep it. =20
