Personally, I would go for the one with the quick release hose.  It's a pain to get the hose to thread into the spark plug holes thru the engine tin and it's much easier to "wind" the hose tight when no gauge is attached.

Having said this, the Mightvac brand compression gauge at most flaps is $30, less than the CP7827 and looks identical.
