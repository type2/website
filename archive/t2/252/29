[...]
the following from lookup  results
a  check of the name servers reveals a bulk name server from qwest.
this business is buried behind three layers of web. date of registry is 
july this year.
I know of one local individual that does enet business under a name 
different than his store front  maint shop.  he is buried in a similar 
way.  so it is hard to tell if this is a good front or a good business 
without referrals.
