Not too bad price wise---
For a brand new Brazillian Van---about $11,000.00 
A people carrier about 15,000.00
And for a Dormobile type camper about 18,000.00.
"Independant heating system, and 3 year warrantee as standard"
These thnigs must be able to be imported from the UK---


Later,

Didn't they quit making the new vintage style Beetles thus drying up the
supply of car bodies for these folks? 
We've got one new "vintage" Beetle here in town and it is very nice
looking. Gets cared for well, lives in a garage. Chris M. <"Busbodger"
