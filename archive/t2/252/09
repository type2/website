Thanks for the great info, I like the chart.  After starting the bus
up last night (allowed gasket maker to cure around throttle body), my
reading was about 15" and it would regularly drop 1-2", then come back
up.  According to the chart, this is "burned valve" or "plug not firing".
I doubt it is the former, since I replaced both the heads <100 miles ago.
I'll try troubleshooting the spark tonight.

Good idea to stopper everything.  Can I stopper the aux air regulator?
Doesn't this require air flow at startup time?  It is my understanding
that this provides extra air at startup and closes after the engine warms
up.

If it comes down to the manifold boots or manifold-to-head gaskets, can I
replace these without dropping the engine?  This could be tricky...
