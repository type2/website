I am mainly talking about the stock peashooter bug exhaust, it seems to
exhaust right in the worst place to suck back into the back.  If your seals
are good, then it will work.  I ran that stock bug muffler for another year
after the co poisoning event and after replacing the hatch seal.  A stinger
or other custom 1600 muffler would work fine if the outlet isn't in the
worst spot.  Monza probably ain't the best.  I actually have a dual quiet
pack on my 1835 right now, made for a bug, sounds good but I wouldn't
recommend it because the fit quality of the welds and the headers are crap
(EMPI).  Exhausts a bit more to the sides, but not as much as stock.
