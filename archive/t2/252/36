>>I think you can get under the headliner without removing it.<<

yes! this is how its done.
 
>>However, take a look at this Bus Depot post from the Vangon 
list, aparently you do not have to remove the rack to replace 
the seal:<<

if your bus was anything like mine, you will want to get under there
& clean it out. there were too many leaves/pine needles/etc. under
there for my liking. also some rust IIRC.
