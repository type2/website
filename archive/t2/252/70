Subject: '71 Transporter FS 

My friend has to sell this bus.  (collecting cash to build a motor for his
'73 Westi)

'71 FS.  Great complete interior, rubber mats the whole deal.  F & R bumper!
Nose is bondo.  Needs engine.  Needs brakes and rubber lines checked out. 

Sliding door vent window is smashed out and covered in plastic/tape (PO
locked himself out and busted window to get in).  Have replacement glass
vent assembly included.  

Normal rocker rust and battery tray rust.

He could part it out for a lot more than he wants for it, but wants someone
to restore it.  Could be a very easy daily driver.  In Smyrna (Atlanta) GA.
