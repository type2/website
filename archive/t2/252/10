Subject: Re: [T2] bug muffler on 1600 bus


Jim,

I had a bug muffler and almost asphyxiated my girlfriend!  Didn't realize
the rear hatch seal was so bad.

Its worth the extra $30 to have the correct bus muffler.

'70 Westy "Rebertha"
(who has a used Ernst bug muffler if anyone needs one for a bug).
