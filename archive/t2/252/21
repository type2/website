Hello again,
Me the Canadian guy with the 72 van

Last night i went to the wrecker and removed the entire rear light=20
components including all the wiring.just wondering what that box is
that the some of the wires are going into attached to the top of the =
engine compartment?and also all the vans i've seen have the red and =
orange wire cut off.
what is this box and what is that wire that is always cut off?

Thanks,
