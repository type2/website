Subject: Re: [T2] Question for Ron the Bus Depot guy

Hey Ron thanks for the response, I wasnt trying to accuse you or the Bus
Depot of anything. I have always had GREAT service from you guys and I
understand that mess ups happen especially keeping up with and shipping
parts to all over the US.

Thanks again
