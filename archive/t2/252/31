Subject: Re: [T2] vendor question

Okay color me confused. i do parts searches on known items on my shelf 
and i get part numbers on that site that look like rebuild company part 
numbers.  I  do a search  by the bosch number and it takes me to the 
same part numbers.  I  cant find a bosch part number listing that 
matches  his part numbers.
