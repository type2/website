Subject: Re: [T2] Front Shift Bushing Replacement

[...]

I just did this today on my 77. Took me all of 5 minutes!
Put in 1st or 3rd.
Remove square head bolt on coupling at end of front tube.
Slide tube forward off end of middle section.
Lower end and move tube to the rear. The shifter will follow it.
Rotate the tube just enough for the end to clear the hole where the bushing
goes.
Install new bushing.
A word of advice: get the correct bushing. It is part # 211 711 182   It is
NOT the split 111 bug bushing.
Fill the inside of the bushing with grease.
Rotate tube back thru the new bushing and put it back on the end of the tube.
Install bolt and safety wire it.
Piece of cake!
