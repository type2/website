AFAIK, No.  If the brakes work the lights work too.

No. Come to think about it, even if the brakes fail the lights still 
work.

No. The switch is on the master cylinder. There is a fuse on that 
circuit.

I can't tell from here, I am at the office and have no manual available. 
Check ALL of the fuses, it won't take long.

I'd suggest you start at the bulbs, and work forward. Quite often the 
bulbs are blown or the contacts are corroded. The contacts are easy to 
clean with a small scrap of sandpaper. Put a big brick on the brake 
pedal and check for voltage at the bulb housing. Also check to make sure 
there is a good ground from the housing to the body of the bus. If there 
isn't any voltage at the bulb housing THEN move up to test for voltage 
at the master cylinder.
