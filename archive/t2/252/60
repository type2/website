Yup. Put a do not disturb sign out to hang on the door handle under there.

This is what's there, two white collars:

There are NLA which means now lingering asbestos. ;-) I saved this
information below from the archives last time I asked about them.

1) The asbestos parts can be replaced with late beetle (76-79) collars, VW
p/n 111 819 945, or you can replace the entire flex pipe assembly. The late
beetle units are made of rubber; last week I got 4 of them from a VWFLAPS
used for $CDN10.00 . New units are available from a VW dealer for $CDN15.

2) Subject: RE: Accordian Heater Tube
The vanagon gasket fits just fine,

from 80-83.5 vanagons they had the same style heater accordion tubes but
with a silicone gasket instead of an asbestos one.

Probably still available from VW.

That is because they are, dealt with many times, get the red or black
silicone rubber grommets from a junkyard Vanagon.  The vanagon has
one straight and one bent one, you need two straight ones so find two
vanagons.  Last forever and seal a whole pile better than the asbestos
did to boot.
