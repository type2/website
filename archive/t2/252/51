Well, do the spark check, fersure.  unplug the wires one at a time and see
if idle drops.  If it does not, that plug was not firing.  This may be
because the plug wire is bad, the plug is bad, or the plug is fouled.  In
the first two cases, replace the wire/plug.  In the third, drive it for
~15 minutes and try again, especially if the van has been sitting a while
or you have been cranking it w/o starting it (tune up) for a while.  It
may clear up by itself in that case.

Yes.  As Richard says, you will need to remove the aux air valve from the
block to get the hose off the air dist box, and it is a metric <euphemism>
bear </euphemism>, but it ought to be done, as this hose is OEM 99% of the
time and it and the elbo on the other end are a big source of vacuum
leaks.

Yes.  As Richard said, tho, it only needs air for a minute or so, then it
*should* be closing.  If you warm up the bus for two or three minutes, it
ought to be sealed when you start and should have no effect on running
after that.

Nah, it is much easier than it looks :-)  The steps:

1) buy new small injector seals;
2) undo the nuts that hold the injectors to the runners;
3) pull fuel rails and injectors away from the runners;
4) undo the 4 (3 if you have porsche heads) nuts holding the runners to
   the heads;
5) pull runners out and up to remove.

Re-assembly:

USE the new small injector seals!!!!
Make sure the injectors lie naturally in the runners.  The rings and nuts
will *NOT* pull them up tight and into line!  You *will* have a vacuum
leak if they are twisted!
If you have not replaced your fuel line lately, this is an excellent
opportunity to do so, eh?
