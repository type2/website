Subject: Imported Mexican Beetles?

I thought I would ask on this group as I do not have post access to the
rec.autos.makers.vw.aircooled. Anyway some time last year I came across
a web site of a company importing Mexican beetles. They would place
mostly new Beetle parts (engine, etc.) on a 73 belly pan as this allowed
them to title the car as a 73 and hence avoid the new crash and
pollution requirements. They would import hardtops and convertibles. I
think their name was Bug World (www.bugmotors.com).

Anyway they do not seem to be around anymore. I did a search and the
only company I could find still in existence was Beetlemex in Arizona
which only imports hard tops. All the other companies importing bugs
seems to have gone out of business. Is this due to VWOA or just the
economy?

My question, does anyone know of a company importing convertibles?

Thanks in advance.
