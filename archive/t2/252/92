Subject: not sparking everytime

I went out and got a timing gun and while timing I noticed the light didn't 
fire on every rotation of the engine. It would fire say any where from 9/10 
times to 7/10 times. I tried it on different spark plug wires and found some 
cylinders to be better than others. Is this normal? Point to a problem with 
points? condensor? dizzy cap? rotor? coil? all of the above?

Thanks for any advice.
Jon
