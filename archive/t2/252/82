Hi everyone,
Me, the guy with the 72 van.

just wondering if anyone knows any troubleshooting methods for the brake =
lights?
if the brakes need bleeding could that effect the brake lights?
could it be the booster?
is there a relay switch on the fuse box for the brake lights?
i think the fuse is ok.my belief is that it is the second fuse from the =
end=20
starting to count from the left it is the second last one on the right =
side?sound correct?
any way to test the wires at the booster?
thanks,
Darren
