Hello all,
 
   71 Dormobile with a 71 bug engine. My question is
 
why when I stomp on the brakes why do I loose my idle. 
 
I can vary the engine speed at idle by how hard I push 
 
on the brakes. Just changed my master cylinder, (no
 
vacuum here) and all hoses that run to the booster. 
 
I have checked and rechecked the check valve in the
 
engine and no problems. Could I have a torn diaphragm?
 
Brakes work great now and I can't here any hissing.
 
Maybe a hose is collapsing onto itself? I have one rubber 
 
hose underneath, but all rest are the fabric coated type. 
 
All comments welcomed,
 
Paul Saulsbury
