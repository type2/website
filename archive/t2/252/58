Subject: RE: [T2] Front Shift Bushing Replacement

I have another take on the replacement of the shift bushing.  I had a
bushing so worn out that the shifter came out of the rod, and I lost the
pin!  Panic ensued, as I needed to be somewhere right now in that car.  I
went to the hardware store and bought a clevis pin that matched EXACTLY the
shifter pin!   Cut that to length, all set.  The bushing was not availiable
anywhere I looked, so I went to the generic parts store.  I found a GM power
brake booster grommet that was an almost perfect fit!  I know it probably
will not last as long as the original, but it got me going in a pinch!
