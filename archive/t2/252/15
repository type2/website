Hey everyone.
Me, the Canadian guy 72 van

I just read a couple of responses to backfiring.
I took my van for a long journey last night at a constant
speed of about 70-75 mph. I was trying to keep up to two hippie=20
girls that drove by in thier van! thing is after driving at a high speed =
for
about 45 minutes i came to a turn off and i heard my van backfire.
it wasnt backfiring before that. would this mean i need to adjust the =
valves.
your comments are appreciated.
Darren
