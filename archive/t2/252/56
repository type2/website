Subject: Re: [T2] '78 Westy Camper prices - again


 I think its just a push/pull thing. Old chevs did the same thing, for years
 everybody wanted a tri five or 58 and early 60's iron went cheap, not
 anymore. I've noticed the same thing,  its getting harder to find cheap
 early bay windows anymore.

 campers, and the asking prices are often 2 or 3 times higher than I'd
expect
 based on long term experience.  Even rigs with major body damage & rust,
 and/or needing expensive repairs are listed with prices of $3,000 and up.
