Subject: Re: [T2] Westy Luggage Rack Seal

I think you can get under the headliner without removing it. 
However, take a look at this Bus Depot post from the Vangon 
list, aparently you do not have to remove the rack to replace 
the seal:

Thanks,

The complete Go Westy kit is the same price as mine ($79 for 
theirs, versus $78 for mine with listmember discount). But 
not all kits are the same.  Mine is better, and exclusive to 
the Bus Depot.  This was my very first product when I started 
the Bus Depot, and over the years I have refined it further 
to make it easier to install, more reliable, and closer to 
stock.  By comparison, the others just sell a generic length 
of weatherstrip and call it "poptop seal."

1)  Mine is the only poptop seal kit that requires no 
adhesive. It simply clips on, using no-rust impregnated 
aluminum clips. Not just the poptop and luggage rack 
sections, but even the front seal section (between the two). 
It holds permanently, with no glue and no mess.

2)  My poptop seal is custom made to my specs, specifically 
for VW campers, not a generic seal.  The location of 
the "insulation bulb" is just slightly lower, and closer to 
the location of the insulation flap on the original VW seal.  
Also, the finish is a bit smoother, closer to the stock 
look.  By comparison, my competitors just ship a generic, off-
the-shelf length of weatherstrip as "poptop seal."

3)  Whereas the other suppliers simply ship a shorter length 
of the same generic "poptop seal" as a luggage rack seal, I 
ship a specialized luggage rack seal.  It is not, and should 
not be, the same as the poptop seal.  If you look at the 
original VW luggage rack seal, it really isn't a "seal" at 
all but more of a decorative trim that matches the poptop 
seal. In fact it has no insulation bulb that seals the 
luggage rack to the roof top.  There's a good reason for 
that. If you look at your luggage rack you'll see that it has 
holes for rainwater drainage. That rainwater must then get 
past the luggage rack trim to the van's rain gutter. A tight 
sealing seal can trap rainwater under your luggage rack.  My 
seal allows correct drainage.  As a second benefit, its 
design makes it possible to install it without having to 
remove or loosen your luggage rack, as you can (just barely) 
fit it in place with the rack intact (saving you a lot of 
installation time/hassle).However, I should note that in the 
case of wind noise caused by a loose luggage rack, it may be 
neccessary to remove/tighten the luggage rack after all (or 
even, in extreme circumstances, use a bulbed seal, which we 
can supply, although this is rarely necessary and not 
recommended unless absolutely needed).

So, I can safely say that you can not get a better poptop 
seal kit for your Westy than mine, anywhere or at any price.

My part number for the complete kit is WESTYRUBBER.  Make 
sure to ask for your listmember discount.
