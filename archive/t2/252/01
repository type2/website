In my book, 15" is a minimum at idle and I like to see 17-18".  I keep
finding different charts that show the different symptoms.  her's one from
GM, but they are all the same:

15-18" of vacuum.

Not noticibly.

You have a vacuum leak.

If this is FI, that "sucking wind" sound is probably normal, especially at
the throttle body. The way idle speed is set on FI is that a bit of air is
allowed to bypas the throttle butterfly and it does make a hiss as it
does.

All these sound good.  In addition, head out to a scientific supply store
or old-fashioned hobby shop (do these even exist any more???) and buy a
supply of rubber stoppers.  Stopper everthing coming off the "big hose"
and the air dist box (decel valve, brake booster, crancase vent, etc. etc.
and see if that helps.  If it does not, then it's the manifold to block
gaskets or the big hoses from the runner to the air dist box.  If it does,
start adding accesories one at a time until you find the one that is
leaking.
