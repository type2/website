 Matthew,

     Well, that is a good question.  I have still not decided between a
Vanagon or Bay.  Both have their advantages & disadvantages.  I like the
power of the bay but the room & more stable ride in the Vanagon make it
attractive too.  This fire has nothing to do with which van I pick.  I was
having these thought as soon as I got sold the 82 Westy I had.  Vanagons are
also a bit easier to change the fuel lines on. :)  Depends on what the
insurance gives me.
