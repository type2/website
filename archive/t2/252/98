Back in 1993 I was driving my 1971 super beetle home and parked it in the driveway which was on a slope.  There had been a bad gas smell for a while but I didn't worry about it enough to locate it.

5 minutes later my roommate came home and said my car was on fire and I need to move it away from his house.

I waltzed down to the end of the driveway and sure enough there was a blue flame flickering from one of the  pea shooter tailpipes. I bent down and blew it out like a candle and this freaked out my roommate to no end as I waltzed back into the house.

I took it to the nearest shop the next day and they replaced a gasket (maybe) in the mechanical fuel pump which had caused gas to leak, run down the engine tin and onto the hot tailpipe.

There's no moral to this story except be ruthless about the state of your VW especially if it's more than 20 years old.
