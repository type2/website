Subject: gas line paranoia?


Folks,

After all of our discussions about changing gas lines, I am 
beginning to get a little paranoid.

I've been driving my 68 bug to work this week and when checking the
temperature when I got home last night, I noticed the fuel line
from pump to the carb leaking.

This is the second time this summer that I have found such a condition on
one of my vw's.  The line in question still has the audi/vw printing on it
and is not discolored in any way.  It was brittle around where the
clamp was.

I *know* that the line is about 2 years old.  It was purchased from a 
local vwflaps that has a 5 bay repair shop in the back, so I know that it 
was not old when I bought it.

This vw has does not run hot(212 oil temp on a 90 degree day) so the line 
has not been subjected to a lot of abuse.

Has anyone else noticed gas lines that seem to be going bad before their 
time...or is it just me?<grin>  Seems to me that the lines used to last a 
lot longer!

Cheers, dave
