Subject: [T2] FTC investigation of Maryland VW shop

I was contacted by the Federal Trade Commission about a Wheaton, Maryland VW repair shop. I was not the one that made the complaint to them as I have already licked my wounds and moved on. I filled them in on my terrible experience with this company. If anyone on this list believes that this company gave you poor service or would like to know, offlist, what the company was or who at the FTC to contact, do not hesitate to contact me. 
Warmest regards,
Howard "Maui Haui" Anderson

'72 Transporter "Cool breeze"
'71 Ghia "No name yet"
