my 78 has hyd valves and I'm not sure this is as big a problem, BUT I have
temp guages and I know that at any speed over 55 or so the temps start
climbing.  in cooler temps I can do 65 and the engine stays within the
limits I have set for myself (230 slow down, 240 slow down to 55, 250 pull
over and leave engine run at high idle while it cools down, if it goes up
at all, shut it down and get lunch, have never gotten to 250 following
those rules)

or pulled over by the local constabulary since they are everywhere around
here on any road you can think about going that fast.

for sure, one reason I set my hyd at 1-1.5turns rather than 2turns as
reccomended

I want far, lots far......so far 310k and counting (now if I could get the
auto tranny to hold up as well as the 2liter bottom end)
