Subject: RE: [T2] Deep Cycle Battery FAQ

Hi David,
As always, you've done your homework. The ACM battery I'm looking at
weighs about 50 lbs, but I can live with that. As you know, It's mainly
the reefer draw I'm looking at, at 4.5 amps/hr, plus stereo (no power
amp) and interior lights. I do have a built-in 10amp charger when hooked
up to shore power. And I also want to use it as a backup cranker. So the
trade-off should be okay for my application, don't you think? I would
also like to ask you about the life of the ACM vs the gel relative to
number of discharge cycles. What I've read indicates the ACMs have an
advantage in that respect, although I have no numbers. Could you give us
your view?
Thanks,

The FAQ didn't mention one important drawback with AGM batteries.  They
have a bad power-to-weight ratio (when compared to traditional flooded
deep-cycle batteries) in low-current applications.  "Low current
applications" means a few amps, or enough to power a couple of lights,
stereo/TV, or a 5.5 amp refrigerator.  :)  Under those conditions, an
AGM will weigh between 1.5 and 2 times as much as an equivalent flooded
battery and take up more space as well.  This is worth considering if
you want to have a lot of battery power and you are concerned about
space and weight.  
A typical group 27 flooded battery will have a capacity of 120 amp-hours
and weigh about 50 lbs.  
A typical AGM battery of the same form factor will have a capacity of
100 amp-hours and weigh 90 lbs!
Every time you accelerate, brake or turn, you are paying a penalty for
that extra weight.

In high-current applications, AGM batteries redeem themselves because of
a better Peukerts coefficient which is why you will often see them in
electric cars.  If you think the solar industry is tuned in to deep
cycle battery issues, you should try the electric vehicle mailing list,
right Chris?  Those guys are on the bleeding edge and taught me a lot
about batteries.
