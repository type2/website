Subject: Re: [T2] Headrests (again)

I have replied on the list to every headrest question.....

Headrests were 1st offered in 1973. They were one-year-only because of the
release button on each post.
74/75 were soft vinyl with a zipper along the bottom from post to post. Age is
getting to them. Almost all have the material between the zipper and the vinyl
deteriorating and splitting.
76 to 79 were hard vinyl. The sun hardens them.....

They all will fit any 73 to 79 bay bus seat. They will not fit Vanagon seats.
I have not seen any original 72 and back seats having the tubes welded in the
seat back frame....

I have almost every color 76 and up headrests in pairs, EXCEPT black. Black is
very tough to find. I have a few pairs of 74/75 headrests also but they are
not in the best shape.....
