Subject: 2 questions

I am rebuilding a stock 2.0L FI motor for my '77.

1) Are the cam plugs for type1 and type4 motors the same?

2) The openings on my HD Melling oil pump are much larger than the stock case
openings for the oil flow. Will this be a problem? Will the larger flow out of
the pump be restricted by the smaller oil openings in the case?

BTW, Thanks to Ron and the crew at the Busdepot for great products and service
through my rebuild.
