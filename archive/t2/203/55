I think that would be risky.  What if you forget to stop the discharge at 50%?

I used to run a normal starting battery on the right and two group-27 RV/Marine batteries in parallel on the left, turned sideways (yes, they stuck out a little but it worked fine).  They lasted about two years.  After two sets of them I decided it was for the birds and tried Trojan golf cart batteries, two 6V in series (inside the bus, they were too tall for the engine compartment.  Equal-to-better performance, plus I just passed the 5-year anniversary of the manufacture date on the batteries and they still hold most of their rated capacity.  Five solid years of 200+ amp hour performance for $110 - that is a bargain.  Go to a golf cart shop and get fresh ones,  don't buy the junk Exide ones at Sams Club.
