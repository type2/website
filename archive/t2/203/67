I just ordered the 3 1/8 tack from Bus Depot to mount in my clock
position on a 79 bus. They say a mounting adaptor is required for this,
but is no longer available, and I will have to fabricate one. Before I
reinvent the wheel, thought it wise to query the list to see if anyone
has already done this or has ideas.
Thanks,
