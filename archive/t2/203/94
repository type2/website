Hi Don,

Yes you can use a cheaper non rev-limiting rotor arm, but then run the risk of damaging your engine due to over reving. 
More revs = more heat being generated which will be beyond the cooling capacity of the system. Yes the fan will turn faster too but will not push proportionally more air through the same fixed gap and the cooling becomes progressively more inefficient as the engine speed rises.

Basically you make the choice between definitely spending a small amount on a rev limiting rotor arm or possibly a large amount on (another) new engine.

The only time I would not recommend using a rev limiting rotor arm is if you have a late bay with full emissions control including a catalytic convertor as the rev limiting rotor arm cuts out the spark and allows unburnt fuel into the cat which will spoil it quickly.

Good luck
