People who responded to my earlier post

Thanks for your responses.

I just stopped by the junk yard yesterday, and pulled the clock.

It is the old style, with the silver style face of the early bays, not the 
black face of the later year bays.  It was manufactured in '68!!

It does work fine, but I think I will put it into the '72 that I hope to get 
on the road some day, just to make it complete.  I will probably pull the 
tachometer that is now in the '72 to free up the third housing for the 
clock.

The interesting thing about this early clock (apparently) is that it is a 
wind up clock!!.  I connected some power/ground to the clock and there was a 
noticeable and quick 'ka-zoom'.  This must have been the clock winding up, 
because when I disconnected the power/ground from the clock, it just kept on 
ticking!!

I wonder how long it will run without power??  Anybody care to guess?
