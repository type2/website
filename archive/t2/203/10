Looking at the horn button, then at the silver ring underneath it.
Don't try to pry the silver ring up; slip a blunt knife or whatever
between the ring and the button. Slide the knife around the per-
imeter of the button to loosen it, then gently pry it up. Too much
pressure might chip it instead of releasing it.
