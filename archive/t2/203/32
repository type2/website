Subject: Re: Guages - final

Here is how I did my three little gauges. I did taco, op, ot, and still
have my original burnt out tach in the clock pod.  Looks lopsided, but
it's just the angle I was taking the picture at.  I used the rubber
three gauge pod, $15 bucks a couple of years ago.  It doesn't get in the
way, is very easy to see, and as one of my non VW friends said, wow
these came with alot of gauges for an old car!  He thought it looked
stock - good enough for me.
