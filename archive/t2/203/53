The FAQ didn't mention one important drawback with AGM batteries.  They have a bad power-to-weight ratio (when compared to traditional flooded deep-cycle batteries) in low-current applications.  "Low current applications" means a few amps, or enough to power a couple of lights, stereo/TV, or a 5.5 amp refrigerator.  :)  Under those conditions, an AGM will weigh between 1.5 and 2 times as much as an equivalent flooded battery and take up more space as well.  This is worth considering if you want to have a lot of battery power and you are concerned about space and weight.  
A typical group 27 flooded battery will have a capacity of 120 amp-hours and weigh about 50 lbs.  
A typical AGM battery of the same form factor will have a capacity of 100 amp-hours and weigh 90 lbs!
Every time you accelerate, brake or turn, you are paying a penalty for that extra weight.

In high-current applications, AGM batteries redeem themselves because of a better Peukerts coefficient which is why you will often see them in electric cars.  If you think the solar industry is tuned in to deep cycle battery issues, you should try the electric vehicle mailing list, right Chris?  Those guys are on the bleeding edge and taught me a lot about batteries.
