And here I had confined my reply to pmail to avoid embarrasing this 
gentleman.

--This guy owns vwclubs.us and vwclubs.com

--This guy has already got a cease and desist notice, predictably, he 
now admits

--This guy told VWOA in writing to get stuffed

--This guy now wants to trade the domains for a vehicle of some value 
(both domains for "a nice one").

Uh, people can do what they want. Maybe somebody will go for his 
offer. =^ )
