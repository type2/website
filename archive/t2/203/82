personally I had a side tent on my 65 and I found that I prefer a regular
tent set up facing the side of the bus with a tarp over the bus and front
of the tent.  can drive away and not have to perfectly line up to the side
tent when you get back, also since my kids are older I and I think they
preferred the distance
