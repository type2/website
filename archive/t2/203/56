Bob,

Not to insult you or anything, but I personally thing putting the gauges
under the dash is not a bright idea. I have learned from experience that
you need to keep an eye on gauges (saved my Mercedes 300D from an
untimely death many a time by watching them). Having them under the dash
would cause you to have to look down, and not see the road, whereas with
top of the dash you have some view of the road, with it under the dash
you would have none. Again, this is not to insult you, but it is just
what I see as being a logical reason not to put them under the dash.
