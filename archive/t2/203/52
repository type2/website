Subject: Re: [T2] diff between 74 and 75 engine?

Reference: Tom Wilson's Book, How to Rebuild your Volkswagen Air Cooled
Engine.
Subject: Differences in engines.
#1) You need the engine number prefix (Example 80-83 Vanagon engines are
CV prefix)
#2) There were 1975 only year model heads with larger valves (need you
numbers off the heads, part numbers should both be the same) They have
hole for sensor. Yes you can drill your own hole and thread it.
#3) There are references to early and late year production.
#4) On a 74/75 Bus it is unlikely that you have the original engine. It
could be 1700 to 2000 cc.
#5) A 74/75 engine can mount 1970 cc barrels and a wide variety of
cylinder heads.
In short what you've got is buyer beware. 
However you most likely have a useable engine of the crank hasn't spun a
main or hammered out the case.
If it will fit in the van you can run it
