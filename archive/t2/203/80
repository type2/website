I think big valves are overrated, and therefore I think that the smaller 
valves of the 2.0 heads will not cost you much hp, and may possibly improve 
low end torque due to greater velocity.

The bore is larger on a 2 liter - 94mm vs. 93mm on the 1800.  I'm not sure 
if the outside diameter is exactly the same or not, but it is close enough 
that you can use the same gasket for either one.
