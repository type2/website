Subject: Re: [T2] Long shot, but here goes!

The key to the dizzy part number you are looking for is the vacuum unit that
is supposed to be on it. Short Bosch number 07 092. This unit has 2-5deg Adv,
11-13deg Retard. The 2-5 advance is what sets it aside as being for a bus. You
can raise your sites and get another dizzy that will meet the centrifugal
specs of 12-16 (-at-) 2200, 22-25 (-at-) 3800 by looking for these additional numbers:
043 905 205A, 113 905 205AA, 113 905 205P, or a real close 021 905 205E [yes,
this is a 72 1700 dizzy...]
Using one of these, all you need to do is find the correct 07 092 vacuum unit.
This unit will have 853 on the arm. The long Bosch number is 1 237 121 853.
Good luck!
