Hi Mark,
I've heard this as well, and was curious to see if I got responses or 
specific advice on the oil temperature sensor location placement and how 
placement options related to actual oil temp measurement.

The other oil temp sensor location options would be:
a)
Tee off at the threaded connection used by the original oil pressure switch 
and measure there.
b)
Use a dipstick sensor similar to the Berg style idiot light actuator.

Problem with either of the above two sensor options would be that I think 
there is a higher likelihood of actually measuring engine metal temp than 
actual oil temp.

My thought is that the sump plate,overall, is rather thin metal, but, in 
the center, thickness reinforced so as to have enough thread depth to hold 
the drain plug; therefore it is a low mass item.

Given that configuration, and given that the plate is more readily open to 
air flow as you are going down the highway, I have to think that the drain 
plate will be less impacted by transferred heat from the surrounding engine 
metal, and more in line with the mass of oil contained just behind the thin 
plate.

But then .... !?
