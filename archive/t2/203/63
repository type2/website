Subject: RE: [T2]  Dual battery Relay (Long)

I have to admit not having seen the earlier part of this thread (I could
perhaps have saved some trouble if I had) but I'll see if I can clarify
here...

The purpose of a relay setup such as this is to "isolate" the camping and
starting batteries when the key is off.  So when the bus is running, both
batteries are connected in parallel and charging, but when the bus is off,
the two are separated, such that even if the aux battery dies it will not
drain the starting battery and leave you stranded. This is precisely the
same design that Westfalia used on campers that were equipped with dual
batteries. It is a simple design yet effective. Also, unlike an isolator
setup (which, when its diode fails, will tend to allow the starting battery
to drain), if this setup fails it may cause your aux items not to run but
it's unlikely to leave you unable to start your bus.

Precisely. However, you should make sure to run anything hooked up to the
aux battery through a fuse or fuse block (not "directly" to the battery).

Hella is being a little overcautious here.  To understand what is happening
here, you need to recognize that by design this kit (that is, both the relay
and the included wiring) essentially "trickle charges" the aux battery while
you are driving. It does not "jolt" the aux battery with a supercharge as
soon as you restart your bus.  This is done for safety reasons.  An
electrical engineer from Exide Battery was nice enough to explain the
reasoning for this on the Vanagon list some time ago.  Michael Benthin
reposted it here back in January. For those who are interested, I have
copied it below. It is a very good explanation on how this relay system
works, and why it is _intentionally_ designed to provide a "trickle charge"
to the aux battery, rather than jolting it with full current like a simple
switch (or a larger relay/heavier wiring) would do.

So how does this work?  Let's say you run your aux battery almost completely
dead when camping.  When you start your bus, the relay will close and allow
your starting battery to start your bus. Then it will remain closed,
allowing an intentionally-limited amount of current to pass to the aux
battery, for the purpose of both recharging your aux battery _and_ powering
those items that are wired directly to it.  So if you are not running any
accessories that are hooked up to the aux battery, that full amount will be
used for recharging your aux battery, so it will be recharged in the
shortest possible time.  This is what Hella is recommending.  If, on the
other hand, you use those accessories (i.e. stereo, interior lights, or
whatever you have wired right to the aux battery) while you are driving, the
rate at which the aux battery recharges will be decreased by the rate of
draw of the items that you are using.  As long as what you are using is
_lower_ in total draw than the available current, the aux battery will still
recharge (but at a slower rate).  Only in a situation where the draw of aux
items that you are trying to run _exceeds_ the available current, will you
run into trouble. In that case, the aux battery will not recharge at all,
and those items may not work properly at first (until you let the aux
battery recharge a bit).

What does this mean to you?  It means that if you kill your aux battery, it
will take a bit of driving for it to fully recharge again.  So the solutions
are, either don't completely deplete your aux battery, or if you do, don't
expect it to fully recharge half an hour after you leave the campsite. If
you are a typical user, who uses the aux battery to run a typical stereo at
moderate volume, interior lights, etc. while camped, and then drives a
couple of hours before camping again, you will probably never have a
problem.  A few days of camping, then a bit of driving, is fine, and just
what this relay is good for. On the other hand, there are two scenarios
where a setup that is designed for a faster charge rate is called for.  One
is if you have a monster stereo hooked up to your bus that draws a ton of
current quickly (or something similar that has an incredible current draw).
If so, you may find that you will have to minimize using it when you first
start your bus up again, as it may draw so much current that it keeps the
aux battery from fully recharging.  As long as you go easy on it for a while
when you leave camp, you'll be fine. But if not, you may exceed the relay's
ability to allow the aux battery to recharge.  The other scenario is if you
will use the aux battery long enough to run it down, and then need to use it
again with minimal driving time in between. In that case, the relatively
slow charge rate of this design may be insufficient to allow full recharging
before you camp again.  But both of these scenarios are less than common.
For the average person, the basic relay setup like this is all you need,
which is why Westfalia used the same design themselves.

But that's the point. The whole purpose of the relay is to _keep_ the main
battery from going dead, so that this never happens. This is why you want to
run your aux items directly to the aux battery (via a fuse), not the main
battery, so it is the aux battery that drains when you camp rather than the
main battery.  If the aux items kill your aux battery, then thanks to the
relay your bus will still start, because the main battery is still charged,
which is the whole point.  If your main battery is dead, then this means
that you have some other problem, such as a bad main battery or a bad
alternator, in which case the fact that your camping items won't run is the
_least_ of your problems.

I think that this would defeat the purpose of the relay.  The whole idea is
to hook the consumers up to the camping battery (and optimally use a deep
cycle marine battery for this purpose that is designed for this type of
use).

Below is Beckett Cantrell's  tome on the issue. Hopefully between it and the
above, this clarifies some issues. This is not to say that a relay setup
like the Hella kit is the only way to hook up dual batteries in a bus. But
it does explain how the relay configuration works, and why.
