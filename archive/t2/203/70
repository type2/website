Subject: 1975 Roter and Conpression Questions





1)	My 1975 bus has a 0231 181 012 distributor, this disy uses a speed 
limiting rotor.  Do I need to use this expensive rotor or can I use another 
cheaper one like 04 033.

2)	My motor has about 10,000 on it and I have not done a compression check!  
My gage and the ones I see in the stores consist of a gage, hose and 
threaded fitting.  Now the problem you can not thread into the head while 
holding on to the fitting, I end up trying to twist the hose.  Is there a 
gage out there that will clear the sheet metal?


thank you
Don Miller
