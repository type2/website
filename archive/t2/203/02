My bus has a pod mounted under the dash, to the right of the driver.
I have moved it forward and angled it up but it is still very difficult
to see. I am in the process of desigining an above the visor guage pod
which I hope will work out well for me -- I should be able to mount 6 or 7
gauges there. If this were not possible I would move the gauges from below
the dash to on the dash to the left of the driver. Your mileage may vary,
but I really don't like them down below the dash. I don't want to have
to move my head to see the guages.
