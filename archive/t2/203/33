Subject: Headrests (again)

I see this every so often come accross this list, but I never see a reply - 
maybe the replies have been private so far?
My Bently book says that head restraints were optional in '68-'73.  My PO 
didn't get that option, but I'd really like them in front - I'd feel safer 
driving around.  I'll be re-covering the seats anyhow and they all came with 
the mount spots for the headrests.

Does anybody have a set of these for the front?  Or, even one of these?  Any 
color, any year (68-73), any shape?  Or, does anyone have an idea of who 
might sell these? 

I have checked with the salvage yards around here and have done an online 
salvage yard part request.  Nothing...

I was even thinking that if I could just know how they were made, maybe I 
could make some - I can weld and sew....

Thanks,
Jen
