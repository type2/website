yes, BUT. there was some discussion whther the 'one-size-fits-all' dizzys
were really all that.

plus i do recall possibly karl v. s. bringing up the point that many
'rebuilt' dizzys are NOT rebuilt to the original specs, and there is no way
to know what they actually do as to rpm/advance curve without a
dizzy-testing machine. or an attentive person with a vacuum meter and a
strobe gun :)
