You can use the cheaper one, I do.  I've seen the 5400rpm rev limiting 04016
for as little as $22 but you don't need it.  FYI, the 914 rotor is not the
same, it's 5800rpm.

Some gauges have a hose you can thread into the plug then connect to the
dial gauge with a quick release fitting.  Other types have a rubber end you
have to hold against the plug hole but they are a pain.
