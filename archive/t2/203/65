Subject: Looking at my first 78 Westy

Probably complete newbie questions, but couldn't find the answers.

I just took a look at a 78 Westy and had a few questions that I couldn't find on the web and a few books I have.

1. Is there a way to find out what options/colors were on the 78 Westys?  The one I looked at didn't have the sink/stove and the storage closet was on the passenger side when I'd usually seen it on the drivers.  Is it supposed to cover up a window or did this piece not belong on this bus? Were the sink and table an option or is this bus probably missing it? 

And, if anyone can recommend a site that has the old fabric/material patterns for the seats and beds, that'd be great.  The roof mattress and the two front seats still had the green/gold plaid but the rear seat didn't.

2. I'm pretty new to fixing up old cars but really want to learn. This bus I looked at had pretty bad rust on the engine door, panel below that, rear hatch and sliding door.  Since I'm no pro at welding/bondo are these pieces I could probably pick up off another bus or parts dealer?  And for controling the rust, If most areas are just surface rust, I should be fine with sanding the areas down and priming right?  Should I use that Ruststop chemical stuff - does it really help?

Thanks for any help.  I know if I get this bus I'll probably be kicking myself for it and not saving up for a better condition one, but for the price and the idea of bringing life back to this one is kind of exciting. I'll also be looking forward to the BugOut show in September to pick up more parts from!
