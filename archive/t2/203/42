My thought was $100.  My plan was to rebuild it this winter and have a nice
fresh motor to put in Zeke next spring.  Then i could rebuild the other one
as a spare or just keep the good bits and dump the case on my old one.  I
would like to keep the enigine in my bus as close to original as possible.
I know that my bus is a 73 with a 72 motor, but oh-well.  thanks for the
info.
