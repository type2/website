Subject: Re: [T2] blown 1700 w/dual carbs - value?

When i was doing salvage stuff.  I would generally give $30 for the 
entire engine if frozen and top still looked like it had salvageable 
parts.

Occassionally i would get lucky and only very minor damage.

When an engine was froze in worst case
bad crank
usually one bad head
bearing surfaces destroyed on at least one
This doesnt leave much of value

best case..
rod/lifter/valves problem that locked it up without actually breaking 
anything.  Still a major rebuild though.
