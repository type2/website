Subject: Side tent 4 Bus

My lovely wife has decided that if we are going to be camping with the entire
family, then we need to get a side tent for the rug rats. I saw BusDepot
advertise one for $199 in VW Trends and got VERY excited. However when I
called them tonight they said that they would not have them available for
another 2-3 weeks, but we need one by High Country Bus Festival. So, does
anyone know of a supplier where I can get a decent New side tent for my bus,
preferably for under $250? Doesn't need to be fancy, just useful.

Peace, John Baker
