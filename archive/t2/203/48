Subject: Re: [T2] Deep Cycle Battery FAQ

Hmm- I read this- so if you live in a temperate zone, 2 "hybrid" deep
cycle batteries in parallel(no relay) should work in a temperate climate
(zero degrees is rare).   This should safely allow both to go to 50%
discharge and still start the bus.  Should last longer that way. 
Interesting that to get the same cranking capacity as the stock size of
CCA battery, the deep cycle must be 20% larger- that should be easy as
we have a lot of room for changing to larger batteries.
