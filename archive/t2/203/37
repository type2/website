Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Temp sensor - Where to sense?

Years ago when running type 1s I saw  a  lot of debate on this.  I had 
an engine on the stand at the time and several temp senders and gauges 
on hand.  I wasnt worried about actual temp so much as variances at 
different points.  As this case was going to be scrapped i also wasnt 
too  worried about drilling all over the place.
Notes are
1. per hoover and others..do not use the tee fitting for temps.  with no 
flow through you are getting case temp. did this in several locations 
and the temp was generally within a couple degrees of the case once 
warmed up.
2. the drain hole was  a reasonable point and was cooler than what was 
going to the cooler by as much as 30
  drilling the case neat the drain hole gave different readings by about 
20 degrees. hotter when still, cooler at what would be highway airflow 
(big typhoon fan blowing on it)  This said i was in a very variable 
area.But when engine temps were high..  the differences between the 
sensors  narrowed to within the range of error of the gauges.Being as we 
are worried about what is happening to the oil when engine is hot...the 
oil sump is not a bad location.  Also oil flow is going to be very heavy 
when running at speed giving you much less of a case reading.
3. I ended up using a drilling into the oil galley from the pulley end 
of the engine to put the oil pressure switch in and put the oil temp 
sender in the original oil pressure location.  I have done this with 
almost all type one that i have built up since.  Dont see any way of 
doing that to a CV style type 4 though.
