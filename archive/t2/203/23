Ordinarily, I would say that this might be beyond what we have time for, but
I think that the guy said that he has power and a lube bay or pit that we
can use!!! We have a good portable compressor and a good assortment of
tools.. So, it may not be so difficult. We're mainly after the camping
gear/interior elements, and it does have louvered jalousies and we are
taking those, too, and the windshield. I may take the tires and rims,
depending on condition.. or at least one or two as a spare/s. If it
feasable, we will consider taking the camper top, and I have considered
taking the rotating passenger's seat. These and the other items depend on
time available. We'll both be working and driving a rack truck and a cargo
van, so we should be able to do a lot.
If I had a trailer and a place to store and work on this vehicle, I could do
a lot more in stripping it, or restoring it, for that matter (but I don't
want anything later than a '71). As it is, we will be somewhat limited,
timewise.  Jan B
