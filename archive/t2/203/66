Subject: Sliding door hinge roller part #

Hey... I need a part number, or maybe someone has one of these that 
they'd like to part with...

It's the roller on the rear latch on the sliding door...  I don't know 
if I have to get the whole part or what.  There's two rollers, and mine 
is missing one... Can anyone tell me the part number?

Thanks,
