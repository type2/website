First thing I'd check is intake leaks.  Intake leaks cause backfiring under
steady cruising or light acceleration.  With the engine idling, spray a
little carb cleaner (use it sparingly) around the runner-to-head gaskets and
around the runner-to-center rubber boots 1 at a time.  Any variation in your
idle speed indicates an intake leak.

Other possibility that comes to mind is exhaust leaks.  Exhaust leaks cause
backfiring on deceleration.
