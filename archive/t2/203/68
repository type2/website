Subject: CHT Gauge Experience

With all this talk about gauges I thought I would throw in my $0.02
worth. I have a stock '71 and I'm a HUGE fan of oil pressure gauges. I
would never run an engine as fragile as a VW engine without one. Oil is
the life blood of an air-cooled engine and the idiot light is just that.
The next gauge I would get is an oil temp gauge.   

As for cylinder head gauges I've tried VDO ones but didn't find them
reliable enough to trust. I had the type of sensor that bolted under the
spark plug which was the first problem because it made removing the
spark plug more difficult it discouraged me from changing the spark
plugs as often as I should have.

The VDO type gauge I had used a thermocouple technique to sense the
temperature. The thermocouple consists of a hot junction at the spark
plug and a cold junction (ambient air temp) at end of the wire sensor
which was located at the front tin. The gauge measures the temperature
difference between these 2 junctions. What this means is at a given
cylinder head temp the gauge reading will go down as the outside air
temperature goes up. That's really not what you want. 
  
I find I can use the oil pressure gauge as a temperature gauge without
too much of a problem. I've gotten used to speed vs. pressure for my
engine. On a hard pull I watch the oil pressure drop and at some point I
begin to slow down. If the pressure continues to drop I slow down more.
I keep slowing down until the pressure stabilizes. Sure it's a judgment
call on how low to allow the pressure to go but I tend to be
conservative so this method has worked well for me for years.
