Subject: diff between 74 and 75 engine?

I asked before and didn't get a satisfactory answer:
I have a 74 engine (running at 120 psi) that the PO dissassembled.
Considering selling the whole thing, but must ask first- can this be
used as a spare for the 75 bus we have and the FI stuff moved to it-
like is it the same case - and can the heads be used for FI by adding a
tapped hole for the temp sensor?  (Or are the heads special for the
injectors?)  If I keep it then I will have a set of stock carbs, etc
available.
