Subject: Rear Brake Line Installation

Can anyone who has replace their brake lines provide suggestions on how to
best install the 9 foot long brake line from the master cylinder to the rear
T-fitting?  I ordered a brake line replacement kit from Bus Depot and am
thinking about how to begin this without screwing it up and breaking the
pipe!  Have you:

Pre-formed the line prior to installation?
Formed the line as you snake it thought all the chassis holes and around the
suspension members?
Started fishing the pipe from the rear, front or middle of the chassis?

Thanks for the insight!
