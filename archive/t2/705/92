Any information will be appreciated



rogelio vazquez in la paz is the guy to know. don't have vitals on him, but
he's well known there. also, the last three pemex stations before guerrero
negro were abandoned and vandalized last year. a five gallon spare tank is
recommended. on the other hand the road is much improved and was 90%
repaved, probably all done by now.
