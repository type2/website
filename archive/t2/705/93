Subject: Leaking oil pressure sender hose

I am using a VDO oil pressure sender with a VDO extension hose. I have read
conflicting things about the thread on the end of the hose that threads into
the case so I used an adapter that has the metric npt threads in the case and
threaded the hose into that. The hose sealed into the adapter but the adapter
didn't seal into the case. pulled the adapter and fount that the threads are
not tapered on the adapter and are not long enough to get tight in the case.
:~(  There is an adapter that came with the hose that I currently have on the
sensor end of the hose. Is that the wrong end to use it on? Is the male end of
the hose metric or SAE?
I realy want to test drive my new engine but not with leaks.
