Subject: Re: [T2] Re: AL75X alternator rebuilt by Bosch

That page, and its list of various parts makes me wonder a couple of 
things (since it now appears I am replacing an AL108 70 amp alternator- 
maybe original stock, maybe a replacement- with an AL75X 55 amp model):

1a) What's the difference between the various pulleys?

1b) Would the pulley that apparently worked on the AL108 work on my 
AL75X?

2) Am I totally screwed if I don't find the proper wiring harness?


-Chuck, who, as a child of the digital age, would probably buy stuff 
from Bus-Boys if they had online ordering.
