Subject: [T2] 79 FI engine to 73 swap

I put a 79 engine into a 74... this is how I did it.

-Had to change the fuel tank cause FI has a return line.
-change the flywheel.
-Had to make and weld a mounting bracket to the frame rail for the fuel
pump.
-Transfer the wire harness that goes from the double relay to the starter to
the fuel pump.
-Cut hole for the computer.
-Cut off the breather box mount from the 79 and weld it to the 74 ( measure
twice, weld once!!! ).
-Mount the deceleration valve to the fire wall.
-Mount the double relay to the fire wall.
