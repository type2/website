Subject: Fooling the CHT gauge

I'm trying to understand the heat dynamics of the Type 4 head. When we measure the temperature under the spark plug what indication is there of a problem at the exhaust port?

For example, the combustion chamber temps are super hot and we get a relative reading of them by looking at the spark plug temperature between 300-450F. I've taken an infrared reading of the manifold pipe and it's closer to 900F.

When you have an exhaust leak where the heat exchanger meets the head, you can do unholy damage to the head but the CHT gauge won't alter it's reading by much. Since there are other causes that can make the exhaust pop (which is what I'd be listening for when there was a sealing problem) how is this best detected before it's too late?
