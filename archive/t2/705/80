Subject: Re: [T2] '73 and '76 external difference(s) are...

The two you are probably thinking of are:

where you put the gas in..the 73 has a lid, the later bus didn't.

the sliding door handle and recession are different

I have a third...if you look closely at the engine hinges they are 
different. The early 73 had the screw in type hinges and the later had the 
post type hinge.

Also the roof on the early bus had a "groove" in the center of the bus 
running widthwise. I believe the later roofs are smooth for the length of 
the bus.

If you have a REAL eagle eye you might see the exhaust stystem is different, 
but that probably doesn't count.
