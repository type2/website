I highly recommend that guy. Be sure to ask for your injector seals back if you've got the good quality ones and don't pay them to install hoses because it's expensive and easy to do yourself.

Here's my cleaning report:

Having the cleanest possible injectors makes the most of the engine's available power. My injectors were ok but had sat for many years without running. The first thing I noticed with clean injectors was that I could drive 5mph faster in 2nd and 3rd gear.
