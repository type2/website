Subject: ignition key serial number.

Hi guys,
I spent 1/2h looking it the archive without getting a straight answer .
I need to know the serial number of my ignition keys.
I have been told that I should look the serial number inside the door 
handle.
Is is true ? which number I should expect to read ?
There is one 10 digit number at the   outer door handle, but I guess 
this is the part number.

Thanks a lots

CHris
