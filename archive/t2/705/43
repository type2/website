Hi Volks,

THANKS to the impressive skillz and most appreciated efforts of Mark 
Dearing and the crew at Salem Imports, my parents are now back on the 
road. Their Vanagon westy is humming along quietly and the rattle in 
the stickshift they had grown used to over the past few years is now 
completely gone. They also have a new clutch plate, resurfaced pressure 
plate and a new slave cylinder, so the shifting is much improved.

They're now headed towards Washington DC to meet up with 71 westy 
owners Ron and Mary Dunn, who have promised to show them some of the 
local night-life and such.

Mark, your first Red Cup at EveryBus is on me. (Wild Turkey, if I 
recall correctly)

Happy trails indeed... Salem Imports ROCKS.
