Subject: cylinder head inspection

I'm looking at a head that I pulled, and, despite the engine having 
pretty reasonable compression, the valves all have tiny concentric ring 
around them in the head metal.  I assume this is the edge of the valve 
seat.  I'm presuming that this is a sign of impending doom?

Or is this normal?

cheers,
	tom
