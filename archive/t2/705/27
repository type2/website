Subject: Fuel Injector Cleaner/Rebuilder guy.

Hey hey, got myself a set of Fuel Injectors off a Donor bus, and I'm
ready to ship 'em off to that one guy, in that one place that will
clean them, rebuild them, and calibrate them to all be the same. Only
thing is, I can't find the info on him. Anyone got it handy?

Chris
