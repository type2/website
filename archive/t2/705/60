Thanks guys,
Ok I have the door outside door handle in my hand , I don't see any 
number which looks like a serial number , I may not look at the right 
place , I don't know how to remove the Cylinder from the handle , how to 
extract it ? it looks like I need to apply a lots of force  at the lebel 
where there is a spring. Is that right ?
