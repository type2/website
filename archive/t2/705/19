Subject: Re: [T2] front end alignment

I recently bought a new set of Michelins for our '97 VW Cabrio and got an alignment. $30 for a two wheel alignment, $60 for a 4 wheel alignment. Be advised this will increase because the IRS rear-end will require shims at the inner pivots on the bus he told me. 

It's worth it. 

FWIW my Cabrio only has adjustments for toe, needed adjustments for canmber and caster. I'm guessing I'd have to go see a frame shop... <UGH!> 

Car drives fine all the same.
