"Since there are other causes that can make the exhaust pop (which is
what I'd be listening for when there was a sealing problem) how is
this best detected before it's too late?"

As I mentioned on The Samba, I do a paper test at every valve
adjustment as part of my routine. A sheet of paper the size of a
playing card (or a playing card) inserted up between the exhaust
flange and the head fins will tell if it's leaking. If the paper is
vibrating or moving when not touching anything you have a leak. This
takes like 5 seconds per cylinder.

I had a leak at the #2 exhaust pipe when I installed my new HEs.
Couldn't hear it at idle, but the paper told. Dropped the HE and reset
the copper gasket. No more leak.

The start of this was when I had my 76 280z. The loooooong 6cyl head
and exh manifold would develop leaks easily if the manifold wasn't
torqued down in the right pattern. Another Z owner showed me the
trick. I started doing it at every oil change and did catch a leak
once that was caused by a spluttering injector.
