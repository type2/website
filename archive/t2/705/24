I had the same problem last year when I was autocrossing my Westfalia. I was having a hard time keeping up with a Miata that also runs in our club. Pulled that pin, cleaned it up and now I can carve the corners sharper than the Miata, oh and the Corvette too... <grin!> 

Just kidding! 

How does one pull this pin? 

Thanks!
