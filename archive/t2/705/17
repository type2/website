For a test, add a wire from the + side of the coil to the + side of the battery. Start it. If the ignition switch is bad, all the problems will disappear. You might need a helper as you will not be able to stop the engine unless this wire is pulled off so be safe. 

Another version would be to make up a test light using the dome light bulb (ala Muir) and attach it to the + side of the coil. If it flickers you've got a bad power supply to the coil. 

Fuel Injection? Could it be the double relay?
