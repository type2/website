All of the extra wiring for the FI is fairly well-contained.  The only 
parts of that that need to even leave the engine compartment is for the 
electric fuel pump (remember to fetch that from the '79! :-)

Obviously, you want to use the FI wiring harness in its entirety, but 
that is totally separate from the main vehicle wiring harness.

I think the biggest hassle is going to be that fuel tank.  Greg Potts 
used a tee in the outlet line from his non-FI tank to handle the fuel 
return.  Or you could transplant the fuel tank from the '79.  If it 
were me, I'd do the transplant.  When you have it out, take it to be 
boiled out and re-lined -- better than new.  You'll have a little metal 
work in the body to do for the FI tank's outlet, but that should be a 
snap ("cut a bigger hole, somewhat square").

You are going to love the L-Jet FI ... it's a great system.  Once it is 
tuned, it "just works", almost flawlessly.  It's a '79 CA Bus, right?  
If so, you're going to get the nice '79 electronic ignition, too.
