Hi Don,

Here is the procedure I use to square a steering wheel, as suggested to 
me by Dennis Jolliffe.

1. Locate a quarter mile stretch of straight road with no traffic as 
close to home as possible.
2. (At home) Remove the horn button and pull the nut off the steering 
column. Lift the wheel off the splines, and then replace it, putting 
the nut on hand tight and don't put the horn button back yet.
3. Drive to the straight road.
4. Line up the bus and drive that straight road as accurately as 
possible. No wandering or weaving allowed. Once you have the bus 
running *perfectly* straight, put on your 4-way flashers and STOP RIGHT 
THERE.
5. Remove the steering wheel nut, and steering wheel.
6. Re-center the steering wheel, and replace the nut finger tight.
7. Test drive the bus to determine if the steering wheel is now 
correctly centered. If not, repeat steps 3-6.
8. Return home,
9. Torque the steering wheel nut to spec and replace the horn button.

Some buses ( esp. early bays) will *really* fight you to get the 
steering wheel off the first time. It's easier to remove the second 
time when the nut has only been re-attached finger tight.

Happy trails,
