Richard, As I understand it, CHT is mostly to make sure you are
not running too lean(or hot for any other reason).  My aircraft buddy 
uses his to adjust his carbs(and the regular purpose).

An EGT gauge is pretty much mandatory in a plane as well.
Why, I am not too sure, but I can't imagine anything but your ears
that is going to detect a leak at the exhaust manifold.

I suppose that the EGT  gauge might show lower if you had a leak in
the pipe before the gauge sensor...

Cheers, dave

When we measure the temperature under the spark plug what 
indication is there of a problem at the exhaust port?

 I've taken an infrared reading of the manifold pipe and it's closer to 900F.

you can do unholy damage to the head but the CHT gauge won't alter 
it's reading by much. Since there are other causes that can make 
the exhaust pop (which is what I'd be listening for when there was 
a sealing problem) how is this best detected before it's too late?
