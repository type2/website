Subject: Re: [T2] Engine cleaning/cracks

Not that I've done this, but in Tom Wilson's 'How To Rebuild Your Volkswagen
Air-Cooled Engine', he suggests that you pass a propane or oxyacetylene
torch over any suspected cracks for no more than a second. The trapped oil
in the crack will bubble up.
He further suggests that ALL magnesium cases (like in my 71) will eventually
and fatally crack. New-fangled aluminum cases can apparently be welded back
in many instances.
See y'all at EveryBus!
