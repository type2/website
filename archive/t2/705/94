Subject: Re: [T2] Leaking oil pressure sender hose

Ok, so I'm not very good at using the archives, but I just stumbled on to this
link.

I think I have found the answer to my own question! The threads into the case
do not appear to be tapered and I found a German OP sender in my parts stash.
It threads into the hole with no wobble after the first thread is engaged into
the hole. So I am off to the flaps to see if I can find an aluminum crush ring
and a metric thread gauge. Hope it works!

  I am using a VDO oil pressure sender with a VDO extension hose. I have read
  conflicting things about the thread on the end of the hose that threads
into
  the case so I used an adapter that has the metric npt threads in the case
and
  threaded the hose into that. The hose sealed into the adapter but the
adapter
  didn't seal into the case. pulled the adapter and fount that the threads
are
  not tapered on the adapter and are not long enough to get tight in the
case.
  :~(  There is an adapter that came with the hose that I currently have on
the
  sensor end of the hose. Is that the wrong end to use it on? Is the male end
of
  the hose metric or SAE?
  I realy want to test drive my new engine but not with leaks.
