Subject: Fuse specifications?

Someone wouldn't happen to have a spec sheetthe stock fuses used in our
VW's? I'm looking at going to breakers at some point in the future and am
wondering if the trip values for these
http://www.nteinc.com/relay_web/R59.html would be acceptable.

A proper spec sheet on the fuses should list the same type of data. How
much over the rated current can flow through the fuse for how long before
it burns up.
