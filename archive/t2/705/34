"Quality" doesn't always mean QUALITY like I mean it (lasts 30 years or 300K miles whichever comes first). I'm thinking lasts as long as the original factory part.  They are thinking it will last until the AVERAGE owner would break it (maybe 1 season?) or until they sell the car because they get tired of it (two seasons)... 

Some fitment required means I get a bent piece of steel and how I make it fit is my own d*** problem... 

All tires are NOT created equal. Just 'cause it fits the wheel (size) does NOT mean it FITS the vehicle (requirements). 

Most POs are crummy mechanics who think hammers and duct tape equal quality, see first rule. 

Procrastination CAN in fact delay a project for years, even it does feel like you're going to take a weekend off... 

Despite all outward appearances indicating differently, a large number of the public STILL thinks anybody who drives an old VW van is a pot-smoking hippe wannabee.
