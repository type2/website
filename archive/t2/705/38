Subject: Still playing with my new FI motor.

     While looking for vaccuum leaks and obvious things I found that the 
hose from the breather box on top of the engine was disconnected from the 
air intake (the big plastic boot that goes from the air cleaner to the 
intake manifold).  I connected that breather hose up and now the engine 
doesn't die right away!  It seems to keep running, but it's idling pretty 
high.  Is this like some kind of automatic choke?  Is there an idle 
adjustment or something?  Should I let it run a for a bit and see what it 
does?
     Again, I haven't even looked at the FI manual yet, so if I'm bugging 
you nice folks just tell me to bug off until I've done my homework :-)
