Well...... 79 square port heads and 80-83 Vanagon heads are not the same.

1979 bay square port heads are one-year-only. They are # 029 101 371B
They use 021 109 601A intake valves [37.5mm] and 022 109 612D exhaust valves [33mm].
These are on engine # GE 039332 and up.

80-83 Vanagon heads, 071 101 371A & B, use 021 109 601 intake valves [39.3mm] and 022 109 612D exhaust
valves[33mm].
These are on the CV engines.
