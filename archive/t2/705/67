Thanks for the offer Steve, I finally found the number , Scott L. is 
right , my father and I could not find it, we'll go for a check to an 
opthamoligist ASAP ! the locksmith found it , it is a 4 digit number , 
It is located to one of the two  lever-like thing that is screwed to the 
end of the lock cylinder.
Again thanks a lot guys ...
