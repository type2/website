I second Karl's suggestion unless the 79 has more rust. Fixing rust unless 
you are a body man is probably more expensive than all the rest.

Either way it sounds like some fun projects are in the future!!

77 hightop soon to be for sale!

"I would seriously consider taking the camper stuff from the 73 and put it
into the 79, might be easier than trying to untangle the wiring harness
mess.    if the wiring is as bad as you say, you will pull your hair out
getting it working, you never know what the DPO has done to it"
