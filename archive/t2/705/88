If it is off any more than 1 spline, then you are
making the steering box run off-center. This will
cause the turn-to-turn ratio to be off: less turns to
go one was vs. more turns to go the other.

You are also going to have the sector shaft off of its
center position in the box.

And the steering column will no longer lock in the
straight ahead position.

Your best adjustment is the factory one: use the drag
link adjustment to correct center!
