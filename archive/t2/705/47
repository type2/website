Subject: acceleration hesitation

FYI
For a while now I have had a weird hesitation thing going on.. I had
many
theorys and went throught the engine compartment for vac leaks many
times.
It dawned on me the other day while going down a rather steep hill in
Seattle that the brakes just didnt feel quite right.. they worked fine
but the pedal felt "hard"... put the bus up on ramps and started
looking for the vac assist line... the hose that connected to the
master cyl. had
deteriorated to the point it was unuseable.. installed a new hose and..
surprise! both problems ( hesitation and hard brake pedal ) went away.
:-)
I had frankly never looked at this system as I had never had a problem
with it.. I still need to trace the line back and find where it hooks
to
the intake for vaccuum.. I want to check out the check valve..

I love those easy fixes.. even if it takes a while for the light bulb
to
go on!
