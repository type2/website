Subject: caliper going out????

I have this clicking sound coming beneath my left foot. Sometimes the speedo 
needed bounces all over the place from 0mph to 30 mph in rhythm with the 
sound. Sometimes when I brake it kinda makes a slight hissing sound. Also 
has a swish swish sound.

I'm certain the master cylinder and servo are fine, I replaced both in 
Sept/Oct. What are the symptoms of a faulty caliper - was thinking this 
might be it. The hoses looked fairly new as I recall being down there last.

Also the shock on that side is leaking - that wouldn't cause any of these 
issues would it? Braking power still seems very nice. Wondering if pulling 
the caliper off my parts bus might be in my future. I just got the bus back 
on the road Saturday after starter problems don't want to be bus-less again 
quite so soon.

Thanks for any insight, suggestions - don't know crap about calipers except 
how to replace the pads.
