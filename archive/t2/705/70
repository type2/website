Subject: Re: [T2] 79 FI engine to 73 swap

Hi Jay,

As long as you get EVERYTHING from the engine compartment of the 79, 
you'll do fine. Remember that you'll also need to swap over that 210mm 
flywheel, pressure plate and disk from the 1700 if you're going to make 
the 2L fit the 3-rib tranny.

The wiring that goes into the 2L FI engine is very simple: Coil wire, 
ignition switch, fuel pump.  The wiring between components in the 
engine is a lot more complex, but that's a self-contained system, and 
remains the same from one vehicle to the next. If you can transfer the 
wiring harness for the double-relay on the 79 into the 73, you will 
have all of those connections taken care of. This was one of the most 
difficult tasks I faced in getting the westfakia converted to FI... 
sorting out what goes where on the double relay. Once I had that 
figured out, the rest was a simple matter of chasing down vacuum leaks.

Happy trails,
