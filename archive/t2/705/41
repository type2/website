Subject: PING: Fla bussers re diving/camping

Daughter and her 75 bus has spring break next week- we'd like to go 
together to check out any good snorkeling/diving in the keys area-
but heard something about sharks?  Fla people reply please off list
if you have suggestions beyond the theme parks- in the past we went to 
Sanibel, Crystal River (Manitees), and that snorkeling boat trip at 
Pennekamp.
