The threads into the case are M10x1.0. I ordered the stainless braided
adapter from aircooled.net and it came with the proper fittings. 

Since the Rivi electricals are all screwed up I've been starting my engine
for testing once or twice a week for no more than 60 seconds (because I
have no readings for pressure etc. that I can trust) and I've seen no leaks
yet. 

It's parked on virgin concrete and temps inside have reached 90 on some
days so any oil that makes it to the outside of the block would definitely
drip off and be visible within a day or two even without daily start up.
