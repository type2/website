Subject: 79 FI engine to 73 swap

     Well, after much deliberation and the sage advice of Steve Dolan who 
was kind enough to drop by today, I have decide to take the 2000CC FI engine 
out of my 79 bus and put it into the 73 camper.  My plan is to leave the 73 
tranny in and move over the engine & the wiring harness from the 79.  Bob 
(Access Systems) tells me that the wiring is very different and this would 
be a bad idea.  Why?  If that is the case, how to do I deal with any wiring 
that would be required to power the FI system in the 73, that did not have 
fuel injection.
     Hey Bob, if you're reading this, I'm not sending it out because I don't 
believe you :-)  I'm just trying to understand the difference between the 79 
and 73 and how to do this engine and carb to FI swap, without having to take 
up all of your time exclusively!
