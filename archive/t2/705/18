can't tell you, hope you understand. You REALLY don't think you are getting
the same thing for 40% off do you?

when ever was anything in this life free?

a 10% cost difference is understandable between vendors, but when you are
over this amt something else is up. It's up to you to not get sucked in by
the promises of "it's the same". Of course, I am sure some list members will
accuse me of using fear to claim our parts are different, but there's
nothing I can do about that.

I will say the vendors that PARTICIPATE on this list are good guys, and all
should be used to keep your busses alive.
