Subject: Engine cleaning clarification

Ok, my last e-mail went to Jamey but didn't get to the list or at least not to
me.  In Wilson's book it indicates that all you need to clean the magnesium
case is hot water and phosphate soap.  So can I take my split case down to the
ye olde car wash and clean with soap and water?
