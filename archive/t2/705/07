Hi Jay,

If there's a buyer for the 79, then sell it. Get it to a good home, and 
keep the market for baywindow parts healthy. If not, then decide which 
bus has the least amount of rust, and part the other one.

Moving a driveline from the 79 into the 73 is an equal PITA factor to 
the task of making a 1979 westfakia. Trust me, I've done 'em both. 
Treat the 73's wiring as an opportunity: Once it's fixed properly you 
can enjoy the fruits of your labour knowing that all the dash 
connections are clean and secure and properly routed.

Fine details: The shift linkage in the 73 is about 5/8" longer than the 
79. Swapping the FI driveline into the 73 will require a bit of 
fabrication to make it work properly. The FI fuel tank will need to be 
swapped, but you can get along OK as I did by using a T in the line. 
There are other fine details but none are show-stoppers.

Here in Toronto a 79 bus would probably sell very quickly for 2-3K $CDN 
with a valid safety certificate. (Brakes, tires, signals, muffler, etc 
OK ). If sold Non-op you would get about half that.


Happy trails,
