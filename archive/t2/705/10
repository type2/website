Sounds like the square end of your speedo cable is
getting worn. The speedo cable has a square end where
it goes snugly through a square hole in the grease
cover of the front drivers side wheel, so when the
wheel turns, it turns the cable and thus the speedo
needle. If either the square cable end OR the square
hole on the grease cover get worn and "rounded out" it
will cause the EXACT symptons you describe.
