Subject: Stuff For Sale

Hello List. I have a 1 bedroom apartment and the
garage where I keep my bus is being sold, so I must
sell a few things to save room. Among other things, I
have a complete set of green westy curtains including
the windshield curtain. I would rate most of the
curtains at either a 9/10-9.5/10. There are a couple
that I would rate an 8/10. They are very nice. they do
NOT come with curtain hardware like tie backs and
curtain rods. I am asking $100 obo +shipping. I have a
single stock(I think) carb with intake and stock oil
bath air cleaner that came off a 68 bus. This came off
a running engine. I recently replaced all of the
gaskets in the carb and replaced the fuel injection
tube. I would like to get $100 obo +shipping for this
settup. I have a few pieces of engine tin that came
off a 1600cc SP engine including the stock fan shroud
without flaps. I have a 1600cc SP longlblock. This was
a running engine. I think it may of had some valve
problems because I have difficulty getting consistant
compression readings. This would be perfect for a
rebuild or it may just need a good tune up. I will
take $100.00 obo plus freight.I am sure I will dig up
a few more things like I may have a side step for sale
if I can find it. Don't be afraid to make an offer.
the worst I can say is no.; ) I live in Wilmington, NC
28403 incase you were wondering. Cheers!
