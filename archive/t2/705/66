Subject: RE: lock code number

The code number on the door lock is on the tailpiece, the cast "hockey 
stick" looking piece on the end of the lock.  It should be in the format of 
2 numbers, the letter "R", then 3 numbers.  There is no promise, however, 
that in the past the handle hasn't been rekeyed or the lock replaced.  If 
you'll send me the number you find, along with a scan of your existing key, 
I'll verify that they match.
