Chris, this is one of those things that you really *need* take someplace 
to do it correctly....they will do more than just toe out and toe 
in...also the camber adjustment that would be hard for you to do.

Find a reputable tire and front end alignment place and just go.

The one that I use is an independent and he has has done a lot of VW's for 
me...he hands me a prinout showing what everything was set to before he 
adjusted, after he adjusted, and what the machine knows the specs are.

Find a good palce and just do it!

Cheers, dave
