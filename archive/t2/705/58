It's on the lock cylinder section of the outside door handle. If you remove
the handle you should be able to find it. I don't recall how many digits it
is but it's less than ten. (Of course this will only tell you the key code
for that particular handle, but if the door and ignition lock cylinders are
still the same as when the bus was new, they both take the same key.)
