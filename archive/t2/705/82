I would only this as a last resort on a later bus with
a fine splined steering wheel AND it is only off 1
spline.

If it is off any more than 1 spline, then you are
making the steering box run off-center. This will
cause the turn-to-turn ratio to be off: less turns to
go one was vs. more turns to go the other.

You are also going to have the sector shaft off of its
center position in the box. 

And the steering column will no longer lock in the
straight ahead position.

Your best adjustment is the factory one: use the drag
link adjustment to correct center!

 1. Locate a quarter mile stretch of straight road
 with no traffic as 
 close to home as possible.
 2. (At home) Remove the horn button and pull the nut
 off the steering 
 column. Lift the wheel off the splines, and then
 replace it, putting 
 the nut on hand tight and don't put the horn button
 back yet.
 3. Drive to the straight road.
 4. Line up the bus and drive that straight road as
 accurately as 
 possible. No wandering or weaving allowed. Once you
 have the bus 
 running *perfectly* straight, put on your 4-way
 flashers and STOP RIGHT THERE.
 5. Remove the steering wheel nut, and steering
 wheel.
 6. Re-center the steering wheel, and replace the nut
 finger tight.
 7. Test drive the bus to determine if the steering
 wheel is now correctly centered. If not, repeat steps
3-6.
 8. Return home,
 9. Torque the steering wheel nut to spec and replace
 the horn button.
 
 Some buses ( esp. early bays) will *really* fight
 you to get the 
 steering wheel off the first time. It's easier to
remove the second 
 time when the nut has only been re-attached finger
 tight.
