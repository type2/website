Subject: [T2] Engine cleaning/cracks

I believe the heat mentioned in Tom Wilson's book will read the case very
well.
I burn off oil and residue from new and used parts in my Ceramics Coating
business and I often find oil and solvents boil out of otherwise invisible
cracks in parts.
I use a controlled heat oven at about 600 degrees but the propane torch will
be fine for testing suspect areas.
I recently found a reground camshaft with pinholes and cracks.
I alerted the owner so he could have this part magnafluxed and save his
engine  .
