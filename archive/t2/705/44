Subject: Online Westfalia Manuals have moved...

Just a note to let everyone know that the 1968, 1973, and 1974 Westfalia manuals that were on my
website are now available on The Samba.  I plan on taking my versions offline in the near future,
so if you have any links to them, please update them to the new addresses.

The old addresses were:

http://www.geocities.com/thegreatjose/VW/68WestyManual.html
http://www.geocities.com/thegreatjose/VW/73WestyManual.html
http://www.geocities.com/thegreatjose/VW/74WestyManual.html

The new ones are:

http://www.thesamba.com/vw/archives/manuals/68westy_germ_eng.php
http://www.thesamba.com/vw/archives/manuals/aug72westy.php
http://www.thesamba.com/vw/archives/manuals/aug73westy.php

My thanks to The Samba for hosting them and great job scanning them in.  I also sent them my 1969
and 1974 Bus Owner's Manuals that have also posted as well.  They actually have a LOT of scanned
in manuals, brochures, etc. for all types of VWs... I've spend a lot of time checking out things I
didn't even know existed.
