Subject: testing engine w/ carb and interchangability of parts 

I am not very experienced with carbs and am trying to test an engine out of 
the bus that has a carb on it.  Some of the wires and hoses are disconnected 
and I don't know where they go.  Can anyone send me a good diagram or 
pictures.  Also, is that the fuel pump connected to the engine on the lower 
passenger side of the flywheel?  Can someone send me a diagram of how those 
hoses are connected?
Also, I was told the engine is a 1700 or 1800.  It does not have a 
distributer or coil.  Can I use the one from a 78 2.0 to test it?
Thanks,
Kyle
