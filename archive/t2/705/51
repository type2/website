Subject: Re: [T2] Alignments

as of said i am sure that i could do the alignment myself but as others have pointed out it may be the best thing to just let someone do it after all... that machine may tell me the root of all evil so that it can be cleaned throughly of any such gremlins.
 
i will however make sure they dont have a problem with me stand N at least right outside the garage with her while she's been worked on...
also will drive it up on the lift myself.....if they have a problem with it i'll find another shop i recon?
there hasnt ever been but three people ever drive my bus that i can remember and thats me my wife and phil one of my friends...
call me crazy but arent we all a little about these lovely beautful vehicles ....
turkish say. Vos Vos....
lol
so i guess i do love my vos vos..
peace and love and thanks all for your replies and comments...

Front wheel alignments on a bus are easy. Any shop should be able to
successfully adjust the toe-in and camber. Heck, you could eyeball it
close...

The only real issue, and another listmember had mentioned it a few
weeks ago (months ago? VW time?) was that the steering wheel may not
be square. The only way to square the steering wheel is to disconnect
the drag link from the steering box.

The Nintendo generation of mechanics may balk at that task. It
actually requires thought and effort. ;)

The nice thing is that you can do that part yourself after the
alignment. Disconnect, center, reconnect. TaDa! It's just easier to do
it during the alignment process.
