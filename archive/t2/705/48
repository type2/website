Subject: Alignments

Front wheel alignments on a bus are easy. Any shop should be able to
successfully adjust the toe-in and camber. Heck, you could eyeball it
close...

The only real issue, and another listmember had mentioned it a few
weeks ago (months ago? VW time?) was that the steering wheel may not
be square. The only way to square the steering wheel is to disconnect
the drag link from the steering box.

The Nintendo generation of mechanics may balk at that task. It
actually requires thought and effort. ;)

The nice thing is that you can do that part yourself after the
alignment. Disconnect, center, reconnect. TaDa! It's just easier to do
it during the alignment process.
