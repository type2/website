Subject: Lubricating heater booster fan

Is there a correct way to lubricate the heater booster fan? Mine started 
causing the voltage to drop more than usual when it was on. I took it out 
on the weekend and found that it doesn't appear the case was intended to be 
taken apart. However, there is a small hole near the blade end on the 
underneath side of the motor. I squirted WD40 in there which seemed to fix 
the problem. Is this what VW intended or a happy coincidence?

Cheers,
