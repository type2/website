Oly,

Same thing happened to me with my 71.  It would run fine for 10 or so miles 
then just quit.  Other times it would not start at all.  Drove me nuts for 
months.

I finally replaced the ignition switch,  I might be wrong, but I believe that 
the 71's ignition is a first and only year probably for that reason.

Change that switch!

After checking all of the wires, contacts and vacuum hoses recommended by
the group I began experimenting to find out if I could cause or work around
the issue.
This is what I've come up with...
I start the bus and when I let go of the ignition she stalls.
I've found that if I get her started, turn to off the back to the on
position quick enough she will run.  It takes several attempts sometimes but
I think I've isolated the issue to the ignition switch.  I don't know why
she sometimes quits enroute but maybe the spring back mech in the switch
releases.  I've limited my key ring for the bus to one key since I found out
the weight of many keys can wear out an ignition switch.
I'll have to read some archives as I think the 71 may be a one year only
switch and requires some extra wiring.
Thanks for all the suggestions.
