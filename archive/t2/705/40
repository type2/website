Subject: Re: Rear Brake Line Installation

I just did this in my '69 Westy.  I cut the old one in half and pulled it out through the middle
of the bus.  I then measured it and went to the local FLAPS and bought the closest combination of
two lines to the original length and a union (I think it was maybe 4" longer overall).

I used the old one as pattern to put a few of the bends in the new one.  I was able to install the
front section from the front of the bus (from above the master cylinder) so I put the almost 90
degree bend in it right away.  I had to install the rear section starting from the center of the
bus, so I had to bend it the best I could while reaching around the frame parts in the way.

It wasn't too bad.  Probably took me about an hour to install it.  The worst part is trying to
start the threads on both ends of the new line into either the master cylinder or the rear
t-fitting.  I put an extra bend in it in the center section where it hugs up against the frame
rail to take up the extra length.  

Remember to take off the clips that hold the line to the chassis.  I think that there were three:
one behind the front suspension, and two on the center frame rail.
