David et al:
When I was missent the new style thermostat I tried to
make it expand with a hairdryer and likewise, it did
not change size.  I put it in a pot of water and
brought it to boil and it expanded considerably.  Try
the boiling water trick.  Bus Depot let me return the
new style and resent me the bellows style which is
easily adaptable to the type IV.  greg
