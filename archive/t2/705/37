Subject: Re: [T2] last question tonight, FI engine won't idle.

     I did this test and as soon as I touched the pencil on that little 
flapper thingy I could hear the fuel pump make a "Whzzzzz" noise, so I think 
that's okay.  So far I replaced the four manifold boots with some radiator 
hose of about the same size because that's what the FLAPS had.  I know 
that's probably not very good permanent fix but what was on there was really 
bad off so I think it's better than that at least temporarily.  I've also 
replaced several vacuum lines but still no improvement.  Tonight I should 
finally have time to read the Bosch manual, and I've got some good help 
coming over tomorrow :-)
