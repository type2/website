Race cars aren't typically concerned with emissions :-)

The idea behind EGR is to reduce the formation of oxides of nitrogen (NOx).
It turns out that NOx forms at combustion chamber temps in excess of 2000
deg F.  NOx is also a MAJOR contributor to smog.
So the way to reduce formation of NOx is to keep the combustion chamber
temps down.  EGR does this by routing some of the exhaust gases (which are
inert and do not burn) into the intake air stream.  These exhaust gases take
up some of the space that air would normally occupy which helps to control
the temperatures inside the combustion chambers.

Not only does it help reduce emissions but it keeps the heads cooler.
Sounds win-win to me.  The goal is not to cool the exhaust gases down as
that wouldn't really help anything that I know of, but to use the exhaust
gases to keep the combustion chamber temps down.
