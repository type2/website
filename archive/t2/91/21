(Well I hate to be the one to post this, because I am sure it comes up =
pretty frequently. I looked at the archives, but there is so much it =
would take a while to decipher it all)

I am lucky enough that my Xmas bonus last year is $2000 towards =
replacing my engine. Its a 1700cc with 166 000 original miles. Never =
rebuilt. Apparently has bad rings and "blow by" because it pops every =
seal I replace. There is nothing I would like more than doing it myself, =
but because the company is paying for it they require I have somebody =
with experience do the engine, so if something goes wrong I can take it =
back. I will have my girlfriend smack me for being so lucky!!=20

My question is should I:

1)  buy an AVP engine (or another rebuilder) and have it installed by my =
mechanic who works on foreign cars in general, but could probably =
install it and get it running correctly. Approximate cost of AVP engine =
is $1200 for a long block. I have heard good and bad things about AVP. I =
know not to buy GEX.

2) try to buy a spanking new engine (not sure the cost on that or the =
best sources) and have my mechanic install it. Keep in mind I only have =
about 2000 bucks (smack) but I plan to keep my bus "forever" and drive =
it on long trips.=20

3) have my mechanic do the rebuild on my engine. He says he can do it, =
but he doesn't rebuild pancake engines very much at all. He also said it =
could be up to $2500 or $2800 with new pistons and everything. Said we =
would have to tear it down to know for sure, which sounds right. I would =
rather have as much new stuff as possible, but have heard some say newer =
stuff is worse than the original stuff.=20

What things should I make sure I get new? What other things should I =
ask? As far as I know there is noone else here in Charlotte, NC that =
rebuilds the pancake engine frequently like a Boston Bob or Jake Raby.

Thanks for any input. I have started researching some, but a big check =
just came in so I better put my bus in the shop now while the money is =
available.
