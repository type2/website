Subject: Re: [T2] Engine replacement - Dell Carbs

I run 36mm DRLA Dells on my Type IV powered Beetle. I like them (the car is 
has been temporarily retired) but may still look towards fuel injection. 
They required little attention.

They are out there. You have to find out what they fit originally and go 
from there in your hunt. Might include checking with the various car lists 
which favor these cars - like the Alfa Romeo groups. I got mine off of an 
Alfa Romeo in an Italian junkyard when I lived there. I can supply this 
info after the weekend.

Also read up on sizing. I went with the 36mm size because though I may lose 
a bit of top end power, I have a stronger vacuum signal at normal everyday 
engine speeds and thus it is easier to control the fuel and I get better 
gas mileage. I would plan to learn to jet and adjust (sync) your own carbs 
because it may be hard to find a local carb man to do that job and it costs 
$$$.

I was able to turn out mid 20's gas mileage in my Beetle on a stock 2.0 
with points style ignition on a 050 distributor (not the best choice 
probably), dual quiet packs, and the stock 2.0 camshaft. Basically I was 
running a stock junkyard engine with bolt on changes. I think you could do 
better with a homemade mixture gauge to help set the jetting and such. I 
tried the OEM jetting for the Alfa-Sud I took the carbs off, bought the CB 
Performance recommended jetting and then found a happy place using parts 
from both adjustments. I think it still needed some more tuning and a 
higher geared tranny for better mpg. I was runnign the stock 1969 gearbox 
for a 1500cc and I have since bought a 3.88 gearbox.

The DRLA carbs come in 36mm, 40mm and 46mm. A stock 2.0 with stock valves 
is sized just about right for a pair of 36mm carbs according to a Porsche 
Performance Handbook I own (their math).

There is another series of side draft carbs (the other carbs - DRLA - are 
downdraft) made by Dellorto that is functionally the same but have to be 
mounted on their sides. Popular with the VW GTI crowds and the like.

I have a picture of a Corvair engine running those carbs so it would be 
possible. They would also be well suited to an arrangement where they share 
an air cleaner assembly above the engine which could be properly heated 
with manifold heat to help prevent carb icing in the cold weather months 
using commonly found junkyard parts. Would also be easier to use for a 
turbo project because again they could share an air box. I've got a pair of 
46mm carbs for a "future" project just like this.

Some good pictures of very high quality parts (I own their cooling kit, 
intake manifolds, and carb linkage) are located at

www.ahnendorp.com

Fat Performance also has nice Dellorto carb parts.
