Yes.  We sell AVP's engines, and always sell 1800 engines to people who have
1700 engines.  The cost is the same, the engine is a direct swap, and the
core deposit is low enough that we just sell them outright; it's not worth
sending back the core.  AVP can supply the engine without smog pump holes.
