Ok   I am going to try and decipher what Bob said. Apparently its not the
jetting (although I have heard thats wrong too), but rather the
"progressive" part. When at idle only one bbl feeds the gas, but as you
accelerate then they both do. He is saying that wears out your engine. He
suggests retrofitting fuel injection (and tranny, etc.) from a 79 bus. He
will warrant with dual carbs. He doesn't recommend the progressive weber
though. Here is a pic of my centermount weber:
http://www.72camper.com/spiff12.jpg which is so readily available and much
more affordable even at around $300. I have seen many buses with this setup,
but I think I will switch, especially with 0 miles on a new rebuilt.


Hope I got that right.
