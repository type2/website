Jamie,

It should just pull out of the lock cylinder.  Give it a good wiggle
and a pull.  When it comes out, note the direction the half moon
is facing so you can arrange the new switch in a similar before installing.

Then you should just have to do the wiring -- you'll probably want your
battery ground strap off for that though.
