Subject: Re: [T2] Engine replacement (long)

A few people have suggested Boston Bob or Jake Raby (and secretly I have
wished for one of their engines anyway).

Well I called Boston Bob and he is very helpful. Being a master of these
engines he explained that my single weber carb is killing my engine. A new
engine from him with new heads and all would be about $2700. This is for a
2000cc engine with hydraulic lifters. Also he doesn't give a warranty for an
engine with the weber carb on it. He reccomends pulling the engine from a
78/79 with the FI, gas tank and tranny and retrofitting it on my new engine.
At the least I would need new dual carbs for a warranty. (I tried very hard
not to misquote, if I did I am sorry). We are talking about $3000 without an
install from a reputable mechanic (not me) to make my company happy and pay
for it. I just can't afford it.

James Garrison and Richard Palmer both recommend Transporterwerks up in
Raliegh, about 2 hours away. I called and the owner is away so no pricing
but they can install me an AVP engine that they back and recommend or
rebuild my engine and they do rebuild these engines frequently. If I can
afford it I will have them rebuild my engine. If not then its the AVP.

One thing I have had 2 people tell me is that I should look for some Delorto
dual carbs. Does anyone have these? I would have to go with the dual weber
carbs otherwise. There is also fuel injection. Can I put fuel injection on a
73? (boy I bet that is gonna bring a lot of emails)

Thanks to all who have helped. I have only pulled out half my hair today.
