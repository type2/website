Also count the lower RPM of a diesel into the longevity factor. Best power
in a diesel engine is under 4000rpm--with diesel you're looking for torque
more than HP (torque is good, m'kay?).

Check out http://www.yachtsurvey.com to see what that guy thinks of small
diesels. (He's coming from a marine diesel point of view.) Basically, he'd
go with gas up until the time you *have* to run diesel to get the power you
need. And a Rabbit ain't that time.

There is a diesel antifreeze you need to put in the fuel tank in the
wintertime. Diesel also has a problem with paraffin formation.
