Subject: Re: [T2] now what??  no fire in #2

78, FI, auto tranny

was getting a return of my intermittent miss.  very tiny only a person who
has ridden this bus for almost 10 years would notice......

however #2 isn't firing again!  there is fire at the plug, all other cyl
fire normally, compression is good, injector would act differently, almost
for sure it is elec......changed plugs "Again"  am running to my local
FLAPS as soon as rush hour is over to get some new SPwires...

???what am I missing???

Thanks
Bob
