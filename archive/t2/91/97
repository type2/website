The engine is a dual carb motor.  It starts off cold ok and idles.  As it 
seems to warm  up its almost as if only half the motor is running, then it 
will appear to run on all 4 but only shortly and then will backfire 
repeateldly when I give it gas. for as long as I leave it running.  I want to 
sync the carbs, but am open for other stories and opinions.
