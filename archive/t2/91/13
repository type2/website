Subject: Gauge Lighting

Hi Folks,

As part of the process of getting my Bus running again, I'm adding a vacuum 
gauge and a cyl. head temp gauge.  Hooking up the gauges is not a problem, 
but getting them lit for night usage is.  I now have 6 gauges atop my dash 
(oil temp, oil press, vacuum, cyl head temp, voltmeter, clock), and the feed 
from the stock instrument panel isn't enough to light all of them.

Is there a switched feed from the headlight switch or the fuse panel that I 
can splice into?  Should I hook up a separate light switch for my dashtop 
gauges?  Does anybody know how Ron Van Ness got all 10 of his gauges lit?

Thanks for any help or suggestions.
