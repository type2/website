Sam, I know you CA folks don't have much use for them, but a working gas
heater in a bus will turn the cold insides of a bus into tee shirt and
shorts temps in no time, and keep it there.  Even when you stop for lunch
and go inside and shut down the engine, when you come back, there's no "warm

BTW, my buddy is loving your engine stand he bought and other Buskatiers are
trying to get it away from him!!
