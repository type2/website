the 79 has a one year only exhaust system (ask me how i know) the
basic engine is just like the 78 except the 79 came from the factory
with square "vanagon" exhaust ports. at least the 79 (IIRC earlier
pancake engines) came w/ a cali setup and a federal setup. My federal
setup doesn't have any smog pump. But it does has the hook ups or the
EGR valves, but the PO took them off :(

While it's my first bus I have been very happy w/ the 2 liter. Hyd
lifters are veeeeeery nice.

I suspect you might have some issues w/ the fuel delivery system. Can
you get FI? for this engine?

> Whats the difference between a 78 and 79 engine?

I think just the heads. (square vs round)
