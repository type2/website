Generally, they are not DOT legal because back then they required the
reflector to be sealed.  There were a few H4 lights that were DOT legal
because they built a glass bulb around the H4 bulb inside the light.  I
think that they were marketed under the "Bobi" name.

I've never been hassled for my H4 lights.  Unless you have nasty
inspectors you have little to worry about if they are aimed properly.
