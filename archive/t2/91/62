John,

ROTFLMAO!!!!  and... I resemble that remark!

It has been a while since I did it, but you can re-aim the nozzles on a VW
washer system by inserting a fairly stiff sewing needle and moving them.
OK, it was more than 10 years ago on the '78, which was only 12 years old
at the time.  Who knows *how* frozen the nozzles on your bus are, but give
it a try.

On the hoses, I have had spectacularly bad luck finding metric hose here
in the colonies :-( I am told that fish tank air hose is good, but have
not tried it.  I tend to salvage good hose when I see it in yards,
especially the reinforciing collar pieces VW used.
