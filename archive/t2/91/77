Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Injectors

Guys,

I got my "rebuilt" injectors for $38 each(with core) from my local
vwflaps.  The seals that came with them seemed to fit well and they made
my bus that had sat for 8 years fire on the 6th turn.  Power seems fine on
a 132k original 2l.

I replaced the pressure regulator and cold start valve at the same time
with new ones also.  When I took my pressure regulator apart to see how it
was gummed up and how it worked, I was glad I paid the big bucks for a new
one.  I think that anything that I might have used to clean it would have
attacked the rubber diaphram inside.


As always...YMMV

Chers, dave
