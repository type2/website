Why not?

If I recall, that's where the dash lights get their power, from a terminal 
on the headlight switch.  Don't remember which one but it shouldn't be hard 
to figure out.  It will handle the load of two dozen of those little lights 
easily.  I have all of the gauges you mentioned above currently lit by 
tapping into the dash light wire and it has worked for years.
