Subject: 30/31/34 Solex on type 4 engine? 

I know I'm going to get sniped for this question,
but my wife is looking at the some of the ads in
the Bugs and Breasts magazine while I was looking
for carb parts.  She notices these stock bug
carbs are sooooo much cheaper than the those
pretty dual webers.  

Any way to adapt solex to type 4 engine? 
Fabricate a space to put on top of a progressive
weber manifold?  Any other single carb manifold
options for type IV?

(Disregard for now jetting, linkage, and
preheater issues. I know these will be big
problems.  I know that dual carbs meter better
and four throats are better than two, etc.  I
know, FI is the way to go, all that. I'm just
doing a mental exercise here.)

Thanks,
Ray
