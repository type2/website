Ray,

Just go back from another round of pulling apart the front end on the '73.
More fun than should be legal!  If anyone has a *civilized* way of getting
the upper trailing arms off,  I would love to hear it!

I would respond as Sean already has, but more so.  As with so many other
things, the powerplant on a bus is a *system*.  The FI was designed with
the EGR system in mind, so the ECU compensates for that extra inert gas,
whether the system is functioning or not.  If it is not functioning, then
you will be running a bit hotter in the heads at mid-throttle[1]. The #2
temp sender will respond to the extra heat by re-enriching the mixture,
but you are asking it to go beyond design parameters.

The beauty of VWs is that by and large you *can* replace many of the bits
randomly and with some playing, it will run.  It may not run quite as
well, but run it will.  VWs are amazingly tolerant that way.  At the same
time, every time I have strayed from "the one true path" I have regretted
it.  As a result of bitter (and costly) experience I have turned, over
time, into a "stock at all costs" freak.  Not that I favor any specific
year, but I try hard to keep the whole of the powerplant and associated
systems together.  Yes, the '73 has a 2L engine in it, but it has a 2L
trans, 2L FI, 2L ignition, 2L exhaust and 2L EGR system on it.

[1] If you have ever had an EGR valved apart then you know it is
hour-glass shaped... closed at no- and full-throttle and most open at
mid-throttle.
