Subject: Re: [T2] VW Diesels

There are 1.9 diesel motors that were used in post air-cooled VW 
sedans that were sold in Canada. These motors are available gray 
market in the US from a place called Parts Place in Michigan. It is 
basically like the 1.5/1.6 diesel Vanagon and Rabbit owners know and 
loveand will bolt in where a 1.6 diesel has been. The make mention of 
them being installed in air cooled buses by some of their customers. 
You can even get a TDI 1.9 from them.

Will it work? I don't know but it seems more interesting and 
dignifying than shoving a Pinto motor in your bus :)
