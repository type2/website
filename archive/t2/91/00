Hi Bob and Ron, 

Neat! I've seen the brochure before, But I've never seen 
the actual camper before! ..  Although I may have, and 
it would look kindof selfmade after a hard life and owner 
modifications. I've had a Kemperink long wheelbase/highroof 
conversion, and that was big inside, it had two loveseat 
size sleeping couches in it :) ..  I always had the plan 
to convert it to a flat (as possible) truck to haul VWs, 
as it is based on a single cab VW .. I had it for a while, 
got it with burned out engine compartment. I have a brochure 
of the split window version of it. When I get my stuff over 
here (It's still in Belgium, and it looks it's gonna be 
sitting there for a while :( ) I'll look into getting a 
scanner. I have some Bus brochures. (Also from the Mexican 
Bus) I know someone who had an Austrian Bus conversion 
brochure, it was a splitty on tracks, only two ever built 
by a professional Austrian coach builder. My Austrian 
friend had one of them in the past, but his collection 
focusses on war prewar VWs and early Porsches. I don't 
know why I am talking so much! :) ..  But if you're ever 
in Austria, (or France or Germany) you CAN'T miss it. 
It is Porsche Automuseum Helmut Pfeifhofer, in Gmund, 
Karnten, Austria. From 4wd VW Bugs, (he has two of three 
built for General Rommel of the Africa Korps) to 356 
Carerra's and Niki Lauda's Kaimann built Formula V, 
Schwimmwagen, Kuebelwagens, things like that ..  I'm 
getting carried away! ...  I love this place..  oh ..  
and Porsche built it's first car to bear the Porsche 
name in Gmund, the 356, Helmut bought the actual 
design studio that was part of the factory and converted 
it into the Austrian 356 clubs' clubhouse. WE GOTTA GO!

Oh well ..  I'm gonna get ready for the day :) ..  

Have a nice one!

Brian
