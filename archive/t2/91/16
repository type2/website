Subject: Removal hints?


Folks,
I'm going to pull my engine in my 78 T2 standard trans tomorrow so I can
then pull the gas tank and clean it out.

Since it's been a looong time(17 yrs) since I pulled this type of engine
does anyone have any special hints? For either the engine or the gas tank
pull?

The Bently manual seems to be kinda weird on the subject(late model
engines).  Basically, pull the engine, move it back a few feet and start
on the gas tank.

Do you really have to remove the shield above the muffler(on the body) as
the Bently manual states?

Cheers, dave
