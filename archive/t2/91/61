Subject: Re: [T2] gas tank/fuel sender clues

I just did my fuel tank on my 78 and the sender is on the top. The problem is
the hole is to small for you to fit your arm in. I don't think its even 3"
wide. I would just plan on removing the tank cleaning the inside and maybe
sealing it. My tank was not rusted or
clogged. I was replacing the sender while I had the motor out. I ended up
using por 15 fuel tank sealer on the inside as a precaution against rust.
