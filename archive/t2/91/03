It is not good, but it is hardly uncommon.  The engine runs fine, without
it, but a bit hotter and a bit less efficiently.  As Barry wrote earlier
today, the valves are often in bad shape at this age, even if they are
present.

yes

no, the filter lives under the tin near the muffler.

I am on my way out to my '73 to have another go at installing the new
front axle beam, I will try to get pics of the whole EGR system while I am
there and will post them later today.

That sounds like your voltage regulator.  Three wires to a plug? The VW
was silver can with relays inside, but aftermarket ones are all solid
state these days.

Hey! We all started out there!  Parts are, alas, not getting any easier to
find in junkyards, at least here on the east (or is that rust?) coast.
If you can get someone on the west coast or in the SW to lok for you, or
can arrange a "business trip" to LA or San Diego, it would make your life
a lot easier :-)  I am seriously thinking it is time to do just that,
travelling up and down the coast stopping at a variety of junk yards and
picking up bits. I miss West coast junkyards second most of all the things
in California.
