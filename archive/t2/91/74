When I reinstalled the EGR system on my '77 2.0L with stock everything I
noticed a 5 degree drop in head temps and 7-10 degrees cooler on the oil
for roughly equivalent conditions and driving style. I am sold on the EGR
system being a good thing, and will keep it installed until I can't fix or
find the parts anymore. Hopefully for a long time to come.
