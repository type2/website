Subject: gas tank/fuel sender clues

Folks,

I am pulling my engine and gas tank tomorrow.

78 t2 std trans

Does the fuel sender hole face the front or rear of the vehicle.

If the tank is "square" does the sender come out of the top?

The point is, if it faces the rear or top, can I get it out with the fuel
tank still in the car and feel around inside the tank before I have to 
take the whole thing out?...yes, I am lazy...if I can feel around inside
the tank without having to pull it, then maybe I can figure out what is 
covering the hole to the fuel pump and just take it out.

On the other hand, if such a thing is possible, and I feel all sort of
gunk in there, then I won't mind pulling it all anyway.

I just have visions of pulling everything only to find a pristine looking
tank with a piece of saran wrap or something similar floating around in
it.....probably not a chance in hell, but I gotta ask.

Cheers, dave
