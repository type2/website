Yeah. Try a Deutz 912. (Deutz makes both air-cooled and water-cooled
diesels.) Power up to 82kW/109hp, sadly one meter long from the face of the
pulley to the transmission mounting flange--meaning you'd have some serious
bodywork ahead of you if you wanted to use it in a Bus. Plus it's an
industrial engine not an automotive engine, so you'd have some environmental
problems with using it.
