He won't warrant an engine with a weber progressive or
any weber?  Will warrant Dellortos?  New dual carbs
means stock or any dual carbs?  I thought all
aftermarket carbs were jetted wrong for VW
applications and need to be properly jetted.  Is the
progressive completely incapable of being jetted
properly?
