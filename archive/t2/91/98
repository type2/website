Subject: ignition switch replacement

Hi Folks,
My igniton switch went on me last evening.  I read Bentley and the archives 
but I am still unclear to the proceedure. I have a '71 Deluxe.  The 
steering wheel is off, the turnsignal dangling, the tiny retaining screw is 
out.  Where do I go from here?
