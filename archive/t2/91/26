Subject: Fuel Shutoff solenoid - MAYBE

I've been searching (not too hard though) for a good 12 volt solenoid valve 
to stop fuel flow from the gas tank into the fuel line to the fuel pump for 
a while. I want to stop gravity fuel flow incase of a fire and it would be 
helpful as a theft deterrent (as would a simple kill switch on the electric 
fuel pump).

Basically open the valve electrically to allow fuel flow to the pump and in 
case of fire, kill the power and the valve closes eliminating the fuel flow 
to the ground (fire) if there is an engine compartment fire.

I have not verified that the cost is reasonable, nor that an American 
supplier couldn't supply these (cheaper) but the fact sheets looked good. I 
also do not know if the stainless steel valve (or the others) is rated for 
continuous duty of flammable solvents like gasoline.

But gives ya an idea of what I'm working towards. I am seeking other ideas 
and links if anyone has any.
