Subject: VW Diesels

I've got an 85 turbo diesel.  I call it the Antichrist.  If you've ever seen
'THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY" you'd understand.

I get 50 MPG and can almost get out of my own way going downhill with a
tailwind.  I also go 100 miles per day to work and back all week on $13 of
fuel.  Is it a bus?  No.  Would I put this engine in a bus?  No, but I would
entertain thoughts of a slightly more powerful one.  I hate the car but my
wallet speaks louder than my aesthetic desires.  It's not a bus, and once I
spoon tyres on my old airhead BMW and it warms up a bit the Antichrist will
be relegated to really bad weather days.  There are air-cooled diesels
available, you see them mostly in industrial strength wood chippers and
such.  I think Wisconsin makes them.  Again, probably not bus power
material.
