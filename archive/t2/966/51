Yes. This is just outside the butterfly. I think that
it will get good vacuum even if the needle is shorter
as the butterfly defines a split flow at that point
and maximizes velocity on both the existing vacuum
port side and the side I drilled. Add to this the fact
that it is a very short distance from the plenum where
the air gets going every which-ways, there is
virtually no possibility of feeding one cylinder more
than any other. That said, though, I wonder how well
"mixed" the wet air is only 100mm from the mixing
point - because it is going to drop in velocity when
it reaches that plenum with its larger volume.

I would be more comfortable with a needle that reaches
the center of the area between the butterfly and the
sidewall, or 1/4 of the entire throttle bore, simply
because that is point of max velocity - the center of
the bore is messed up with vortices caused by the
butterfly.
