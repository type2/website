What you need is a mechanic's stethoscope. Just like a doktor's 
except it has a metal probe on the end. I used mine daily in the shop 
to verify source of strange noises. Just press the end of the probe 
firmly against the various possibles and you should be able to verify 
the source. Such noises can bounce all around the engine compartment 
and be virtually impossible to isolate otherwise.

The generator bearing on my 67 Porsche has been grouling for over ten 
years now when cold. It goes away after just a minute or two warm up. 
As long as it keeps going away, I am not concerned. It's a 40 year 
old original otherwise in perfect working order and has every right 
to groul a bit when waking up. It is not a big worry unless it progresses.

Other possible sources of Bus grouling: Alternator bearings, dizzy 
either shaft or gears, clutch pilot or throw out bearing. Least to 
most worry(cost/break down potential): dizzy bearing or gear, 
alternator bearing, clutch, dizzy crank gear wear.
