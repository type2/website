Subject: VW Westy mirrors....."inclination"

I am always amazed at how the Mirrors are positioned on "Bay window" Westys,
the "plate" that is....  some are positioned with the bias up, and some in the
stock position.  Is there an occult "message" by position, I am not priviledge
to?  Inquiring minds want to know....eh?
