I think my Yahoo!Mail is going batty, cuz I missed this first message.

I've been meaning to order a few.  I lose the passenger side glass
every Summer when we go camping, and I buy a used mirror from someone
for $10 instead.  The next Summer, out pops _that_ glass.  Happened
twice.  This time, I swear to myself, I'll just buy the glass and mount
it so it doesn't fall out!

Good luck,
