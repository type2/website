Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon Seat Armrest Removal

Don -

You might want to add that your procedure applies to 88-91 Adjustable
Armrest equipped seats.  Vanagon GLs & Westies thru 1987 have shorter,
non-adjustable armrests that are held onto the seat with just a hex-head
bolt accessed thru a removable plastic cap in the armrest itself.

Nice write-up tho :-)
