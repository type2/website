Subject: retractable seatbelts from GoWesty

I just installed the retractable seat belts from GoWesty and it is like 
THE BEST upgrade ever!  Their shipping was SUPER fast as I think it 
arrived in a day or two after ordering it - granted, they are in CA as 
well, but still.. great service - great upgrade!

So yeah, I'm super stoked.  I don't need to explain how to use the seat 
belt to my passengers any more :)
