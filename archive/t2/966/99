Subject: Battery Terminal accessory tab

I've been looking for this brass ring terminal for the battery terminal:

The original AMP terminal had one built in and It let's you quickly  
connect an accessory.

Does anyone know of a vendor that sells this ring terminal? You'd  
think it was pretty common but I can't find it anywhere.

I'm not interested in a replacement cable with the accessory wire  
already attached.
