As a matter of fact, it's pretty well known that promoting auctions is
not something welcomed on the list.  This is clearly stated in the charter
and gets discussed again every time someone decides to ignore the charter
"just this once" to promote their auction.  Since you seemed to think that
your action might not be proper, you should have checked before posting.

If you want to sell something to the list, just post it here and ask a
fair price.

As you know, this is a mailing list, not a web forum.  Everything you
post goes out immediately and cannot be "moderated."  The only moderation
we practice here is to remove people from the list entirely.
