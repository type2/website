Hey guys,

    I hope you don't mind me posting this... if I'm not supposed to, then
moderator please delete and I'm sorry. :)  I made an impulse buy several weeks
ago and brought home a 1974 VW 412; I haven't even finished my Bus yet. Wife
says I need to get rid of it because we can't have 8 cars at the house.  If
you know anyone that might be interested, please forward this to them.
