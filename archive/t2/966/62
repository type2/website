 I agree, Don. It's fascinating to think how something so simple could be so
effective, and yet, rarely is it instituted. The benefits are numerous
(better cooling, better mileage, longer engine life... I could go on and
on). In fact, I was just doing some research on the potential to mix other
things in with the water. Various liquids can go in, like alcohol or
methanol to both retard freezing and improve combustion. And what of the
possibility of microbial growth? There's a whole treatise right there. And
don't even get me started on bottle placement. I think I may want to rig up
my sink so I can have an overflow valve on the drain for auto filling. Often
too I wonder if we might need an injector to help create a mist. I think
this topic is fascinating. It keeps me up at night.

Or we could just talk about the best tires for a bus...
