Hi there,

I'm betting that your flexible fuel vapor recovery system lines  
suffered some damage when the canister came loose.  There's one in  
particular that's behind the spare tire holder that is often left un- 
replaced because it's a little difficult to get to (it's red in image  
on the following page).

Check out the 'FI Fuel tank' section about two thirds of the way down  
on this page:
http://www.ratwell.com/technical/FuelHoses.html

It shows exactly where all of the vapor recovery lines are.  When  
those lines decompose and leak you can definitely smell it (I suppose  
especially now when the weather is getting warmer).  When the red one  
leaks the smell comes mostly from the driver's side air scoop.

In regards to Chris's suggestion (fuel filler neck) you can take a  
quick gander at that too via the pie plate on the passenger side of  
the engine compartment.

Good luck!

Zack
