Subject: Strange "loose bushing low pitched squeal" coming from Cyl 3/4

I started up the bus today just to warm her up and do a health check,
I don't drive my bus much so I start it periodically just to keep
everything running.

I did my usual pre-flight, checked fuel hoses, oil, belt tension,
checked for new oil spots etc.

Took a few turns to start but not multiple attempts.  There was a
noticable slow down when I let out the clutch which smoothed out once
she got a little warmed up.

During warm up I ran around back and listened for valve noise and any
other odd sounds which should or shouldn't be there.  I heard sort of
a sick bearing "rattle/squeal/warble" coming from around the #3 cyl.
It went away after the bus got warmed up but I figured I would pose
the question to the list.

Some particulars:
I did not rev the engine at all to see if it was affected by RPM.  It
wasn't constant and seemed to come and go a few times before
eventually "going away".

I have a 1.7 75' that was built out to 1.9 with aftermarket
performance heads(Mark stephens(sp) phase 1) 2.0 litre Bosch EFI from
a 78'

It seemed to come from the top of the engine as it did not seem any
louder from underneath.  Any ideas?
should I be worried?

I am thinking maybe the distributor shaft?
