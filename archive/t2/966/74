Subject: Re: [T2] Sick of the water injection BS

I'm sorry if I offended you, this was not my intention. My blurb to
remind folks of other, more thread-selective opt-in discussion groups
was made in haste and missed the mark.

I had not found your content outside of the helping community of this
list, nor do I consider it BS.  Next time I'll measure twice. Please
accept my apology.
