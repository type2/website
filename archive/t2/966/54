	Bussy you're too kind.

	yes, that too  -  but much more importantly, in thousands of 
miles of testing on many different carbs.
	FI & diesel much less researched, but nonetheless far better 
proven than any other widely-useable way of improving power &/or 
mileage c.10%.

	The right silicone will allow several placements & removals 
while retaining perfect seal.

	Rahd awn Bussy
	But this latter 'autoshutoff' may not be essential.  What 
little air is drawn past the needle on the over-run may well benefit 
from humidifying & cooling.  A large flow on the over-run might 
conceivably chill the cyl heads fast enough to crack them, but I 
doubt it; listen for whistling sounds   ...

	Welcome news indeed  -  even the cyberdazzled can recover 
from digital complexity and get back to basics, analogue processes, 
and appropriate technology.  Yet he can retain ability for 
cyberimaging eclipsing my own.

	Flattery will get you somewheres, Bussi.  Failure modes 
proliferate with comlexity, more than you can imagine.  Simplicity is 
the watchword; use forces already to hand, and minimize transducers, 
power inputs, etc.  Find a force that varies according to need and 
tap into that.

	woop woop woop    pull up   pull up
	See the point by recalling the venturi in the   -  grope back 
now, stay with me  -  carb. The same flow (cc/s) where sucked thru a 
narrow stretch flows faster (cm/s) , sucking fuel out of a Solex 
power jet suspended in the middle, or water out of a tiny hole in the 
wall retarding the distributor timing as vac drops upon opening of 
the throttle 'ahead of the rpm' when preignition becomes more likely 
but is totally quashed, quelled & kybosched by WI.

>than the carb version.

	Sock it to 'em Bussy  -  in theory they're right but so many 
faults can degrade performance in even early FI that it may not 
achieve any better economy than a well maintained carb.
	Anyhow both stand to benefit from WI so we can leave aside 
this argument.  We're trying to help the FI airhowlers.

	This is not a venturi with anything like the suction of the 
far smaller cross-section in a carb venturi putting thru a similar 
flow.  Therefore a blood donor needle, or two, is needed.
	The much smaller needles made for Vacutainers are needed for 
the smaller air horn just inside the carb in the 1600 DP.  The 
suction there is so large that 0.5 mm ID gives a rather high water 
feed rate.  That makes the filter more crucial.  With the big needles 
blockage by dirt is less likely.  Make the most of the acquisition of 
that panty=hose hem, because one will make 10^2 filters.  A nut 
screwing onto the 5mm OD PVC tube holds the filter and weighs down 
that pickup near the bottom of the bottle.

	Exactly
	The vac regime so ably envisaged by Busahaulic would maximise 
the economy & cooling at cruise, while retaining enough vac on 
wide-throttle acceleration to quell preignition.

	The most I'm dreaming of is my 50 hp motor giving 70 hp for 
brief hillclimbing, and passing Splitties.  I fear the water will at 
best get me only half the way; other notions being developed under 
shrouds  ...

	This would be correct.
	Sock it to 'em
	Tell eet lahk EET  EEEEUZ

	No WI is not too good to be true.  It's the only proven way 
to get substantial improvement in cooling, emissions, power, & 
economy.  Nobody, not even Busahaulic, can patent it, and groups of 
VW enthusiasts could make small production runs bringing very little 
profit.  D Trump would not attempt takeover.  The people can help 
themselves, using some rubbish from the consumer frenzy (the plastic 
water bottles).
	Mark Dearing will be redeveloping his sparger fogger to 
humidify the sucked-in air more thoroughly.  That looks like the next 
great leap forward  -  key component sintered glass fish-bubbler.  It 
too will be unpatentable & DIY.  J C Whitney may resume selling a WI 
kit.  Holley may wake up from their stupid 12V pump pushing air in 
the top of the air-cleaner, with transducers on water temp & vac. 
Don't give them a cent.  Do as Busahaulic & Unca Robt say  -  or else 
you will continue to waste c.10% of the fuel you buy, emit more toxic 
exhaust fumes, run hotter than necessary, and lay less rubber as you 
burn off Grand Ams at the lights.
