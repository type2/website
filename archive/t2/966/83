Subject: Re: [T2] Door Handles

My '79 has straps and armrests...wait a minute - are
you calling the armrests door handles? Anyway, the
straps have a spring steel liner under that vinyl and
hooks that engage into slots in the door panel so the
stress is on the hooks and not the screws. So, if I am
understanding your question, "no." -BaH

 Just thought of a question:
 
 I replaced the OEM seats in my '79 with Vanagon
 seats and had to take the
 door handles off.
 
 Do the old vinyl door straps screw into the holes
 left by the door handles?
