Late 80's. Don't know the year, I didn't check the VIN on the donor
Vanagon at the pull'n'save.

I'm 5'11" mostly torso and fit with several inches of headroom. It
adds just an inch or two above stock.

I'm going to make a removable plate to cover it. That way if I ever
need to put them in a Vanagon (or if I take the fresh air ducts off
the doors) I can reinstall the arms.

Yep. That's why I needed to remove the arms. It looks like without the
ducting they might fit with the armrests.

Thanks. There was info around but nothing with pictures. I just wanted
to get something out there for the visually oriented among us. =D
