Bussy our man
	       Now you're thinking analog (tho' outcyberdoing me by 
miles).  Your schematic is admirable, to define one good vac regime; 
also the existing vac port implies another regime.
	The existing vac connection is worth trying.  Your new 'big 
boss' needle position is also worth trying.
	In either case a challenge will be to get a needle long 
enough to reach to the middle of this rather wide air passage.  Your 
needle in your pic looks a good deal longer than typical medical 
needles as used with Vacutainers.  Or is there some other cheap 
source of mass-produced stainless tubing ID 0.5 - 1.5 mm?

	The 'mirror image' vacuum regime just inside the throttle 
butterfly is maximal on over-run, and depending on air leaks may feed 
some water then  -  unlikely to cause trouble, but can't be sure. 
The right needle will feed enough water to quash preignition in hard 
acceleration, but then more water when you roll off to cruise.  I 
expect this jet position to maximise fuel economy, but not water 
economy, i.e substitutes water for fuel more than the 'outside' 
regime.
	The difference is as described in my earlier WI Bull 1.1.  A 
water jet just outside the throttle butterfly experiences little or 
no vacuum on over-run, and v little at idle, but is sucked by c.0.3 
atm {10' of water barometer} when accelerating hard.  Economic cruise 
may show c.0.15 atm which will feed water slower than when it's most 
needed during hard acceleration.  This regime, achievable using the 
hi-vac nozzle which goes to the dizzie from many Solex, Stromberg, 
etc carbs, supplies motive force to feed water in rough accord with 
need & economy.  To slap a water jet into this part of the VW carb 
venturi will require a special hole (gasket, etc).  But our theme now 
is FI.
	For FI or diesel a transfusion needle is a good stab at the 
point you indicate.  If another needle is needed in parallel, a 
second pipe thru the bottle cap is easier than a Y-junction.
	I believe these water pipes should rise all the way from the 
bottle.  But if you must slap in a turning point of inflection, keep 
an eye on it for airlocks.


	If we are to get reliable info on these setups as fast as 
possible, let's record fuel vols to fill at recorded mileages.

	BTW why is there any throttle butterfly if fuel injection can 
vary fuel supply according to need?  Why not take in a full charge of 
air each cycle, as diesels are claimed to do?
