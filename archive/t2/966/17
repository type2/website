Subject: Re: [T2] water injection on a fuel injection engine

Ideally, a narrow spot where the airflow velocity is
higher - but where is that? The 'S' hose is not a good
place and there isn't really any place after the
throttle body as it goes directly into the plenum
where it really slows down. It looks to me like the
vacuum port on the throttle body would be the point of
best airflow velocity - or drill another hole in that
same vicinity directly opposite that vacuum port so
you could insert the needle a bit into the airflow
without having to worry about the throttle valve
(butterfly) hitting it. A slightly oversized hole with
a silicone plug that mushrooms out on the outside is
what I'm thinking. After proving, the silicone plug
could be replaced with an epoxy or polyurethane plug
(the needle, of course sticking in through the plug.)
