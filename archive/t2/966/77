And while we're at it, how would I determine where the timing mark is
on a fan pulley without a timing mark? I was thinking of filing my own
mark on the pulley.

Richard Atwell says 42mm from the center of the bolt almost inline
with the wide slot on the fan to the inside portion of the pulley.

Any help on this one?
