Subject: not using drivers side window

Hi gang,

 

When I had my paint job done, I discovered that my rear left quarter window
would not stay shut.

 

So, we ordered a full pane of glass and put it in.

 

Now I have a regular pane of glass, without the louvered portion for a 1978
CDN Westy.

 

Anyone want one?

 

73,

 

Alan
