Subject: Re: [T2] Side View Mirrors

Get the flowable silicone calk for windshields (Corning, I think, any 
Autozone type place has it- good for bad window seals)- prudle out any 
loose original sealer from around the glass.  Flow in the silicone and 
let dry.  If sealer is missing enough to lift out the glass, then clean 
it all out and put in a bead of bathtub silicone or urethane sealer, 
then insert mirror, wiping off any oversquishing.

twice. "
