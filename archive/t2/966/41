	This sounds like as near as could be in a FI motor to the 
method I'm now using on my 1600 DP.
	Let me re-emphasize: the needle point should be near the 
middle of the intake pipe, or else there may be some risk of putting 
more water into one cylinder bank than the other.  This would make 
the vehicle steer in a large circle, R or L   ;-}  ...   but even if 
not, it's definitely desirable for all cylinders to be upsouped to 
the same extent, rather than say 10% more power from two of them.
