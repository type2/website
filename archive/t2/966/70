Subject: [T2] 73 rear brakes picture??

anyone got a good straight on view of the rear brake shoes and components.
  I need one that is with it all together so i can see where i went wrong...
  i have looked in bentley but that picture doesnt help and checked the type 2 libary and found no pictures on rear brake shoes...??
  i usually leave one side on but in theis case i had to take both sets off cuase the PO had tach welded the e brake hooks to the old shoes instead of using the anchor pins and clips...
   
  i had ot take the old shoes and have the e brake hook cut off both...
  when i got back home i wasnt sure if i put it all back together..
  i thought i did until i went to adjust them and they werent right...
  and the e brake isnt right either... sooooo now i need a pic to see whati did wrong..
  anyone know ?
  thanks
  chai
