Subject: Website's back up

Finally found away to get the website back up without spending a fortune.

I purchased a reseller's account with a hosting service that charges a tad
less than my previous one.  The fees that my webhosting clients are paying
will cover my own costs for hosting their and my own websites.

I'm sorry for the bother of trying to link to my website and finding it
unavailable.

Now to straighten out the financial mess from nearly going out of
business...
