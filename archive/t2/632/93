Subject: Various seals for the floorboard

I'm trying to deal with the rust and leaks in the floorboad of my 76.  I see a
lot of holes that represent direct opening to the outside (and everything that
comes with it, cold air, noise, dirt, etc..).
Right now my parking brake lever has no seal around the bottom.  I found
211-341 on WCM "Boot Emergency Brake".  Says fits 68 -79 so I guess I'm good
there.
When released the clutch is sealed by a seal that comes from underneath, but
when you push it down there is a big opening.  Is there supposed to be an
addtional seal that is open just enough for the shaft to slide through?
I guess same holds true for the brake.
The hole for the gas pedal is open as well.  I found 211-621 on WCM "Boot
Accelerator, Rod on Floor".  Looks right.
Finally, what looks like a drain hole.  Seals for this one?
Any advice or part numbers welcome.
Thanks!
Mike
