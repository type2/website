Subject: engine stands.

I have a Lufkin engine stand which appears nearly identical to the
current Harbor Freight engine stand. I can arrange the arms such that I
can bolt up three arms but not the fourth. I was considering using some
flat bar stock as an adapter when I noticed the stands illustrated at a
few of the vendors only appear to have two connecting arms. What do
y'all do to get your engines mounted on stands? Are three arms (one
high, two low) enough support?

Thanks yet again, in advance,

jack
