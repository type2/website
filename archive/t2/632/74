There's already been of good suggestions on this, but I didn't see anybody
mention the obvious: Anytime you're replacing shoes on the rear drums you
need to loosen the hand brake cables BEFORE adjusting the stars.  Then,
after you've got the stars adjusted, go back and adjust your hand brake
cables.
