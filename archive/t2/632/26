List et al,  For years I have been using Mitchell's Collision Estimating
Guide with part Numbers. It has been very useful. The manuals I have were
published in 1980. As far as I know they are still available for $75.00 a
year. Covering all autos and pickups. Published by Mitchell Manuals,INC 4926
Savannah Street, POBox 80427 San Diego CA 92138. I would like to see this on
a CD.
