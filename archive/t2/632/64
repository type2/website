Subject: 76-79 Westy rear cabinets

Folks...

I'm starting some interior work on my '76 Westy.  The first task (new 
curtains) requires that I pull the rear cabinets.

Does anyone have a list of all the fasteners that hold those things 
down?  I removed all the ones I could see but they wouldn't budge.
