I put a gauge cluster from a Porsche 924 in my 73 Westy about 5 years ago
and everything worked fine.  Since the 924 used a VDO dual oil pressure
gauge/dummy-light sender just like the buses, the only real concern was the
gas gauge and speedo.  Miraculously, the speedo was spot-on and the gas
gauge was close enough.  So as long as the Jetta cluster doesn't use a lot
of funky electronics to interpret the inputs it may work out.  

Just don't make any permanent changes to the bus until you've verified
everything will work (ie. don't cut any wires or dash material).
