>>Maybe it's too far adjusted in and needs
to come out a bit to clear?<<

This makes sense to me. So the shoes might not be "balanced" so to
speak. With the screw all the way in, one end of the shoes sticks too
far out. Therefore, the drum contacts that end as the wheel turns.

I will move the adjuster screws out a little and see if this helps. 

Thank you.
