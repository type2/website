About 12 years ago, I replaced the original shocks on my 73 Westy with a set
of Monroe shocks (pretty much the same as the NAPA ones I expect) for about
$10 each.  The difference was substantial.  Of course, it wasn't as much fun
because I could no longer make the front-end rise and drop at a stop light
like it had hydraulics (via judicial use of brake, gas, and clutch).  But
the new ride was awesome.  For about 6 months.  Then it started getting VERY
soft again and I replaced the Monroes with KYB's.  Ran those for 10 years
and they were as good at the end as they were at the beginning.  Personally
I didn't find the ride harse at all, but that may be because my other car is
a 914 that is lowered about 2 inches...
