Subject: 76 Westy Deluxe kitchen light

Folks...

I think I've concluded that my broken kitchen light is beyond repair.  
Does anyone have a spare kitchen light for a 76 Westy Deluxe they would 
be willing to sell or trade for?  I think the light is the same for all 
76-79 US model Westfalias (I know the Canadian model is different), but 
I'm not 100% certain.
