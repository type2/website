Hi Folks,

By the way, now that the engine is running and breaking in, are there any 
things I should keep an eye on or plan to work on in the near future?  Do 
the heads need to be re-torqued at some point?  Should I adjust the valves 
more frequently?  Do I need to change the oil at 500mi, at 1,000mi?
