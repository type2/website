It's a matter of preference I'm sure.  FWIW, I've
driven the KYB Gasadjusts all the way around on
all my buses since the late 80s.  I like them
well enough and haven't noticed any ride
problems.  I've also had Boge's and Monroes
(which I think the GR2s are made by), but I
didn't like the softer handling.  

It might be an age thing too.  I've noticed that
older guys I know like vehicles with oil filled
shocks that (in my opinion) wallow a little but
ride better.   The teeneagers seem to like
airbags and cars that scrape the ground.  To each
his own I suppose.  

If you make it to a VW event, maybe you could
convince a few bus pilots to let you take a few
test drives.  Bring beer!  :)
