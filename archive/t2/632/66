Subject: intake manifold gasket

Greetings all,

	I am getting ready to reinstall the weber DFEV progressive 
carb on my 1700cc type 4 ('72). My question is for others with the 
same setup as to what type of gasket you use on the intake 
manifold/head union.
	I've looked at the stock metal gasket, but have concerns 
about it.  It seems thin to me and the intake manifolds with the 
Weber dont look as precise as the stock manifolds.  Anything I can do 
to eliminate vacumn leaks I will do.
	So? RTV? Gasket material (cork/fiber)? Stock?

	Also, any hints for getting the rear shift rod boot on?  It's 
nasty under there.  TIA
