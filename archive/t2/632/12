Chris,

I think there might be something wrong with the way your sender is
installed. It is important to have the sender mounted on the head so it
cannot move or rotate when you remove the spark plug, and I have come up
with a foolproof method for this. It requires putting a notch in the spark
plug hole counter bore, which is not always possible, depending on when you
install the gauge. Our "foolproof" method works well when you have the head
on the bench, but I have done it with the engine assembled also.

We wrote a tech article on installing the gauge and sender which illustrates
this method and also shows another method for installing the sender without
cutting the head.
