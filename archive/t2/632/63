I've used NAPAs,  They lasted a few years and finally started leaking when
I loaded the bus heavier than normal.  Handling was OK, but I'm not all
that picky.

Yes, that's the problem.  You have to flex and bang the thing to get it
into place and then there is residual stress on the engine and muffler.

Doing it properly by heating and bending the muffler flanges with a torch
is very time consuming, as it is a trial-and-fit procedure with four
different flanges.

Better to get a better muffler to begin with.
