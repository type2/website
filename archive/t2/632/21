Subject: fuel pump weirdness...

This just keeps getting weirder and weirder.....
 
I've been working on finding the fault in the wiring for a few hours.  The fuel pump is "hot" all the time the battery is connected, not just when the key is in the ignition....
 
When I disconnected the brown (supposed to be red) line from the solenoid than runs current over the transmission and to the engine compartment, the fuel pump finally went "cold".
 
But of course I need juice in that line to run the motor.  I re-connected it.  I disconnected the ignition coil completely - fuel pump still "hot".
 
I disconnected the auxillary air regulator, the cold start valve and the thermo-time switch (I thought I might have connected them incorrectly) - fuel pump still "hot".
 
Any ideas?  What thing in the engine should be "hot" all the time?
 
Thanks for any help you can give me....

Marc
