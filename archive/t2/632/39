O.K. guys, since you have been so suportive in the last years I decided to
lift the bus and cheked the # part of my konis, the # is 80 2110 and I found
a site that listed them for VW transportes 72-79 starting from chassis
numbers. 22.000.097.
If you can find and afford them they worht every penny.
