Actually, they all seem to be missing, at least for now;  Wolfsburg's
website lists them all as "not in stock."

I already carry (and have for some time) the actual German Westfalia plad
fabric for '76-79, in two flavors - the green plaid for Sage Green campers,
and the yellow/orange for Chrome Yellow campers.  I will eventually have the
other plaids as well. But perhaps not as soon as Wolfsburg will; while
theirs is a repro, mine comes from the original German supplier and they are
slow to produce.
