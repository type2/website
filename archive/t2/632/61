Subject: Strange type1 case. 

Anybody see one of these before?  It has a spin-on filter boss and typeIV lifters.

http://www.thesamba.com/vw/classifieds/detail.php?id=97065

Cast number on the case is 070 101 101A.  Has the 3 holes so it would work in a 68-71 bus.
Does not have the oil fill like a typeIII or a universal case.

Is this a late Mexican bug case?
