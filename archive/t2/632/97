Subject: any differences btwn 1978 2.0L Type IV and 1979 2.0L Type IV

Hi All,

Subject line says it all. I've got a chance to buy a used 2.0L from a 78 
bus. I currently have a 79 bus (calfi. FI).

Is there anything I should be concerned of in terms of not matching my 
motor? Heads, case, etc?

Thanks,
Harry
