Subject: Re: [T2] Re: What shocks do you prefer

I have Koni on the front axle of my 1977 European spec Westfalia (1600 DP
T1), they are oil filled and are also adjustable, this shocks work great,
and prove to last longer. I used to have a 1976 Westfalia American spec
(2.0L FI) that came with the shocks about 7 years ago, I sold the bus to a
friend who put some KYB gas adjust in the four corners so I could keep the
konis, since that I used the konis in my 65 beetle, then about 3 years ago I
got my european westy so I move the shocks from the beetle to the bus, I
have been using this same shocks for about 7 years  in my dayli drivers and
still counting , during the same time my friend westy has seen a few sets
(at least two) of KYB, by now I got a full set of Goodyear Wrangler RT/S
195R14 C SUV tires and she feels like as Joe said "(relatively speaking)
slotcar-ish ". I can tune the shocks to set them up smooth if i want.
