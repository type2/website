Subject: weird fuel pump...

Hello all - 
 
I have an 81 Vanagon CA emissions that I've been attempting to revive for about a year.  I'm pretty close (I think)
 
The engine's turning over, but not getting fuel.  I think the fuel pump is shot.  But it's doing strange things.  First of all, the leads to the fuel pump are hot all the time, even without the key in the ignition.   Second, when I was removing the fuel pump, it kicked on intermitingly.  I re-installed it, and nothing, but if I tap the end near the fuel tank with a screwdriver, again it came on briefly after each tap.
 
Any ideas?
 
Thanks - 
 
Marc
