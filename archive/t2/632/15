Subject: weird TS switch problem

Hi all,
I have an all-stock 72 Westy.
When the headlights are on, if I switch the turn
signal to make a right turn, the high-beams switch on.

THe right turn signal goes on as it should, but the
hihgbeam switch gets activated, too.

If I pull up on the switch, the hibeams are activaed
just as they should.

So, in short, all functions work as they shoud , but
the hi-beams are also activated when I turn right.

Does anyone know if this is a wiring problem, versus a
problem with the switch?

Oh yeah, the switch is a little difficult to push
forward and back, and the cancellation feature doesn't
work.
thoughts?

Thanks,
Jason
