my question exactly...if you shim the motor mounts, it will make the bearer
bar go even LOWER and hit the heat exchanger worse, unless you shim the high
side to bring up the low side.  I'm not real fond of this solution though may
try it as a last resort.  i think they're just cheap motor mounts.

Shim those motor mounts with a flat washer or two between the mount and bearer
