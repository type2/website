That's it!  I should have remembered the 'STOP.'  Thanks so much.  Now I 
can know exactly where TDC is regardless of the scratches, PO marks, 
etc. and KNOW I'm setting everything correctly.  And I don't have to 
have help.  May God bless Karl von Salzen.  I know he's missed by many 
here.  Ciao...KR
