I see this Golfcat has the optional wire stand to put it on a floor or
table. That is what the Blackcat does, which I have- very portable
(takes least space) for a 3,000 btu heater. Hang a divider curtain in
your camper behind the front seats and it will take the chill out of the
air without an open flame.  We use the single burner screw on top of the
tank stove to do the same thing- to warm up the interior, standing in
the center of the floor. Warm up your morning tea/coffe/cocoa at the
same time!
