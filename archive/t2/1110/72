Hi John,

there appears to be a captive seatbelt bolt thread in the body work either
side just below window height, about level with front of the parcel shelf.
There's also something central in the sloping panel between rear floor and
parcel shelf - looks like another captive thread - would these have been
present in a late kombi for back seat bus use do you think?

It looks to me like the aftermarket rock and roll bed has been bolted into
the 3rd point...

Cheers

Dan
