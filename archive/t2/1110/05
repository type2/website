Subject: mechanical Turn signal woes

Is there any adjustment on a turn signal to get them to bounce back after a
left turn? The right turn springs back fine. I've cleaned them , and nothing
looks broken inside. 

 

Need new guts or whole unit? I see that they are some "complete"
reproduction turn signals out there - Anyone ever changed a turn signal? 

 

Thanks,
