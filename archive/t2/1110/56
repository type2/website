Subject: [T2] What have you done for your bus lately?

Man another productive weekend on the bus...

I found a place that had a reman brake booster for around $150 and grabbed a
new master cylinder as well. Installed rather easily, bleed the brakes and now
my brakes feel so nice. Not quite new car brakes but probably as close as it
gets. Also the steering coupler (rubber disc) looked kinda crusty so I
replaced it with a new one. The old one had some many cracks in it. I couldn't
believe how bad it was.

Next on the list of things to do is replace the 009 distributor with a quality
SVDA unit. Currently running a 009 with a weber progressive on a 2.0L
engine(recently rebuilt). Not real excited about the way it runs. Looking at
jetting the carb differently also. I wish I could afford a different carb
system... oh well.

Body work has begun. Body is pretty straight, just need to patch a few small
rust spots and battery tray. Think I will use the Metal Epoxy method with the
battery tray. Just have to find some epoxy locally. Anyway thanks for
listening. I have no one else to brag to about this kinda stuff.


Dan glad to hear you getting into the gas tank compartment!
