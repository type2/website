Hi Volks,

OK, it's hard to believe but apparently there are only three weeks to go 
before EveryBus 2010; the eleventh annual bus gathering at Hagan-Stone 
Park near Greensboro NC.

I first attended EB back in 2001, along with a few other local bus 
owners, the paint was still tacky from the pop-top transplant I finished 
the week before. We took three days to get there, and arrived well after 
dark on Thursday. When I awoke the next morning to see that I had parked 
at the edge of a field with over 100 other buses.... that was a pretty 
amazing moment.

I've been back to Everybus every year, except for missing it in 2009 due 
to its date change to fall. My family and I have come to know a great 
many wonderful people at this event, and we look forward to it every 
spring. Apparently this is the last year that the organizer is planning 
to run it and as of this writing there is no plan for his succession.

Anyway, I haven't heard any talk on this list about EveryBus just lately 
and thought it would be a good idea to put it out there and see who's 
gonna be there.


Happy Trails,
