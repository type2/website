I guess it depends on the quality of your cup-holders!! 

I had a big propane tank with one of those tank-top heaters mounted 
between the seats and tied securely with bungee cords.  That's what is 
not safe.  But now I have a Mr. Heater Buddy mounted securely behind the 
passenger seat with the controls easily accessible from the drivers 
seat.  Still unsafe but, hey, I ride motorcycles and fly hang gliders, 
so that is the least of my worries.  OK, now off to adjust valves and 
figure out why the Bopmobile won't idle.  And if I can just figure out 
how to get her to run on water.  I hear it's got hydrogen in it.  :)
