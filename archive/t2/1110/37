Thanks. That's interesting to know. One of the main reasons I (and I suspect
others) gave up on the weber progressive is the boots cracking or not sealing
properly leading to potentially disastrous lean running.

Seals breaking. I've had webers missing the case mount so that the
manifold was only secured by the rubber boots. Must be the quality of
the boots as mentioned already.
