Hi Bob,

In the winter of 2007 I did a teardown on a 1.7L motor and I wanted to
know it would run properly BEFORE I put it in the van. The engine install
would be happening in the driveway and building the engine test rig made
it a LOT easier to set the timing and tune it before it went outside for
installation.

It was not as hard as you'd think. I didn't have a stand as such, I just
set it on the table with a couple of small wooden blocks underneath to
improve airflow.

The parts required were as follows:
I used a spare starter and bellhousing to spin the engine.
I used a lawn mower gas tank for the fuel, with a T in the line as
discussed elsewhere for the fuel return.
I had a bracket attached to the bell housing to mount the fuel pump,
double relay, ECU, decel valve, ballast resistor pack and ignition
switches.
I made my own bus-side harness to connect the double relay. The pin-outs
for the double relay are well documented in the type2.com library.
The battery sat on the floor next to the table.
I used a doorbell push-button for the starter and a spare toggle switch to
control power to the coil/double relay. I ran 2.5" ducting to take the
exhaust fumes outside.

Running the engine for 5 minutes would heat the garage for about 40 minutes.

I have pics at home, I will post them online later tonight.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
