Subject: valve adjustment and spark plugs

Why does it say that it's easier to adjust the valves if you remove the 
spark plugs first?  Is it because the engine will turn easier not 
building compression?  I am running the battery down trying it with them 
in.  Sorry to ask such stupid questions.  But I'm getting there.  Ciao...KR
