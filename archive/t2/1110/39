Subject: Re: [T2] problems

I havnt read all of this thread so this has prolly been mentioned but...
One thing I learned over the last few months is a weber progressive carb can 
only handle 3psi fuel flow and the VW fuel pump puts out around 8psi. it is 
damn near impossible to tune your carb properly unless you put in a 
regulator. Unlikely to be your problem, but thought I should mention that. I 
was having trouble with a weber progressive on a 1600SP that I couldn't get 
tuned. did a rebuild on it and no change. at idle it was alternating between 
running rich or flat out dying. on downshifts it would backfire. I got rid 
of it and put in a brosol that ran like a million bucks out of the box. Ive 
read nasty things about the brosol picts but I have to say I am a fan.
