Try this-
If a screw is threaded metrically,
like M8X1.0, then the 1.0 is threads per what?
Certainly not per inch, eh? :) Try millimeter.
Nevertheless, it's still 1.0mm per turn.

Therefore, 1/4 turn is .010" for you non-metric folks.
Easy enough to verify with a feeler gauge and a thread pitch gauge.
So, OK, then- what's a 1/4-20? Got a ruler with 1/20 on it? :)

the actual turning ratio re: 1/4 turn = ??thou of an inch??
