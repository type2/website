Subject: Re: [T2] engine bearer hitting heat exchanger

the engine is still on the stand. It is not in the bus yet, i think it's a
combination of cheap motor mounts and cheaply made (though not cheaply priced)
heat exchanger.  I may be able to massage the metal on the exchanger a bit to
get more clearance.  it's not a tight fit, but the bearer bar is touching the
exchanger, and when the engine is installed, the weight of the engine may lift
the bearer bar off the exchanger a bit.  thanks to all for the advice and
opinions.  greg
