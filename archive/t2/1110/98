Subject: Re: [T2] valve adjustment and spark plugs

That's correct, the compression is much less without the spark plugs.
However, I've never had a problem turning over any of my type I engines by
hand with plugs in to adjust the valves, (been doing it that way for over 15
years) and never had any problems with type IVs in the past, although I did
have to use a wrench on the fan nut as I recall sometimes to turn those...
