Why not do it the old tech way from before dwell meters - use a feeler
gauge to set the point gap. Just do an extra good job of being precise
with it.

Same with the tach. The old pros used to set the RPM by ear. Just
adjust the idle until it sounds right. For distributor timing at max
advance, just throttle up until the engine roars and you don't see the
timing advancing any further.

Best of luck,
