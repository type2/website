Subject: Fuel Injection in 68 Bus

Hi Greg,
 
I have a bus question for you. I was searching through the archives and saw
that you installed a fuel injection system in a non-fuel injected bus. I have
done this in the past with a 74 bus, but now I have a 68 bus. I am installing
a beetle fuel injection system. I saw in your old post that you just used a
T-fitting on your gas line for the return fuel. How well did this work? I am
trying to get away with not replacing the 68 fuel tank if I can help it. Did
you have any drivability problems with that settup? Would you do it that way
again?
 
I want to start this project this summer if I get enough time off from work. I
am using dual carbs right now with decent drivability, but I wanted to upgrade
while I had my engine out. I am cc: this email to the list as well. Any input
would be appreciated. Do you know if any place tests fuel injectors when they
are out of the vehicle? Thank you for any help you can give.
 
Take care,
David Kelly
