Most of the Weber kits used standard VW "dual port" intake runner boots.  PN
is I think 113 129 729B or something similar.  Another thing that every
NAPA/Autozone/? used to have in the little "air cooled VW" section in the
day.  Now, who knows somebody local usually still has em, cheap, couple bucks
each in German, SA, rubber or red silicone.

carb are called.  Are they what BD calls a 'plenum seal?'   Ciao...KR
