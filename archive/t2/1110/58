Subject: RE: [T2] What have you done for your bus lately?

Saturday I tore down the rear axle that had something break back in December
when it was -14 degrees outside.  Bent the crap out of my 3/4" breaker bar (my
third) trying to unscrew the castellated nut from the driver's side.  I always
get confused about which side has RH thread.  Turns out it was the large brake
spring.  Snapped at it's end and that piece was dragging around inside the
drum.  Best (cheapest) place to get a GOOD drum(shipped)?  I should replace
them both (rears).  Yesterday I relayed that 3rd brake light I added in the
fall.  The one that got its power from the brake-pressure switch.  Doesn't
work better, but I know it's done right.  Has anyone added a contact switch to
the pedal?  If the pressure switch(es) fail, you'd still have brake lights.
Also added the H4's I recently purchased from Bus Depot.  They look good.
Haven't driven in the dark yet with them.  I'll post opinions later.  I found
the steering coupler I bought from Bus Depot a few years ago.  It's got the VW
logo on it.  I'll need to replace that bad boy soon, I'm sure.
