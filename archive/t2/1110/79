Hello,
 
I was just reading in the type2 archives earlier about the topic. One of the
posts mentions the possible draw backs about using the vent line for return.
One issue is that the vent line empties out at the top of the fuel tank. This
line being above the fuel level would tend to fill full of air when the pump
stop running. This could cause hard starting. This is all speculation. I don't
know anyone that has actually tried it. It is just something to think about.

over a tank swap if I was doing another.
Could a fellow plumb the return line into a tank vent connection?
