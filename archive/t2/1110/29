The pitch on the screws is 1mm which is 0.040", hence 1/4 turn is about 0.010"
or so give or take.  Use a feeler gage people for heavens sake.  Although
loose is sure better than tight with 1/4 turn nearly twice the setting you are
looking for, this is a lot of room for error.  With hydraulics as I've long
mentioned, who cares so much 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 turns pick your poison and imagine
what you will (and people will argue that vehemently) but with solid lifters
you want to be relatively spot on.  When you get used to it you can almost
feel the correct little click when you sort of tappety tap them, but set em
right unless you are middle of nowhere with no tools and for some reason took
off your rocker arms or something with your teeth.

the actual turning ratio re: 1/4 turn = ??thou of an inch??
