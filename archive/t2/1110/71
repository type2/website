Subject: Re: [T2] dwell meter kacked it

Speaking of tach/dwell meters...I need a new one.  Any particular
brand that someone can recommend?

And yes, perhaps I'll install petronix or some other ignition system
at some point, but regardless, I still like to be able to have a tach/dwell
to troubleshoot...

cheers,
   tom
