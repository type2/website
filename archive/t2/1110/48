Subject: update on engine bearer bar hitting heat exchanger

installed the engine yesterday and bear bar is now off both heat exchangers by
about 3/8 to 1/2 inch...i didn't know the motor mounts would compress that
much once the engine weight was on them.  thanks to all for your sage wisdom
and random thoughts.  they're all very much appreciated!!  greg t.
