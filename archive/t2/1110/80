On my '77 bus, there are a total of 6 captive nuts for the 3 seatbelts for
the rear seat.  Each fender has one, and then there are an additional two
pairs in the sloping panel.  There are also at least 4 (there may be 6 to
accommodate the 9-passenger) captive nuts in the floor for the seatbelts for
the middle seat.  I imagine all bus bodies came with these captive nuts,
just like they also seem to have the key-holes in the floor for the
passenger-bus seat mounts.

I'm not sure what the captive nuts in the bodywork at the level of the
windows were intended for.  They do look a lot like seat-belt captive nuts,
but I haven't tried screwing a seat-belt bolt into them.
