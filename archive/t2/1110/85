Subject: dumb question

OK, this is really bone-head.  How do I connect the remote starter 
switch?  I used to be able to get it to turn over with a screw-driver.  
Now I can't even figure out how to do it with the switch!  What's the 
correct way to hook this thing up?  Karl said the Solenoid post and the 
Battery post but I'm not sure which  they are.  Arggh....KR
