	Removing & storing the good one will likely degrade it one 
way or another.  Leave it where it is, and add any soothing cremes 
(of a silicone kind?) to slow the cracking.
	The new one is likely to be far inferior in quality.  Store 
it cool & dark against the day when things cease arriving from the 
mystic E.  :-/
