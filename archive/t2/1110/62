The strength is more in the cloth cord than the rubber, hence most
don't notice how bad it has gotten. Keep an eye on the new one. The
one that is on the market most now is reportedly poor quality.
Depending on where you got yours, you might have gotten a good one.

 SVDA unit. Currently running a 009 with a weber progressive on a 2.0L
 engine(recently rebuilt). Not real excited about the way it runs. Looking at
 jetting the carb differently also. I wish I could afford a different carb
 system... oh well.

The 009 is your primary problem. Your bus will run fine with the
Weber. After the recent discussion on the GAMI article, head temps,
and cylinder mixture variation, I have decided to pull my stock dual
Solex and use Weber progressive again. My best bus driving experiences
have been on Weber progressive.
