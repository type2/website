I took the switch off the column, and out of the holder. Then I sprayed some
lubricant on them, and they work better.

 

If it is not cancelling when you turn one direction, it sounds like the
steering wheel(which has a cancelling ring on the underside of it) is not
aligned correctly, or is bent. Mine is bent, but still seems to work, most
of the time.
