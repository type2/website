Subject: Re: [T2] Quandry- replace good German CV Boot or???

I would use the original German used along with one Asian new. Then a 
point in time will come where you can advise which lasts longer. I'm 
guessing you will need the saved Asian to replace the used Asian and 
the German will still be good to go.
