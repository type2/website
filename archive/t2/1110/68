Subject: [T2] What have you done for your bus lately?

>> Dan glad to hear you getting into the gas tank compartment!



I am indeed!



Having yesterday agreed to buy me, the girlfriend and our baby our first
home (the one we're renting) I guess I have just secured a dry, modern,
detached double garage as home for our bus. All I need to do is swap the up
and over door for some taller gate style ones and Ill be able to get it in
and out without first putting the bus on naked rims.



After a number of years on the streets of London or in my friends field the
bus is currently enjoying some overdue TLC, which now does not need to be
rushed because were staying put:

-          engine out for a general clean and shine, seals to be replaced,
new plugs, new ignition cables, new coil etc (rebuild postponed till another
winter)

-          gas tank accessed for new filler tube, breather hoses and sender
(existing on blink)

-          tin ware in car trunk waiting for me to take it for blasting and
powder coating

-          engine bay wire-brushed, prepped and primed awaiting a coat of
paint

-          new heat exchangers secured* (were going to have heating for the
baby!)

-          rear 3 point seat belt being investigated (any insight accepted)



Between work and the baby, its hard to stay focussed on any one job from day
to day  but I am loving the luxury of leaving out parts and tools and I
guess it does not matter.



*on the heat exchangers  I was expecting them to be a bit rubbish, but I
was at least expecting the tin skin to seal around the exhaust pipes and
blower inlet. Very poor they are, will have to take them somewhere to get
them welded  anyone else had same issue, or am I unlucky?



Cheers for now!
