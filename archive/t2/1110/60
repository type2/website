Subject: dwell meter kacked it

Hi,

My "Equss" Tach/Dwell meter went flakey today and ended up with major
current pull.

I am trying to figure out if I really need one. I own an electronic DMM.

Here is my take on the math.

13.4 Volts (after read from battery)/ 4 cly = 3.35 Volts per Cyl.

3.35 volts * .52 degrees = 1.742 Volts per cyl..

Naturally these readings are taken from the green wire to ground.

If I have lost myself here, can someone tell me and how?

Also, is there an easy way to do tachometer readings?

I can't afford a real test set at the moment.

Thanks in advance.

Alan
