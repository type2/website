Subject: 1970 camper - steering slop

I would like to thank those who offered suggestions for the play in
the steering of my 1970 camper.  Picked up a brag lin\k and installed
it yesterday.  The difference is night and day.  There was about 8
inches of play on either side - huge - now virtually none.  Regarding
pullers, I had a hard time finding any.  I went to Advance Auto to buy
a pitman arm puller but it was too big - I asked a mgr if they could
order a smaller one and she mentioned they offer a tool rental
program.  I got a front beam kit with 5 or 6 pullers - you buy the
used kit, bring it back and get all your money back (mgr's description
of their rental program).  So I used the pullers for free.  Thought
that was a decent policy for corporation such as this.  Just FYI.  For
pictures of kit you may view the following public links.  Thanks again
all.

Other VW projects to follow in a few weeks.  I am going off on a 2
week tour today.  Live Oak Florida (Springfest), Birmingham AL, St
Louis MO, Chicago IL, Rochestrer MN, Lutsen MN.  If listers are nearby
please shoot me an email - love to meet you - guest tickets and that
jazz.  Thanks again.
