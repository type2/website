Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Valve Adjustments - number of turns = ? thou?

Please John, at no time did I want anyone to throw out their feeler gauges. 
I merely asked what the ratio was. It IS interesting to note though that in 
many parts of Germany, people were taught to use so many degrees of turn for 
the correct tightening of nuts to bolts, NOT a torque wrench. Just another 
way of looking at things. In a pinch then, 1/8 turn of a adjusting screw 
turned out from gently touching the valve stem would be approx. .005 Nice to 
know if in the right circumstances.

Always be yourself, because the people that matter don't mind,
and the ones who mind, don't matter.
