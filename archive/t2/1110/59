Subject: double cab for sale

Hi,

Saw a 70 double cab for sale today. All white.  A lot of $'s, but body and
gates are in great condition and it has disc brakes on the front. Interior
looks nice too. Some surface rust in a few places. Sign says owner has had it
15 years and the price is not negotiable. Its been garaged most of that time.
Pmail me if you are seriously interested. Location:  Redondo Beach,
California.

Chris
