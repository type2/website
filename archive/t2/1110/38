The one I am installing now has a bad mismatch in the casting halves
of the center manifold. I had to do a fair bit of grinding to smooth
things out. The previous owner must have had some leaking, as I do not
think a good seal could be made on such an uneven surface.

 sealing properly leading to potentially disastrous lean running.
