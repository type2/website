Subject: Quandry- replace good German CV Boot or???

So I pulled my axle today to replace the one bad boot. The other boot appears
to be excellent with just the start of some small hairline cracks that are
very very superficial. It is noticeably thicker than the aftermarket
replacement. Damn!!! Replace both while the axle is off, or keep the good
thick one that is old but solid???? I'm thinking replace it anyway with new
ones. The new ones are Taiwanese marked MB1. Mean anything to anybody?
