Take an oxy/acetylene torch and heat up the metal so you can tap it 
inward a little stretching the metal.

I'd be inclined to install the whole thing and take it to a shop with a 
torch (if you don't have one) and heat it. Use a round 1/2" or 3/4" bar 
and pry against the bearer bar to get the clearance you need/want.

I'd then take it home and clear up the burnt heaters and repaint to keep 
the rust away.
