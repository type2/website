Very easy, and I've verified that it works.  My mechanic also uses the 
same technique.

Just so you know, the reason that you're getting the quote warning is 
because you tried to quote my entire block of text.  If you just snip 
out one or two lines of quoted material and then write your response, 
you won't get the failure notice.  I believe you have to have at least 
one line of original text for each line of quoted text.

Thanks!
Mike
