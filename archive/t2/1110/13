Subject: Re: [T2] Heater boxes

Hi,

I stripped my boxes and then painted them with the POR15 silver. This was 
about 8k miles and about 6 years ago. They still look good. Oh yeah, the bus 
is garaged in So Cal. Sorry, its a garage king.

I just bought new heater boxes and want to paint them with POR15 silver in
order to keep these from rusting out like the last ones. Do I need to remove
the gray paint first before I use the POR15, or can I paint over the paint
and get the same results?

Thanks,

Bob
