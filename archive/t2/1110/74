Subject: [T2] What have you done for your bus lately?

>>-  The kicker is reinforcing the mount point. Bolting it into body sheet
metal is unacceptable.

there appears to be a captive seatbelt bolt thread in the body work either
side just below window height, about level with front of the parcel shelf.
There's also something central (plugged at mo) in the sloping panel between
rear floor and parcel shelf - looks like another captive thread - would
these have been present in a late kombi for back seat bus use do you think?

It looks to me like the aftermarket rock and roll bed has been bolted into
the 3rd point...


>>-  Congrats on the baby and gargage!
Cheers!
