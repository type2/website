Subject: Re: [T2] problems

I tightened the rubber ones down and they seemed to be alright.  Of 
course, I didn't get a look at the undersides of them. And all the bolts 
are tight at the motor.  But it sure seems like I have a vacuum leak.  
My neighbor thinks its a fuel starvation (i.e. carb) problem.  When it 
runs, it runs pretty good.  But it won't idle and it has always been 
back-fire prone if the carb isn't adjusted just right.  When you choke 
it manually, it'll idle, though a bit high.  That tells me it's getting 
too much air from somewhere.  It was too wet today to mess with checking 
the valves,  but I've had time to think about it more than I should.  I 
don't think I've got a problem with the bottom of the motor as I've got 
compression, though maybe not as much as I'd like.  I plan on checking 
that properly when the weather improves.  (Actually, I need to mess with 
a Jaguar to make room for it on pavement where I can get under it 
easily.)  But it also seems to run too good to have a valve problem.  
But I am going to adjust them anyhow.  I may end up buying a 
carburetor.  But I swear I thought I did a good rebuild on it.  Maybe I 
should pull the intakes and change gaskets.  Don't know what those 
rubber boots up by the carb are called.  Are they what BD calls a 
'plenum seal?'   Ciao...KR
