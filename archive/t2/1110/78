It may well be made for seat belt use. Not sure how to be certain.
Perhaps a Samba check on owners manuals for the year. Also, if you
have a VW seat belt bolt from another car, you can see if the thread

 There's also something central in the sloping panel between rear floor and
 parcel shelf - looks like another captive thread - would these have been
 present in a late kombi for back seat bus use do you think?
