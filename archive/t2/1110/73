Subject: Looking to rent a bus for a wedding (Philly)

Hi All,

Wondering if anyone has a really sharp looking bus, in the philly area, 
that they would consider renting to me for my wedding.

Everything is local for the wedding so there would maybe be 30miles 
total driven.

Wedding is June 12th, 2010.

Cheers,
Harry
