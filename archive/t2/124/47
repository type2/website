Subject: Re: [T2] Saggy Rear-revisited

As soon as I get in the front seat of my bus, it sits perfectly level!

Most buses sag a tad in the rear (I think it comes with age like John said!)

Turn a torsion bar to bring the back up a notch if you wnat, but then you
will nose-diving when you drive...mind you, that was a fad in the seventies
though, could be retro...

I say, no real harm done to the bus with a little sag....
