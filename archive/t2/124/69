Congratz on your engine, I'll be interested to hear more about it
as you get some miles on it.

Hmm, I'm not sure if I understand.  I've only removed mine (a '79)
once, but I just removed the 4 bolts (and the engine bearer) and it
came right out, and I did read the manual.

If you removed the tranny mounts, how did you secure the tranny when
the engine was out?  Ooh, that just reminded me of a question for the
list that I'll post later ...
