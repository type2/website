Subject: bus sighting on tv

I dont know if it was a re-run or not,

but last night on "Boston Public" a drama on Fox, there was a bus scene.

the show is set in a high-school, and a teacher finds out that one of her 
students is homeless, she and her mother areliving in a Bus.  There is a 
scene where the teacher goes to find the bus, and then on several occasions 
the teacher trys to get other adults to help by saying............"for god's 
sake Stephen, she is living in a Volkswagen, a Volkswagen, she is living in 
a Volkswagen."

Wish I had it on tape :-)
