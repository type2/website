Hi Volks,

On all 3 of the type2's I've owned the bus rides high in the front when
unloaded. Put a driver in the seat, and it comes back down to level. Add a
copilot, passengers in the back, a half-ton of camping gear, it's still
level. 

My 73 rustfalia tended to squat at the rear as it approached full load
capacity, but was fine under "normal" conditions. YMMV.

Happy trails,
