Subject: re:Propane Tank

I recall seeing a reference on one of the bus sites to someone having a
block buy on some double length bus propane tanks.  They were to use the
standard fittings and mounts but be twice as long=twice the capacity.  
Anyone have any idea where that went?  IF they were reasonable I would be
a starter for one.  My local propane outfit, Solano Propane, is very
helpful, very knowledgeable, and has odd tanks around for sale but none
exactly the correct size.  Alternately one could buy one of the aluminum
portable tanks, as used on most small fishing vessels (no rust). These are
available at propane supply houses.  Then get a high pressure connecting
hose with quick disconnects and a high flow safety shut off (in case the
hose fails) . I use a steel 100 pounder set up like this where I live. jon
