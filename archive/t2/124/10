--Here's my summary (so far) of splicing procedures...


1. twist pair to be spliced together.
2. solder connection.
3. apply wire nut.
4. apply shrink wrap tubing.
5. apply electrical tape (wrap twice in different directions).
6. paint with "star brite" (2 coats).
7. mechanically mount connection to chassis with self tapping screws.
8. reconnect ground strap.
9. encase bus in concrete.


If you can't appreciate the humor, review back episodes of "the anal retentive chef"...
