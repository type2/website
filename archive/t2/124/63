The total cost was around $12. =20
The spacer is make up of two rubber plugs inserted into the ends of a =
plastic bushing.  The plastic bushing can be cut to make the length =
appropriate (my roof was dented in at the corners so I needed slightly =
longer spacers). I've posted some pictures for people to view at =
