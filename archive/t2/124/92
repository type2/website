Subject: Clearance Heads or Trim Barrels.....

Was breaking in my newly re-built Type 4 2459cc 
engine this past weekend when the head at the #4 
cylinder started leaking an burned a nice hole in the 
head near the sealing surface (see 
http://www.jacklockamy.com/032402_Burn_Thru_01
_640x480.jpg).

After doing some research, I have decided to install  
Copper Head Gaskets (.060" thickness).  My current 
configuration is 8.3:1 CR, Deck height is .048, head 
combustion chambers are 70cc's, bore 105mm 
stroke 71mm.  If add the .060" thick gaskets and 
leave everything the way it is...I will go from 8.3: CR to 
7.3 CR.  My calculations show that to be a loss of 
about 10 HP.  I would like to have a CR of 8.0:1.

In order to get 8.0:1 CR....I have a choice to make.  
Should I take .057" off the head's sealing surface, or 
trim the barrels .057".  Clearancing the heads would 
be the easiest since I need to re-surface them 
anyway and the piston/cylinders would not need to 
be removed..... but is that the best course of action.

Opinions, comments and suggestions welcomed.
