Steve,
Thanks for the step by step. Here is what I found. When I line up the 
mark on the flywheel at O deg the I can feel the piston in number on 
move up and down. I can also line the dist up with the mark in the 
housing. Now when I
take and watch for the intake to close it just start to close when the 
dist points towards the number 2
wire. It is still closed when pointing to the number 1 wire. When I 
called my rebuilder he told me to
watch the number three valves and when they start to teeter I am at top 
dead center of number one.
I thing teeter is when one valve is just closed and the other just 
opens. When it does this it points to number one wire and maybe 4 deg 
past 0.  Should I start looking beyond the timing and look at
ignition?
