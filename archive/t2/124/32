I need to find replacement rubber spacers for the back of my luggage =
rack (1971 westy).  I talked to Joe at Busted Bus and he did not have =
any, though he thought there was a product that could be used.  Perhaps =
a hard rubber motor/machine mount.  Does anyone have any suggestions for =
replacing these.
