There was a tear in the Right side outer boot and  rust and water that were present.   I swapped the right
side assembly after repacking the newer ones and installed them.  Steve was right there were two different bolt
heads.  Some 6mm Hex and some Torx drive.   A few stripped but luckily, Mr Vice-Grip stepped in when he was needed
and everything was fine.  One of the easier jobs on the westy.

Every time I work on these vehicles, I am amazed at the quality engineering.
When I was a mechanic in the 80's we cursed many an engineer for the North American manufacturers.  Too little
room, too many parts to remove to get to the problem,...  "Yeah sure, we'll remove the dash assy. to work at the
heater core...

Thanks for the tips folks.
