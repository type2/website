Subject: 66 Kombi 4 trade in Ohio

Hey All!
I have got a 66 Kombi that I am looking to get out of my barn.  I got the bus about a month ago with every intention of restoring it. In the month I've had it, I have done exactly NOTHING with it (except pull out the original engine), and with upcoming reponsibilities (paving driveway, painting house, etc. etc. etc.) it doesn't look like I will get to it any time soon.  It has been sitting for a LONG time. Body is surprisingly solid, one smallish (baseball sized) spot of through rust on one rocker, and other one on drivers side floor, surrace rust in other usual places. In some other spots, the paint is peeling to reveal some skim-coat. I have the original 1500 SP engine (condition unknown, other than that the carb and manifold are full of acorns from some sort of fuzzy little occupant) I also have a RUNNING 1600 DP which I intended to put in the bus.  
I am looking to trade for something, maybe a Bug, Thing, Lawn tractor, whatever.  You can see pix at

I would almost definitely trade for a running bug (non-super preferably) but will consider non-running vehicles, but in that case I would keep the 1600 DP.  Let me know if you got anything to trade.  I also like guitars (looking for a nice 12 string acoustic\electric) and mandolins.
Peace, John Baker
