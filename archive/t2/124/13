Subject: High top for sale

I have decided to sell my high top. I really like it, but with a new paint
job for my bus in the future I want to show the paint off.

You can put tons of stuff up there and you never have to pop your top!! I
have been keeping my spare tire mounted to the roof too so you gain room
when you are sleeping if you had been keeping the spare tire in the rear.

You could probably add some sort of upper bunk and your original 68-72 cot
will still fit if you want to keep it. Not sure about the original bunk bed
on the later Westy's. Best thing is you can store your jack, sleeping bags,
and lots of other stuff up there all the time, you never have to pack!!

I want $300 for the high top. I will help install it. It will fit any
baywindow bus 68 - 79. It comes with 2 new Westy seals (not original to the
high top, but keeps the water out), a brand new skylight and a nice VW
emblem on the inside of the roof. You can see lots of pics here:

I am in Charlotte, NC and the only practical thing is to drive up and we'll
put it on your bus together.

If you want to use your credit card to pay for it you could buy me this
rack:
