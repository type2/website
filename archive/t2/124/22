Huh?  You can't change the dwell without changing the point gap.

Right.

At idle this is correct.

Are you sure you don't have those reversed?  My memory is that the left 
port (slightly larger, at the throttle plate) has vacuum at idle.  You are 
right though about where each type should be connected.

Did you notice an advance in timing when you did this?

Idle or 3000 rpm will make little difference.  Vacuum advance can only 
really be observed when the throttle is substantially open, and at a 
sustained 3000rpm, it's not open enough to get a good measurement.  For a 
quick check, "goose" the throttle and you should see vacuum briefly 
register on the gauge, 5-8 inches or so.

Check for timing advance when you do this.  Try to determine how much 
advance you get.

You're already getting more advance than an 009 can supply, but not the 
full amount as it appears your vacuum advance isn't functioning.

I don't have the specs in front of me, but you should have *about* 45-50 
degrees maximum, which is the sum of:

Centrifugal (both lines disconnected, difference btw idle and 3000rpm)
Retard (you have observed about 12 degrees)
Advance (at idle, difference between sucking on advance hose or not)
