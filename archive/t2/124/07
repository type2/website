Scotchlok connectors are the quickest route to corrosion I've found.
Total and complete trash, only suited for hack stereo installers.

To do it right, get a good soldering gun and Kester rosin-core solder.
Strip the insulation from the wire for 3/4 inch, wrap the other wire
around it and solder the connection.  Use heat-shrink tubing if you can or
carefully tape the connection, remembering to allow the tape to take the
mechanical strain on the connection, not the solder!
