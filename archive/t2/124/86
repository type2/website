Nice post on your AVP engine rebuild experience.
Please keep me/us updated with your engine. Any and
all info is appreciated.
I considered AVP for a rebuild but ended up doing
piston/cylinders and heads (heads done by Ronnies
re-builder)myself. I now have about seven thousand
miles on the engine and it is running perfect. If a
problem starts happening with my engine, I will
consider someone such as AVP or Jake Raby.
Keep posting......

10 weeks to go to our 7 week east coast road trip in
June !!
