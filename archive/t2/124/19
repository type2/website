Depends on: Are the tierod ends moving easily?  Yes?  Replace em. Are the 
boots cracked or torn? Replace em. Make it easy on yourself and the future 
and get new tierods with ends (both adjustable) for $27 per set from 
Busdepot.com. (German) They are easy to r&r.  You need standard tools and a 
small puller to push the ends out.
