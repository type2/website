Subject: Timing questions

Hi all,
I have recently purchased a 75 westy - my first
experience with FI - yikes. I proceded to tune the
thing up (valve clearence, points etc) and when I went
to set the timing, I ran into trouble. Muir, Bentley
and the sticker on my engine say to time it to 5
degrees ATDC, but when I get close to that, it will
stall before I get there when turning the distributer.
It runs much beter when it is advanced approx. 5
degrees BTDC. I asked my mechanic about timing this
vehicle and he said he just sets it so that when
running and fully advanced (high RPM), the reading
should be at 38 degrees BTDC....period. Is this sound
practice? It seems to work, but I have never heard
that before. Also, in adjusting the idle air screw,
Bentley sais to turn CCW to increase RPM and Muir says
to turn CW. Whatever I do, it doesn't seem to change
squat and my idle is usually slow and rough, but
sometimes good. (in other words.. a bit inconsistant).
Other than that, it runs great. Any comments?
Blake
