Just in time for Kelly Park on Sunday, April 7.  Last year we added a late Type 2 class but the showing was a bit disappointing.  If we could get double or triple that this year it would be great.

There's also an open house at Volks Authority on Friday, a Bus centric swap meet on Saturday, and dinner on Saturday night.  Go to www.ggcvvwca.org for details on Kelly Park or go to the Wolfsburg Pacific club site (http://63.230.74.177/newwolfpac/) for details on all the events in their calendar section.

Sean, if you would like a Bus to drive to the show I could loan you my '70 sunroof.
