Subject: Re: [T2] Saggy Rear-revisited

John asked:
>>What are the other reasons (besides appearance) to do this adjustment??
 Does it affect handling? Is it going to be harmful to my bus' suspension
 if I DO NOT do this, and leave the rear to sag???<<

John,

i asked this same question a while back.  i think it depends on each bus
on a case-by-case basis.  to determine if you really _need_ to do this,
i might suggest looking at tire wear. are the treads wearing evenly, etc.?
also, do your CV joints seem to be wearing out quickly, etc.?

if the sag isn't causing apparent problems, then i would be inclined to
say you do not need to fix the sag.

i would like to hear more input from other listees. i, like John, have
pondered this issue before.
