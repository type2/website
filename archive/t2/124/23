Subject: Propane Tank

Greetings:

Anyone know a source for those external 2.5 gallon propane tanks?

I had one on my '70 Hightop Campmobile.  It was very handy.  I thought maybe 
some RV supply centers might carry them but have had no luck finding a 
source in a recent search.

I can also remember the attendant in AZ not wanting to fill the tank the 
last time I had propane put in it.  He said it was over some age limit and I 
could not verify that it had been inspected.  He reluctantly filled it but 
said he was not supposed too....
