That's what I meant.  Perhaps I should have said
.016 and it measured (54 dwell).  Several
attempts at setting them at 0.016 resulted in an
improper dwell.

What I meant was that it did not show any more
advance at rpm connected or disconnected.

I'll check again tonight.

Didn't try it with the engine running and the
strobe hooked up.  Just tried did it and felt and
saw the plate moving.  I'll try it tonight.
