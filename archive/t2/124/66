Hi Vince,

First, replace the front bushing. My shifting was also very sloppy, and when
I checked my front bushing  THERE WASN'T ONE!!!.

Do the front one first, it's relatively easy. If the issue persists, then
replace the rear bushing.

From what I've been told, the rear bushing can be replaced WITHOUT dropping
the tranny. That's not what it says in the Bentley, but if you ask me again
on Friday night and I'll have a more authoritative answer on that; probably
some photos too.

Happy trails,
