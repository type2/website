Subject: Re: [T2] Is my buss worth working on

Thanks for the answer but the problem is that I doesn´t even know if I have 
to weld??
Please have a look at my pictures on the buss ( 
http://download.tripodnet.nu:81/Folkes_hemsida/index.htm )and write back on 
what you think. Everyone says differant and it´s very hard to know witch 
ones to belive...
How much can you fix without welding?
I just whant to get the buss in usable condition, if the rapairs hold for a 
year a am satisfied.
