Kyle,

Welcome. I almost advised you to quit while you are ahead but your comment 
that you had fixed the horn gave me pause. If you can fix the horn on a VW 
you show real promise. Smog can be a challenge.

Just as a start you must pass SMOG to register the bus in California.

If your bus hasn't had to meet very strict smog specifications up till now 
you may have to replace some rather hard to find and expensive parts.

Step 1 is to determine if your bus is 49 State(Fed) model or a California 
model. The engine door should have the info written inside the lid.

Step 2 get a look at service manual (Robert Bentley is good) and compare 
your exhaust and fuel injection components to those in the manual.

My last time thu smog with a 1977 bus I did the work. I had to:

1. Replace the Egr Filter $138
2. Replace the Cat Converter $125
3. Replace The Egr Valve (1979 may not have one) $200 (rebuilt)
4. Replace the Fuel Filler Restrictor $150 (long story)
5. Pull and clean the air distribution manifold. (not fun)
6. Fix a wiring problem so the erg light would work
7. New plugs, points
8. Set the C0 level with a exhaust analyzer

I would guess that you will face a similar fate unless you have a close 
relative that runs a smog test station.

Good luck
