Subject: steering problem persists

Volks,
77 T2 Westy. Replaced center pin and bolt on swing arm over the weekend. 
when lying under the front of the bus and having a compadre turn the wheel i 
see mighty play atop the king pin. side to side as well as up down motion. i 
used the swing arm repair kit and did it by the Muir book with the C-clamp. 
i did not need to ream the new bushings to get the new pin in, so i figure 
they were pre-reamed. What am i missing here? I was planning on going to a 
campout this weekend, there is still time to get Grace to a shop, but i'd 
rather fix it myself. Suggestions?
-Jeremy
