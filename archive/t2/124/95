Subject: Re: [T2] spare tire well water/rust


Not sure if you have the same set-up as my '78 Westy but here are some
suggestions. The propane line runs through the floor and into this
compartment of the cabinet, could take water when driving in the rain if
not sealed. Also I am not sure if the city water hook up or other fittings
on the body are in that area or not, they could leak too. If its a door
seal or a window seal that should have other easily visible signs...

Folks,

After looking at some of the pictures of the buss that Johan Svanborg
was trying to decide to buy/keep, I have a question...

Where does the water come from that gets into the spare tire wheel well???

I have recently expierienced this in my 78 and could tell that water in
my wheel well was a fairly new phenomenon.  I could not figure out where
it was coming from though!

Any hints on this one?

Cheers ,dave
