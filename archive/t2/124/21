Ditto.  I've found that the recession is very deep and it is easy to be 
fooled into thinking the wrench is seated when in reality there is a bunch 
of crud in there and the wrench isn't going in all the way.  I usually 
start by taking a small flat-blade screwdriver and scraping out the cavity, 
then spraying carb or brake cleaner in there to get the small stuff and 
grease/oil out.  Then, with a good sharp allen wrench (even in the original 
12-point bolts) they come out.  If the allen wrench bends too much I use a 
"helper" vise-grip on the outside of the bolt head and turn it and the 
allen wrench simultaneously.  Using this method, I have yet to be defeated 
by even the oldest, crustiest CV joint bolt.
