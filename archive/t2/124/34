This is very good, and as it ought to be.

This is because I screwed up.  Biill, I am sorry...  I was not thinking
straight.  The #1 intake valve should close at the *bottom* of the intake
stroke (piston moves down and draws fuel/air mix in), which is also the
beginning of the compression stroke (piston moves up, compressing fuel/air
mix.  (I am *shocked* no one called me on this!!! Guys, I am an amatuer,
just like (most) of the rest of you... sometimes I screw up... call me  on
it!!!)

Your rebuilder is absolutely correct!  What is happeninng is that the
piston in #3 has reached the top of its exhaust stroke, at which point the
exhaust valve closes and the intake valve opens.  This point in #3's cycle
is also the firing point in #1's cycle.  that is, TDC.

Bill,

It sounds like everything is OK with the engine.  As long as you have the
plugs out, you might want to  check compression,  but that is just becasue
it is convenient (and it is nice to have a baseline)  Since it looks like
the engine is good, let me run thru basic ignition settup.

Another step by step (without any mistakes, I hope :(

First, check dwell.  Take you dwell meter and hook it between the
condensor wire and ground. If you don't have a dwell meter, hook a VOM
between the condensor wire and ground.  Have an assistant crank the
engine.  Your dwell should be 50 degrees or 6.67VDC  If it isn't adjust
the points gap 'til it is.  I took some pictures intending to write
instructions on setting dwell, then never wrote the text :-(  The pictures
are at:
http://www.everybus.com/steve/dwell/index.htm
and may be helpful on their own.

Then set the timing (static):

Leave the dwell meter or VOM connected.

Move the crank 'til the #1 piston is at TDC per your rebuilders
instructions.

Look at the mark on the fan. It is very close to the TDC mark on your
timing scale, correct?

If it is, then move the mark on the fan to 7.5 BTDC on the timing scale.

Turn the bus on.

Loosen the distributor clamp and rotate the distributor body  back and
forth.

As you rotate the dist body, a dwell meter will flip back and forth
between 0 and 90 degrees, a VOM will flip between 0 and 12VDC

If it does, then your points are opening and closing, which is good.

Move the case until the tiniest wiggle makes your meter flip.

Tighten the clamp.

You *should* be done.  button it up and try to start it.  If it does
start, recheck the dwell and timing (they  will probably need some
adjusting, the above procedure were just to get the engine close enough to
start)

If it does not  start, let me know.
