Subject: AVP Engine Swap Experience (long) Part 1.

Hi All,

This is Part 1. Part 2 will cover how I get the couple of engine issues resolved and will follow =
when they are resolved.

I have had a =9278 Bus (California Fuel Injected Hydraulic Valves) for about 4 years. When I first =
got it, the PO told me that the owner before him had rebuilt the engine. The bus ran quite strong =
and when I tested compression, it was about 130 psi all around, which is considered healthy. =
Fast-forward to 2001 and probably 80,000 miles later. The compression had become very uneven. Some =
cylinders were 60 psi, some 90 or so. In January of 2002, I lost one cylinder altogether (zero =
PSI) and had a second at 30. The bus was also leaking a lot of oil. I was adding a quart every =
week or two.

I reviewed the options of available engine suppliers and chose AVP. I chose AVP based on their =
reputation on the list over a number of years as a reputable engine supplier. I know that Boston =
Bob & Jake Raby also seem to be top choices for engine suppliers. AVP is close to me =
geographically and their prices (around $1200) seemed reasonable.

I had a couple of long phone calls (30 mins or so) with Erin at AVP and found her to be very =
knowledgeable and having answers to all of my questions. I considered getting the larger valves of =
the earlier type 4 engine installed, but after consulting the list decided to keep it stock. The =
advice I got was that the added performance would be minimal and would come at the expense of =
low-end torque and longevity.

So I ordered a stock 2 liter hydraulic engine. I planned on putting the engine in myself with the =
help (and garage) of fellow listee Grant Simmons.  Not having a dial indicator, I requested a =
flywheel with the engine so that I would not have to deal with measuring end-play. Erin said that =
the lead time on engines would be up to three weeks. This was not the best month for my vehicles =
as my motorcycle also developed a valve issue which prevented it from being driven. I explained my =
situation to Erin and she said that they would try to get my engine to me sooner. I think it ended =
up taking a week and half or two weeks.

The engine came in a cardboard box attached to a pallet. The cardboard box was a little beaten up, =
but the engine was in perfect condition. No dinged pushrod tubes or bent studs, etc. Curiously, =
although the engine came with the flywheel, it was not attached to the engine. The engine came =
with the receipt for the engine, but was missing the warranty papers. This is something that I am =
still waiting on.

I thought that it would be fun to put the engine in myself (with Grant=92s help). I have more free =
time than money right now, so it all made sense. Through my own lack of experience, the engine =
removal process was longer and messier than it needed to be. I did learn a few useful things: =
There are 6 bolts (not 4) at the front of the engine that need to be removed. The four that hold =
the engine to the trans everyone knows about. However to properly remove the engine, you must also =
remove two bolts on top of the trans that hold the trans to the frame. The idea is that you are =
supposed to put a jack under the trans and lower it a few inches, which will allow everything to =
be removed smoothly. I removed my engine without doing this which is not supposed to be possible. =
That=92s part of why the engine removal was such a bear.=20

If I had to do this again, it would probably make sense to look at the manual first ;-) Other =
things I learned:

-The best place to jack up the bus to lift it high is the mount in front of the trans. This is the =
place with the two bolts that hold the mount into the frame.=20
-When disconnecting fuel lines, you must be careful to pinch them off (with vicegrips for example) =
and that fuel will drain from the tank return side as well as the fuel pump side.=20
-The exhaust system cannot be removed in one piece. It does not have to be totally disassembled, =
but the two sides must be separated from the rear pieces.
-It would really help to label, in-detail, all wires and vacuum hoses during disassembly. I have a =
Compufire points-replacement and an MSD ignition, which would make that even more important.

I=92m embarrassed to say how many days I wrestled with this thing, and that it didn=92t occur to =
me to check the steps in the manual (or with the list) during that time. After I finally removed =
the engine from the bus, I was very burned-out on the experience. I also lucked into some work =
which I rationalized would be well spent having my mechanic finish the job properly. If I had had =
more time, patience and the common sense to read up all of the steps first rather than assuming =
that I knew them, this wouldn=92t have happened.=20

Anyway, I took the bus to my mechanic (Lou=92s VW in Reseda, CA =96 I highly recommend). Lou =
swapped all of the new parts to the new engine and installed it in the bus. He also installed a =
new clutch, fuel lines, etc. that I had planned to do myself. Lou checked the end-play =96 which =
AVP had set perfectly. My old bus had a temp sensor in the oil sump plate. Lou swapped this to the =
new engine. Lou noted that he found a bunch of white sealant (silicone) in the new engine sealing =
the sump plate. This is not supposed to be necessary. I am not sure why AVP used it there. My old =
engine (and the new one now that I have the temp sensor sump plate installed) do not leak just =
using the standard $8 silicone O-ring.=20

We measured timing, both idle and total advance. Besides common sense, these measurements are =
needed to keep the warranty valid.

I managed to crush my working thermostat in the engine removal and new T4 thermostats are NLA. I =
was able to convert a type1 thermostat with Grant Simmons=92 help for use with my engine. The =
fitting on the type1 is a female rather than male. We welded the nut from the type4 thermostat =
cable to a screw with the correct threads to go into the T1 thermostat. That=92s it, easy! We =
tested it and it properly closes and opens the flaps. Maybe one of the list vendors (hint-hint) =
should make up some cables with this fix or a similar one and sell them with Type 1 thermostats.

How does it run? It runs really well. I was expecting more power, but I think that may be due to =
the engine still breaking-in. The engine is quiet, smooth and overall a pleasure. I haven't driven =
the bus in hot weather yet, but it seems to be cooling OK. I've had it up to probably 220 degrees =
peak. Oil pressure when cold is 60+ PSI. When hot and idle, the oil pressure is about 12 psi. A =
little more at idle would be nice, but I guess this is normal.=20

The bad - there are three oil leaks:

- From one of the bottom studs/nuts holding the case halfs together =96 the one behind the =
strainer. The oil seems to bleed through the threads or from behind the nut. It isn=92t coming =
from between the case halves, thankfully. Erin at AVP suggested I tighten it a little and see if =
that fixes it. If not, I will wait to hear from them whether I should remove it and put some =
silicone or a copper washer or something. I just tightened it today. I didn=92t turn much since it =
already seemed to be pretty snug. I=92ll know tomorrow whether it is still leaking.

- From the strainer plate. Erin suggested I snug this one a little too. If that doesn=92t fix it, =
when it gets its 300 mile oil change I will put some new gaskets up there, etc.=20

- From behind the flywheel. This is probably the worst of them. The oil actually comes down on the =
little bump of the transmission right where the two meet at the bottom/front of the engine. Erin =
cautioned me to verify that Lou put in the O-ring into the flywheel (as well as the flywheel seal =
which was installed by AVP). Lou says that he definitely did and if he had not, the oil would leak =
differently than it does and would quickly ruin the clutch. At this point, I am taking Erin=92s =
suggestion and waiting till the 300 mile break-in is done and see whether it goes away which I =
guess it sometimes does.

Other issues:

I am still waiting on the warranty papers. They should be here any day now. Also, there was a =
period of a couple of days where I could not get a hold of AVP, I did not get a return call or an =
email. I got a little worried, but it all seems to be OK now. Other than this time period, they =
have been responsive.

So that=92s it. There were other things that needed to be fixed. The bowdoin tube for the clutch =
attaches to the body. It had broken off. There was also a muffler mount that was broken. I welded =
both of these back on with my rudimentary MIG skills. So far so good.

At 300 miles I=92ll do the first oil change. At 1500 miles, the next oil change is due. For =
warranty purposes, the hydraulic valves must be adjusted to 1 turn past contact at this time =
(rather than the normal 2 turns).


Non-technical stuff:

I was so happy to have the bus running nicely again, that I went and gave it its first wash in =
months. When the bus was running on two or three cylinders, there just wasn't the motivation to go =
and get it cleaned. Now that its running nicely, it also looks good (from 20 feet ;-) and I am =
motivated again to do a little cosmetic work.

Also, while the bus was inoperable and the motorcycle inoperable, I was forced to rent a car. The =
subcompact I got was a Daew*o. During this time, I think I got used to sitting close to the =
ground. Now that I am back in the bus, it is truly a joy to be able to see over all of the other =
vehicles again. The first few times driving it, it felt like flying.

I=92ll report to the list what happens with the remaining issues =96 paperwork and oil leaks as =
well as the results of the compression test at 1500 miles. Feel free to p-mail me with any =
questions.
