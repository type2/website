I'm the "Adam" Greg Potts speaks of.
I have a '68 Westy (real).
My roof has the rack in the back like yours. That cot is original issue. I'm
not sure how comfortable it is, as my son fell through the brittle canvas
last week before I had a chance to feel it for myself.
I have a second cot, in better condition, but since I had the old cot out I
decided to put in the Benthin Bed.
The cot is about 18" wide by 5' long.
Fine if you're a skinny midget.
I've been able to install (almost done) a 3'2" wide by 5'10" bed up there
instead. This has the added benefit that my son doesn't have to be scared of
rolling outta bed. It may also add a little insulation to the top of my bus.

Honestly, if you really want the cot, go for it, but if you have about $30
cdn and a day with nothing better to do, you can build and install this full
width, full length bed, and never have to wonder if that thud in the night
is someone falling through the cot.

BTW, if anyone needs a full cot setup, or a cot frame (canvas torn &
brittle) let me know. I have both, and won't need them.
