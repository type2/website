I'll bet either one of the arms on the throwout shaft came loose or the
pivot on the end of the arm wore out.  the fix is the same in either case,
replace the throwout shaft.

There are heavy duty shafts made for the dune buggy trade that are better
than the stock shafts.  Be sure to specify one for a bus transmission and
for your style of throwout bearing (probably early style)
