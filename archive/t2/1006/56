<<On my '74 Westy, is it true the lining of the flex tubes from heater
boxes to rest of system is lined with asbestos material?>>

Where did this info pop up from?
I don't think so---

<< If so, what other models, newer, that don't have it, can I replace
them with?>>

If this was a fact--There isn't any air cooled VW that meets the EPA
mandated cut off for the use of asbestos--too old.

So you'll have to live with it.
