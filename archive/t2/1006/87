$350 is purty darn cheep (but great quality from Kyle's) considering when
available brand new from VW they started at around the $1100 range on up
into the stratosphere.  Just the FI Harness on my 84 Vanagon was over $1600
when available new from VW.  That's why I have a couple of real nice
ones stashed away if ever needed.
