Kevin,

That is the one. BustedBus.com also has a box of them with a better red lens
if you are the resto type.

Hi guys,

I am looking to get the broken brake warning light repaired/replaced in my
bus. I saw one online, but I'm not sure if it is the correct one.

The seller said it had part number 111 919 233B. He wasn't sure if it was
the correct part.

Here is the link:

Does anyone know if this is correct for a '69 single cab?

Thanks for your help.
