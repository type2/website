Eight or so years ago, VW of America replaced a number of old VW bus heat exchangers at no cost to the owners. They were doing research to see if there was asbestos in them. Mine were replaced at the VW dealer here in Tucson. The replacement included the hoses and the exchangers. I don't know what the result of the research was and I don't know if they found asbestos, but I think that is what they were looking for.
