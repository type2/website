Subject: Front Seat belts from Vanagon into '78

Hey everyone.

I'm sure I can answer this myself but since my parts Vanagon is 40 miles
away and I'm not sure when I'll get to it I thought I'd ask the experts.

Has anyone ever taken the front seat belts from a Vanagon and installed them
in a Bay? Do you think it is possible without too much alteration?

The '78 has a retractable seat belt on the driver's side but the old
non-moving belt on the passenger side - what a hassle that is once your
buckled up.

Thanks ahead of time for any advice on the topic.
