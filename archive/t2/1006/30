Subject: '79 work to be done

I picked up a 1979 Westy on Friday, had to tow it home. I did a 
compression check, 125, 0, 110, 110. Yep it looks like it has valve 
problems. It came with a 1.8 engine for spare parts.
The transmission linkage is screwed up (I hope). I can't find reverse 
and can usually find a fwd gear.

I plan to pull the engine and see about fixing or changing the heads 
(the 1.8 as parts), then mess with the linkage and then the brakes.
I have tools and know how to turn wrenches but it's been some years 
since I worked on an air cooled engine and I've never messed with 
transmission linkage.

If anyone can offer advice or a web site on checking/fixing the 
linkage I'd appreciate it. At this point I'm going to use Muir's book 
for changing the heads (I saw www.ratwell.com 's write up on pulling 
the engine) and could use any other sources for the head change job.

Advice or web sites are appreciated.
