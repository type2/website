OK folks, KILL THIS THREAD.

No more "I think the movie is good" or "I think he should be kicked off 
the list" responses either.

Bus content, bus content, bus content!

And yes, based on his breaking of the list charter, I suspect that Mr. 
Jackson will be removed from the list (to be verified).

Cheers,
