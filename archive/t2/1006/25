 Worse than that.  Just the act of refilling them is illegal.

 I didn't know that.  Figured if they sell a widget for doing it, and it's
not against the law to sell them...

 The device comes with detailed instructions that should prevent you from
over-filling the bottle, but I can imagine that someone, somewhere is going
to think "Why not fill it up to the top, it'll last longer."

I believe it is legal to refill them. Federal forbids selling or
transporting refilled bottles across state lines in commerce.  See 49 USC
1809
