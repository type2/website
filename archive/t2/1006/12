Subject: 1971 Westy Pop-top pieces

I have a 1971 Westy and the canvas is gone.  I ordered and now have the canvas
but noticed when I went in to install the canvas that the pieces that hold the
canvas to the bus were gone as well.  I see that it mounts to the wood on the
fiberglass top but need some help on mounting it to the bus.  Ideas?
Suggestions?

Thanks,
