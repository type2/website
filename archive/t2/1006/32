After getting new ball joints and adjustable Koni shocks installed by a 
mechanic, we noticed a "clunk" from under passenger side front seat area 
when hitting bad dips or potholes.
Inspection underneath led us to first believe it was a missing rubber 
torsion arm limiting bumper, but no, it was the bolt for the extra 
seatbelt I put in 20 years ago so daughter could ride facing backwards 
in her baby seat. It would hit the tire on a bad dip!  Bolt is now cut 
off, and I suspect the Koni's have to be "stiffened" -can someone point 
out how to do this?
