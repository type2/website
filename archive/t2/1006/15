Subject: child belt ideas for 79 rear seat?

Hi all,

My youngest is currently using a child seat on the left side of rear bench
seat when he rides in my 79 westy. My daughter sits on the right side using a
3-point seat belt that I added. Now the youngest is outgrowing the child seat
and needs to switch to a booster, but the only belt on the left side of the
rear is a lap belt. I was thinking about getting one of these harnesses to use
with the lap belt:

Has anyone tried one of these harnesses on the back of the bus and did it work
out OK? Anyone have other seat belt ideas for the left side of the rear seat
on a 79 westy?

Thanks,Bob1979 WestyMukilteo, Wa
