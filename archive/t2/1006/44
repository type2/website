Subject: Del 40s fuel hookup

Hi, I am finishing my "warmed over" 1800 type 2 motor, and because I live in a
remote place where this application is not common, I would like to know, where
the 2 fuel "nipples" on the Del 40s attach to the fuel system, and where the
"base plate" attachments go to since I am running an 009 "dizzy".  If any one
has a complete "pix", of the whole system installed in a type 2 , that would
be great, or "sage" advice from past "doers".  Thanks
