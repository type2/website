I think a complete wiring harness is around $350 at Kyle automotive.  But,
you get better than origninal wires that can withstand lots of heat, and I
believe, new connectors.  You can choose from a variety of different colors
too.  And, I believe you can get a $50 credit for any extra harnesses that
you send in, up to 2 or 3.

You get a core credit because they are rebuilding the harness's..... not
making new ones.

From the link:
a.. Reconditioned and inspected 2-way connectors on injectors, thermo-time
switch, auxiliary air valve, cold start valve
a.. Reconditioned and inspected connectors on ECU, air flow meter, double
relay and injector resistor
