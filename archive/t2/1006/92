Subject: spark plugs at AUTOZONE

I forgot to mention this earlier, but pay particular attention in AUTOZONE if
you go there for plugs.  It happened to be convenient for me the other day.
The plugs actually listed in the computer for an 81 Vanagon Campmobile (air
cooled) were completely off.  Being lazy that day as I was, I hadn't brought a
spare plug or #s down to match up so I trusted them to give me the correct
ones.  Guy at the counter gave me what was listed (so he didn't goof), but
they were completely off!!

Anyway . . .when I went back to talk to the manager about getting the computer
straightened out (for potential t2 listmembers in the future  :) ) . . .he
didn't really seem to care much and I doubt it got fixed.

Long story short . . .there isn't a VW shop in town so this is what I have to
go through when I need something basic and simple.  :(    . . .and double
check your spark plugs if you have to - or choose to shop at "the zone".
