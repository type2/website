Subject: Engine cooling tin

Facing the back of the motor, the alternator side, does the inner deflector
tin piece that directs air from the front shroud to the head, fit into the
rear of the front shroud and stays there, or around the outside, the down
curved  piece that is?  I am not getting a snug fit where the sheet metal tin
over that side reaches the front cast shroud, and am trying to narrow this
down, before I take it all apart tomorrow, and try again.  ThanksSquid
PS  Could not find detail in Bentley, any of my other manuals, or the
archives
