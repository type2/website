Subject: folding adjustable cup holders

I have about 6 extra folding adjustable cup holders in black (the ones for
Vanagon/bus), that I don't intend to use.  I'll give them to anyone on this
list for free + $5 shipping a piece.  They are normally like $7-8 +
shipping/handling.

If you're interested, shoot me an email and I'll send you a picture if you
like.

Brad
