Mark,

 

To be more specific, my transmission is a 091 with a '71 bell-housing and
input shaft. The clutch disc is a EMPI unit and the pressure plate is a
Kennedy 200lb unit.

 

 Is this combination considered a weak link as well?

 

I like the idea of upgrading to the Rabbit diesel clutch. What exactly makes
it a better choice?

 

Jon Stiles

hello on  It has been shown to me that sometimes using the higher pressure
plates is a mistake. The TOB crosshaft will break, mostly on the early

pressure plate with a rabbit 200mm diesel clutch disc.  later  mark d
