Subject: engine stand, half of a bellhousing

I'm looking to create a new engine stand to replace the pos bench
stands that I've been using. From what I read in the archives, the
preferred method seems to be to purchase harbor freight's  stand (is
the 750lb strong enough?) and mount an old bellhousing to it.

I want to create a hot stand, where I can run the engine in place. I
have an old 002 bellhousing with a starter that I've started engines
on before. I'd like to cut it in half..

Is half of an 002 bellhousing strong enough to run an engine on? I
want to cut it in half to be able to assemble the halfs of the engine
case together, and be able to later hot test the engine on that same
stand. Is half of the 002 bellhousing up to the task? Any recommended
cut patterns?

It would definitely save time to build, test, and tweak the engine all
in one place before install.

thanks.
Eddie
