Sort of a similar interesting thing though, depends who defines legal.  On samba right now is a mid 80's Vanagon Doka out of Canada, apparently that someone got a neat idea to bondo over the treasure chest doors fairly nicely to make them apppear not there, and then try to run something across the border in it as it has the acess from under the back seat.  Now as a Doka Vanagon, it is an entirely illegal in the US without a registered importer, and $5000, yada, yada, yada, to federalize it.  At least for a few more years until it hit 25 years old.  Funny thing about this one, is that the state of TX seized it (police for the drug running) and issued a good TX title for it when they sold it at auction to the guy trying to sell it now (a bit overpriced for a nonsyncro Doka.)  No registered importer, no federalization, just a good TX title in the State of Texas' name.
   
  Nice to be a state.
   
  Another thought, an '83 is legal in just one year, parts or offroad only vehicles are legal if you pay the import tariif which probably already happened.  You can buy it and if you resist driving it for just one year, legally drive it next year, not a bad thing IMHO.
