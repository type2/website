It is funny that you should mention that. I met her
approximately 2 weeks prior. At our first meeting she
told me that she was a spontaneous person. I called
her out on it. I told her that I was planning on going
to the mountains for a week to watch the leaves change
colors in my 1968 VW Bus. Being a hippy herself, she
accepted my offer. Fast foward to today- We are having
a baby together and we will be getting married in the
near future. Talk about a story to tell your kids huh?

Take care!
