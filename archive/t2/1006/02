Thanks for the theories and explanations on studs over bolts.

To perpetuate the boring topic :-) anyone know the best source of studs for
the head, and should I just try to remove the existing ones from the head
being removed, to install on the 'new' one, or should I only use new
hardware?

I doubt I will find it at home depot <g> Would a FLAPS have the studs, or is
it a dealer item?

Where can I find the thread size and overall length?

Do I really want to use a torch on the head, to get the studs out?

Thanks for all the good advice.

John
