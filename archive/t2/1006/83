Subject: Re: FI harness

I think a complete wiring harness is around $350 at Kyle automotive.  But,
you get better than origninal wires that can withstand lots of heat, and I
believe, new connectors.  You can choose from a variety of different colors
too.  And, I believe you can get a $50 credit for any extra harnesses that you
send in, up to 2 or 3.
