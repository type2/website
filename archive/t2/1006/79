I'm getting ready to take a type 2 body to the junk yard.  Everyone has helped
me so muchon this list that I thought I'd offer it to anyone on the list.  I'm
in Santa Maria, CA which is 1/2 way between SFO and LAX on the coast.
It's a 70, has been hit in the right front and repairs attempted, has a few
pieces cut out of the left front, has a bad sport on the left rear, has no
glass, no engine, no trans, no wheels, no doors, and no interior. actually the
rest is in remarkable condition. You will need a trailer and a four wheel
drive to get it from my place.  I'm 7 miles back from the highway on a dirt
road.  I can send pictures if you want.  It's going to go Saturday or Monday
so don't wait.
The main parts of the body are in remarkable shape and I just need to get it
out.  No pink slip.
