If it is outside the country, it wouldn't be eligible for USA import  
exemption (25 year rule) until next year. Right now, it doesn't match  
any US based version so you couldn't get a compliance letter from VW  
to help you clear customs on form HS7 under box 2A.

If it's already inside the country, you have to be suspicious about  
the VIN, title, reg, etc until you seen it all first hand. It could  
very well be here illegally.

Assuming it has papers, the difficulty of registering it will depend  
on where you live.
