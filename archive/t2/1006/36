This happened to me too. I live in Wilmington, NC.
Last year, My girlfriend and I decided to go on a week
long trip from Wilmington to Linville Falls, NC and to
Grandfather Mountain in my 1968 bus. I could write a
book about that one trip. I broke down about 10 times
through out this maiden voyage. My first breakdown
happened before I even got out of town. My throttle
cable broke on Fri. 5:03pm at an intersection on the
outskirts of town. I called Darrel from Silver Lake
VW. It just so happened that he had a  1968 parts bus
with a good throttle cable still in it. He Pulled it
out and left it by the door for me. This was at
5:03pm! Could you ask for a better mechanic! ;) I took
a taxi cab back to my girlfriends house and drove her
car to Silver Lake. Once we were back at the bus, it
took me about 5-10 min and we were back on the road.

Although I broke down around 10 times during that
week, I never had to call a tow truck. I broke the
throttle cable, smashed my external oil filter, broke
a rocker retaining spring, broke a couple of fan
belts, throttle cable kept getting stuck in the "wide
open position", and I killed the battery a couple of
times. That's whats great about owning an old VW. You
can fix just about anything on the side of the road!
