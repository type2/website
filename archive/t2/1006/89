Subject: BA6 for sale

I just found out that my mother passed away this morning. So if I am a
bit discombobulated, please forgive me.

I need to get $$ together to get to California to deal with her
remains, funeral, etc. But being unemployed for so long (I started a
new job 2 weeks ago) I'm flat broke. So I'm looking for things to
sell.

The BA-6 I have was pulled from a junkyard bus. Not tested yet.
Includes the heater itself, dashboard switch (no knob though), fuel
pump, and squirrel cage blower fan that attaches to the side. The
wiring harness was NOT retrieved (it was close to their closing and I
didn't want to miss out on the heater) so I cut the wires a few inches
out from the connectors to be able to recreate the wiring. I also
grabbed the overtemp sensor that goes in the tube just forward of the
heater (though for the life of me I can't recall where I put it).

I have no idea what it's worth because all I've seen for sale are the BN-4's.

Local to Denver, or I can deliver between here and SoCal this weekend
(anywhere along I-70).

(Please note I am NOT asking for charity. I don't want anybody to feel
like that's what I'm trying to do. Just making some hard financial
decisions. )
