> i wish i could find some cheap wood...

I put in a wood stove last year and spent a few weeks this summer getting
ready for this winter.  Got 5 racks full of nice hardwood.  Some elbow
grease and a chainsaw.  Also was blessed to have been present at several
times when someone was hoping to get rid of some potential firewood.

The crazy thing is that here in town a lot of folk are just tossing firewood
away.  Nice hardwood sitting on the curb waiting for someone to haul it way.
Heck, most of it's already cut into manageable lengths.  I ran out of room,
or I'd be picking up more of it as I drive by several locations where it's
just sitting there to be taken.

Wanted to put a wood stove in my bus (before we sold it), but just couldn't
find a design that I liked and that felt safe.
