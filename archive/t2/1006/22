>Worse than that.  Just the act of refilling them is illegal.

Most of the references I was able to find stated that it was illegal to
refill them AND sell them, or to transport them in order to sell them.  I
can't imagine that WalMart or Harbor Freight would be allowed to sell the
adapter if it was against federal law to refill them.

In any case, refilling isn't a job for the novice.  You have to watch out
for leaks, etc.  And I bet that refilling them while you're burning some
trash nearby would be a blast...
