Hi Rob,

I'd definitely recommend changing out all the shifter bushings. Even a
properly adjusted shifter can be impossible to get into reverse when
the bushings are shot/missing. One in particular, the one that exists
at the front of the shift rod, just forward of the shifter is very
important.

there are a few pages on the type2.com library that cover the topic.
If you're going to have the engine out, that is the time to replace
all of the bushings.


Eddie
