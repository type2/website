Yeah, I couldn't believe all the busses we saw (and a real nice red 
60-somethin ghia) along the way.  It got me thinking and wondering if anyone 
has ever put together a bus run, from say, Monterey down to say San Luis 
Obispo (camping 2 or 3 nights along the way).  I've driven a lot of 
coastline over the years (including Ireland and S. France), and still to 
this day, many sections of Highway 1 are the most breath-taking and dramatic 
drives on paved road.

If anyone knows of such a bus caravaning trip like this one -- above, let me 
know . . .we'd love to jump on it.   We saw a group of about 10 antique 
1930's Rolls Royces making the trek . . .if they could do it, we could 
surely do it!
