I am sure that remark was directed at me but......
IF you had read the charter when you signed on to this list, YES it was sent
to you!, it says:

--Search the List Archive and the Technical Resource Library.
In other words, consult the extensive resources available to
you at www.type2.com before asking on the list. You will get more
information faster that way. If you ask frequently asked questions
(FAQs) or frequently annoying recurring threads (FARTS), people will be
inclined to ignore you or become caustic.

Here is the charter you got:
