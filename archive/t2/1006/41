Hi Robt,

Even if your mechanic is duty bound to fix you engine, I think that he will
have done the best job he is capable of doing the first time around. If he
was unable to build the engine correctly in the first place, what are the
chances he would do a better job the second time around when not being paid
for his work or replacement parts? And if he gets it wrong the second time,
will he improve on the third try...and ...etc...

Just my 2 cents...this was the approach I took after having the steering
wheel fitted, by the mechanic that re-built my engine (1600 SP), spin freely
as I was going around a corner...really!  Apart from the unclamped fuel pipe
over exhaust from #3, the loose engine tin and the left pre-heater, never
connected, that exhausted into the engine compartment for a few months
before I noticed, and the one missing exhaust stud nut the engine has been
good - about 13000km so far.  I have
not been back to the mechanic that re-built my engine since the steering
wheel incident.

I think you may have to cut your losses and find a new mechanic, or do it
yourself.

Apologies if this does not constitute an "informed" opinion....but it is an
opinion! :-)
Cheers
Bruce
