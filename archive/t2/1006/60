Subject: Re: [T2] Front Seat belts from Vanagon into '78

Jeff asked:

 Hey everyone.

 I'm sure I can answer this myself but since my parts Vanagon is 40 miles
away and I'm not sure when I'll get to it I thought I'd ask the experts.

Has anyone ever taken the front seat belts from a Vanagon and installed them
in a Bay? Do you think it is possible without too much alteration?

The '78 has a retractable seat belt on the driver's side but the old
non-moving belt on the passenger side - what a hassle that is once your
buckled up.

Thanks ahead of time for any advice on the topic.

Do a SEARCH on the type 2 list archives. THAT is what it is for.

One of the biggest problems on the bay bus is the lack of metal area to
mount the bases.
