Worse than that.  Just the act of refilling them is illegal.

That being said, the reason that it is illegal is that the disposable
bottles don't have a provision against overfilling.  If filled completely
full with liquid propane the expansion of the liquid in a hot bus could
rupture the bottle with disasterous results if an ignition source is
nearby.

So, if you refill, make sure that there is some "slosh" in the bottle when
you shake it.  If there isn't, hook it up and burn off a bit of propane
before you store the little bottle away in the bus.
