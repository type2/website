Hi Richard,

How many miles are there on the bottom end of that engine? Do you know 
how many shims there are at the end of the crank? (Should be 3).

Excessive crankshaft end play can be cause a fore-and-aft wobble that 
will spin the distributor slightly. That could be the cause of your 
problem.

Or it could be as simple as a vacuum leak affecting the distributor. Try 
removing the vacuum lines from the distributor and see if the timing 
continues to wander. If it does, you have an endplay issue. If not, it's 
a vacuum problem.

Good luck!
