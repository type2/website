Subject: HELP ME !!!


Hello All,
   I am not in the best of spirits right now since my Bus is sitting in my 
back yard DEAD....I have a question that I want as many people to answer or 
just give me some thoughts on my situation. I had my 1800cc engine rebuilt 
last Fall I took the engine out brought the engine to this guy (who will 
remain nameless) He is a very reputable VW Mechanic. He rebuilt the engine 
for me and a few weeks later I picked it up...I brought it home put it in 
and then began to break the engine in. To my dismay it was leaking oil so I 
brought it back to him and told him my situation. He said "oh its probably 
just on of the push rod tubes" he said he would fix and then I could come 
back and pick it up. Well when I went back to pick it up he said he had some 
"BAD NEWS FOR ME". He told me that there was a hole in the block and that he 
did not notice it when he was rebuilding it. He said that he would put some 
high temp epoxy on it and it would be fine....I thought oh great this is 
going to be a disaster. So he puts the stuff on it then runs the engine to 
see if it leaked it did not so called me and told me to pick it up and that 
all was well. Anyway about 3000 miles later (while driving up to go back to 
school) the engine starts to leak oil pretty bad. So I take it back to him 
and tell him whats up he looks at it the next day and then tells me that it 
is the hole and that engine is useless. I said ok took the bus and brought 
it home not saying anything about him not finding the hole from the very 
begining. Now I am out about 1600 dollars and have a engine that has hole in 
the block. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? I like the mechanic but I am in a 
really crappy spot here.Isn't there a way you can do a pressure test on the 
block to see if there are any cracks or leaks? So this does not happen 
before it is rebuilt... I feel like I have been screwed over a bit because 
he never said that it was his fault or apoligized to me. And he never even 
offer to give me a break and help find a new block and give me a break on 
the labor. ...GUYS PLEASE HELP ME? Give me some input as to my legal rights 
and some thoughts on what I should say to him.....I am not in the position 
to just be screwed out of 1600 dollars.....Please give me some feedback as 
to how I should handle this......
                                Thanks,
                                    DIREWOLF6
