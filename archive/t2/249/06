When we were teenagers, my brother had a blue Super Beetle, it had one 
of those fiberglas bonnets ala a '39 Ford on the front. Which was cool 
but other than that the thing was a real POS. The fuel lines were all 
ossified and every 75-100 miles the line to the carb would pop clean 
off. It would then run while spraying gas all over the engine 
compartment until the carb bowl dried out and it finally died.

We'd just stick the line back on and keep going. Didn't think that much 
about it at the time.

It's amazing to me now but that Beetle didn't die by fire. It broke down 
one too many times and my brother eventually abandoned it by the side of 
the road.
