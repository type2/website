Michelle- ( Your P-mail is bouncing tonite ):
You have been had, plain and simple.
Where is the hole in the case ?
The test for pressure in an engine case
is the oil pressure in the bearing circuit.
Any other defect is a leak not under pressure.
No reputable engine builder will assemble
an engine with case cracks. Holes ? No.
Please describe the hole and location.
