Subject: Increasing power

I have an 81 Westy and really find the 67HP too little to be safe on any
incline and on-ramp.  I re-built the engine a few years ago and a VW shop
that tested it out afterwards said I did a god job and that it had "lots
of power" - well...not in the mountains in Vermont with the whle family
and camping gear.
I'm sure this engine in a non-camper bay is quite fine, but a Vanagon
Westy!

Anyway, a friend who has numerous Porsches in various states and a
greater amount of engines has offered me a 2.2L (or possibly a 2.4) for a
fair price and I was thinking of going for it, but I'm a little afraid of
all those carbs and Porsche prices in general.  I know the engine lid
needs to be modified and one needs to fabricate an engine mount and
exhaust (MSDS kit too expensive) and use a different flywheel (KEP), but
any other thoughts on this conversion, or ways to get a healthly power
increase from the type 4 in there now?

I see all these hopped up type 1's in the VW mags, since the type 1 parts
are more common and therefore cheaper, would a hopped up type 1 be the
way to go?  Or, gosh, dare I say it, Subaru power?

In digest mode, so feel free to p-mail

Thanks,
