Subject: RE: Where do I get a yellow fire extinguisher?

Hi,

Dont worry about getting a "yellow" fire extinguisher.
 The "yellow" fire extinguisher is for flammable metal
(Class D) fires.  These are only effective on these
items, generally in the chip or shaving form.

Get yourself a good 5 or 10 pound ABC fire
extinguisher (I carry 2-5 pound ones in my bus).  They
work well on class A (ordinary combustibles) B
(flammable liquids) and C (electrical) fires.  If your
fire burns long enough to catch the aluminum/magnesium
componenets on your bus, it is totally gone by then
and this expensive "yellow" extinguisher would be just
a waste of time.  Make sure you mount these in a handy
place, so you dont root around in a burning bus, or
have them used as missiles on you in an accident

For additional information, look in the library
section.
