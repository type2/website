No smog and insurance no title transfer in Cal unless the PO has declared it 
inop to the DMV. If it's over due on registration and not inop you might be 
in DMV hell anyway.

I bought a 77 (out of state to Cal) couldn't transfer title and ended up 
cutting it up in my garage. Quite a learning experience.

The junk yard would not take it (to much DMV hassle) and recommended that I 
shove it into the street and wait for it be towed. Since with 6 old cars I 
am, shall we say, on shaky ground with the neighbors  I went the chop route. 
(They loved the noise).
