Subject: Flywheel won't budge

Hello,
I have a MAJOR oil leak and I am in the process of replacing the seal 
behind the flywheel.  I got the gland nut off, but how and the world does 
the flywheel come off?  Bentley says it will come off the dowels, but mine 
ain't budging.  Are there any tricks that this kooky math teacher doesn't 
know?  Thanks

Joy Thru Air,
