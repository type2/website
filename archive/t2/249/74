Subject: Re: [T2] burnt bus

Pat,

Very very sorry to hear of your loss. When I restored my bus I took it by a
Korean mechanic I respect who has done some work on my other cars but speaks
little English..

After a lengthy look he had one adamant word of advice. "Clamps," he said,
pointing to the fuel lines. I had good fuel lines but had no clamps. "Fire."
he said, shaking his head.

With many years in the business and probably m ore than a few burned vws
under his belt, Paek knew the primary cause of disastrous fires--fuel lines
that come loose. A fuel line that comes literally pumps gas into the engine
compartment.

Paul, I hope your bused was totally covered by insurance and you will be on
the road again. I am glad to know you got everyone out safely.

In sympathy,

John Rogers
