I guess what I really want to know is if these plates  which the bolts =
for
the hold down clamps are only in passenger busses  or in all of them. =
Mine
are kinda nasty & looking worse all the time. Cutting them out & welding =
in
some sections of flooring seem like a  good idea, but not sure what the
actual westys had.

Well, when we were taking out the cabinetry in the '79 Westy that I had
bought, I was surprised to see these things in there. The front cabinet
under the Z bed is partially held down by the rear two of these =
brackets,
and what is REALLY strange, is that even in the carpeted open floor =
area,
there are definite factory cutouts in the rubberized floor carpet, and
access holes through the thin plywood subfloor, so that you can get to
these.. For what purpose, I am not sure, unless they thought to =
themselves
that some people might wan't their Westies customized to have the =
additional
middle seat for transporters, instead of the sink/stove cabinetry unit.
But I will say this much.. If you, or anyone else down the road wants to =
put
seats in this vehicle, that would be the only legal way to do it. =
Department
of Transportation (DOT) sets certain standards that apply equally to all
imported, as well as domestic vehicles, and this would be a number one
safety item, that there be an approved system and method of anchoring =
the
passenger seats and seat belts to a substantially strong part of the =
floor.
I am aware that these little places accumulate crud and rust on many =
buses.
If it were me, I would try to preserve them for future use by cleaning =
them
as well as possible and then painting them with a rust stabilizer. This =
will
all be super easy to do, and if you like you can fill the area with an =
epoxy
putty, which can be dug out later if you want to reverse the process.
