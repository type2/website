Subject: Help!...need windows parts


Folks,

I cannot for the life of me find anyone with any replacement parts
for my sliding windows in my 78 Champagne edition.  The two center windows
on my non-camper bus.

Rubber guide and the felt strips for starters.

These are the parts internal to the window..I have the outside body to 
window seal.

Are these the same on vanagons?

Please tell me I just missed them on some site!

Cheers, dave
