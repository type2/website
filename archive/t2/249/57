Subject: Re: [T2] Engine oil leak stuck in Ohio update

I assume you are talking about the single bolt in the center of the round
oil strainer cover plate?  If so, you should be able to replace this bolt,
but be sure you find an exact match and torque it to no more than 9
ft-pounds.  Apparently this bolt can damage your main bearings if
over-torqued.  Nine Ft-pounds is not much...if you get it too loose it will
just leak a little, and you can tighten it a little more.

If possible, try to clean up the threads in the case to avoid stripping
those as well...a local FLAPS will have a metric tap to do this with.
Thread size is "M8"

If that's not the bolt, let me know and I'll look it up if needed...
