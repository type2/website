Subject: I hate FI!!


Learned all about FI in college.  I have carbs, and stick to carbs.  I know 
them pretty well, and they are very simple, once you learn the concept.  I 
did a project where I had to write about the differences between each.  On a 
bus, there is no denying that the the newer 2.0 with FI makes a bus fly in 
comparrison to it's 1600cc little brother.  And when I saw the major change 
in domestics from carbs to FI I did see those cars going smoother, faster.  
When my bus is not starting, I check two things. Gas, and spark.  Put a 
mirror over the carb, and watch it spray! FI is a little more involved, 
although not as big a deal as some may think. It is much more efficient, and 
better for the engine.  Any technologically advanced engine is injected.  
But alas, though I am young, I am from the old school when it comes to 
vehicles.  Coils and carbs.  No computers, no sensors, no fiber-optic, 
CD-ROM, plasma gas, flex capacitors!  FI is just different...and I hate it!  
Fear of the unknown. And I know it's ridiculous!       B.G.
