[...]
my westy is an 82 (built aug 81) (rv  cert in jan 82) with the 82 
operators manual but the camper manual is an 83.  when i first saw this 
i thought it was strange. but then i did a check of everything in the 
manual looking for differences and didnt find any.  however in the 
maintenance and internal parts area there are differences.
