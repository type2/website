Subject: FI/Carbs/Simplicity/Reliability

I realize that this message is going to end up being a big old pile of fuel
for the inevitable flames, BUT...........

When I work out my personal equation for reliability/repairability -vs- my
current skills and equipment, I always end up back with the carbs. I'm sure
this decision is partially influenced by my latent Luddite tendencies, as
well as most people's desire to stay within the comfort zone of 'the devil
you know'.  None of my carbed vehicles have ever frozen up, failed beyond my
ability to at least nurse it back to civilization, or failed in such a way
that I needed a $150 part that was only available from five states away.

I do understand the benefits of FI, in theory anyway since I have no
persoanl experience, and about once a year I get the bug to convert from
carbs. Just about that time one of my employees will be stuck in the parking
lot after work with an FI vehicle that won't start, or if it starts, won't
run. This happened just this past Tuesady. Little domestic truck, ran fine
all weekend, on the way to work and at lunch, dead as a hammer at quitting
time. Skip ahead, skip ahead.....fuel pump, ignition control module, and 2
non-functioning injectors were replaced before it left the lot under it's
own power on Thursday. Maybe I'll think about that FI conversion a little
more.

When you get right down to it, this is one of those subjects (like oil) that
falls under the "Brussel Sprouts" theory of life. What might that be, you
ask? Brussel sprouts are a fine, tasty, nutritious vegetable; some people
love them, others hate them. No good reason for either opinion except in the
minds of those who hold them. Go figure.

Happy Friday, all.
