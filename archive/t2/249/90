--Mark,

pick up a pressure gauge that reads to 40 or 50 psi and attach it to the stub on the fuel rail between #3/4 for the purpose. It has a 7mm screwed hex head bolt in the stub regularly.

crank it!

check the gauge, are you seeing close to 35psi and absolutely no lower than about 23?

yes: then you've got other problems.

no: perform tests per bentley on fuel pump and pressure regulator to determine which it is.

Later,

Billy

for more than a couple of hours.  So, I believe my problem to be either the fuel pump or the pressure regulator.
