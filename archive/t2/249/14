Just a comment on the contact adhesives 

that 3M has. While the stuff that Chuck 

mentions is great stuff, Please Please

 dont use their contact sprays for interior 

pieces. I wasted my money and it just does

not hold up to the interior temps for fabrics.

Door panels and such. The heat casues it to 

"melt" and bubble your material. Use an auto

specific spray. 321 Contact is great!
