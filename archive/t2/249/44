Subject: Re: 79/78 buses

With this vehicle running, I could feel the exhaust leak in the rear muffler
area. After looking at a diagram of a muffler system for that year, I am
sure that it either came from the muffler or the catalytic converter. After
pricing those I know I would not be in for too much money...About
$100-$125.00.
That is the only reason that I am sure of that it would not smog. Other than
that, it would have to go in for diagnostics and a smog check. In
California, if it cannot pass the emissions tests, you have 60 days to
repair it, and they'll give you a pass to use it until then. After that, no
dice. But this would be enough time for me. If that guy can get it out
today, I may just give him $200 and the cost of the tow/storage and I think
he'll be glad to be rid of it. I don't have a place to put it right now, but
a friend of mine needs a transportation car for about two months, and he can
have it to use if he pays the fees on it. His only car is having problems
and he's down to taking the bus to work. I wouldn't even care if he got it
banged up a little bit (he wouldn't, and he's used to driving vans)..as long
as he keeps the oil topped off. Everything that I need body-wise is above
fender-level on this thing anyway.
First thing is, we have to see if we can get it out. As far as smogging that
particular vehicle, it is a moot point.. It will soon be an empty hull, one
way or another.
