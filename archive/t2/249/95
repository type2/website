at this point I would question the "reputable" part.  everyone makes a
mistake, it is what you do next that seperates the reputable from the
shysters.

????? any mechanic that rebuilds an engine and misses a hole would have me
worried from the get go.  What else did he miss??  and why didn't he see
the leak when he tested the engine, he did test the engine didn't he?

how much of all this is in writing, and ask him, "if I get another block

for legal rights you probably should discuss it with a lawyer, I took a VW
shyster to small claims court and won the max, now collecting that money
is another story.


a possible short term solution though. 
  I have oil heat in my house and that means an oil tank, occasionally
they will leak and that is the ultimate mess in a house,  well they make
special from the outside oiltank repair plugs.  it is a spring loaded
"T" shaped head with a large seal and flat plate on the outside along with
a nut to tighten it.  it might work depending on where the hole is. BUT I
would consider this short term only.

good luck
