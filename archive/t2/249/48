 Just a question: how did Kokopele, the water sprinkler/flut player get to
be
 the bus god? Just curious......

Well, of course, Kokopele is only my unofficial bus god, but that is because
he's also known as a "trickster".. It only occurred to me that some things
are so simple that they obscure unexpected things from the unwary, and often
the workings of even something so simple as a VW are like that.  Jan B
