This is the way I see it---and he may too.
Seeing as you installed the engine, he could very well back pedal out of
this undesirable situation by simply saying--you dropped it---or you did
this, or did that--- and he therefore has zero liability---
However, if he openly admitted to you he missed the hole--he may offer
some assistance---

Did you inquire as too what he would be able to do for you, after the
first hole patch job----or after it fell out?
I didn't see anything mentioned about what you had said to him about
this mysterious hole in the case

Ask first, worry about recourse later,

Was this a running engine out of your bus prior to you having it
rebuilt, or something you picked up elsewhere--at a bargain deal?

If it was a running engine in your bus--I was just wondering myself
where the hole came from--

Later,

Terry

Hello All, 
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0I am not in the best of spirits right now since my Bus
is sitting in my back yard DEAD....I have a question that I want as many
people to answer or just give me some thoughts on my situation. I had my
1800cc engine rebuilt last Fall I took the engine out brought the engine
to this guy (who will remain nameless) He is a very reputable VW
Mechanic. He rebuilt the engine for me and a few weeks later I picked it
up...I brought it home put it in and then began to break the engine in.
To my dismay it was leaking oil so I brought it back to him and told him
my situation. He said "oh its probably just on of the push rod tubes" he
said he would fix and then I could come back and pick it up. Well when I
went back to pick it up he said he had some "BAD NEWS FOR ME". He told
me that there was a hole in the block and that he did not notice it when
he was rebuilding it. He said that he would put some high temp epoxy on
it and it would be fine....I thought oh great this is going to be a
disaster. So he puts the stuff on it then runs the engine to see if it
leaked it did not so called me and told me to pick it up and that all
was well. Anyway about 3000 miles later (while driving up to go back to
school) the engine starts to leak oil pretty bad. So I take it back to
him and tell him whats up he looks at it the next day and then tells me
that it is the hole and that engine is useless. I said ok took the bus
and brought it home not saying anything about him not finding the hole
from the very begining. Now I am out about 1600 dollars and have a
engine that has hole in the block. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? I like the
mechanic but I am in a really crappy spot here.Isn't there a way you can
do a pressure test on the block to see if there are any cracks or leaks?
So this does not happen before it is rebuilt... I feel like I have been
screwed over a bit because he never said that it was his fault or
apoligized to me. And he never even offer to give me a break and help
find a new block and give me a break on the labor. ...GUYS PLEASE HELP
ME? Give me some input as to my legal rights and some thoughts on what I
should say to him.....I am not in the position to just be screwed out of
1600 dollars.....Please give me some feedback as to how I should handle
this......
