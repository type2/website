Type 4 again should disregard, I dont know. We dont know....


But the type I is a different story.

I decided to test both ways. I ran the bus without flaps and then with 
flaps, and I noticed a reduced temperature in heads and oil temp on the same 
stretch of road at approximatly the same speed. I had a 63 so dropping the 
engine was quick and painless. Put those flaps in weather or not you wire 
them open or use a thermostat (which by the way on the "test" I did not use 
a thermostat, they were wired open).
