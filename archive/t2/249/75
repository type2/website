Hi Jamie.

Glad to read of your successful flywheel removal and seal transplant..

On to other matters:

For me any weekend but 4-6 would be great (my wife will be out of town and I
will be taking care of the kids). Also, there is a Fall Cookout in Charlotte
NC on the 6th that could compete..

The next weekend has a conflict with Oktoberbus the 11th-13th in Harmony, NC
that might drain off some would-be campers. So may I suggest the 18th-20th?
Leaves should be at there peak at that date, and the crisp fall weather
ideal.

I'm only a few hours away and was already thinking of a weekend camping
there even before your post.

Cheers,

John Rogers
