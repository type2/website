Hello All,   =20
            I have a 78 westy currently in the process of being put back =
on the road. I purchased it after it had sat for about 5 years. I've =
straightened out all the normal problems,bad gas clogged injection, etc. =
I have gotten the bus to run and have been able to drive it. The problem =
is sometimes the ignition switch will not trigger the starter. This =
seems to happen almost at random. The switch will only turn over the =
starter about 1 in 20 times. I have replaced my battery terminals and =
wires, cleaned every contact on the starter, checked for voltage at the =
starter, and everything seems ok. is their something I don't know about =
the solenoid that I should take into account? Any possible information =
or things to try would be greatly appreciated. Thanks
