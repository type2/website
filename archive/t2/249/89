I am a little puzzled by the specs for the 021 905 205E dizzy:

Bus & Pickup 1972 * 1700
Distributor: VW 021-905-205E, Bosch 0231 173 005
Vacuum Can: 07 101
Timing Set At:: 5deg ATDC (-at-) 800-950rpm w/strobe, vacuum hose(s) connected
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 8-12deg Adv, 11-15deg Ret;
Centrifugal: 13-16deg (-at-) 2000rpm, 23-26deg (-at-) 3600 rpm

That 07 101 vacuum unit is the same as a 73 with auto trans:

Bus 1973 * 1700 Auto Trans
Distributor: VW 021-905-205F, Bosch 0231 173 007 > 021-905-205Q, 0231 173 008
Vacuum Can: 07 101
Timing Set At:: 5deg ATDC (-at-) 800-950rpm w/strobe, vacuum hose(s) connected
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 8-12deg Adv, 11-14deg Ret; Centrifugal: 14deg (-at-)
1700 rpm, 15-19deg (-at-) 2400 rpm, 21-25deg (-at-) 3400rpm

Somehow it loses a degree of retard in 1973!?!

I do have a good 205F dizzy if you want it. The vacuum unit, 885, is good.
Same unit you need. The centrifugal curve is different, but you would probably
never notice the difference.
