Subject: Re: [T2] points bounce?

What does it mean for the points to bounce?  I've read this several place
but I'm not sure what it refers to.
 ---------------------
It means that the point set spring is weak or you're revving very high.
Not something to worry about since your engine will blow before you get
point bounce with a Type IV engine.
