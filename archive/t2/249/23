Subject: Benefits of FI


This is probably a good time to ask this.
I've been thinking about putting fuel injection back onto my '77 bus.
The PO removed the FI setup and replaced it with a weber progressive.
Could some of the people that have FI tell me the benefits of having it?
I'm aware of better gas mileage and I like the idea of no more icing in 
cold weather, what else?  My bus budget is pretty tight right now, and
I'm 
hesitant to do the switch. Learning everything isn't a issue, I enjoy
it. I've 
read as much as I can get my hands on, Type2 archive and Library plus 
the chapter in the Bentley. I have a almost complete FI system on hand.
I'm afraid I'm going to switch over and have half the parts fail
leaving me with a large bill...

Please direct any thoughts to me.

thanks
