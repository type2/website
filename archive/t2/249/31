The mechanic obviously is ignorant of engine metals.  You can weld  the 
vw engine with an open flame and not  set it on fire.  Yellow  coding 
is specific for flamable metals like high percentage magnesium, and 
metal powder fires. and have specific markings for specific metals.  an 
old  m series thermite grenade would probably just  melt through 
without starting a metal fire. (about  15 seconds) you need a class b 
extinguisher for vehicle  engine fires and for a westy a multi abc 
would be recommended for kitchen and engine fires.  Over the years i 
have seen extremely hot race engine fires that never set mag-al  
engines on fire.  just the fuel.
