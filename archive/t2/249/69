Subject: Idling troubles on 72/74 bus

Well, I'm having some idle troubles right now, as the subject says. The bus 
is a '72 body, but the engine is a 74 dual carb.

At the end of a short (2 and a half hour) trip, I put the clutch down on the 
exit ramp and noticed that my brakes weren't functioning right. It felt like 
the engine had stalled, and the weak-at-any-rate powered brakes weren't 
working at all. I checked the dash, and the oil light was on (but not the 
generator or brake problem lights). The engine had not stalled, however, it 
was idling at 800. 800 or so is normal, I understand, but my engine isn't 
quite right and has been set to a high (1600!) idle to keep it from stalling 
out... so 800 is quite low.

Since then, I've checked the oil level, which is fine. Every time I put the 
clutch down or shift into neutral I lose power breaking. When I let it idle 
with the clutch down it goes down to around 1000 RPM, and idle slowly begins 
to dip. As it clears just under 800, the oil light comes on and brake power 
disappears. Sometimes the engine stalls, in which case the alternator light 
and brake trouble lights come on. Sometimes it does not stall, in which case 
only the oil light comes on.

Known problem: the dash brake light is a little unreliable, something is 
loose under there and it comes on sporadically sometimes. It usually goes 
off if I tap the dash with my fingers or move the heater levers, so maybe 
there's a short or just a loose connection. Just wanted to mention that, in 
case the brake light status could be misleading in this case.
