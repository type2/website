Subject: Where do I get a yellow fire extinguisher?

Fellow listees!  After getting a leaky fuel injector fixed I had a
discussion with my mechanic who told me that I need to carry a yellow
fire extinguisher on my bus  for fires; I have been carrying an ABC type
and I thought that was supposed to be good for any type of fire.  Any
advice on where I would get a "yellow" one?  I talked to the local fire
safety guy and his response was "get rid of the bus and get a new saturn
(or chevy, or hynudai, or whatever.)"  I was horrified and told him I
love my bus.  ( I didn't mention the part about getting  a tattoo of it
on my leg.)  Anyway, let me know what you think.  Thanks!  Beth and
Prudence the '78 Bus.
