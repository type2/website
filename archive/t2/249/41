Watch out. You may not be able to retrieve it.
California has an abatement law. If the vehicle was towed because of it, it
can only go to a wrecking yard. It cannot be re-registered and put back on the
street. And you cannot buy it, complete, for parts unless you are a licensed
wrecking yard.

Remember the '78 with rustibus with the good engine and tranny for $800? I
never did make an offer on it. Well, I have been looking at that darned thing
for over ten days now, and I's been slowly getting under my skin. I told my
self last night, "No way, I'm going to get involved in another project". I
thought that had settled it. But alas, I had made the mistake of going out and
test driving it. That engine ran pretty darned sweet.. That bus is
impressively fast, powerful, with super responsive acceleration. I'm sure that
it's nowhere near running as good as it could with some maintenance.
So, why do you think I've been asking all these questions about FI's and fuel
efficiency? Like I said, I thought I had it pretty much settled that I
wouldn't mess with this one, but it's still eating at me. So, just now I got
the nerve to call the guy back, and he tells me that it got towed. He says
he's going to cash his paycheck tomorrow and go down to try to get it out, but
if for some reason he can't, he tells me that I can go down there and he'll
just give me the pink. He says he'd rather see anyone get it but them. Well,
it's only going to have about a $50.00 tow bill and two days' storage on it.
Let's see what happens. They towed it because the registration was expired,
and they'll probably want that paid, too. It's only expired by a few months.
