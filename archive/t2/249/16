Subject: silly metal floor question

Because I seem to not be able to stumble across the right picture,
perhaps someone can help me here. In the floor of my 79 7 pass bus
there are slots across the floor at particular places that the bolts
that hold the pass seats fit in. I now have my bus as a camper &
really don't have much need to the rusty remains of these holders.
What bolts or bolt holes are in the cargo area of a regular late bay
westy? links to pics would even be better.
