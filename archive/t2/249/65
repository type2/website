If it was a running engine in your bus--I was just wondering myself
where the hole came from--

I am just as curious how that hole got there. Was it there before you first 
pulled it?? Did it get put in there when pulling it and the mechanic missed 
it?? Did it get put in there when rolling around the shop floor or gravel 
driveway or when reinstalling?? Did you run over a stick and it jumped up 
and poked a hole in the case after it was reinstalled??  Were you using a 
jack with steel tangs unprotected with a wood block or something like 
that?? Just where on the case is the hole???
