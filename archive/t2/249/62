Without pictures it can be difficult to understand exactly *what* is being
described through words alone.  From your prior post and this one it sounds
to me like the bolt you're talking about is the one centered in the deep
recess between the lifter bores in the left case half.  Correct?

If that's the one we're talking about then I'd be very concerned because
this is a "parting-line" fastener (one that contributes to holding the case
halves together) and it's hard to understand what would cause the condition
you describe.  None the less, if you intend to drive out of wherever you're
located then you have to replace that bolt.

What I would do is this:

1) Find the correct replacement bolt
2) Clean the area of the case where the bolt head seats as clean as possible
3) Slather the threads and the bottom of the head (the portion of the bolt
that hits the case) with Permatex 3H
4) Install the bolt and torque it to 15 foot-pounds
5) See the sights for a day or so to let the Permatex 3H set up

If the bolt won't come up to 15 foot-pounds then something is wrong inside
the case that can only be fixed by tearing the engine down.  If that's the
case and you still have to drive the car, then buy a couple of cases of
cheap oil and check the oil level every 30 minutes or so.
