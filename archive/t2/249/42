Subject: fuel injection

So the word is stick with the injection, problem is I didnt take it out of 
the last bus the guy I bought the engine from did. So we are missing whatever 
control modules and aircleaner stuff that all this FI plugs into. Everything 
that is bolted to the engine itself was there. So who might have this extra 
stuff, what is it called and how much to atain it. Can I test anything with 
it out of the vehicle and missing the control module. thanks again Dylan
