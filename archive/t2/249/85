Wow! Well apparently, and importantly for me, there is no Abandoned Vehicle
Abatement (AVA) program in my county. I'm sure it's coming, though. No, this
one was just impounded on an expired registration, I am sure. When/if proof
of ownership and payment of impound/registration fees is submitted, I am
sure it will be released. It would be considered "abandoned" after the
passage of 30 days, but that's a long, long way off, still. I'm still not
100% sure that I'm going to do it, though. I've got a very full plate right
now.. It's just that I know this opportunity will not present itself again.
