Subject: burnt bus

Do not ever think it will not happen to you.  On the way back from the
ReUnion campout, my bus burned to the ground.  I had changed some of the
fuel lines but not all.  I was just west of The Dalles when I smelled gas &
less then a minute later smoke was pouring from the heater vents & flames
from the back.  I got my sleeping wife & son out safely.  I grabbed my
wallet & fire extinguisher but there was no putting the fire out.  It burnt
so quickly, it was unbelievable.  Since my camera burned with the bus, I
have no pictures but will get some to post as a warning to all.  Change your
fuel lines.
