Basically, it's a thermocouple in reverse.  With a thermocouple, adding
heat to the junction of two dissimilar metals produces a voltage.  With
one of these coolers, applying a voltage to the junction of two dissimilar
metals (or semiconductors) moves heat.

Thermoelectric coolers aren't moving nearly as much heat, either.  If
you want to move a certain amount of heat, there is a fixed minimum
amount of energy you have to use to do it.  It's the law.  Don't fight
100 years of profit-driven companies and engineers deciding that a
compressor and some fluorocarbons are the most cost-effective way to
cool...

No.  If you used a really huge solar panel, you might be able to run
a small Freon(tm)-based refrigerator.  Probably a better bet would be
to use a sanely-sized solar panel to run a small fan.  Opening one of
the rear-most pop-outs and putting an _exhaust_ fan in the cab vent
(backwards from an ambulance fan) would probably be near optimal.
The hotter air rises to the top of the interior and the cab vent
intakes are some of the top-most things in a Bus.  There are security
implications of opening the rear pop-out, but if your Bus has good
door seals, it is necessary to do that so the fan isn't sucking on
a bottle.
