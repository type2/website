As far as I know, no one supplies internal parts for the sliding windows. Not
even VW.

Vanagon windows are about 2" taller than bay windows.

Here is the parts pic of bay windows, but they do not show 78/79 sliders. But
if you look at the vent windows, you will see there is no breakdown of parts
for them.
