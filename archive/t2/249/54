Subject: engine oil leak need advice! Stuck in Ohio!

Hey folks,
I'ts me and Anya again still on the cross country.
Just changed the oil and notices a naughty leak that
just got worse. The oil is coming out of the bolt
between and under the pushrod tubes on the left side.
I think the bolt goes through to hold the strainer in
but not sure. could I put a o-ring on the bolt and
solve the problem like that or what? Thanks,
Giles
