Subject: was engine sonversion, now stupid mistake

i have weighed the options, and i think you guys are right.  it would cost 
me the cost of the engine plus some new parts plus installing everything, 
which is probably way over my head.  i have driven a 1978 with a 1641cc and 
looking back i like the power of the 2000cc much more.  now my dilema is 
getting my engine rebuilt.  are any of you from the chicago-land area.  i am 
now looking for a place to have my engine rebuilt.  i would be willing to 
drive a little to get there as long as it is a good place, and what is the 
ball park cost of a rebuild for a 2000 FI.  thanks for your imput, it 
cleareda few things up for me.
