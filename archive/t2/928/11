Subject: Re: [T2] Best cheap paint job for 77 Westy . Maaco  etc

I had Maaco do my daughter's 75 bus; used their best (5 yr?) epoxy 
urethane for around 800 bucks or so.  Prep is key; their primer is 2 
microns thick and I swear sprayed just ahead of the final color!  We did 
our own prep, using Uroprime primer where bare metal was sanded to, and 
used around 300 grit for prepainted areas that were fine and de/waxed 
with prep-sol.  The finish is nice after 2 years; see the transition on 
my daughter's bus page on her site (she is an 
artist)...http://www.geocities.com/the_fider/MyVWBus.html
