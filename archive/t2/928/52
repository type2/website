GD - USA with FI
CJ - Europe with carbs

The chrome locking and non-locking gascap are hard to find but they fit and work best. The last locking gaspcap I bought was from eBay but since then Bus Depot has started to carry this OEM Blau gas cap again:

Be sure to avoid the black version of this gas cap: It's for a non-Type 2 VW and it fits poorly.
