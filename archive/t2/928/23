Can someone tell me where all this debate came from? We're overthinking this...

1. Have system evacuated by a shop that recycles your particular refrigerant.
2. Think of the A/C system this way:
**The compressor is a water pump
**The refrigerant is the water

Then it starts to make sense. It's just a mechanical system, and as
such should be within reach of the average member of this list.

Just remember to have the system evacuated (unless it already is from
damage or part failure), do the work, have it evacuated again to
remove air and moisture, recharge.
