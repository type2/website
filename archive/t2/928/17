Subject: Westy Bed Padding

I just cleaned and refurbished my interior for my westy and my spouse and I
both feel that the foam padding is just too nasty to use. Does anyone have a
vendor/source for the high density type replacement foam. The stuff at the
craft store is far too thin to take the abuse.
