Agreed. My DC is very quick (80+ is just not safe though in any stock Type2
Don! :). But the sight of my VW makes even the sanest driver try to lead
foot it past me.

I did a "test" last week. I got on one of Denver's major freeways that is
known for speeding. I set my speed at 70 in a 55 zone and A SEMI, A TOYOTA
TERCEL and a DELIVERY TRUCK overtook me in the right lane (which is
illegal). Is it they feel safer or is it that they feel obligated to pass
every aircooled vehicle as a matter of standards?

However, I find myself trying to keep my speed down in my wife's Mini Cooper
S. I honestly think it is much safer to drive at high speed because it has
the drivetrain, brakes etc to back it up. But that doesn't excuse an 8000lb
Ford or Chevrolet product barreling down the freeway at 90. We get dozens of
big SUV's, pickups and minivans rolled when the weather changes. Too much
vehicle + too much speed = airbags deployed.

I think if airbags and ABS didn't exist, people might slow down but I think
it is now cultural. I'll still drive my VW's every day and everyone else can
KMA. I have full insurance, retractable belts and big ol disc brakes, the
best I can do.

Doug,
      Maybe this isn't the place to address the question, but it is a
Friday...
so here goes.  I think the average speeds at which people-in-general are 
driving (on Interstate highways in particular) have increased.  It is not 
seemly to do an indicated 55 on a 55-limit road.  Yes, I know about speedo 
error.  What I see well exceeds any 10% effect.  I think many motorists have

got the idea their relative 'invulnerability' is at a new high, perhaps due
to 
anti-lock brakes, stability controls, air bags, etc.  Bottom line, I am not 
comfortable driving any vintage VW on freeways -- except at times when no
one 
would be expect a need for speed, that is, getting to work (let's say).
Sorry 
for the pessimism, but IMHO the wonderful air cooled VW products are no
longer 
suitable as daily drivers, if you have to drive on roads posted above 50
mph.  
Just my 2" worth...... Glenn
