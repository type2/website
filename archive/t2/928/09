 << At the top of the list is the fact that R12 is killing the Ozone
layer.>>

Did---as we are / were told.
I've got a problem with the propaganda that the EPA feeds us.
Nobody mentions that the Space shuttle, and every Atlas missiles
carrying who know's what upstairs, take along with itself ozone
depleting burnt fuel gasses--
direct to the layer--Live, and blow big holes in it.
Nobody says a word about that--
Nobody reminds anybody about that issue.
It's good for NASA, it's gotta be good for me.

Just think--one blast of an Atlas missile up yonder is equivalent to all
the cars exhaust here and in Europe, and for 3 months worth of a ozone
burn.
This is a good deal.  

 <<(And converting to R134a involves more than just draining the R12 and
replacing it. And, R134a requires addition of a special oil.>>
Nothing special.
Just Pag Or Ester.

<< Not to mention the expansion valve and dryer modifications which
should be made when converting from R12 to R134a.)>>

Just the dryer.
The expansion valve will be fine.


<<I am not a tree hugger. But releasing R12 into the atmosphere is both
illegal and has an adverse effect on mother earth.>>

Maybe.
I always thought this was pretty funny.
Any body shop doing business in the US MUST have an AC reclamation tank
and recharging station.

Hmm.
After the Car ,Truck, Bus, gets wacked in the nose--where's the
refrigerant?
And why would a body shop need any AC recharging equipment except for a
nose hit?
They wouldn't.

More EPA  BS.

 <<If the issue was both no training and lack of proper tools, then go
ahead- work on your automatic tranny and screw it up. Go ahead- work on
your CP-091 4-speed 6-rib manual tranny and screw it up. Only your T2
dependabilty and pocketbook will be affected. >>

How did an automatic trans get into this conversation?

Let's talk about a nuclear submarine, or maybe heart surgery while were
at it.
None of which is within comparable parameters---transmissions included. 

<<There is a reason working with R12 requires a license.>>

The government only makes this a licensable item so they can control
it---and tax the hell outa it.
That's all.
The exobitant price of the R-12 is going into the pockets of Uncle
sam--lining his pockets big time.
 
<<It is too bad so many 60s to 80s era cars, refrigerators and freezers
were manufactured world-wide before the adverse effects of R12 became
known. >>

Your girl friends hair spray propellant did more ozone damage than R-12,
only because there was more of it world wide., day in and day out.

I repeat.
You can't learn without doing, and making error's.
