Subject: RE: Importing a vehicle to USA - need advice

Jamie,

I have brought in my camper from Germany and can help with experience and
logistics on the German side. Remember: whatever you bring in MUST be at
least 25 years old to avoid DOT and EPA hassles. 2007 will be the first
opportunity for water-leaker Vanagons (early '83 models with a '82
registration).

Hello Volks,
I am thinking about importing a vehicle from either Canada or Germany to
USA.  Anyone have any experience doing this? Thanks.
