Subject: gas theft

Well, I was perfectly happy with my non-locking original gas cap -  until last night.  I went to dinner kind of late with a professor  friend of mine.  Parked across the lot from the place.  It's  just about 1/4 mile from my house.  This morning I noticed that  the gas guage didn't work.  Well below the empty mark.  The  bus was almost empty anyhow but I made it to the gas station where I  noticed that my gas cap was missing.  It has been over a week  since I filled up and I'm confident I would have noticed it.  My  guage reads 1/2 full when it's full.  So I always fill up when I  hit the empty mark.  Yesterday I was near that mark and planned on  filling up today anyhow.  Well, my tank took 14 gallons!   I've never been able to put more than 12 in it on the empty mark.   And I've never run it out of gas.  So I figure somebody tried  siphoning off some gas and got as much as they could.  But there  was still enough in it for it to run.  They didn't get much but  they also
 didn't put the gas cap back on.  That ticks me  off.  So I guess I'm going to be ordering a locking gas cap from  BD.  Grrr....KR
