Subject: Re: [T2] AC

<<Working on AC systems is not something you do in your driveway if you
have zero tools or knowledge.>>

Why Not?

I'll have to say this.

If a guy is willing to learn, or wants to,what is wrong with that?

Nothing.

<<Not sure where you live, but here in California you have be licensed
to buy R-12. >>

Yea---but he didn't even bring up the R-12 subject so don't even worry
about it.

The EPA Gestapo wouldn't even screw around with a guy doing his own
stuff in his own garage.

I enjoy Black Market R-12.
It's the thrill of it----cloak and dagger refrigeration work.
  
All of this can be said about painting, welding, and twisting wrenches--

The tools all cost money--and you have to have some idea how to use
them.

How does one learn?
By doing.
By screwing up.
By laying pigeon ca-ca welds on a flat panel--by blowing holes the size
of the Grand Canyon in sheet metal, by laying a run the size of a
tsunami tidal wave down the side of their vehicle.

And look how many out there are fumbling around trying to keep their
antiquated Buses running, and just discovered what a screwdriver is.

These responses to Arnaud's original post is kinda counter productive.
Instead of telling him what to do--you guys are telling him not to do.

AC work isn't that tough to master.
Neither is welding, or painting.

And so what if he does fail?
He learned something in the process.

Nobody has an inborn ability to do any task.


Nuts.
