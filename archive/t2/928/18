Subject: Re: [T2] Westy Bed Padding

Research foam nomenclature.  (Learn the difference
between 1823 foam, and 2347 foam.  Most craft stores
carry 15xx and lower- very low quality for padding or
upholstery.)  Select the grade you wish, and know the
dimensions.  Then buy it through an upholstery shop. 
An upholstery shop will be able to get the correct
brick of foam, at exactly the correct dimensions you
need.  You should plan to trim the foam down if there
are S curves or exotic shapes.  You can have the foam
supplier do exotic trimming, but you will pay exotic
prices for that trimming.  Good luck.
  
A supplier who is also into T2s?  William Thompson of
thecraftedcow(-at-)comcast.net.

PS:  18 of 1823 is a ratio/percentage.  23 is really a
hardness.  1823 can make a good top foam.  2347 is way
firmer, and is usually sandwiched underneath.
