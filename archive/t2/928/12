	The depletion continues as freons (& other ozone-destroying 
gases) float up into the stratosphere.  It is not in dispute among 
experts.   Newly-released freon will deplete the ozone layer after a 
decade or two.  The releasing has to stop!

	It's news to me that these are the estimates for the relative 
effectiveness in ozone-layer depletion.  But, supposing for the sake 
of argument that it is so, the answer is of course the solid moral 
principle that two wrongs don't make a right.

	I've been in environmental science since before this issue 
emerged, and have watched it go from 'fringe propaganda' thru to its 
current status as thoroughly respectable science.  The same creeps 
who drafted dismissive letters for Ministers of the Crown when I 
wrote about ozone-layer depletion 3 decades ago now get junkets to 
foreign confabs and have long since come to agree with the Nobel 
prizewinners who pointed out the catalytic destructiveness of freons 
(etc) on the ozone layer.

	Whatever the US EPA may say on other issues, on this it is 
representing solid science.  The extra flux of UV (especially at high 
latitudes e.g where I live) is proven, and the explanation is as the 
scientists agreed leading to the Montreal treaty to control 
ozone-depleting chemicals.

	For those few who are vague about these issues, note that 
ozone depletion is far more settled science than climate degradation 
which is still disputed by a handful of expert dissenters e.g Lindzen.

	BTW regarding refrigerants more widely: independent experts 
have agreed, since it became clear that freons should no longer be 
released into the atmosphere, that there are excellent alternatives. 
They are not directly substitutable into existing A/C, but new ones 
should have converted many y ago to designs using either ammonia, or 
carbon dioxide, or LPG  -  well proven refrigerants essentially 
straightforward to deploy.
