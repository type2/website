<<Fitting a second e-brake handle to allow the independant use of the
rear brakes is a good work-around and would probably be a lot less
costly than a limited-slip rear differential.>>

And Ya know what?

This does work--some of the time.

Mack Truck's have no rear end lock out on twin screw ( 2 drive axle)
semi's.
( single axles either )
They tell a guy to just touch the brakes when under power & going no
where to lock up the two opposite spinning axles.

It works --but it all depends on what kinda surface your on--and how
buried you are in the mud, or snow.

Then without an air lock up rear end, the driver is doomed.


Sanders.

Now we're talking about an accessory of days gone by---
 
They worked well, and If I ain't mistaking they were an available
accessory for automotive  vehicles.

Only problem was with them was keeping the sand dry so it would drop in
the front of the wheels when you needed some tracation.

I think Warshawsky's had them in their catalog for auotomotive / Bus
use.

I used to see them all the time on truck from out west, that have come
from over  "The Pass" and UPS semi's had them on everything.
