Rick,

You've hit on the exact problem on the freeways.....

I absolutely *hate* being behing a truck or humongo SUV...even in my daily 
driver sedan....

The reason....

I can't see didly when behind someone in an overbuilt dodge ram 
1500000....all I can see is his rear end at 85mph....and when ya back off, 
then some 16 year old with no experience gets right in between us and 
rides the guy's bumper....as someone said...it's either 85mph or zero.

That's probably why people want *not* to be behind you...even at 85mph.

just ranting....done with it now.

Cheers, dave
