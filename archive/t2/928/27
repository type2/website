<<Hmmm... according to Wikipedia.org, Freon is indeed a trademark of
DuPont, but it can be used to describe CFC-10, CFC-11, CFC-12 (R-12),
CFC-14 and a couple of others. 
So... I guess we should all be more specific to avoid confusion. :-)>>


Arnaud would have been more correct using the word refrigerant than
Freon.
A small miniscule error.

I knew where he was going as he is pretty new to the technological
correctness of AC terminology.

If he asked for Kleenex I wouldn't have handed him a brick, or if he
asked for Jello I wouldn't have given him a tire, just because the exact
name brand product wasn't around.
I knew what he was tryin to say, because of the vintage of the Golf.

A small slip of the lip -- and Humpty Dumpty goes bonkers.
