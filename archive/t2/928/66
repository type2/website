Yes, (to quote your statement) You CAN raise the rear
end with destroying the CV joints! I raised mine
slightly more (I thought) than eliminating the sag.
The suspension TOPPED out over any little dip and the
new set of CV's was junk in about 6 months. There is
already waaaayyyy too much air under there - what do
you hope to accomplish? It seems to me you are taking
a number of negatives related to our vehicles and
expanding upon them! The bad aspects of T2 handling
will be increased tremendously with your plan. I
really would like to know what the goal is! -BaH
