There are many engineers on this list.  Have you had formal training in 
refrigeration systems?

I side with Terry.  I can't believe I'm saying that.  :-)

That's an opinion - one that is by no means unanimous.

The oil is not "special" - PAG and Ester are available everywhere, and 
without a license.  I, a mere software engineer who took the basic ME 
classes, was able to successfully convert an old bus to run on 134a. 
How is that possible?  Answer:  Because it's not that difficult.  Think 
about it - many people on this list have rebuilt their own engines... do 
you think that is easier than working on an A/C system?  Not in my book.

New dryer.  Same as you would do with any major repair.  I used my old 
expansion valve and while it may not be the *optimal* solution, it does 
work fairly well.

Sorry, I don't buy it.  You want to know what's bad for mother Earth? 
Logging in the Stanislaus National Forest.  What else?  Paving over the 
entire North American continent (okay, I'm exaggerating... slightly).

If you're worried about the "illegal" part of it, getting the license is 
VERY easy.  Pay a small fee, study a few questions, take a test.  Anyone 
who has attended high school has been through that drill many times.

Yes, screw it up so you will waste 5 quarts of new transmission fluid 
and 100lbs of now worthless metal parts that will end up in a landfill. 
  How bad is that for the environment?

   Go ahead- work on your CP-091

See above.

See above.  Everything has an impact, and many people snowed by 
mountains of  well-intentioned but misguided rules and regulations do 
not realize it.  If you really care about the environment, you should be 
riding a bike, train or city bus to work, or at least retrofit a 
catalytic converter to your bus... how many of us have done that?

Now let's cut Arnaud some slack and help him with his A/C system, 
instead of criticizing him.  Thanks.
