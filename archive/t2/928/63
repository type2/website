I didn't need to swap the nosecone, just bellhousing, old starter, and trans input shaft is about 1/2" shorter.  I don't have the exact ratios in front of me but my old top speed was about 65mph (indicated).  My new top speed with 091 is about 85mph (indicated).  Someone can probably look up the ratios but it was definitely more than 5%.  Perhaps the reinforced tires added to the effects.

these are good reasons for a stronger engine.  when I was working on the 
1776 I had a fresh 1600DP for about 6 weeks (thanks to phil cain).  It 
worked OK but with stock power was a little doggy getting up to speed.
