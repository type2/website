	If you're *really* close behind, you can save bulk fuel  -  *and
8 cruise faster than your max.
	That was my discovery in driving my splittie from Vancouver 
to Berkeley in the fall of '64.  Cruising flat-out (63 mph if I 
recall correctly), let a big square-ended truck pass you by a small 
margin, and nip in right behind his rear end.  The large eddy zone 
sucks you along  -  you ease off your fuel, and cruise at 70 !
