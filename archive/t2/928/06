Subject: Re: [T2] does the rear defrost ever work??

For the bus, learn to use the outside mirrors- I drove witht the rear 
curtain closed plenty as daughter watched TV in back. As for heat, Hang 
a barrier behind you to keep heat in the front cab; close/block the rear 
vent outlet if no passengers.
...Speaking of workarounds, in our 68 bug the total rot-out of the heat 
tubes under the step runners led me to lift the rear seat up and tap 
into the "Y" on each side'-flatten/block the y side to the runners and 
use flexible vent tubing (the same stuff for connecting the fan housing) 
from the Y leading out from rear seat- one tube went under the driver 
seat to the front along the door runner (inside). along the side of the 
dash to a piece of DWV 1.5" pipe drilled to alow the heat to diffuse up 
to the windshield and keep it defrosted.  The other side I split to let 
some go against rear window and the other to terminate below passenger 
seat.  Real toasty.
