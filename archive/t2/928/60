Some Beetle cases can be machined to have the mustache bar bolted directly
on. Otherwise, buying a new universal case and building that up is what I
did - you'll save a few bucks, and also know it's done right (as long as
you trust yourself)
For that matter, I have a couple old bus cases kicking around the house
that might be good with a line bore...you're welcome to take a look some
evening...I'd probably let one go cheap...
