 Hi!  I have , what I believed was a '74 Westy.  It
 has the orange "stuff"
 inside, with icebox, etc.  But after "surfing"
 Samba, I see other American
 "same types" with different color interior,
 different type cabinerty, etc.
 They don't look like D. A. H. (do at home), jobs! 
 Excuse my confusion, but
 can someone please tell me what my Westy had stock!
 And it would entail a great amount of work to
 cahnage from stock to some of
 "those".
