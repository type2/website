Subject: Need Better Freeway Gears

Doug,
      Maybe this isn't the place to address the question, but it is a Friday...
so here goes.  I think the average speeds at which people-in-general are 
driving (on Interstate highways in particular) have increased.  It is not 
seemly to do an indicated 55 on a 55-limit road.  Yes, I know about speedo 
error.  What I see well exceeds any 10% effect.  I think many motorists have 
got the idea their relative 'invulnerability' is at a new high, perhaps due to 
anti-lock brakes, stability controls, air bags, etc.  Bottom line, I am not 
comfortable driving any vintage VW on freeways -- except at times when no one 
would be expect a need for speed, that is, getting to work (let's say).  Sorry 
for the pessimism, but IMHO the wonderful air cooled VW products are no longer 
suitable as daily drivers, if you have to drive on roads posted above 50 mph.  
Just my 2" worth...... Glenn

Is it feasible to install a bigger ring & pinion in the stock 71 tranny?
Can it be done w/ out removing the tranny or is that a stupid idea?
