Did you take a look at:  http://www.type2.com/library/camper.htm ?  Near the
bottom of the page is some information on identifying camper layouts.

As well, there were a variety of Westfalia layouts - a subset of them were
imported to the USA/Canada.  You may want to take a look at your m-codes to
see where your camper originally came from:  http://www.type2.com/m-codes/
I think these will also tell you what camper layout it originally came with.
