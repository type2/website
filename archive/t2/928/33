Subject: vacume advance

hey all , i have a FI  2.0L, and it looks like the PO had put on a 009
mechanical advance distributor, as opposed to the 050 vacume advance, now
joh Muir says you cant do this, but it seems to be running fine, the dwell
is at 53, just a smidge over where id like it, its not hot, but it does chug
gas, 18mpg, and at first start its like its running on 3 cylinders, is anyof
this related?
i still have the 050 vacume advance. should i replace the 009? with the
pertronix in the 050?
ty in  advance  JSC
