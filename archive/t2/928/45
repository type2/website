Subject: What engine in my 77? GD or CJ ??

While looking online for a gascap for my 77 Canadian Westy, Rockauto asked me for either the 2.0 GD or 2.0 CJ engine. I didn't realize two engines were offered in 77. Which would I have, and what are the diffs?? While I'm at it, who's got a stock gascap for sale?? My daughter left ours at the gas station >:-( and of course it's gone.
