I did not know the technical nomenclature of the
various foams available.  Foam seen at craft stores
was too thin and too soft.  I had a friend in the
upholstry business for 20 years get my new foam.

If you want to do it yourself, try trimming the foam
with an electric carving knife.

Last July, I was able to un-staple the original seat
covering (gold cloth) in my SO42 interior.  Machine
washed it twice on the delicate cycle.  Twice, because
the first time the wash water looked like coffee. :-P
Clothesline dried the covers.  Then I handed off the
plywood seat bases and the covering to my friend. He
took it from there, finishing the job for $120.
