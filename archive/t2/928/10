Hey Cliff, I do worry about releasing CFC gases. As a matter of fact I
paid 35$ to have the R134a in the system discharged before starting
the R&R. I came home sick though because I was convinced that the guy
had no equipment to do the job and released it in the air. Who knows,
I should have stayed there.

Like I said, the Golf is a 1995, hence it does not use R-12 because it
was illegal in new cars by then. Notice that I carefully avoid
mentioning a date when R-12 was made illegal to avoid being corrected
by those who know.

I just got my gauges in the mail and the box reads "Complete
diagnostic & service gauge set for use on AC systems with R134A
freon". I guess the chinese are also confused by the DuPont copyrights
and hence abuse the word.

With all that being said, within two days I will release about 1/3 lb
of R134a in the air when i will vacuum the system before charging !
