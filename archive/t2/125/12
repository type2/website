Subject: GEX Engine

A friend of mine just bought a pretty nice bus.
When I found out about it, after the fact, is when I found out the engine 
to be a newly installed GEX 1600DP.

I have no experience with same, but have read posts from others on the subject:

Well, anyway, my first inspection of the bus was when I told him to:
Change the oil (30W) every 300 miles of the first 1500 miles,
Then go to a 1,000 mile change twice before
Settling into a regular 2,000 change cycle.
At that time, we would start to adjust for the warmer Texas Summer climate 
and go to straight 40W oil.

I changed his oil for him when I first saw the bus, and it came out with a 
sheen that indicates the rings are seating themselves.  No contaminants 
visible.

The engine looks very nice.
It does not drip oil.
The exhaust is bug style.
Engine sounds fine, runs fine, etc.

I asked him to drop it off with me today so I could check the valves before 
he drives it to Louisiana this weekend for a crawfish boil. That trip will 
be over 8 hours of driving in the round trip.

The engine has very few (approx. 1,000) miles on it.
I recorded what I found with the valve adjustment(s). ....... As follows:

Rocker arm nuts: 1 slightly under torqued & 1 proper torque value on each 
assembly.

Heads: Did not check torque #

Initial valve readings were:
(4th place decimal is interpolated)
1 Inlet = .0085
1 Outlet = .0045
2 Inlet = .008
2 Outlet = .006
3 Inlet = .010
3 Outlet = .006
4 Inlet = .009
4 Outlet = .010

I set all valves to .006.

Valve covers do not leak and the gaskets seat well with no adhesive or 
corruption to their install methodology.

I found no valves to be tight, as you will note, and the oil still remains 
clean with no material contaminants visible.

The engine appears to be proper from my minimal observations to date.
