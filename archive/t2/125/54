You can punch a 2" hole in a VW 15/1600 diesel piston using ether as
starting fluid.  On Bob's big ole Detroit diesel's maybe not, but it isn't
wise for most car diesels.  There is a wonderfully safe alternative, WD-40
will start and run a VW diesel quite nicely, ideally a warm can of WD-40
that aerosolizes well but not critical.  In high school I drove the '76 bus or
a '78 diesel Rabbit with about 250k miles on it, in WV in the winter WD-40
or a hill were my best friends.  And on real cold nights at 1:00 am after
closing at Ponderosa there was always getting a friend to bumper me
around the parking lot till I could start it when I ran out of the WD-40 or
didn't want to stand outside in the 30mph wind.
