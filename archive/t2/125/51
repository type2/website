??? I owned a bus company and we had up to 17 buses, it gets pretty cold
around these parts and we used cases of starting fluid all winter and we
just sprayed it into the air cleaner.   never did damage any of those old
Detroit's that I'm aware of.  and these were "MY" buses so I didn't want
em damaged as I would have to pay for the repair.

now bringing it back to VW Buses,  I have used starting fluid on very cold
mornings to get my 2L going.  usually just a quick spray onto the air
filter.
