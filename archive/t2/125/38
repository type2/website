Subject: BN4 Pics, diagrams

Does anyone know of a place or person that has a wiring diagram for the late model BN4 heater, the fuel metering style. I want to double check all the wires under the cover to make sure everthing is where its supposed to be, but haven't located any diagrams or info about the wires actually on top of the heater. Just how to wire it to power/switches. Or does anyone have some good pics at different angels of the late model heater I could check out?

Thanks,
Casey
