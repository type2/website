Went to school for 4 years, and have a degree in automotive. Do not use e=
ther starting fluid, you can cause major engine damage to your motor. VW =
engines are not made to run on ether. This will put major strain on rods,=
 crank, ect. Best bet is to use some carb cleaner. In school, we used to =
use a small propane tank with a tube, and a valve to check for vac leaks.=
 I'm not so sure thats too good either. Carb cleaner should not hurt the =
engine in the least. Starting fluid is generally made for diesel engines.=
 Their rods are made for high compression. A VW is not. I may be mistaken=
 but this is what I learned in college.
