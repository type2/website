Hiya Justin,

As has been mentioned the "correct" VDO dash clock for your application is 
the 3 inch blackface clock.  Look for the second hand, it is unique to this 
clock.  The price ranges given by other posters are pretty representative of 
what's out there.  

However, I do have a piece of additional advice.  If confronted with an 
expensive "guaranteed-to-be-running" clock versus an inexpensive "it was 
running the last time it was in a Bus" clock - go for the expensive one.  
Many people selling these things will tell you that it was running when they 
pulled it.  That is exactly the same as saying, "It ain't running."  It costs 
a small fortune to fix these things and there aren't that many clock shops 
which will take on an automotive clock.  

The short of it is that a busted clock will cost you more to get running than 
one in good health.
