Subject: Re: [T2] GEX Engine

I have a GEX motor in my squareback. I didn't buy it , it came with the car.
Don't bother changing the oil or doing any other maintenance. All that extra
money spent on tune ups will be needed for a new motor =)

BTW , It has less than 10,000 miles on it and has 2 pulled head studs and a
pulled exhaust on cylinder 2 and it leaks oil like nuts, has no
power...................... and yes I did routine maintenance until
recently.
 Later,
 Bryan
