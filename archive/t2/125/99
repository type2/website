Subject: Re: [T2] Re: CDI Install Trouble

Guys, I've been running the Tiger 581 CDI on my ' 78 FI 2.0L Westy, Coupled 
with a Pertronix Ignitor, for three years now. When I ordered it I talked to 
one of the tech's at Universal Corp. and he built a driver for the FI trigger 
and tach into the box. When I got it, it was plug and play. I'd check with 
whomever you bought it from and make sure it was compatible with FI. They 
make the CDI in two configurations, one for carbed apps and a different one 
for FI.
Hope this helps,
Robert
