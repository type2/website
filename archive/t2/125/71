We don't use starting fluid on any Mercedes car diesels. The engine won't
start if we do. The starting fluid washes the oil off the walls and rings and
compression goes by-by. You can hear the cranking speed double!. If we get one
towed-in that has had starting fluid sprayed in it, we have squirt a light oil
in it, i.e. ATF, to get the compression back up.
