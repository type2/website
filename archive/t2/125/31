No, a diesel works by compressing air until it's hot enough to ignite light
oil, then injecting some. There is no fuel in the cylinder on the
compression stroke.

You can use starting fluid on a diesel, but you must have a starting fluid
injection kit on the engine. Just squirting it into the air intake from a
can, like you do on a gas engine, will blow the engine up.
