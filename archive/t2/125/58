>I hate to drive this thing into the ground, but I am
becoming a bit concerned. The VW number for my
distributer was wrong as I reported it. the correct
number is 311 905 205T. The number that apparently
doesn't exist: 0 231 167 014 is the correct number
that is stamped into the body of my distributer. I
tried to look it up myself and I agree: it doesn't
exist. Karl, I will email you a photo of this thing
that may help identify it as I do not know how to set
up a link for everyone. (This photo, showing the
numbers, will also hopefully prove that I am not
insain or dyslexic) If this is not the right
distributer for my bus, am I in danger of toasting my
valves or something? Also, what distributer (that is
compatible with my bus) do most recommend?

No, you are not nuts or insane.....you do have a 014 on your dist. The 311
number leads me to believe it is a type3 dist. But the T does not show up. If
it is a type3 it would have to be pre-FI because FI distributors have trigger
points in the base. You do not have a cover on the other side, do you?
A 1500S with twin carbs before Aug 65 has a 311 905 205D.
A 1500S with twin carbs from Aug 65 has a 311 905 205F.

Here is the correct dist. for your bus:

Bus & Pickup 1975-Early 1976 * 1800 (75), 2000 (76) Manual Trans
