Subject: Re: [VB] Rev Limiting Rotors

dont these only start to work at like 5500 rpm's or something?  you would
have to be deaf not to know that you should let your foot off the pedal at
that point, that is if your poor engine doesnt go first.  as far as i know
they are for porsches and drag racers.  let me know if you find them with a
lower cut off, say 3400 or something.  id be interested in those.
