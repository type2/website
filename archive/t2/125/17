Subject: Re: [T2] hissing noises!!!

Hi Matty,

Get some starting fluid from your local FLAPS, the kind that you spray into 
carbs to make stubborn engines start.  With the engine running, spray some 
in the area where the hissing noise is coming from.  If you have a vacuum 
leak, the engine will increase RPMs as it sucks in the starting fluid.  Once 
you determine that it is a vacuum leak, you can pinpoint the spot by 
spraying the fluid (thru a straw like the one that comes with a can of 
WD-40) on each of the vacuum hoses and seeing which one makes the engine rev 
up.

There are lots of hoses in there, and twice as many connections, each of 
which can leak and hiss.  Fortunately, vacuum hoses are relatively cheap, 
and you can improve your engine's performance by sealing all the holes.

Good Luck!
