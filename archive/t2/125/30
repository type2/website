--Justin,

68-72 ones have silver trim circle in the center typical of the center of the speedo and idiot lights.

73-79 ones are solid black and generally run 40-80 bucks on ebarf.

I say 40 cuz I picked up a beautiful one for that amount only to have it stolen out of a big wooden crate which my speakers where mounted in, presumably the speakers were converted to meth and my clock's in a dumpster. Angry rant over.

the 2 1/8" size is for a different vw or an aftermarket console. the vdo ones of which you speak are for the 3" (+/-) hole next to the speedo.
