Hiya Mick,

A little tip in installing the seals.  Place them in their grooves WITHOUT 
any adhesive.  Check for a good fit.  And drive around for a few days like 
that.  They will not fall out or cause you any other big-time problems.  In 
those few days the seals will "adjust" around so that there are no tight 
spots or areas in which they are all bunched up.  Then take your adhesive 
(3-M is good stuff) and glue them in without removing the entire seal from 
its groove.  Just do sections about 12 to 18 inches at a time.  Your seals 
will like you for this.  And you'll like the results.
