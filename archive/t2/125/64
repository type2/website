Subject: RE: [VB] Rev Limiting Rotors

  The lowest RPM one I have ever found is 4500 RPM. These are not a special
item. They came stock on early Volvo's and BMW's and I'm sure other European
cars. More dealers and/or shops replaced them due to a high failure rate and
causing detonation problems when the rotor shorted out to stop spark.  Safer
to buy a rev limiting CDI box then a rev rotor, just my opinion.  
  I think John at www.aircooled.net sells these or go to Tigers web site
direct

regularly tach out at 5500

dont these only start to work at like 5500 rpm's or something?  you would
have to be deaf not to know that you should let your foot off the pedal at
that point, that is if your poor engine doesnt go first.  as far as i know
they are for porsches and drag racers.  let me know if you find them with a
lower cut off, say 3400 or something.  id be interested in those.
