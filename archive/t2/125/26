Richard,

Since I have been giving out the HELP SMOG number( 1-800-544-4357 ) I should 
give credit where it is due. The info came from a T2 post (Date: Wed, 14 Feb 
2001 09:45:09 -0700 From: "Sean Garrett") to our list.

As to Texas smog its been too many years.  I do know they have a safety 
check (yearly?)that can uncover all those little items you are going to fix 
someday. Califorina has a check for incoming used cars where they look at 
the VIN numbers etc. They may look at horn, brake lights, stuff I don't know 
for sure.

Califorina used to have ~$300 or so charge for 76 and newer cars that were 
not up CAL standards. They were forced to refund that a few years ago. The 
idea seemed to be that they would accept the out of state lower standards 
but sombody had to pay (guess who).

There was a story in the T2 archives that said a 79 bus was going to be 
junked because of the lack of a correct filler neck. I take it that it was a 
CAL bus because if you paid a fee to get an out of state bus into CAL they 
could not fault you for not having  a CAL compliant bus.

Good Luck

Chuck
