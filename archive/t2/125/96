Well, you might change the oil a few times.  My first and last GEX engine
lasted 40K miles in a well-maintained bug.  If this bus engine lives up to
the GEX standard, you will have a year or so to save up for the new
engine.

GEX still owes me the Bentley manual that was a "bonus" when buying an
engine.

Just be glad that you don't have to get a core deposit back from them!  :)
