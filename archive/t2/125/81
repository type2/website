I must be missing somehing here---

Perhaps somethng was lost in translation 

Who's talking about running on ether?

I'm talking about, giving an engine a snort to fire it up in severe
cold---not running on the stuff !!!

The Bus wouldn't be funny at all--it would be a bomb !!!

Later,

Terry

Ok, leave it up to me to start and continue controversy. I guess I must
be good at it. I had mentioned before that I received a degree in
Automotive technologies. In school my instructors, who also happen to be
ASE certified, and have masters degrees in Auto, and race funny cars,
explained like this; When you are building an engine, a race engine, if
the car is going to run on gas, you build it one way. Now take a look at
the internals of an alcohol burning engine. The rods are much beefier,
pistons are stronger, heads are modified, and the crank is or should
definitely be forged, and not cast. Can we agree that ether is more
volatile than gas? Can we agree that the octane is much higher? Just
look at engines made to run on fuels like this. They are race engines.
VWs by design were not specifically designed to run on this kind of
fuel. Moderation? That's relative, propane in a plastic spud gun?
Craaaaazy! I guess I may value my body parts more than most! If you feel
like using ether in your gas engine feel free, but if I am going to pay
someone $1600 for a new long block, I think I will stick to what Jim
Budreau, ASE certified, master technician, and builder, and racer of
funny cars told me. I figure someone who has a masters degree in this
area, and builds race engines should be the one I trust. To each his
own, and good luck! Maybee you could design an ether injection system on
your bus and have you a funny bus. I think I will keep mine serious! =A0
