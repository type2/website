EEEEEEEK!!
I would be very careful with that stuff!!
I have had CAA ( the canuck version of AAA) drivers refuse to use that, or
be near a car that it's being used on.
Turns out that stuff is REALLY flammable. Like all explosives, take great
care if you're gonna do this trick.

Hi Matty,

Get some starting fluid from your local FLAPS, the kind that you spray into
carbs to make stubborn engines start.  With the engine running, spray some
in the area where the hissing noise is coming from.  If you have a vacuum
leak, the engine will increase RPMs as it sucks in the starting fluid.  Once
you determine that it is a vacuum leak, you can pinpoint the spot by
spraying the fluid (thru a straw like the one that comes with a can of
WD-40) on each of the vacuum hoses and seeing which one makes the engine rev
up.

There are lots of hoses in there, and twice as many connections, each of
which can leak and hiss.  Fortunately, vacuum hoses are relatively cheap,
and you can improve your engine's performance by sealing all the holes.

Good Luck!
