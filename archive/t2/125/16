     I pulled some out of a bus in a junkyard a few months ago.  It was a lot easier than I expected because the
   radio had been removed.  I used a screwdriver with a long thin shaft that fit through the slots that the levers
   travel.  The tip of the blade was thin enough to slip under the flat cap of the rivet.  I think I also used a long
   nose pliers to compress the prongs on the other end of the rivet.  A little squeezing with the pliers and a twist
   with the screwdriver was all that it needed.  I got them out in less than ten minutes. 

   You don't have to worry about damaging the rivets because you don't need to put them back.  Levers work fine
   without them
