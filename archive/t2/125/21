Subject: painting suggestions?

I'm still not even near enough to buy the paint, but here's a question
for those who have painted their bay window busses. How did you paint
the area behind the air inlet grille? More specific that area that you
see when you look through these vents. Mine doesn't look that terrific
& it looks like a huge pain to get paint there w/out totally covering
the outer shell w/ paint.
