The 311 905 205T/0231 167 014 distributor fits Type 3 1600 with Dual Carbs
70-72, Manual Transmission, European market only.  Distributor probably
came with a "turn key" engine from Europe back in the 80's when it was the
rage to buy a "good" used complete engine from outfits like the now defunct
ECI.  Could have been from a privately imported vehicle too.  Some volks
were privately bringing in late model Notchbacks around then as well.

Takes a Dual Vacuum Advance/Retard Can, so it would appear it's timed at 5
degrees AFTER TDC, as most are, but don't take that as gospel.  A few were
timed at 0 TDC.  I don't have any other references on this distributor
other than the Factory Parts Book as to what it was originally installed on.

Go with the distributor Karl recommends, you'll be much happier.
