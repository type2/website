Subject: VDO clock

Volks,

I've always thought it strange that my 78 Westy Deluxe didn't come with a
clock... but after seeing one
on a listmember's page, I decided I must have one!

That being, what clocks will work? I did a quick search of E-*ay, and found
"VDO clock VW" a wide-ranging search, resulting in $10-$100 tags... one is 2
1/8" and claims to fit VW, Audi and Volvo. Is this true? Someone pls point
me in the right direction, so I don't go off half-cocked and buy some crap
that won't work.

Cheers!
