Subject: Re: CDI Install Trouble

Nick,

The fuel injection ECU uses a signal from the points to tell it when each
ignition event occurs. This ECU input requires a spike that is taller than
12 volts - with a points/coil setup you get a spike that is sufficient -
with the CDI in the circuit the points doesn't drive the coil directly so
this spike does not occur and so the ECU does not see any ignition events.
One solution that I have seen work is to hang an extra coil off the points -
it's only purpose is to create the much needed voltage spike for the ECU.

I have the same problems with my bus currently - I haven't put on the extra
coil patch since I am in the process of replacing my stock FI with an
aftermarket DIY kit.
