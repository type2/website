Matty,

I agree with Karl 100%.   In addition, the sound of air "leaking" between
the idle adjustment screw and the throttle butterfly can really fool you.

Really the only way to tell that you have a vacuum leak is to hook up a
vacuum gauge and see what it says.  Before  you do, iit is always a good
idea to set dwell, timing and idle speed.  Then plug in the gauge and see
if you  have 15+  inches of vacuum.  If you do, then nothing is seriously
leaking.

A vacuum leak will usually not cause a loss of power, at least not
directly. It will cause your engine to run leaner and thus hotter, and
once you  burn a valve or punch a hole in a piston, well, *then* you have
a definite loss of power, but fixing the leak will not cure it.
