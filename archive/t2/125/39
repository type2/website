Hiya Dave,

Ditto what George said.  The rear hatch seal is (by far and away) the most 
likely culprit.  And it is often not the actual fault of the seal but that of 
the rear hatch itself.  On mine for example, a simple adjustment to the rear 
hatch stopped the leak immediately.  If, by chance, the seal and the hatch 
appear to be OK, look hard at the rear window seal.  That little beast was 
also leaking in my Bus.
