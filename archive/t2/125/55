Subject: Re: [T2] Timing questions

I hate to drive this thing into the ground, but I am
becoming a bit concerned. The VW number for my
distributer was wrong as I reported it. the correct
number is 311 905 205T. The number that apparently
doesn't exist: 0 231 167 014 is the correct number
that is stamped into the body of my distributer. I
tried to look it up myself and I agree: it doesn't
exist. Karl, I will email you a photo of this thing
that may help identify it as I do not know how to set
up a link for everyone. (This photo, showing the
numbers, will also hopefully prove that I am not
insain or dyslexic) If this is not the right
distributer for my bus, am I in danger of toasting my
valves or something? Also, what distributer (that is
compatible with my bus) do most recommend?
