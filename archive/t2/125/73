Karl,

I'm talking about a "shot" of vitamin E, not giving the engine a bath
with it, as most wild men would do---and I've seen many a wild man
giving an engine a big bath with the stuff--hydro locking the engine's
up----

A snort wouldn't wash all the lube off the cylinder's-----how could it?

 A Benz is a horse of a different color anyway---:>)
 

Later,


Terry

starting fluid 
From: "Terry K." 
Automatic ether injection set-ups are available as an option, on all
diesel engine's----as a cold start package, from all truck mfg's. (
Mack. Freightliner, Pete, KW, Volvo/GMC, Ford, Sterling, Hendrickson,
FWD, Navistar,Western Star, Oshgosh ) 
We don't use starting fluid on any Mercedes car diesels. The engine
won't start if we do. The starting fluid washes the oil off the walls
and rings and compression goes by-by. You can hear the cranking speed
double!. If we get one towed-in that has had starting fluid sprayed in
it, we have squirt a light oil in it, i.e. ATF, to get the compression
back up.
