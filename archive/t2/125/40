In the 71 bus I had, lowering the trans with the engine allows one to
reach behind the tall fan housing to get at the upper 2 nuts.  The trans
I rested on a concrete block with plywood shims.  In the 78, I never
touched the trans mounts, and only have to remove the shrouding around
the rear and the oil filler neck and bend the pipe a bit (or remove it)-
after removing the throttle attached air inlet hosing.  Most problems
I've seen relate to the angle of the enginge going in and out compared
to the trans- Make sure the trans (bus) is level with the floor that the
rolling jack is on, or you'll have to muck with changing the height of
the jack as you separate/reinstall.  This happens automatically in a 71
with just the rear jacked up a bit, but in the 78, I jack up the front
until it is level.
