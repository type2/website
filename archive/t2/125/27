WD-40 is an effective non-flammable compression leak tool.
You can also use brake parts or carb aerosol cleaner.
Starting fluid is extremely dangerous for this application.
A fog of starting fluid is very explosive.

this is what I learned in  college.

A diesel engine works by compressing kerosene ( or fuel oil ) until it explodes.
Starting fluid is too volatile all by itself, and will destroy a diesel immediately.
A more correct starting fluid for a diesel engine would be WD-40 !
