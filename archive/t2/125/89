Subject: automatics for sale in OH

Hello all,
      Below is the listing for my automatic buses that I'm selling.  I'm
starting to hear it from the city for what they call "abandoned" vehicles.
I just don't have the space or time and my focus is shifting to my 71
crewcab.  So if anyone has any questions just pmail me and I'll send info.
There are some pics available on the samba but I've got plenty more I can
send out.  I'm located in Kent, OH.  I also have a "running" 2L motor with
all the FI components, wiring harness and gas tank that needs a new home.
Also a complete working BA6 gas heater too.  Thanks, Marcus

$1000 obo 74 VW Bus automatic without motor or tranny. The body is straight
and clean. If you can find a CLEANER Baywindow Bus in the rust belt call me
I want to see it. Interior is complete in excellent shape, headliner is nice
and dash is perfect, uncut and unmolested. 76 VW automatic with transmission
and 2L FI motor. The 76 is missing the fuel pump and starter. I don't know
the condition of the motor. The 76 is rough missing windows and parts of
interior, i.e. seats. I also have a spare automatic transmission that goes
with the whole deal. I really need to make these leave my driveway. I'm open
to all sorts of trades i.e. rust free crewcab gates(yah right!) KG parts,
upright motors but nothing with wheels my driveway is only so long! Email me
for more info and pics.
