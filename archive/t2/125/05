This is what I understand. This does not keep the DMV from sniffing you out 
as a gross polluter as you drive by.

Here is the story. You can't pass CAL smog with a "tampered" fuel filler 
neck. Now if you or the PO drive away from a pump without removing the fuel 
nozzle the filler restrictor can be torn and fall under the "tampered" 
category. This is a eyeball test. Heck technically they could fine you I 
guess.
The restrictor is to keep you from using leaded gas and poisoning the CAT 
converter ( required for my 77 bus but not required for FED 49 state 77 
models).
My restrictor was torn and only the FED version was available at a 
reasonable price ~$20. I was quoted $150 if they could find one at SMOG HELP 
(1-800-544-4357 Darron I believe was his name).

I put in the FED version 211 201 199 I think the CAL version is 211 201 
199B. Replacing this part CAL or FED is not fun. The smog tech looked into 
my filler and marked me down for a tampered fuel restrictor (FED version).

So here's what I did. I cut the hood off the damaged CAL filler neck, closed 
the torn restrictor hole by tightening a wire tie around it (it looked 
good). I left the opening lip attached to the trimmed and closed restrictor. 
I removed the metal flange from the fuel opening, applied a coat of Vas to 
the trimmed CAL neck and shoved it into the FED neck. I replaced the flange 
(4 screws) and passed smog.

I warned you it was a long story.
