Subject: Re: [T2] hissing noises!!!

From: "Matty Kirk"
>today i spent some time checking out the bus. nothing
serious, however i was running the engine, and i
noticed hissing noises come from the rear of the
engine(that is, the side closest the the rear bench
seat and gas tank). what the?!  im thinking-
     power loss + hissing noises = vacuum leaks

am i on target here? how can i determine the source? i
moved my hand around a bit in there trying to feel for
a leak, but there is so much air moving around in
there it is tough to pinpoint anything. as always any
help, hints, or insights on this scenario will be
greatly appreciated. thanks in advance.

Matty,
Do not get confused by the 'noise' of air moving thru the thin wall of the
plenum. The plenum is the black chamber on the top middle with the 4 intake
runners coming out of it. The wall is so thin, you will swear there is a
vacuum leak there....
