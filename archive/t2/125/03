Hi Mick,
The sliding door, rear hatch and engine lid seals all fit into a shaped grove which will hold the seal in place with out any glue at all.
The same is in thory true for the cab doors although its not very successful just below the windows at the front of the door.
Where seals have needed to be stuck I've used "Evo Stick" sucessfuly.

Good luck
