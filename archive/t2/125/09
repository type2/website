Well, I am glad that I am not the only one that didn't know this. Lou (my mechanic) was pretty =
harsh on me about this one "everyone knows that...", etc.

I think you are supposed to support the rear (bell housing side) of the trans with a jack during =
engine removal, then use a coathangar or something to support it once you have the engine out and =
the jack out. The idea is that by dropping the trans a few inches, the engine can kind of slide =
out at an angle.=20

I didn't do this, and I found that the muffler and top of the fan housing wanted to hit the body =
of the bus before the bottom studs were clear of the transmission. I guess if you removed the =
muffler and maybe the fan housing first then it would clear OK. It was only with a lot of wiggling =
and slightly damaging one of the trans holes that I got it out. The process did not look very =
professional. Maybe there is more than one way to do this correctly?
