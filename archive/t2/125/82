Subject: Re: [T2] BN4 Pics, diagrams

Thanks for the links Rob, but I need pics of the late model BN4, the heater manual is for the early model and the wiring will differ some.  I have checked all the articles in the library but need some good pics of the wiring from a couple different angles would help. Just want to make sure everything is hooked up right as I don't know why my heater isn't allowing the fan to run when the air gets to a given temp. Instead of the temp reg switch just cutting power to the fuel pump to allow the air to cool some while the blower continues to blow, mine is cutting power to the fan and fuel pump. It sits a few mins while it cools and then cranks back up. Heats good just not for very long.

Thanks
Casey
