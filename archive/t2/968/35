Hi Dave
My GPS fits right inside of the speedometer!  That is to say that it sits on 
top of the glass of the speedometer!
It is a Garmin etrex and I have had it for a couple of years!   I got it 
free with my Marlboro miles but in reality it probably was not free!
It tells the speed in mph or kilometers to the tenth of a mile or kilometer! 
Also will tell you your altitude above sea level so when you are camping in 
the mountains at 11000 feet why it would probably be best not to have that 
aforementioned cigarette!   The new ones do a lot more!   Google.com is your 
friend!
Rob
