I assume you meant to say that you have the 228mm flywheel.

5 rib is an 002 tranny that came in 74-75 busses.  6-rib is an 091 
tranny that came in 76-79 busses.

Will the tranny I have work with a 2.0 motor?

You talk as if you have a 5-rib but your bus originally came with a 
6-rib.  Either will work with a 2.0 motor.  If you are already using the 
  228mm flywheel then you must have the 091 bellhousing and starter so 
you are all set.  If you install a different 5-rib tranny be sure to use 
your existing bellhousing and not the one that comes on the tranny as 
the 002 bellhousing will not fit over the 228mm flywheel.

As Mark D. said, the 091 trannies are sought after because they are very 
strong and thus most suitable for use in high-hp applications such as 
dune buggies and VW quarter-milers.
