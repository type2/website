Subject: RE: [T2] Fuel Pressure Check

Greg,

I just bought an actron from Checker yesterday. It works fine with the
universal adapter. You just have to block off one end of the tee fitting.

Your Westy doesn't have a screw-in pressure fitting (but it looks like it),
only a plug. There is just a regular press-on nipple like at both sides of
the rail. You use a regular piece of FI hose to the pressure tester.

The Actron unit registered exactly what the Bently describes, 35psi so it is
an adequate unit for the occasional test, IMO.

Jon
