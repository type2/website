Subject: Re: [T2] Need ac outlet block for 78 Westfalia

Installing a circuit breaker (15 amp is fine) along with a GFI outlet is an
excellent choice.

Originally in that 4.5 x 7.5 opening you describe is where a double outlet
with a circuit breaker was mounted on a metal panel that screwed into the
wood paneling.  These were made in USA by Delta Six Industries in
Chatsworth, CA a very, very long time ago.  These are pretty difficult to
find as few Westy's get parted out like your friend's apparently has been.

The outside 110VAC connector for the 74-79 Westy looked just like it's 80-91
Vanagon plastic counterpart except the casing was pot-metal with a bakelite
inside housing and was also manufactured by Delta Six as well.  These are
also hard to find, but I happen to have two of 'em (used) in case anyone's
interested.  Asking price is $35 including postage.
