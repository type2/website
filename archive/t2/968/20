Subject: Re: [T2] Window Removal

At the top of the Vent window is a philips screw.. it is hidden by the felt 
channel guide... pull down the felt,... then undo the screw.. then you can 
pull out the vent window.
once you have -all- the rest of the 10mm head bolts out,,  you can pull out 
the glass,, then you can take off the scraper

Hope that helps
