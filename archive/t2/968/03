Subject: 1981 Vanagon clutch slave cylinder removal

Hi All,



I have searched the archives and have not found an answer to this. I am
trying to remove the clutch slave cylinder from my 81 Vanagon. I have
undone the line, and removed the left (forward) bolt holding the unit.
How can I get a wrench on the bolt head on the right (rear) holding the
unit. The bracket is in the way on the bottom. Thanks for any help.



-Jeff
