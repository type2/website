Subject: RE: [T2] Cold Start Valve wiring... and more

DAVE PEARSON IS THE SMARTEST PERSON IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

First you show me how to hook up my $7.00 "stupid-proof" remote starter and
then you point out how to make my Westy run! What a great weekend this has
turned out to be!

Literally one turn of the starter and wham, like a kitten. Now to explain to
my neighbors why I was revving my bus, jumping around and laughing manically
without any liquor...

Thanks Dave! The next BBB (or anytime we meet) I owe you a keg, leg of lamb
or whatever... don't let me forget!

Jon
