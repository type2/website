 DAVE PEARSON IS THE SMARTEST PERSON IN THE WHOLE
 WORLD.  

I liked that so much that I thought it deserved another round.  Sorry, Dave.  Blushy Bussy.  Sorry, Richard.  Sorry, Karl. You're all in the running.  And Don, Mark, etc. etc.! So let the voting begin.  

Dumbest person in the whole world?  I challenge any of you Krautheads.    Cheers..KR
