Subject: Trannys

Out here near the left coast in the dry salvage yards it is extremely rare to see a bay window bus with a transaxle intact. They're gone as soon as the bus is put out. Saves a lot of work for Karl, the engine is on the ground, ready for hauling out or stripping of usable parts. The only exception is auto-tranny's and in one memorable instance a Synchro! I got the badge from that, some listees got the good stuff despite a nasty mud puddle. 
There must be a crew with good connections who come in and get 'em before we mosey by on weekends. They don't mangle anything when they pull 'em. Splitties are ignored by them but picked up by locals. 
We've seen this for 5 years or so. Bays in salvage yards are getting scarce as are Vanagons.

Oh, heard about a local farmer's estate sale this weekend. From what I heard a VW bus was modified into some kind of box making or assembling tool for a fruit packing shed. Parts went in one end and came out assembled.  Will look into it.
