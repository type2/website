To be honest, I'm not sure. I bought like three different sets of gauges off 
eBay before I was able to put together a set that I thought looked nice. The 
two lights both still blink together regardless of the direction I go, but I 
bought a set of dual relays that will make just the one flash for the 
direction it's turning.
