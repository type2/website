So if you've got gas and you've got gas under
pressure, then you're probably at the point where you
need to start thinking ignition. Do you have gas
returning to the tank now? Did you loosen the pressure
port and see if you've got pressure?

After that, you need to determine if your distributor
is triggering the injectors - OBTW, somebody a few
weeks back had the injector wire to the coil on the
wrong terminal so the ECU wasn't getting the trigger
signal for the injectors. -BaH
