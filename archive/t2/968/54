Hi Timo,

It is possible to remove the tank without dropping the engine. ALL of  
the FI parts will need to be removed in order to get enough  
clearance. But in my experience you may need to remove the rear  
hanger bolts and allow the engine to sag about an inch or so. I know  
that was the case with my 1.7L engine when I last dropped the tank in  
2000.

Once you have the FI removed and the firewall out, the rest is pretty  
simple. Strong and flexible hands are a big asset when working on the  
tank, it's not east to get at.

Happy Trails,
