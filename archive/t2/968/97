Subject: RE: [T2] oil stablizer

Personally, I don't like the thought of the oil crawling up all over
everything.  In the little Lucas displays, it looks to me like it makes the
oil foam.  Second, oil controll is a way of gaining horsepower visa vie
windage trays, glyptal painted lifter galleys, ect.  I use synthetic gear lube
because in every way I can measure it peforms better- quieter, smoother
shifting, less heat.  In the engine, regular oil changes and grey matter go a
long way to keeping an engine alive.JT Beaufort, SC
