	but it might mislead the young, so let's get this name right.
	Anodes are all positive.  The ions attracted to this 
electrode are negative  e.g OH-, Cl-, SO4--, and are called anions.
	(Similarly, cations  -  positive ions Na+, Ca++ etc  -  are 
those attracted to the other electrode, the cathode, which is 
negative.)
	These assignments go right back to ancient Greeks with names 
like Epaminondas rubbing fur on ebony etc. ...    The two signs of 
electric charge discovered in those primordial expts, positive & 
negative, have been arbitrarily named with this convention, long long 
ago.  It is far too late to change this naming convention; the 
electron is deemed negative and that's that (arbitrary tho' the 
original assignment was).  Anode means positive electrode; cathode 
means negative electrode.
