Subject: RE: [T2] Cold Start Valve wiring... and more

Oops, I tested 86b not 88b. They look awfully similar printed on that old
relay. 

Well, now the Double Relay checks out OK.
Fuel flow checks out OK.

Hmmmm. What next?

Thanks,

Jon

My test showed that with the ignition in the (2) position, there was no
power to terminal 88b. However, there is power to terminal 88b when I engage
the starter. Does this still mean the double relay is bad?

Getting closer...

Keyswitch "ON" Stick finger or screwdriver handle into AFM. No pump? No fuel
flow? Got Gas?
