the answer is a qualified "Maybe!"  I have done it and the engine ran fine
for years, but officially it is an absolute no-no.  once when desperate I
pulled one cyl and piston without even taking the engine out of the 78
bus.  was a pain and was probably dumb luck that I found one that was
close to balanced.  you can probably find a decent piston and cyl (get
match piston and cyl from same cyl)from an engine that blew one cyl itself
and has 3 servicable ones.  some considerations, when you lost a valve,,
did you do any other damage??  unless you are very lucky I would not
consider this type of repair a long term permanent fix, although I ran
mine for 4-5 years and over 75,000 miles like that.  check your head very
carefully

changing a cam changes so many other things that you probably were doing a
"test" just by running it, and the problem could have been from something
totally unconnected.

yes, I would do that first before the evidence is "tampered" with.

good luck
