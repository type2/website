Understood, Bob, but in this case, since it is suspended via the plastic
lens thru a rubber gasket, there is no (electrical) connection of the
fixture to the body at all.  I know that electrically it is immaterial which
is which and, as you say, custom would dictate that the collar be ground,
but....

Think back to electrolytic derusting.  The part you want to remove the rust
from is made the anode (negative) .  If I made the steel negative, over time
it would be slightly self-derusting.  The down side is that the bronze would
become the cathode and would be self-corroding, but that bronze is pretty
corrosion resistant and will,  all things being equal, long outlast the
steel.
