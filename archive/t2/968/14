Subject: Re: [T2] Home done frontend alignment

I got the right specs from Bentley and showed them to local tire dealer 
to do an alignment on our bus.......it's the one where they have to do 
some adjustment on the ball joints (camber?).  Toe in you can do 
yourself, find something you can telescope and mark, such as a dowel in 
a fitting tube or pipe- measure the distance between the rims at the 
front (9 o'clock) vs 3 o'clock.  Should be about 1/8" farther in the rear.

  I was just told that Canadian Tire couldn't do the alignment on my 70 bug

to do
  one on, so thought, what the heck, I'll do it myself.
