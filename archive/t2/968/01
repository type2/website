Subject: RE: [T2] Cold Start Valve wiring... and more

I now have gas. I just studied the wiring diagram and saw that the dual
relay is powered off of the shared wire to the reverse lights. My 68-71
brain just assumed that the wire was just for the reverse lights.

But even with the pump running through the AFM, it is still doing the same
thing (running only briefly).

I followed the Bentley's double relay test carefully and have come upon one
inconsistency.
From "To test relay function:"
3. "With the ignition turned to the running (2) position, apply the second
test probe to double relay terminal 88b. If no positive (+) battery current
reaches terminal 88b, the power relay is not closing and the double relay
should be replaced."

My test showed that with the ignition in the (2) position, there was no
power to terminal 88b. However, there is power to terminal 88b when I engage
the starter. Does this still mean the double relay is bad?

Getting closer...
