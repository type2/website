I'm doing a repair/return to servicability on a vehicle, I use Liquid Nails
construction adhesive and zip screws to attach flanged body panels.  We had a
vehicle that we had done a floorboard repair with this method 7 years prior
with no sign of cracking, corrosion, or problem of any kind.  Most of the time
welding has a lower sucess rate due to expertise of the welder, difficulty of
getting a perfect seal, imperfections and weak spots within the welds, and
there is always the problem of blowing holes in old sheet metal and
warping/shrinking.  Unless it's a show pony, do what works.  If you sell the
vehicle, let the buyer know what repairs were made, how, and why.  Get 'em
back on the road, keep 'em on the road, and if someone at the gas station
comes up to you and says, "Hey man, nice van." then you're on the right track.
My humble opinion.
