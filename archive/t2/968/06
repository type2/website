Subject: trannys

I just got back from Bugapalooza 07.  Lots of Bug stuff, almost no bus stuff.  Seems like there is less and less every year.  Anyway, one guy had several 091 trannys.  He wanted $450 guaranteed to work.   I'm looking for one that I can pick up for a hundred bucks or so (bad) that I can rebuild myself.  My '76 has a 1.7L motor in it but I know I have the 128mm flywheel.  I have a 2.0 motor that I want to build out.  And if I can pick up a good used 091 to build, that would be great.  What's the deal on 5-rib or 6-rib?  Will the tranny I have work with a 2.0 motor?  The guy told me that 78 and up uses the 6-rib.  What's the danged deal on these things??   I know these are dumb questions but I want to have an engine and tranny on the shelf ready to install when needed.  At a decent price.   And where's the place to buy tranny rebuild stuff?  Thanks....KR
