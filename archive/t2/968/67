Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel smell and replacing rubber filler neck

Hello Timo, I have done the filler neck replacement and I'm pretty sure
it's not necessary to remove the tank to do this. You pop the round
black plate by the air cleaner out for better access. I dropped my
engine to make it easier, you will need to be a contortionist if you
don't. Undo the clamps at at both ends of the rubber tube for removal,
and when re-installing get the filler neck and metal tube in position,
then feed the rubber tube back on the tank and the metal tube at the
same time (a little slip spray and twisting action helps). The biggest
problem was getting all the pieces to line up (filler neck rubber, metal
tube and rubber tube) so, when you pull it out, note the position of the
filler neck rubber on the metal tube and make sure the replacement goes
back on in the exact same orientation. I didn't do this and it took me 4
tries to get it right. Timo in Hawaii
