Subject: AIRS call - San Diego / Chula Vista

Volks,

I have a friend who is San Diego with a '79 bus, his dipstick tube boot is
bad and he has serious oil leak. He needs to find a shop with the boot, or a
repair place who can install it.

He is in Chula Vista RV Resort, 460 Sandpiper Way, Chula Vista, CA.

Email me directly and cc JEROME MAZIER cjmazier(-at-)rogers.com.

Thanks,

Scott Lyons
