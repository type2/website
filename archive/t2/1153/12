HI Mike,
        The vanagon electronic ignition system is very reliable. IMHO, if its
firing up to 3400 its working fine electrically. A coil swap would be a simple
test, but I think the rest is ok.  You could use an inline spark tester to
confirm you have good ignition up to 3400.  The ones that are held on to the
ign wire also work well enough.

Sounds like the very simple and reliable, (after the FI grounds are cleaned)
injection is working fine too.

However, that period Vanagon does still have mechanical advance in the dizzy. 
Which is why that ign package is a great swap for earlier type IV engines.
(Thanks  Doc JA)  Might be worth pulling the distributor and cleaning, lubing,
the advance mechanism if you have not already done that. An unresponsive
advance mechanism will definitely degrade the power output.
