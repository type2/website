Features
Chevron Delo Gear Lubricants ESI are premium grade, multipurpose gear
lubricants.

They are formulated with ISOSYN. base stocks and compounded with a unique
extreme pressure additive utilizing an inorganic borate compound. They also
contain a patented, synergistic combination of additives that protect
against wear, seizure, oxidation, corrosion, rust, and foam.

Chevron Delo Gear Lubricants ESI are ideally suited for gear sets exposed to
extremely high temperatures and loads.

Tests have proven that Chevron Delo Gear Lubricants ESI provide a wear
protection film 3 to 5 times thicker than the conventional sulfur-phosphorus
antiwear film. The inorganic borate film is composed of compounds that do
not react with metal. The film forms promptly to provide superior gear
protection and improved thermal stability. By minimizing friction, cooler
operating temperatures have been observed.

Applications

These lubricants are excellent for all types of automotive and industrial
bearings and gears, particularly those operating under severe temperature
and load conditions. They provide excellent wear control even in the
presence of small amounts of water. Their exceptional thermal and oxidation
stability, and antiwear performance permit longer gear life and extended
drain intervals.

Chevron Delo Gear Lubricant ESI SAE 80W-90 is the first nonsynthetic gear
oil approved for the extended warranty program of Dana Spicer heavy duty
axles and is an approved lubricant for drive axles under the Eaton
Roadranger E500T Extended Warranty Program. Chevron Delo Gear Lubricants ESI
are also approved for the extended drain specifications of both ArvinMeritor
and Mack.
