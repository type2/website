I've also had success with the dual Weber ICT and dual "baby Dell"
setups. They have the advantage of stock Solex in terms of short path
from throttle plate to head, but neither had chokes, at least not the
ones I had. Like stock, there is the additional hassle of
synchronizing, but after you get used to it, it's not big deal.
