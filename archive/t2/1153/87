Subject: Re: [T2] SOLVED - Problem with Vanagon lack of power

the worn flat cam is overlooked soo often,,  I don't look for it as a
routine,, and I should be

I have heard the V8 guys chew about cams that are no good.. and recently had
an situation with a new "rebuilder" engine that looked like it had 100k
miles on the cam ,, who knows ,, maybe it did.. but they claimed to have put
in a new cam,,
the mechanic owner claims to have done the oil changes etc to ensure long
life on the engine... but it started to give grief at 7k miles, then about
5k miles later , they pulled it apart to find the worn parts...
he managed to get the vendor of the engine, not the builder, to have another
builder warrentee it...

I talked to the mechanic about his choice of oil.... and he flatly [lol]
refused to listen that the oil could cause that much wear sooo quickly,
I am just waiting to hear if the new cam will suffer the same demise, as
they are repeating the experiment ,,
