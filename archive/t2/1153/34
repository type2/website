Brad,

Progressive are troublesome to set up and maintain and greatly limit
the performance of your motor. Being in Minnesota, forget it dude.
Stock Solex carbs are junk and I am still puzzled by why some still
"prefer" them. I would almost say they are worse than a progressive
carb, which is not a good choice.

My "opinion" is...You may want to sell what you have and use a set of
NEW dual 40 mm webers or professionally reconditioned 36mm Dellorttos
(no larger than 36mm to 40mm is needed). Two dual barrel carbs offer
one carb for every cylinder, no long runners to freeze up so a choke
really isn't needed. After so many years of futzing around with stock
carbs, progressives and other flim flam, Dual two-barrel carbs with an
SVDA are the way to go.

A fellow named Gabe (Alfa1750) on ebay can send you a flow matched set
of 36mm Dellortos pre-tuned for your application for under $500. For
all intents and purposes they are brand-new. Your motor will run
wonderfully, idle perfectly and return the highest mileage numbers of
any combination.

Trust me, a set of Weber or Dells will have you high-fiving yourself
and clicking your heels up in glee vs. the shrugged shoulders of a
progressive and saying, "well I guess its good enough...".

Well you asked for opinions... :)
