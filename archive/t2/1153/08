That carburetor is actually my carb of choice. I just removed the dual
Solex set from my 74 and installed a Weber.

Cold weather operation is, as you suggested, the biggest challenge
with this setup. In California I found the electric choke to be
sufficient to get me started and off to work on icy mornings without
any need for warm up time, but if you are in severe cold weather, you
will have to do something more.

Walter at Bus Boys says that in Canada they have electrically heated
manifold wrap. The most elegant solution I have heard yet is to tap a
pipe nipple into the bottom of the plenum and run a tube to the
exhaust to bring in hot exhaust like an EGR. The poster said this
setup worked perfectly for him.

Rebuilding your Solex is an option of course.
