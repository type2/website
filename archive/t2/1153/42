Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Light Flickering

Hi Josh,

It isn't mentioned so I'll bring it up... If you are running 10W30 oil 
(or thinner) then switch it up to 20W50 or straight 30 weight or higher.

Having the oil light come on at speeds higher than idle is a bad thing. 
The sender is set for 7 psi... if you are driving  with less than 7psi 
oil pressure then the engine is not in good health, and a bearing 
failure will be in your future.

I had my oil light flickering once as I was coming through Buffalo on my 
way home from a long trip. Didn't get dimmer or brighter depending on 
the RPMs of the engine. turned out to be a loose sender wire that was 
grounding out on the engine case.
You might want to inspect the blue oil pressure sensor wire and make 
sure it's not frayed or loose.

I've also had an engine that gradually lowered its oil pressure at 
highway speeds, eventually developing a rod knock and creating a large 
hole in the top of the engine case. That's to be avoided if possible.


Happy Trails,
