You can get GL-4 Stalube at your local NAPA.  In normal use these 
transmission experience little gear wear running GL-4.  Synchronizers in 
these trannies will last 50-200K miles depending on how your drive, the 
rest of the box will run fine until something breaks from age and hard 
use, or the seals go bad and the box gets run out of oil.

I have lost three trannies in air cooled VW's over the decades and each 
time something broke.
