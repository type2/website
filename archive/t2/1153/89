Bob,
 
Several of the Mobil-1 products still have somewhat higher levels per their
data sheet.  They are higher than other oils, but federal mandates make them
less than specialty oils.  They have 1000-1300 ppm range of zinc and
phosphorous.  The 0W-40, 5W-50 have some, and indeed the 15W50 which is
probably the smartest T4 choice anyway, has the most.  Now their "racing" oils
are up in the 1700-1800 range, but additive package probably not for street
use and change intervals.  Interestingly BTW several of the Mobil 1 products
still are listed as meeting API SJ, SL as well as SM, SN, whereas that is not
the case for many oils today due to low antiwear properties.

As mentioned by others, other specialty "racing" oils like Brad Penn still
contain zinc and phosphorous in the 1400-1500 ppm range.  Although Brad Penn
alludes to a street compatible additive package, again some others are not
suited for street use and standard change intervals.  The Penn goes about
$5/qt online shipped price, ZDDPlus goes about $7/additive bottle but I cheap
out and have only been running half a bottle beyond the initial breakin and
another 2-3 changes, so pretty much a wash either way.  In retrospect I should
probably just run the Mobil1 15W50, price wise but still have something for
dino oil in VW's, likely my stupidity.

when I had my engine (type 4 2L) rebuilt I used a breakin additive for the
first 3,000 miles or so and in checking I found that Mobil 1 15W50 (only) has
the highest amount of the zinc whatever that a cam needs to breakin
correctly.
