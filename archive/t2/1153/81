Subject: Re: T2 Kauai Report

Hi Chris, I'm on the Big Island. We have plenty Vanagons, a few Bays and Bugs,
but Splits are getting a bit thin on the ground. The guys in the Big Island VW
Club have some nice older cars. I have a '77 Neptune Blue Kombi, '67 Bug and a
'83 Vanagon that will never run again, its parts have kept other Vans alive.
Kauai sounds nice, never been there, small tho!
