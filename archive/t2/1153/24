Subject: I need to catch a break

....but not a break down.

I had plans to take my bus on its first camping trip this weekend, a short
drive from Annapolis to just south of Frederick, Maryland.  The final
preparation has been a bit stressful to say the least.

Well, I was looking at the new tires that I put on last week, since one of
them appears to be out of round or balance, and I discovered that when the
tires were shipped to me last summer (yes, this project is taking a long time
to finish), I was sent two different size tires.  Two are 205/70 and two are
205/65.  Incredible.  The tire shop didn't notice when they mounted them on
the rims, and I didn't notice when I installed them on the bus.  Of course, I
mounted the 205/70s on the passenger side and the 205/65 on the driver side,
so to put the same size tires on an axle I need to swap them diagonally.
Which means either putting it on a lift or jacking it up twice.

I'm still hoping to get this sorted out so I can drive the bus this afternoon,
but I'd really love to catch one break with this trip/project.
