Somebody must want this.

This is a 1971 Volkswagen Single Cab truck, it has drop side and rear gates,
and dual "Treasure Chest" doors to access the cargo compartment under the
bed from either side. The body is reasonably straight, it has the usual VW
bus rust - driver side floorboard, doglegs, and rockers - all readily
repairable and really not bad compared to many of the other VW buses I have
owned. The treasure chest floor is fairly sound with a few rust through
places.

The deal breaker issue with this vehicle is that it had an engine fire and
the back end is seriously toasted. The fire damage, and the rust that
followed, means that the rear corners, rear bed frames, and tail end of the
chassis will require serious metal work to repair. I can send photos via
email, but you really need to see it in person to determine what a potential
repair would involve. The bed floor also needs to be replaced. There is no
engine, but the transmission and rest of the driveline is intact.

I have the rear valance, rear bumper, and a replacement engine hatch that
will go with the vehicle.

I bought this as a parts source for a 1969 Single Cab that I restored, drove
for awhile, and ultimately sold. This vehicle was written off by the
insurance company as salvage. I have the paperwork (including tittle), but
the person I bought it from never had it put in his name and I did not
pursue obtaining a tittle for it in my name as I never intended to put it on
the road.

I'm looking to move it on to someone who can use it to put another vehicle
back on the road, or who has the resources to restore it.

I'm open to a trade, let me know what you have. I'd be interested in a boat
- kayak, small sailboat, etc., but would consider most anything.
