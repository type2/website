Subject: Oil Light Flickering - Resolved for now

Oil changed.
Oil pressure sensor replaced.
Carb stripped and all the crud cleaned out.

Oil light doesn't flicker anymore and the engine runs like a dream now even with 
the 009 distributor.

However, I'll watching the oil level and quality closely for a bit just to be 
sure.

Thanks for all the help, everyone.

And if anyone is interested, here's some photos of Berta.
She's a '79 Viking Conversions Spacemaker (also known as a Super Viking).
