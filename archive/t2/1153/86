I don't know necessarily, though obviously could be the case.  A lot of local
bug engine builders who do the occasional T4 underestimate cam issues, which
were already bad on a T4 long before out crap oil of today, and reuse.  But in
no way underestimate the lack of zinc's effect on a good regrind or even brand
new cam.  Several of the big names in cam's today will not warrant any flat
tappet cam (1000s of small block chevy cams a year probably) not run in with a
high zinc breakin oil and run with ZDDP additive.
 
Personally as I've said many times I have always used Elgin cams for regrind's
stock or performance for T4's and everything else and Dema has been warning
about the ZDDP issue for a good 10 years.  I've never had an issue with one of
his cams of course.  Ordered a 20 pack of ZDDPlus just 2 weeks ago in
preparation for oil changes in the '77 and '69 very prescient to this thread.
