Chokes aren't added to any carb to make up for long runners.  Chokes 
mostly make up for cold intake air and cold heads/combustion chambers.  
There are a lot of complaints from people who live in cold areas and try 
to run carbs sans chokes.  They either must fight a cold balky engine 
for several minutes or jet their carbs overly rich.
