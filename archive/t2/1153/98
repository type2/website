Subject: Re: SOLVED - Problem with Vanagon lack of power

It seems that the cam failure in the Vanagon was nearly catastrophic, in that
a lot of wear occurred over very few miles.  I can't remember - we've been off
topic for a couple of weeks.

I can't claim to know much about cam design, construction and materials, nor
about oil formulation, but it seems that a cam will hold up OK to a point - a
threshold if you will - and then start to fail rather rapidly.

Regardless, as old as our machines are, there appears to be an incompatibility
with current technology.  Years ago, when lead levels in gasoline were
reduced, there was a scramble to reconfigure the heads so that they would not
fail prematurely.  This was when air cooled engines were still in production
worldwide.  It's harder these days to get a work-around.
