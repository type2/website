water can do some strange things.

go out at night in the dark,
start it up and without a flashlight or anything look to see if there is 
electrical leakage. will show up as light tracks most often on top of the 
distributor cap. but can be other places.  (BE CAREFUL) your working in 
the dark especially check top of coil, wires and distributor cap.

the  top hatch is perfect place to observe if you have a hatch.

might help if you just swap out distributor cap and rotor and see if this 
helps.
