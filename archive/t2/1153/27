John -

Yep, they run great for what they were originally designed for - a
F**d Pinto (us auto parts guys call 'em "Pimples") 2.0 or 2.3 inline.

To be specific, the only Weber Progressive to run great out of the box
(conversion) was one I got from Mr Bug/EMPI for a 76 Rabbit owned in
the mid 80s.  Really woke it up, much better than the factory Zenith
2B2.  Just set the idle go!  Great mileage too.  Why do you think
Chrysler installed them on on the VW provided Rabbit block on the Omni
Horizons?

Installing one on a Bug 1600 dual port was a bit tougher, especially
from a re-jetting situation.  After about 4 or 5 weekends of futzing
with it, I finally got it to run right. A Few subsequent installs on
other similar Bugs were repeats of the first no matter how much
pre-prep lessons supposedly learned from previous installs - didn't
make a difference.

Type 4 installs were a REAL bear, re-jetting and icing being the
biggest problem, even in Southern California.  Never again ;)
