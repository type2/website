I would have to go back and look again at the SM stuff, but from memory 
SN appears to be less restrictive.  I seem to remember that SM oils were 
restricted to .08% phosphorus for oils with a first number of 10W or 
less and (maybe) .10% for oils with higher first numbers.  It has been 
several years since I looked though.  For SN oils there is "NO 
REQUIREMENT" for maximum phosphorus on oil with first numbers higher 
than 10W and/or second numbers higher than 30.  These oils would have a 
viscosity grade of "OTHER" in the chart in the following link.

Hopefully we will see some of the heavier weight oils reformulated to 
have a bit more ZDDP under these new SN guidelines.  I presently use 
Redline breakin additive in my oil.  Nice concentrated stuff, only need 
to add one teaspoon per oil change to bring the zinc up by about .02%, 
which in the Mobile 1 Turbo Diesel oil I am running these days brings 
the zinc to .14% if I have my numbers right.
