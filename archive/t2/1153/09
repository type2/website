Hi Mike,

Haven't noticed this mentioned yet but I'd go with the ignition at this 
point. (no pun intended). Is it ignition electronic or are there points 
involved? Checking dwell or swapping the ignition module would be worth 
doing at this point.

When the engine is revving faster there is less time for the coil to 
build a charge and that may lead to an insufficient spark.

Fuel pressure could also be a problem, definitely worth throwing a gauge 
on it to see what's happening there.


Happy Trails,
