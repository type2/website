Subject: Re: Vanagon Intermittent Ignition Problem

Well, I did as John suggested and eliminated the digital idle thingy, but the
problem persists. 1980 California Vanagon with electronic ignition. Starts and
runs great for about 10 minutes and then dies, wait 15 minutes and it will
start and run again. One thing I have noticed, the ignition control module
(black thing on left side of engine compartment with heat sink) does not get
hot after the 10 minute ride. I am assuming it should, considering the heat
sink. Is this the failure mode of these modules, to work and then fail when
hot (not?)? Also, I asked before, but didn't get an answer: does anyone know a
source for a new wiring harness that connects the module and distributor, or
the part number? They are not showing up in any of my searches of the web.
Thanks again, Timo in Hawaii
