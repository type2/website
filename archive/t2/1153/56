Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Light Flickering

Thanks for all the replies.
 I took the bus out for spin this afternoon.  A few miles into the village, got 
some petrol, then over to the co-op for some lemons and sugar.
Oil light didn't flicker once.

Then on the drive back the oil light started flickering.  Not much at first, but 
then it would flicker whenever getting much above idle.
I've since parked it and don't plan on driving anymore until I get it looked at. 
 Hopefully I haven't done any major damage.
The engine was warm, but the dipstick area wasn't too hot and it came out 
easily.  The engine also seemed to run fine during the trip.

Also the oil was changed only a few hundred miles ago so I would hope that it 
would  not have broken down by now.
I'm going to top it off with some good quality 30 weight tonight and try to get 
around to a test drive tomorrow.
