Subject: Seriously considering selling my VW

I hate the idea of parting with my 71 VW Microbus (seats taken out, bed
platform put in for car camping), but my personal economics dictate that I
have to sell something ...

SO, any idea where in the SF Bay Area is best place to list a bus for sale?
When I bought this bus, it was pre-craigslist days. Locally there has been a
rash of car thefts via craigslist ads, so I'm hesitant to post there. eBay
really isn't an option either because I want to find the next person who is
going to keep The Escape Pod running and enjoy her company. I don't want her
to get lost to the parts bin.

Any ideas?

Thanks!
