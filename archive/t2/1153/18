I have had a similar issue on my 71 Bus with a 1600. It was just a wire that
came loose off of the coil that connects to an idler celanoid.

I could start her right up and she ran fine. When I added a load I assume the
motor shifted just enough to make the wire separate from the coil.

Once I crimped the connector and put it back on the coil all was well.

Hopefully your problem is the same.

clutch in, in addition to not having any power to get up and go.  1st gear
seems fine but she really bogs down in 2nd.
