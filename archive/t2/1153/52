The conventional wisdom has been to buy GL4 because GL5 eats brass
synchronizers.

The current thread at The Samba argues that the steel parts are
getting to be NLA and therefore it is better to use the GL5 to
conserve them and just sacrifice the brass parts to it.

If cost is no object, Redline is synthetic GL4 and has generally been
considered the finest your money can buy.
