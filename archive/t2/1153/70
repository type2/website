First, thanks Daryl, and thanks Jim for relaying his response.

That's really good news.

Interesting write-up on Swepco 210:

"An 80W-140 true multi-grade EP gear oil designed for most industrial
and rolling stock gear applications. Designed to reduce inventory, so
a customer can use one oil for a multitude of applications. 80W-140
multi-grade, API GL-5 and MT-1 rated lubricant. Exceeds most
manufacturers requirements. Excellent high temperature stability.
Oxidation and thermal stability. Excellent low temperature flow
characteristics. Reduces lubricant inventory. One oil for
transmissions, differentials, power take-offs, and industrial gear
boxes. Improves low temperature lubrication and shifting. Helps
eliminate lubrication mistakes. Reduces energy consumption. Primary
Markets are Trucking, Industrial manufacturing, Mining, Sand and
gravel. Over the road trucks, transmissions and differentials.
Industrial gear boxes."

I like the "Helps eliminate lubrication mistakes" part, as if they've
heard our conversation before!

Also MT-1 to GL5 covers the compatibility range beyond GL4 since MT1
is pretty basic.
