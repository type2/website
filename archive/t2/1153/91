Subject: Re: [T2] SOLVED - Problem with Vanagon lack of power

Just to chime in, when trying to figure out incredibly high head temps
it finally turned out to be caused by a worn cam. The rebuilder
apparently had no clue of what he'd put together - obvious some
"original" OEM parts that didn't survive the first 1000 miles. My new
rebuilder - one of the old bug drag racing guys specialized in type4
conversions - did my current engine. It now has plenty of power and
running 365F CHT at 75 mph. He adviced me to use only the racing oil
"Motul 300v Competition 15W50" (e.g.
http://www.mayesmotorsport.co.uk/catalog_view.php?id=306) sold in 2
liter tin containers like "extra vergine olive oil". It's not cheap
but since the engine warranty only extends when using this oil, I
suppose it's worth the cost. I guess it also has high zinc like the
other oils mentioned in this thread and keeping to racing quality oils
seems to be a low cost compared to a complete breakdown of your
engine...
Just today I've been checking valve clearance after 6000 miles and -
contrarily to all my other engines - did not have to adjust anything
since all were in spec. Going to holiday to Normandy tomorrow seems to
be no problem (knocking on wood).
Cheers,
Timo
