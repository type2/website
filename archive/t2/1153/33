Subject: Secret campgrounds outside Yosemite park !

Hi ,

We are going to Yosemite park tomorrow for a couple of day. Every 
campground in Yosemite is super booked until ... October. I need to take 
my van outside the park over night.
Do you guys know any nice places (other than campound$), close to 
yosemite valley  I can stay over night with my camper . When I say nice 
place I mean some side (dirt road) I can easialy access with the van and 
enjoy my morning breakfast in a nice area

Thanks for any tip  !!!
