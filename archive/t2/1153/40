Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Light Flickering

The oil light reveals low oil pressure. Since it doesn't come on until
the pressure is quite low, you are right to be concerned. Conventional
wisdom is that other than at idle, if you see the light come on, the
damage has already been done.

Engineers tell us that on average, you should see about 10 psi per
each 1000 rpm. You should not be running under load at less than 1800
rpm, so there is a reason for lost pressure. This can be a function of
choosing oil of too low of viscosity. Otherwise, the other causes of
pressure loss can be worn engine bearings, worn oil pressure relief
spring, and worn seats on the oil pressure relief valve.
