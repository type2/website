Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Vanagon Intermittent Ignition Problem

Tim -

I've been following this and the beginning thread on the problem and
here's my thoughts......

We've ruled out a bad Idle Stabilizer, but here are some failure
points of the other components:

**The Ignition Control Unit (ICU) on the left firewall, that black
multi-pin module with the heat sink has a history of long life, thanks
to that heat sink and failure of these have been uncommon, but they
can fail, especially after 30+ years of use.  They do not get hot to
the touch in normal operating conditions, but they can get warm - the
heat sink is there to soak up any potential short term "heating up"
should it happen and it works quite well in practice.  I don't have
the Vanagon Bentley at my fingertips, but I do remember from servicing
my Calif 80 Vanagon I owned in the 90s that there is a troubleshooting
step by step to determine if the module is functioning properly.  In
addition, to disconnect the plug, simply use a flat blade screwdriver
to carefully pry the clip loose and pull the plug..

**In addition, there is a troubleshooting step by step to check the
hall unit in the distributor as well in the Vanagon Bentley.

Both of these troubleshoots should be done, otherwise you may be
unnecessarily spending money on replacement pieces just to find out
the cause.

The Ignition Control Harness was obsoleted by VW over 18 years ago,
they were close to $200 from them (!).  On a 30+ year old Vanagon,
yes, they are getting hard and brittle.  The late Karl Von Salzen
often found these in California boneyards for list members back in the
day.  I would dearly love to find one that is decently intact to have
them made for perhaps a more affordable price. Otherwise, ya just
gotta patch it up for now.

There are other possible causes to explain engine shut off after 10 or
15 minutres (in my experience):

**Kombi-Relay - One side controls certain FI functions, the other side
controls the fuel pump operation.  Failure rate on 30+ year old units
is increasing these days, the fuel pump side is usually the culprit
and Bosch has STUPIDLY obsoleted these this past year.  No more new
ones!  I get 2 or 3 calls a week for these.  Calif Models (80-Early
83) 2.0 have 13 terminals, Fed Models have 11 terminals and they are
NOT interchangeable.  When I hit a boneyard, that's the first thing I
check for and lately I haven't had much luck finding 'em, someone's
beat me to 'em.

**Fuel Pump - These can overheat if the square plastic pre-filter (if
equipped) gets loaded up with junk from the tank.  This is becoming
more of a problem these days with ancient fuel tanks.  I change my
pre-filter every time I change the oil, they're cheap.  Gasoline
actually "cools" these pumps while operating, so starvation, loading
up with tank junk or running out of gas usually shortens their life
span.

**Fuel Enrichment Relay - This is a tall, black cube shaped relay only
on California models, located on the left firewall next to the
Ignition Control Unit and the Idle Stabilizer.  If it fails, the
Vanagon will not run, period.  Chances of failure on these are less,
the only time someone asks for one of those is because it's missing on
their Vanagon, not because of failure.  VW obsoleted this relay over a
decade ago, so again, the boneyard is usually the only source, but
getting really hard to find.

**Ignition Coil - Because of the higher voltage energy of the hall
ignition, these do run hot and it's normal in most cases.  This same
coil is used on 79 Calif Buses and Late 83-84 Wasserboxers (as is the
hall unit and Ignition Control Unit).  Original Bosch Coils are pretty
robust beasts, but keep in mind the engine compartment environment of
the 2.0 Vanagon is the hottest of these models and 30+ years can take
a toll on these.

**ECU - Very robustly made, failures have never been a common problem.
Never personally had one fail on a Bus or Air Cooled Vanagon.  But I
had a failure on a 20 year old Wasserboxer 84 Westy in the middle of
Texas once.  Had a spare, swapped it out and continued on my way.
When you live in your Westy full time as I have for the past 12 years,
you tend to carry a bunch of WEIRD parts for on-the-road repairs :) A
bad ECU can fail because a circuit (or circuits) inside will overheat.
 After failure shut-down, it's possible to re-start because the
circuits(s) involved and the ECU is programmed to reset itself when it
is activated.  It runs in "Open Loop" mode for about 3 minutes, then
goes to "Closed Loop" to receive signals from the O2 sensor for proper
running.
