Subject: Opinions?

Requesting advice from the learned collective.

I am in the horns of a dilemma on this one.   I was all set to change the
carbs on my stock '72 1700 until I started looking for how to connect the
throttle cable to the Weber progressive carb I bought. Most of what I came
across was how bad of a carb this is for a Type IV engine.  Not bad because
of flat spots or carb/distributor combination, I got a SVDA one, but from
icing.  Up here in the Great White North, icing can be bad with a good
system let alone a questionable one.  There are frost warnings up north
tonight.

My question for all is would it be worth it to continue to convert to the
progressive or rebuild the Solexes (or is that Solexs?) I have? I would
probably use the SVDA distributor, the stock dist has way too much play in
it. 

Opinions?
