Subject: Intermittent Ignition Problem

Hello All, I'm hoping someone can shed some light on an intermittent ignition
problem a friend is having on her 1980 Vanagon. It died on her one day and she
called me saying someone had checked and there was no spark. I looked and
found the distributor cap and rotor were shot, swapped them out and the
Vanagon started and ran, but not well. She made it the 5 miles to my house, I
did some other tests, inconclusive, but swapped to a new coil to eliminate the
possibility that it was failing when hot. Engine started, ran better than
ever, and she set off to drive home. She made it about 10 miles and the van
died again, so she got it towed. I'm reading in the Bentley that one should
never tow this vehicle without first unplugging the ignition module. What is
the failure mode of these? Regardless, I got it running again, but again it
died after about 10 miles. I noticed the ignition module, the black thing with
the heat sink mounted to the left of engine was cool to the touch. Aren't
these supposed to be hot, given the heat sink? Any easy way to test it? How do
I remove the plug from the bottom? I see a thin wire which appears to be
holding it, but I don't want to pry and possibly break anything getting it
off. The wiring harness and associated plugs are all pretty brittle, chunks
have broken off other connectors already. Lastly, I don't see them listed, but
are these harnesses available new anywhere? This is the one that connects the
ignition module, distributor and another black box with two round connectors
on the bottom. Thanks for your help, Timo in Hawaii
