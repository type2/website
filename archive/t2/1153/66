To evaluate the degree of danger to your engine from a leaking
carburetors, you have to look at the volume of gas getting into the
oil.

You can get gas contamination in your oil just from running rich. This
is the sort of thing that slowly causes excessive wear.

In order to get a sufficient volume of gasoline into your oil to be a
cause of low oil pressure and serious engine damage, you would have to
see the oil level rise dramatically. A bad leak can fill your
crankcase overnight, but I would be concerned at any amounts that are
sufficient to raise the oil level visibly on your dipstick.

Dirty, stinky a few hundred miles after an oil change is not a cause
for concern.
