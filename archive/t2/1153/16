I would either rebush the 32s and get the stock setup as mint as you can, or
try finding one of those Holley bugspray two barrel carbs. I had one on a
411 motor in a 73 bus and it ran fantastic. Considerations include finding
one in great shape, the intake manifold needs to come with it. Gasket kits
are available, might have to drill a hole for the brake servo hose, the
linkage between the gas pedal and the return spring and the length of the
accelerator cable would all have to be worked out, then get rid of all the
vacuum leaks.
