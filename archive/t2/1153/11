Hi John,

I also have a 72, live in S. Alberta, and have replaced the dual carbs
with a Weber. I don't drive mine in the winter so don't run into icing
too much. It seems to work well enough till about -5 (C).

I tried rebuilding the Solexes, but without much success. I ended up
getting fuel dripping out into the front right cylinder and then spun
a main bearing and locked up the engine. After that (second) engine
rebuild I put in the Weber, which is working great (other than
slightly less fuel economy than I was getting with the dual carbs.

I might try the hot exhaust return, if I ever need to drive the bus in
the winter (my other issue in the winter is HEAT in the cab as there
is none).
