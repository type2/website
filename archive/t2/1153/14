I've done enough of these Progressive Weber Conversions over the past
25 years to have a great dislike for them.  Too much work involved in
making them run right.

Rebuilding the Dual Solex Carbs is the way I would go, but there is a
caveat here - 39 year old 34PDSITs have probably seen more than their
general usefulness in life, especially if the Throttle Plates are worn
where the Throttle Shafts go through - big cause of vacuum leaks.
Re-bushing them can vastly extend the life of these carbs in my
experience.

I believe someone on the Samba offers rebuilt units with re-bushed
plates from time to time.

That being said and to Brad or anyone else on this list, I have a pair
of NOS, never installed 1972 ONLY 34PDSIT carbs.  I've offered them
for sale from time to time on the Samba for $550 including Priority
Mail postage.  I will even supply two carb rebuild gasket/diaphragm
kits with them because after sitting on a shelf for over three decades
I'm sure the diaphragms have hardened up and need replacing before
installation.  Every time I've advertised them, I've had lotsa
nibbles, but no takers, even though most said it was a great price.
The left carburetor alone went for over $1400 at Volkswagen in 1982,
the right side a bit cheaper.  The price is firm because I'm losing
$300 from what I paid for them in the late 90s to install on a 72 Bus
project I was involved with, but ended up parting out (too much body
cancer).
