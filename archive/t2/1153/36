	Especially for a tyro on VW engines, I reckon the valve 
clearances would be a low priority for this diagnosis.  The behaviour 
described is extremely difficult if not impossible to explain by any 
version of wrong valve clearances, no?
	More likely are
* reversibly failing electrical connection  -  as already suggested
* clogged fuel supply (e.g an added filter which is a good idea but 
may have become clogged)

	Don't be too focussed on the rain; it *may* be irrelevant.
