Subject: SOLVED -  Problem with Vanagon lack of power

It was a flattened cam.  Sucks because the shop that did the work for 
this guy (and has been around for 30 years) and provided a guarantee for 
this thing, went out of business last month :(  I had a feeling it was 
something mechanical because as long as an engine is getting sufficient 
air, fuel and timing (all of which were true), it should have no problem 
accelerating and this just wasn't the case.

Thanks for all of the input and suggestions - too bad it wasn't 
something simple!

thanks,
Mike
