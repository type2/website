Greg,

	Different tyres on a given 'axle' are a serious error, 
deprecated by all authorities I know of (except those who contest an 
eccentric 500-mile race on a 1-direction track in Indiana ;-)).  The 
vehicle cannot handle symmetrically  -  skidding as readily on LH 
turns as on RH  -  unless the tyres on each 'axle' are very similar 
if not identical.
	Another, minor reason is that with the arrangement you have, 
the differential will be working almost all the time when it would 
not normally be.  You are forcing the L drive wheel to revolve 
slightly faster than the R, on any straightaway (have I got the yank 
term right? <:-|).
	I agree with Bob too about which axle to slap the bigger 
tyres on.  Unless you have unusually steep hills or heavy loads, slap 
the /70 on the drive wheels, because this will save some fuel in 
cruising, demanding slightly lower revs for a given cruise condition, 
and will slightly help you to exceed your normal top speed when you 
get an inviting downhill stretch  ...  8-)
