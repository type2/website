Thanx Jim Arnott, one of our main bridges to them noo-fangled 
Vanagos, for your helpfully distributed advice from an expert.  As 
usual, some further comments may be forthcoming ... :-|

	As far as I can discover, this is correct.  The difference in 
viscosity is unimportant.

	This sensible idea is to be contrasted with the totally 
extremist contrary recommendation of the Aug 1972 VW T2 Instruction 
Manual p.36:

--------------------

  Vehicle data quiz

....

      When is the gearbox and final drive oil changed?

      Only at 1000 km.

....

--------------------

	The idea that this oil need not be changed (except at 1000 
km; never again) strikes me as downright wild.  But then, you did 
know Germans get wild now & again :-| ; we tend later to forgive 
them, at least sufficiently to buy some superior machinery they used 
to make :-*.

	Such glimpses are generally valuable  -  and hard to come by.

	 This outfit came & went a decade ago in NZ.  It is not a 
vernacular name for what does tend to look purple: the gear oils made 
by Lubrication Engineers <www.le-inc.com/>.  I have no commercial 
involvement, but a good friend is a salesman for LE and convinced me 
their oil generally, and most especially their EP gear oil, is worth 
the extra price.  It's made from a peculiar crude oil of which LE 
control the wells.  Many hevi-doodi commercial applications use LE 
gear oils.  It's not retailed thru the same channels as used by BP, 
Shell, Castrol etc.  I also have their multigrade in my sump.  LE 
don't bother to offer multigrade gear oils, believing 80 or 90 is 
good enough.  And BTW the difference between 80 & 90, while perhaps 
significant for youse Canucks etc, my buddy reckons is small.

	I send separately my brief article on gear oils.
