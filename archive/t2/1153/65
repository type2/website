Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Light Flickering

Bob,  I'm in sunny 'ol England so I don't think it's the temperature.
Although after being here 4 years I never thought I'd miss those humid Maryland 
summers.
However, I'll never miss the two-a-day high school football practice in August. 
 Ugh.

Since some other folks here mentioned oil contamination I pulled the dipstick 
and took a whiff.
I never did a baseline smell to gauge what healthy engine oil smells like, but I 
believe there is a whiff of petrol there.
The oil was only changed a few hundred miles ago so I don't think it should be a 
stinky as it is and it's a bit dirtier than I would expect.

Martin and Mr Potts mentioned that a leaky carb could be allowing fuel to escape 
into the crankcase.
Take in mind that my my bus has had problems idling for a week now.  It'll stall 
at idle before getting warmed up and once fully warmed up the idle will hold but 
it will wander sometimes.  I figure there's a carb problem, but could this be a 
symptom of the carb leaking fuel?

Furthermore, assuming contaminated oil is the case what damage may I have 
already done?
I noticed the oil light flickering on the last half mile home on Friday.
I took the bus for a short spin on Saturday to the shop and to see if the 
problem persisted.
That's about 6 miles round-trip and the oil light wasn't flickering until the 
leg home.

Thanks,

Josh
