Subject: replace upper and lower torsionbars with balljoints

Greetings,

I just purchased upper and lower torsion arms with the balljoints 
pre-installed on my komb( bus-boys)i.  I got the right side installed 
and then when I jacked up the left side of the bus,  the bottom torsion 
arm on the side I replaced slid out about an inch?

Can someone tell me what I am doing wrong?  How do I insure that the 
torsion arms do not slide out?

Please be patient with me.  I am a newbie, have not actually worked on a 
car in 20 years, and this is my first bus( I love it sooooo much I am 
thinking of buying another).

Thank you in advance for your help.
