Subject: Late bay steering wheel

Looking for the remains of a late bay steering wheel.
Just the center section with the splines. Not interested
in a complete wheel (unless the rim is beyond repair)
I've got a very old wood rimmed wheel that I want to
play with and don't want to sacrifice a good VW wheel
to the project...
