Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Light Flickering

A cheap place to start would be to just change out the oil pressure 
switch or better to put on a  mechanical gauge temporarily so you can 
see your actual oil pressure.

Gasoline is pretty volatile so if you heat the drop of oil on your dip 
stick with a match you may be able to see any gas boiling off or it may 
even flame if there is gas present.

Yes a leaky carburetor will make an engine idle poorly.
