Subject: No power ... could it be the rain?

Last week my 74 Westy was running great and looking forward to camping this weekend.  Then the storms came.

Now, she'll start fine the first try but then after 15-30 of idling she dies.  The second or third starts are fine but I have to keep my foot on the gas to keep her running.  Driving, she wants to stall every time I push the clutch in, in addition to not having any power to get up and go.  1st gear seems fine but she really bogs down in 2nd.

I am a complete VW mechaninic novice so I will ask the stupid sounding question ... could the rain have somehow caused a problem?  I'm thinking not but rather maybe its a fuel filter, (electric) fuel pump though reading the "no power" thread it could obviously be other things.  

Haven't checked/adjusted the valves since she sat for most of the winter ... throwing that out there just in case.  Dual carbs clogged up after sitting?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  I'd love to get her on the road this weekend!

Steve
