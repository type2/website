LOL, is calling for 95 today, was hoping to do some welding but not a 
chance.

since you caught it early probably little or no damage, yet

personally I'm a convert to synthetics and have had nothing in my engine 
(except for break in) since 1976.  Mobil 1 is about as good as it gets in 
my opinion.    15W-50 should protect in all conditions,  pay $2,000 for an 
engine rebuild but balk at $5 for oil to protect the investment..penny 
wise etc.
