Daryl Christensen at AATransaxle gets this question about twice a week  
on the Vanagon and Syncro lists. I don't think that he's on these  
lists so I'll summarize and CC him.

Cliff's Notes:

Says any quality 75/90 gear oil is fine. He says that GL5 will work.  
Says the the important thing is to change it every couple years.

Says that while Redline used to be great stuff, a couple years ago  
there were some corporate type changes and now, not as good.

Said that he's not impressed with Royal Purple.

Says that if you're bucks up, Swepco 201(203?) is the stuff to run. In  
cold weather, the first couple shifts might be a challenge. (This is  
what he runs.)

All this can be found in the Vanagon List archives: http://gerry.vanagon.com/cgi-bin/wa.exe?S1=vanagon
