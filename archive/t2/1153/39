I noticed my oil light flickering yesterday at the end of my commute home.
There is a hill a bit over 100 yards long leading up to my house.
I was in second gear pulling up the hill when I noticed the oil light 
flickering.

I got home turned off the engine and checked the level after dinner.
It's halfway between the two marks on the dipstick so there should be no problem 
there.

Some researching shows that the oil light flickering at idle can be OK, but not 
under load.

Also, I've been having problems with a slow/rough idle lately as well.  I'm not 
sure if this is related.


Any advice would be helpful.

THanks,
