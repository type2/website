Subject: Moving to CA, need advice re: smog

Ok, so i've got the engine and transmission out of the bus (77 Westy 2.0 
FI) in preparation for the drive to LA.  I'm in buffalo, NY by the way, 
so it's a pretty nice drive.  Anyway, i get to thinking about the smog 
testing.  I found out that as a student paying resident tuition at a CA 
college, I have to register my vehicle in that state.  So, my bus once 
had a cat converter and an EGR and that stuff, but most of it was gone 
when i got it, and i removed the rest shortly after that.  

So, i have two questions.  The first is, can anyone tell me about the 
requirements of the smog test, specifically the amounts of each gas 
allowed and what can be adjusted or added to control them?  

And the second question.  I'm sure many people on the list have 
attempted to make a non-CA bus pass the smog test... Is it worth the 
work, or should i just start looking for an older bus?

Thanks,
