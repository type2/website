Mike maybe you should read beginning of the thread :)  Zach wanted to 
know why putting the fuel filter after the fuel pump instead of before 
it is dangerous. He has a carbed bus I assume.

Here's some of my finest ASCII art maybe this will help.

scenario 1
|FUEL TANK|-----[Fuel pump]--------(filter)--------{Carburtor}

The filter gets clogged, pressure starts to build up in the fuel line
between the pump and the filter. High pressure develops. There is a 
possibility that the hose fitting could pop off. This is why you 
should NOT install the fuel filter after the pump.



scenario 2
FI:
|FUEL TANK|-----[Fuel pump]----(filter)-----/injectors/---{Regulator}

Same thing could happen in this scenario. The filter especially would
block the flow of fuel, just as if the line was blocked off. With the
high pressure a FI pump can create the the pressure would build up 
very quick. It doesn't matter that the regulator would bleed of 
pressure because the fuel would be able to continue past the clogged 
filter. This probably wouldn't happen though since its pretty hard to
 install the special FI fuel filter after the pump as the hose sizes 
don't allow a easy match up, but who knows what someone might do.

So install the filter before the fuel pump always. It could prevent 
a fire and as another list member mentioned it keeps the pump clean.
I don't know the stock location VW put the filter on carbed buses 
but on FI buses the filter is next to the frame rail right under gas
tank, before the pump. 

Alex.
