Subject: OT: FRS and GMRS radios

This is somewhat off-topic, but I want to buy a pair of FRS or GMRS radios for
Heidi and I to use to keep track of each other at bus campouts. I'm asking on
the list because you guys share some of my sensibilities: has to be cheap and
functional!

Amazon has a pair of Motorola T5420 for $32.44 after rebate. These are FRS
with sub-codes and each uses three AAA batteries. I have a good recharger
already. I've found standard rechargeables to be hand in flashlights and my
digital camera because I can substitute standard batteries from a convenience
store in a pinck.

There's also an Audiovox FR1400 for $14.99 each that seems comparable. But you
can get the Uniden GMRS680-2CK for $47.99 that does both FRS and GMRS,
claiming a 5-mile range with built-in rechargeable battery. Decisions,
decisions...

Any input would be appreciated. It's not alot of money, but I hate to spend
$50 and find out later that I could have done better. P-mail me if you want to
keep this off the list.

-Eric
