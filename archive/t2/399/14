Subject: Re: [T2] making valve cover gaskets stick to valve covers

Are we talking about a type I or a type IV engine here?  My understanding is
that the type 4's are more difficultl.  But on a type I I have never used
anything, just cleaned the heads and valve cover surfaces well and put a dry
gasket in place.  Works everytime, no leaks, no fuss, and the surfaces are
clean next time you go to adjust valves.  In fact,  I have even reused the
same gaskets after first cleaning them in gas--and still no leaks.

If there are leaks on a Type I it is most likely because the surfaces are
not cleaned well or the valve cover is bent or warped, in which case
replace, or the gasket wasn't properly positioned under the valve cover.
Also, the bale (sp?) may be bent and need replacing.

Frankly, I think it is easier to position a gasket dry than one with grease
or sealant on it, which if the gasket moves may cause it to stay wrongly
positioned, whereas a dry gasket returns to the shape of the valve cover
surface.
