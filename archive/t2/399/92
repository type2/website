Subject: Moving to CA, need advice re: smog

Dave,

Being a former new yorker, present californian, former baywindow driver, present split window driver,
here are my thoughts,

you better have ALL your smog equipment spec for the year of the vehicle or have the smog ref document you otherwise.

you better have your bus seriously tuned up with new plugs, wires, points, condensor, cap, rotor, oil and high octane gas.

you better get ready for the hassle of your life as you sit through a two hour smog test where if you pass everything but fail the vacuum test on your gascap (which they do at the very end) you will go through the whole thing again.

I can hit you with the specific gas numbers tomorrow or you can search the archives for my posts after failing this year.

My advice? Leave your good bus for others on the east coast to enjoy. Come out here and pick up a fanatastic condition splitty for 3k like I just did or an early bay for 1000-2000.

Later, Sorry,

Billy
