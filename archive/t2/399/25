Test it:

The one change I would make to the article would be to use 1W resistors or
larger. VW also recommends 1W:

The reason is that I was testing a handful of voltage stabalizers the other
day and bad units caused the 1W resistors I was using to get very hot very
quickly.

FYI, good units (bi-metallic style) all gave similar readings but not
exactly the same as each other which I found interesting. If anyone needs
one because theirs is toast, pmail as I have a bunch from the junkyard that
I've tested.

The speedo cable turns a disc inside the instrument cluster. The disc rubs
against another disc attached to the needle. The coefficient of friction
between the two discs causes the needle to deflect based on the rotating
speed of the first disc.  When I discovered the mechanism by which it worked
I immediately wondered how the speedometer would behave once the disc wore
out.

Not sure what the problem is but I wanted to pass that info along.
