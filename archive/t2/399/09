Subject: Urgent! daily driver down, was running rough

my 79 westy isn't starting.
It is my daily driver/ only car.
Plus I have a road trip coming up.
I'm at a loss now.
there was a broken ground wire in the distributor, but I soldered it back 
on.
still wont start.
I pulled off a spark plug wire and held a screw driver to it and turned over 
the engine. I get a spark.
The starter/solenoid is working.
battery is good.
Can't seem to find a disconnected vacuum hose.
I'm pretty sure I hear the fuel pump working. so I pulled off the fuel 
filter. Gas everywhere.
blew through it. It was dirty, but gas can flow through it. That is where I 
stopped. It has been raining and I haven't had a chance to even put it back 
on.
Muir talks about checking fuse 15. My fuse box only goes up to 12. Am I 
missing something.
Any way, I really need to get this started soon, so I really appreciate any 
help.
Thanks.
