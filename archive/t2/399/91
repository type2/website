Subject: Re: [T2] Moving to CA, need advice re: smog

I don't have the numbers in front of me right now, but I can tell you
that you'll need your egr working for sure.  If you don't have it, your
NOs will probably be too high to keep everything else in check.  Other
than that, just make sure it's in good tune and bring it to a shop
that's willing to sit and tinker with it for a while.  Most likely
they'll have to open the AFM and mess with the spring to get it to
pass.  Be careful, however, because I've found that whatever they
changed it to was too lean.

a non-ca bus has to pass it's home-state's regs, not CAs

where are you moving to?
