Subject: Alternator, rebuilt, high output, lifetime fact warranty, 75-79

I just purchased one of these alternators from the Bus Depot to replace my
regular one for a 73 bus. I have a problem though.  The boot that goes to
the fan is different.. Does anyone know if the boot is still manufactured?
If so do you have a part number? SnoopyBus is not a happy camper and trying
to get ready for Bonnaroo. I'd hate to have to leave her...

Please Help...

Bus Depot is closed so I can't get the number from them...

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
