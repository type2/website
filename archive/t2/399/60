Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Filter

i also wanted to know about this ...?
this is the first time i have heard that but makes since ...

i just recently put my filter under the bus almost to the side but on top of the tranny..
i got it off the engine skirt cause i was afraid the plastic fuel filter would get to hot and melt?
not sure..
but what zach is saying makes alot of since also..
to catch anything that may go into the carb from the pump..?
can someone shed some light to this..
i thought about safety and didnt consider thsi when reinstalling my filter in another place.
