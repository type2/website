Subject: Re: [T2] got Her running!

ahhh ok just got another reply to my post...
so looks like i can go home tonight and set the valves and then redo the timing then..

so let me get this right..
i must make sure that she is running ...
once running i can set the valves and then go back and sreset the timing again...

the timing is still pretty far off... is that not going to hurt the valves..?
thanks
