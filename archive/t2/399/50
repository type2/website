Subject: Air shock bolt follow up..

On a tip I found in the archives, I was able to locate
the right size longer upper mounting bolt to make air
shocks fit on my bus. I found them at mdmetric.com
There was a minimum order, so I ended ordering a total
of 6 bolts (12mm x 1.5 pitch x 110 mm length). If
anyone has ever looked for a bolt this size, you know
how difficult it is to find. So, if anyone other
listee is considering putting on air shocks or
coil-overs, let me know and I will sell you the
correct bolts for the price I am paying (about$2 per).
