Subject: Re: [T2] Windshield seal

I used it.  It doesn't appear to me to be any different in shape than my previous seal, which was from Bus Boys.  Like the Bus Boys seal, it "sweats" a bit of black off when I wash it but other than that seems to be holding up well.  No shrinkage after several years of Texas heat.
