the same holds true for type IV motors. the leaks are caused by dirty or
badly fitting parts, too much goop on the gaskets, or a weak bale. sometimes
the head surfaces get messed up also.

there is a small design shortcoming, IMO, in the tIV head cover that
encourages the leakage. there is only 2 tiny tangs on the cover to hold the
gasket in place. if the head cover had more or larger tangs the gasket would
stay in place better. this is why people resort to using glue or sealant to
hold the gasket in place. i use a hylomar type sealant made by wurth.

i have a set of aftermarket die cast aluminum head covers on my VW thing
motor. they are not bolt-on covers, they use the stock bail. they have four
tangs evenly spaced around the inside of the cover to hold the gasket, and
this work really well - there is no tendency for the gasket to creep
inwards, plus the tangs are very tight on the gasket so they hold it firmly.
something like this for a tIV would be an improvement as the tIV head covers
are quite a bit longer than an a t1 and the gaskets can and do move around a
lot if not stuck on somehow.
