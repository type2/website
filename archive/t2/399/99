try for York county, I don't think the smog checks are that bad and they
have better tax codes, or even better move accross the state line into
Maryland where car are only inpected when they change hands (not every
year like PA) and smog checks are every two years and you can "Buy" your
way clear if it won't pass after so much work on the bus. (currently spend
$450 on trying to get it to pass and you get a cert for two years)
