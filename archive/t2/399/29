I'm not a big fan of venting the valve covers.  Seeing as how they are
already vented through four big pushrod tubes it really isn't needed
unless you happen to autocross your bus and push the oil around in the
sump.  If you must vent the rocker area, better to do it through the head
so that you don't have to disconnect a hose to pull the cover.
