Anything you put on the head side is going to squish out as soon as the bail
is applied over the valve cover. The cork gasket will compress and seal on
it's only unless the head surface is not flat.

The biggest problem is cleanup. Next time you have to change gasket because
you removed the cover anything that hardened on the head side will require
cleaning.
