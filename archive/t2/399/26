Subject: Plugging the smog holes on generic or 74 heads-what was stock?

In our 75, we had a local mechanic do a top end job- he used one new
generic head where he apparently used bolts to plug the smog pump holes
in the head......but a loud noise head one day we traced to one of these
coming loose as leaking exhaust gas......I took a stock 74 head that was
cracked and noticed it had hollow tubes threaded in that were capped-
the thread was finer than what came loose, and I suspect he
crossthreaded a handy bolt and it worked loose (only about 1/4" of
threads went in; the stock one goes in at least 1/2"- I got him to put
this stock tube in.  He said he always did this and they never worked
loose (??)  The other one worked loose also a week later, and I threaded
in another capped hollow bolt.  Were these a stock item?  I noticed they
have a thickening in the center that actually bottoms out on the head
surface before the thread itself fully tightens????
