Subject: Re: [T2] OT: FRS and GMRS radios

We've got a pair of the Motorola radios and we're happy with them. Better 
than the cheaper competition. 1.5 mile range most of the time.

We used them with alkalines and Ni-Cads for a while and then splurged for 
the Motorola drop in rechargable ni-cads with dual charging stand.

Very good for around campus ("free" cellphones for working / students me 
and the wife) and around the neighborhood. We've not used them on the 
highway or camping yet. We also take them shopping in case I'm on one side 
of Lowe's and she's on the other (entertaining our 3 year old).
