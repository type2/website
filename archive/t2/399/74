Three AA batteries are better.  AAAs go pretty quick.
"Sub codes" are good if you want to limit conversation to only one other
radio.  When travelling with a group you will probably turn them off so
that you can hear everyone on the frequency.

GMRS requires a license (which most everyone ignores, but it's a $10K
fine)  You might get 5 miles across open country, but a mile or two is
more realistic.

I use $10 FRS radios for bus outings and they work well.  If I lose one,
no big deal.
