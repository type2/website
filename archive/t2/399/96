While I don't doubt that AAA-powered radios can last a long time, AAs have
more capacity, (2600 vs 1100mAh) and are generally easier to find.  The
AA-powered FRS radios I bought weren't any larger than the AAA-powered
competition, either!

Exotic batteries can do great things if you have the tech to keep them
charged.  Personally, I keep it simple and use alkaline cells
