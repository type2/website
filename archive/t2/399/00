Subject: Re: [T2] horn woes

i just had some horn trouble too.  along with some help from the list 
and these diagrams i found of beetle horns 
http://www.wolfsburgwest.com/wired/wired_12_00/wired_12_00.htm i 
understood things a little better.  if any of this looks confusing 
ingore it because the bug stuff is not the exact same as the bus stuff. 
 just in principle.

here's how I did my horn troubleshooting and i do think it was rather 
genius.  fixing your horn you can wake up all your neighbors so I 
created long test leads to connect  in place of the horn which was held 
in place by the wiper blade on the wind sheild.  that way when it worked 
i could just see the light go on instead of hear the loud honk.  just a 
thought.

it seems like you were sucseful somewhere.  there's just a break in the 
circuit.  perhaps somethings dirty.  the bentley manual says the horn 
circuit can be notorious for this.  clean all the connections, 
esplecially the ones on the horn (sometimes the p.o. will pull off the 
rubber boots that keep them clean.  use a wire brush).  see if it's the 
horn button - take off the wheel and touch the ground wire (originally 
brown) on the steering column.  also, using an ohm-meter ckeck for 
continuity in your circuit too.

have questions ask
