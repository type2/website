"We have a bunch of the AAA FRS motorola radios (I think the 5420s-the
red ones) and they lasted an entire 5 day trip to yosemite on the same
batteries -- used them all the time."

I would assume it depends on the quality of the battery.  Lithium Ion 
batteries last a LOT longer than the standard, or even H-D alkaline.
