Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Filter

The way I understood it is like this. The fuel filter can get clogged 
with rust/debris but the fuel pump still has a good supply of fuel, so
it keeps pumping... since the fuel has nowhere to go because the 
clogged filter the one of fuel lines that are CLAMPED blows of because
of the high pressure generated by the pump. 
And you know what happens them....  :(

More likely to happen with a fuel injection pump i suppose than a
low psi carb pump but either way its safer to locate the filter before
the fuel pump.
