according to the wirng diagram it is as follows

1.  brown from horn to nut underneath  

2.  brown plugs into horn button.  look at this picture i found of a 78 
when i was searching for stuff about my horn. 
 http://webpages.charter.net/bclausen/How_to_files/ignSw/img2.gif  yours 
is a little different but it is the same priciple.  it has to plug in 
somewhere.  btw this was taken from this web page. 
http://webpages.charter.net/bclausen/How_to_files/ignSw/ about taking 
out an ignition switch

3.  your  black and yellow wire is right.  (goes to the fuse box.)

A COMMON PROBLEM IS CORROSION BETWEEN THE WIRE AND NUT UNDERNEATH THE 
STEARING COLUMN.  just make sure everyhing is clean down there.
