list,
 
i want to make one of these to start engines on a stand:

it could be made with the clutch housing of an early (3-rib) bus trans. does
anyone have an early bus clutch housing that they can sell? an empty bug
trans case will also work, but won't allow starting of a type IV bus motor.
 
this unit costs 54.00 $US plus shipping to me in toronto, so i want to spend
less than that, if possible.
