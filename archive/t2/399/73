NO!  don't glue down the head side.

On the head side the gasket has a big flat surface to seal against, so the
entire gasket does the sealing.  On the valve cover the surface is smaller
and a little hylomar here helps assure that no leak paths develop.  The
Hylomar also ensures that the gasket comes off with the cover and doesn't
stick to the head.

You _really_ don't want to clean glue off of the head surface every time!
