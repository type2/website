Subject: Fuel Filter

I was reading through the thread about some kids new 74. When I saw the part
about not having your fuel filter in between your carb an pump, I figured I'd
better heed the advice. So where should I put it, in between the tank and
where the line goes into the fan shrouding?? It seems like vibration could
still be a problem, but what do I know??
