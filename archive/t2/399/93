My experience is here (pmail me for any questions. I did it in December):

You can determine how well you will do in the smog test before you leave by getting your exhaust sampled at the local garage. The #1 reason for failure is idle mixture too rich so get it set.

There are four components to the test:

- visual (all stock components present)
- timing (within 3 degrees of spec, rpm within spec)
- exhaust (depends on county but in general %CO and HC)
- gas cap (does it seal)

If you have a engine setup that is younger than the chassis you will have to go to the  smog referee and get it certified. For example 75 bus with 78 engine becomes a 78 bus and will smog a few more times before it becomes exempt. You cannot put a 75 engine in a 78 bus, only a younger setup.

The limits are here:

Your category will be (Truck < 6000 lbs, 1975-1978). HC is measured in ppm and CO in percent.

Pass/Fail limit:
Idle HC 250
Idle CO 2.5
2500 HC 200
2500 CO 3.0

Gross polluter limit:
Idle HC 500
Idle CO 5.0
2500 HC 450
2500 CO 5.5

Min CO+CO2 7.0
Max idle RPM 1100

If you have an older bus (1974 or earlier) you are smog free as of Jan 1, 2003.
