Subject: Possible relocation to PA

There's a possibility that we might be relocating to eastern Pennsylvania
sometime in the next 12 months.

Is there anything that I need to know about the bus and smog checks, etc.
before I attempt to take the bus up there to the Philadelphia area
(Langhorne, Bristol Township, etc.)?

Thanks!
