I found some on-line owner's manual scans that helped a bit, but I'm
probably going to have to pick up a used housing from Darrell's this week to
be sure of what I'm doing design-wise.

I'm still waiting on my Bentley & Muir.  Things are tight at the moment and
I'm having to put off buying the manuals for a bit.

Thanks.
