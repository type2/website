Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Filter

Guys, i hope that if you wondering about where to put the filter it's 
because your Bus is going great and you don't have much to worry 
about!!! (he he he...)

The fuel tank (carb) should have a "Filter Screen" inside this one near 
the nipple (like a sock), but! in my case it was broken and died up, 
hanging at the bottom of the tank (I just swap tanks for an FI one). So 
this is normally your first filter, this one should "filter" most bigger 
rubble / debris. This one should also protect the fuel pump. If you 
don't have one in the tank or don't know if it's still there you should 
put some kind of screen between the pump and tank. I personally use a 
hobby (1/4 scale model airplane) inline cleanable screen.

Putting the main inline transparent filter after the pump and in the 
engine compartment as 2 meaning, first you can take a look at this one 
once in a wile, second, you can filter all debris that could come from 
the fuel pump to protect those expensive carb(S).

So the intelligent filter location if you have only 1 filter is between 
Carbs and pump.
The second intelligent thing to do when you owned a 30-year-old bus is 
to remove the fuel tank, inspect-repair-clean this one. If you have a 
clean and rust free tank, you won't have to worry about "rust/ chunk of 
rust" issue, so no worry about the fuel pump being damage by a big chunk 
of rust!!! The small dirt particle found in the fuel wont damage the 
pump at all.
