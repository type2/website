Subject: Leaking Valve Covers

>btw, weatherstrip cement works well to hold the gasket on.  However, if
they still leak, replace the bales and that should hopefully fix the
prob.  using the above method will keep the cover from moving during
install so you might be able to do away with any sealant..

I have been advised that type IV bales are a dealer only item now. Does
anyone know the part number and or a non dealer source for "new" bails. I
replaced my covers with shiny new ones and cork gaskets. One side still
leaks. I did not replace the bails but actually bent the ends where they
lock into the head some so that the bails are a lot tighter to get on. It
helped but has not stopped the leaking entirely. One side still leaks, not
very much but enough to make the heat smell. I am so sick of leaking valve
covers, but everyone on the list says the bolt on covers leak worse.
Aircooled.net has a nice looking set that I just may try though... I have
been through these covers way to many times.
