In august 2002 i ask my VW dealer part guys to look in is computer just 
for fun if  any parts where available for my 73!
Many were! including rebuilt "warranty" head (about 700CAD-$430USD),  
reman T4 2.0L & 1.8L engine, new pistons and cylinders.

When i ask him about a rebuild 2.1L Vanagon engine (1987), he told me 
that they were B/O, for ever!!! only the USA had 325 in B/O !!!  They 
had 11 x 1.9L left and that is when he told me that they had many 
air-cooled engine left!

I just bought some Solex 34/32 carburetor parts (small shaft for the 
acc. pump), $17 each!!! ouchhh!. he had  4 left!

Last year, the same guys told me (for the sake of a discussion) that 
they still could get parts for as early as 1969!
Well, i don't believe him on that one!

Just a thought! Don't ever forget your very friendly and helping VW 
dealer!!! (he he he)
