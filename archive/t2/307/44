HPBus was in Billrica Mass back in the late 70's.  where a Westy raises
the roof, HPBus lowered the floor.  the floor between the wheelwells was
lowered about 10 inches and a ramp was constructed of the lower part of
the door mechanism.   could only be done on an auto tranny bus, they
stopped when the vanagon came out, haven't seen or heard of a Vanagon
conversion.  originally designed as a wheelchair carrying taxi, but the
few I have seen have all been converted to some interesting uses.

we negotiated the value based on similar Dodge conversions.

a couple photos are posted (please excuse the mess had just gotten back
from the West coast and daughters wedding) with the John Brown Buses
