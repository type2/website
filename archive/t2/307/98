Subject: Sugar in Urine

Hi Guys,

Found out today that I have sugar in my urine. I am 41 years old and am 
being tested for type II diabetes.

So, what is the general experience on the group with this?

Will it make my swings worse and prolong my time off work or explain them 
and shorten it or completely declare me a basket case and put me on LTD for 
life??

Alan
