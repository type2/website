Theory aside - I have issues in cold weather (sub 50 degrees) with my Weber
progressive that closely mimics a vacuum leak. Poor idle, hard to maintain
idle when warming up, engine dies when I slow to a stop, etc. The problems go
away completely with warm weather.

Right now, I'm used to heal-toe braking and keep the idle set a little high in
the winter. In Ontario, I would definitely think twice.

There are lots of instructions on the web for making your own heat riser for
it. I'm going to make a stab at it myself by running some duct-work off the
heating system. I'll make it easily detached for Summer driving. Don't want
that hot air in the engine compartment come Summer!
