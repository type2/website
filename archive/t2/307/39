When my 69 ghia was rear-ended this summer it took an adjuster's appraisal, 
about a weeks worth of phone conversations, numerous faxed receipts and pages 
of internet "for sale" postings of same year cars before the insurance 
company settled on the value listed in the "CPI" guide.  They were quite 
adamant about not accepting the NADA value.
