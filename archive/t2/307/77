Hello Tor,

I think the point of the heat riser is to keep the
varor warm and in vapor form until it even reaches the
manifolds. Because dual carbs have such short
manifolds, the vapor has a much shorter and more
direct route to the head so the vapor condenses less.
With single carb units that often do not have heat
risers at all, the vapor can condense and collect on
the inside surfaces of the manifolds. It is the same
pricipal used in a moon shine still. The longer the
distance the vapor has to travel and the colder it is
allowed to get, the more condensation collect and the
ammount of usable fuel that enters the head is
diminished. At least, that is the way I understand it.
Good Luck and have a great day!
