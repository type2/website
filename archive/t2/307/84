someone that has a new unused set. They are remanufactured of course.

I had a free type 1 rebuilt from their shop...Lasted a month. Everything
about them is a crapshoot; you could get real lucky and the heads could
last...Or they could lose a valve and destroy the rest of your engine. My
guess is that an awful lot of GEX motors end up in about to be sold VW's
so they can be advertised with "rebuilt engine" in the advert...The new
owner gets to pick up the pieces...
