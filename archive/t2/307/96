Subject: [T2] Bus sheet metal needed....

Hi, I was wondering if anyone out there has a parts bus or maybe repair panels
sufficient to replace the whole nose of a 71 bus.  The bus was in a front end
collision and was also rusty.  I need the nose from the windshield down.  I
couls also use some rust free doglegs along with the inside skin of the nose.
I would consider a rust free nose from a parts bus or new panels.  I am in
Cleveland Ohio and would be willing to drive up to 100 miles for a good deal.
Lemme know what you've got.  Thanks, Brian
