Subject: 2.0 Rebuild

I am rebuilding my 2.0 fuel injected bus engine right now and need some 
advice on checking to make sure if certain parts are still in good shape to 
use in the rebuild. The first part in question is the rocker arms. They look 
to be in good shape. I also need to know if anyone knows of a good machine 
shop in Baltimore surrounding area that they would reccomend that i can take 
my, rods case, crank and camshaft to be looked over by someone that knows 
what they are looking at. The parts all look good to me but I want to have 
them grinded or replaced to make this rebuild last. I had a dropped seat in 
my head on the 3 and 4 cylinder side, what else is new and  was wondering if 
anyone has had any luck with replacement 2.0 heads and if so where did you 
purchase them and what was the cost. I am so psyched to get this engine back 
in. Any reccomendations on the rebuild would be great. I also am having the 
grinding going into 3rd gear on my bus, what is that, there was an earlier 
post on this and i am also curious. If this is a trans problem I will 
replace that while I have the engine out.

Thanks All

Casey
