Subject: Re: [T2] BA6 question recirculating air?

Hi Christopher, 
The other fan has nothing to do with propelling the heat(it's what adds
fresh air to the burn chamber and pushes out the exhaust). the normal
heating system(fan in engine compartment, and motor) and the
recirculating fan is what pushes the air. I suppose you could not use
the recirculating fan and just rely on the motor and fan to push the
air, but then your air flow would be reduced.

Thanks,
Shawn Reed
