Subject: '78 2.0L exhaust manifold torque

Hello Everyone,
        I checked the archives for the torque of the manifold and also
checked 2 books, but can't find this information. While removing the pipe
2 studs came out ( appeared to only be about 1/2 of threads in the head).
While reinstalling the studs they felt spongy and will not get tight. I
will have to tap and rethread to get the stud nuts to tighten. I saw in
the archives that someone went with GM studs to replace. I want to be
sure of torque when I put it together again. Also any information
concerning the stud replacement is welcomed. Thanks for your help.
