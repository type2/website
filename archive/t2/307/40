A fair bit of free advice.
Insurance companies DO NOT make the laws.
Your legislators do...but the insurance companies think they do!!!
Here in PA I have run into more than a few cases where the insurance
companies rules ran contrary to State law.

You sure as hell do not.  This is exceedingly
poor advice unless you have a show car or vehicle
that is heavily modified and worth more than the
average bus.  Most of us do not.  Don't waste
your money.
