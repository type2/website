Subject: RE: [T2] Dule carb to single Good or Bad idea?

I used to have a Weber single carb on my bus engine, 1973...

I had the icing problem and hesitation, so annoying!! but only in cold time!

Now im with Dual Weber 40 IDF, im real happy, but you have to synch these
babies and play a bit with jet and venturis to get a nice power acceleration.

a bit more work ill says, but definitly worth it!  Anyway you ll lose as much
time trying to adjust the single weber, trying to heat incoming fresh air to
avoid icing...

Stock Solex are good, but with time they worn out and lose vacuum by the
butterfly arm, they become impossible to tune anymore, and new solex part are
difficult to find
