Hello,

Is your dip stick pushed all the way in?, Is your oil
cap screwed on tight? You may have a leak around the
main engine seal behind the cooling fan. That would be
my guess. As it leaks, the fan sprays it all over your
engine compartment. You may be able to replace the
seal with the engine in the bus but I have not tried
it. I don't know if the fan can slide out far enough
to clear the fan housing with the engine in the bus or
not. 

Good Luck!
