I sent an email out earlier about loosing all my dash electrics, except for
lights and radio when I uninstalled the fog lamps on my 1977 Riveria.  Well,
I checked all the fuses again for the fourth time, but this time I pulled
all of them and tested them with my handy dandy VOM.  What I found was that
the newer glass one was bad even though the metal strip didn't break.  If it
had been an older style ceramic and metal one it would've been more
apparent.

Now that it is running, I found a rather large black wire, with a female
spade connector loose off the back of the fuse panel. I thought that black
and brown wires were meant for grounding? Why would there be a black wire
coming from the fuse panel?  I'm searching for my manual to try and find
this wire, but until I find it I thought I'd take the easy way and ask.
