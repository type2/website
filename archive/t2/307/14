Hi Greg,

When I built my westfakia in the early 2001 the donor roof was drab 
grey in spots, and had heavy black soot deposits on it most everywhere 
else. My brother and I cleaned it with VIM (mild abrasive cleanser 
containing bleach) and a couple of scotchbrite pads. It came up looking 
terrific. If I hadn't already purchased the paint I probably wouldn't 
have bothered. It took 2 motivated adults about 40 minutes to 
completely scrub the roof and luggage rack.

If you do decide to paint it, good paint gives great results. I used 
"Interlux Yacht Enamel" which was VERY pricey at $30CDN/litre, but it 
covered well and looks great 2 years later. A quart is enough to paint 
the roof 2 coats and leave enough afterwards to do the bumpers to 
match. There are a few pictures of before and after in the gallery 
section of my westfakia page.

Happy trails,
