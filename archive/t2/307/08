I'd like to hear some more opinions because I've been considering this also.  I had terrible wind buffeting until I replaced all of the shocks with KYB gas-a-justs and now it's no why near as bad until a big truck passes you. The biggest improvement I made to the steering was to replace the clapped out steering damper.  Prior to that the wheel used to yank back and forth over simple speed bumps.

Leafing through the Bus Boys catalog there is a page on anti-sway bars but they say that they cure handling problems more than wind buffeting.
