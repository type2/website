Subject: dual carbs to single.

the time and money? But my main question is if its a good or bad idea and 
why?  Any help would be great.  Thanks

Best to stick with the dual.
The carb on an engine is used to vaporize fuel.  That vapor travels through 
the manifold and into the head.  The longer the manifold, (that is, the 
furthur the gas has to travel) the better the chances of it starting to turn 
back to a liquid.  Dual carbs in my opinion are always better.  Better fuel 
delivery, and better fuel vaporization.  Seems with domestic Hot Rods 
optimal is fuel injection.  Next to that, is dual carbs.  Closer they are to 
the cylinder heads, the better.
