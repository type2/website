Subject: Beauty Rings (was another hub question)

Hey George and Ronnie and the rest of the list,

Thanks for the replies. That answered my question. It
made me think of another one. Will any of the VW
chrome "beauty rings" fit our bus's rims? I have seen
them as an option on other air cooled VWs and wondered
if they would fit on the bay window bus rim. Thanks!
