Simple Green, Gunk--I've used them all --and they have worked--

However ---I tried this product--located at your friendly local Honda
Bike dealer--and it works super--

Honda Bright--

Spray on--let it soak a minute--wash off with a garden hose---

This stuff is especially made to clean the aluminum cases of a bike--so
why not a VW ??

It works real well--I used it on my 74 Westy engine, as well as my 325
BMW--squeaky clean is the description of the results--

Later,

Terry

I am wondering if anyone has any suggestions on what kind of degreasers
work well to get years of South Dakota dust and dirt and oil off the
engine.
