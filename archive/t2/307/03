<< Got a 71 Westy , the rear door is not that aligned (about 1/4 space on the

the door left side is really compressed compared to the right side one, that
one looks almost new. 

Thinking this might be a source for water coming in. Help....Anyone ever
adjusted one to get in more evenly aligned on both sides? 

The Bentley doesn't really explain this.

Thanks,  >>

There's probably a VW tool/jig for this, but since we didn't have it, here's
how we aligned my replacement hatch...Loosen the allen bolts on the non-
sealing side and the catch for the lock. Carefully place a good friend on the
top of the engine compartment (make sure all essential body parts are in-
side), with a can of quick dry paint or a magic marker. Close the hatch and
lean against it until it is in your choice of position. Hold in that position 
and
have good friend mark the positions of the swing arm and the catch. Open 
hatch, release good friend from captivity and tighten down the bolts ala 
their marks. Try hatch; should fit tightly...If not, repeat (as they say on 
the shampoo  bottles.) If it's really 'out', you may hafta loosen both top
sides...But remember not LOOSE, just untight enough to allow a little
movement. When alignment is perfect, take good friend out in leakfree
bus for lunch...
