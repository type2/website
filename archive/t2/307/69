Hi Terry,

    You let the cat out of the bag, best kept secret for years. Almost all
the bike companies offer some sort of case cleaner, and yes it works great!
One caution though, this stuff is caustic and can etch aluminum and worse. I
have used different brands over the years, and I find some much more caustic
then others. Be sure and follow the directions on the container. One brand
said not to soak over 5 minutes, others have said over an hour.
    Plus you need to observe all the normal precautions about getting it on
your skin, clothes, and especially in your eyes. It will also kill the
wife's flowers, so watch where you rinse the parts.
    Careful!

Howard
