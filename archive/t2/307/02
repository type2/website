Subject: Re: [T2] oil sheen

If you removed the alternator stand, and inadvertently 'inverted' the metal, 
louvered insert, the oil could be blowing out of the breather tube somehow?  
Also, if you changed the oil cooler seals, they may not have seated 
correctly, and the fan could be blowing oil-vapor everywhere.

I just recently did a top end rebuild on my 71 westy.. now when ever i run
the bus i get a light spray of oil inside the engine compartment, so
everything is shiny, and it eventually collects in the pully tin and drips
out... i lose about a half quart for two hours of driving.. i am out of
guesses of where the oil is coming from.. any ideas out there? thanks ..
