Subject: Seating conversion saga

OK, list buddies; here's a question for you......Has anyone had any sort of
experience fitting the nice, comfy, plushy seats from an 85 Vanagon MarkV
conversion into a 74 bus? These seats mount onto a sort of dished plate with
a riser in the center that bridges the depression in the center of the
pedestal. (Anybody understand that?) The Vanagon pedestals are a little
different than the 74, but the plates do fit. The problem is that with the
seats in my head is about an inch and a half from the roof. If I cut out the
riser I can gain about an inch and a quarter. Before I do all that work I'm
wondering if an inch and a quarter is going to be all that much better. Any
ideas out there? These tracks are entirely different from the VW tracks, so
there's no way to make them work that way.

And now for something completelt different: Does anyone have any tips for
installing a new sliding door seal on the 74?

Thanks in advance,
Dave
