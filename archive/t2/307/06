Subject: sway bars

Can anyone comment on the effectiveness of front and rear sway bars and wind? My
location on the north side of Lake Ontario produces some mild winter weather,
but wind is an issue. Reinforced sidewalls made a world of difference, but I
have heard that aftermarket sway bars make a world of difference too....

I see that Ron carries them at the Depot, I'm just looking for hardcore
experience...

Thanks,

Collie
