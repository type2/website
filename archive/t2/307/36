Have you checked the manuals?  I think Bentley and Haynes both have the jet sizes listed.  Off the top of my head, I believe the 137.5 mains were used in 1972 1700cc engines, 130 was in '73 and 127.5 in '74.  Air corrections started at 175 and went down to 140 in '74.  Also the sizes varied between manual and auto trannies.  Check the manuals to be sure.
