Subject: re: sway bars

I put them on my '76 and feel that it made a nice difference.  I still get
blown around a bit, but it's much more controllable than before.

By the way, if you do add the swaybars, get a new clamp kit for the front.
Reusing the existing clamps sucks big time.  Using a new one is definitely
the way to go.
