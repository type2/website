Subject: Re: [T2] Dual carb to single Good or Bad idea?

Setting up dual carb's is a little hard. I have been
running a single progressive weber on my 73 bus for 17
years and have not had any problems at all with it,
the people that I know that have dual carb's are
always tinkering with them. I vote for it being a good
idea. Phil, (73 & 75 bus, 80 westy)
