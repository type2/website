Subject: Insurance Question

Thanks to everyone who responded I really appreciate it. I now have a better
understanding and  I need to change companies to get an assigned value
policy. My current insurance carrier GEICO doesn't do that:( Their lost I
guess. I am off to compare two offers, wish me luck.
Peace
Meg
