Here are the numbers, from my airplane's performance chart.  Since it happens
to be a 100-horsepower engine, no math is necessary to calculate the
percentage power loss.  And since it is an aircooled engine with 4
horizontally-opposed engine, it even looks like a Bus engine.  How
convenient!

Horsepower at full throttle:

 o o o o o o o o o o o
 o  Altitude    BHP  o
 o  ---------   ---  o
 o  Sea level   100  o
 o   2,500 ft    87  o
 o   7,500 ft    76  o
 o  10,000 ft    71  o
 o  12,500 ft    63  o
 o o o o o o o o o o o

Since this is a direct function of the amount of oxygen available to the
engine, I would expect the same percentages to apply to any normally-aspirated
engine...

...except, of course, that these figures are for the engine's performance with
the mixture leaned precisely for best power at each altitude.  If you continue
running with a sea-level mixture at high elevations, the actual loss of power
in a Bus will be dramatically greater -- more like 50%.  The impact on fuel
economy might also be pretty dramatic.

p.s., especially with Don Tuleja's current predicament in mind:

High-altitude operation with an overly rich mixture also fouls spark plugs
(and, in the long term, valves too).  So, Don, if all your basics check out
and your Bus still isn't running right after the trip to Denver, you might
want to try checking the plugs for carbon deposits.
