Subject: Camping heat

I think I read too many messages and get confused...

Just Campers have an offer on Halogen heaters and I fancy some warmth while 
camped:

I think (and have had a quick dig through the archives) that the only worry 
with these is setting fire to yourself if you are careless. This is better 
than propane heat which fills your van with moisture.

Am I right. Anyone used one of these ? I really want to be warm in the 
morning once I get out of the sleeping bag - I know cold is more manly but 
who cares.

Note for US readers: We don't have Wally Mart or anything similar. I might 
be able to get these slightly cheaper elsewhere but I'm going to do a Just 
Campers order and want to support them anyway. The cheapo guy on the market 
isn't much use for obscure van bits so I want JK to make enough money to be 
as big as Wall-Mart :-)

Thanks

Phil
