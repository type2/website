Subject: New Piston needed  - ideas?

Hey Dan,  I assume you got back to the seller and asked him to take back the 
stuff?  Sounds like a bogus deal, the way you put it.  Some years ago, under 
time-pressure to complete an engine, I used a piston that was not matched in 
weight with the others.  Engine ran like crap.  Unless you can get something of 
the correct weight grade, I'd think about putting yours up for auction to some 
other poor guy.... so you can buy a good matched set.  If you have access to a 
scale, it wouldn't hurt to check weights.  Paint marks can be faked.  Best of 
luck!

Hi, I just bought a set of Mahle pistons and cylinders for my 78.  However,
the set is missing a piston.  Any ideas on where I can pick up a new Mahle 94
mm?  I have several used but would like to find a new one.
