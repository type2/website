Subject: Re: rear brake connector rod

"My rear brakes were acting funny and Lockhart's
Volkswagon say that I need a rear connecting rod that
goes between the brake shoes.  (76 Campmobile)  No
longer available from the dealer and I haven't found
it in any of the aftermarket cataloges.  Any ideas
short of a junk-yard part?  Thanks...KR"

More information on "acting funny"? What has led you to believe that you 
need the rear connecting rod?

Cheers,
