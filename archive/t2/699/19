I don't know about "continuous", but the drive to the top of Mt. Evans
(14,264') in Colorado is quite impressive.  When you reach the summit...
*DO NOT* open a bottle/can of anything carbonated in celebaration! This
will only leave you wet, sticky, and thirsty as I can assure you that even
the Molson (used to be Coors) brewery in Denver is 9K' lower and the St.
Louis Coca Cola bottleing plnt is the full 14K' lower...  WET! and STICKY!
as the carbonation instantly releases.

AMEN!  Even with FI.  The whole concept of an air/fuel ratio depends on
there being *some* air to mix with the fuel and there are places where
that just is not so.

OOK!
