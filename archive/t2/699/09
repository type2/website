  You can't beat this deal. I cannot buy them wholesale this cheap. All the new single port heads come from tha same 
factory as only one place makes them. I do not know how the quality is of these heads but do know that the class 1/2 
1600 racers won't use them. SCORE has changed the rules for next year allowing the use of duel port heads due to 
the lack of GOOD single port heads now.
