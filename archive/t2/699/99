I put a Type IV onto a Type I Beetle tranny. Required a new flywheel only. Pressure plate and friction plate were Beetle units and I already owned them. Everything else was stock VW and not changed. Pressure plate came from Kennedy. 

You can do it but parts will have to be changed. What I do not know specifically. Hvae you checked the list library?
