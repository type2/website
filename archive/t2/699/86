WHOA KEVIN! I'm up in Cookeville... 

The gas fumes ARE NOT NORMAL! They indicate a prblem and most likely an impending vehicle fire!!! 

You need to replace (not just inspect) filler neck hoses, vent system hoses, and fuel supply hoses. 

You don't want to have a line part and then dump a tank full of fuel on a 400+ degree engine, not to mention possible sparks from the charging system, points, and bad spark plug wires. 

DON'T drive it until you get this fixed! This is as important as brakes! 

The fix will be prob less than $25 and will save your $2500 bus. 

What part of town? Got family in Walden and Hixson and Soddy-Daisy.
