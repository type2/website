Dead right Gerald. In the UK we get 240V AC - which means our electricity is
twice as good as yours. :-O

Thanks for all the replies. It looks like this will be a good idea although
I like the oil-filled radiator idea as well but suspect this will take
longer to give off heat.

I guess I should have explained that what I am looking for is heat while
static and connected to the mains on a campground. Propex looks good but I
have a BN4 in the shed awaiting fitting. I won't want to run that while
static though - the electric heater will be much cheaper (we don't get cheap
petrol). Personally I'm looking forward to having a toasty van in the cold
mornings and evenings when I want them. Working inside the van during the
winter will be much nicer as well.

With a .co.uk address I would hope so. ;-)
