Subject: Master cylinder connections

Hi

I have searched the archives for this one but can't find anything so 
here goes.

I have just replaced my master cylinder (split brakes -1973 1800 twin 
carb)  and the connections are not in the same place as the old ones 
(for reasons I won't go into).  I undertand that each half of the master 
cylinder is separate and I think that its set up for the rear brakes to 
go nearest the servo.

Does it matter which of the two connections available is used for the 
switch and which for the brake line?

thanks

John
