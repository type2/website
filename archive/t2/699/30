Subject: RE: [T2] altitude and performance, the bigger question

Here's how I can best explain the loss of power at altitude:

As the altitude of your bus increases the absolute or ambient pressure
becomes less.  That means for every cubic foot of air there are
physically less gas molecules contained in that space.  When the engine
takes in intake stroke it is still displacing or sucking in the same
amount of space but there are fewer air molecules in that space.

Now that there are less air molecules in the cylinder there is less
oxygen to go through the burning process when the fuel is introduced and
the spark ignites.  Less oxygen to burn with the fuel means less power.

That is also why engines need to be leaned out at higher altitudes.
Less air = Less fuel if you want to maintain a constant ratio.  I
noticed this big time on my trip from California to Colorado.  I had to
lean out the 76 about a turn and a half from its sea level setting.

The only way to offset horsepower loss at altitude is to turbo-charge or
turbo-normalize your engine.  This is a very common practice on high
performance aircraft.  A supercharger will work as well but they also
become less effective at altitude.
