Subject: Thermostat & flaps - heat and cooling observations

Since installing the thermostat and flaps, I have been observing the 
differences.

I have a CHT and oil temp gauge.

The gauges have been running cooler, but then so have the ambient 
temperatures, so take that with a grain of salt.

The heater has been going like gangbusters, keeping the cab at 30+ 
degrees above outside temperatures.  I believe that the air is able to 
make the booster fan (bilge fan) spin.  I have not had to use the 
booster fan yet, but I daresay that I will be able to stay warm at 
temps down to zero (if it ever gets that cold).
