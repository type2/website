Subject: Best Battery Cables.

Is their such a thing as thicker battery cables, or maybe cables made
out of something other than copper that's better? I'm replacing my
cables, and I don't want to have to do it again for a LONG time. So
I'm looking for the best quality setup you can  get for Battery
Cables. Any ideas/recomendations?

TIA
Chris
