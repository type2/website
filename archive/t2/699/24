Subject: Re: [T2] Boneyard find

For the west coasters, there's a bay westy in a private boneyard in
Red Bluff, CA. No engine, no transmission. Owner is going to start
sending all his stuff to the crushers, so proabably priced next to
nothing if it's not gone yet.

 A few weeks ago, we were driving by a boneyard on the way home and on
 top of the hill was a Westy.  It was Sunday and we were coming home
 from a "backpacking" trip, so we didn't stop.
