Whatever you do to compensate for a too-rich mixture at high elevation, it is
absolutely necessary to change it back before driving at lower altitudes or
switching to extra-low-octane gas.  As you've suggested, failing to undo the
changes would be a bad idea.  Running too lean or too advanced can cause
overheating, detonation, burned valves, thrown rods, non-rebuildable cores,
death, taxes, war, terrorism, Enron, and divorce.  If you run *really* lean
and use *way* too much advance, all of these things to will happen to you at
once, and you'll have a whole lot of explaining to do when you go in for your
interview with Saint Peter.

Just remember to be careful!
