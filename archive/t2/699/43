Shouldn't matter.  Higher octane gas resists *unintentional* early ignition
and detonation, but in this case you're *intentionally* setting it off earlier
than normal.

High-octane fuel is necessary in high-compression engines, which can compress
the fuel/air mixture enough that it could detonate on its own, without spark,
during the compression stroke.  If there is no chance of this happening, then
high-octane fuel offers you no benefit whatsoever.

The too-rich mixture does not burn as quickly as a normal lean mixture, and
therefore it is somewhat helpful to ignite it earlier.

> Also, even if one improves the mix by leaning, isn't it still less burnable
mix going in to the cylinder?

A properly leaned mixture will be perfectly burnable, but your manifold
pressure (which is what you are adjusting when you step on the gas pedal) will
be much lower, resulting in less available power.  With a properly leaned
mixture, your engine can produce 70% power at 10,000 feet every bit as well as
it does at sea level.  It just can't produce more than that.
