Hi Mike,

That depends on the year of the bus... IIRC 68-72 have one lever for 
each side, whereas 73-79 have one lever to control volume from both and 
the other lever alternates the output between defroster and knee vents.

I could be wrong about the year that the levers changed, but I'm pretty 
sure I remember my 72 westy having a lever on the riser pipe to control 
the knee vent/defroster output.

Happy trails,
