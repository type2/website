Subject: Things on Dashboard

     Okay, I know I sound like a total fool here, but on the dashboard of my 73 type 2 bus, I have two slots with climate control levers in them. I know the one on the right controls the vent on the front of the bus, but I can't figure out what the one on the left does. There are two levers and they are attached to two cables that run somewhere under the bus. I know they have something to do with the heat, but can't figure out what since when I push them up or down, they spring back to their original position. Can someone clue me in? 
 
 Thanks in advance.
