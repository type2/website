Subject: rear brake connector rod

My rear brakes were acting funny and Lockhart's
Volkswagon say that I need a rear connecting rod that
goes between the brake shoes.  (76 Campmobile)  No
longer available from the dealer and I haven't found
it in any of the aftermarket cataloges.  Any ideas
short of a junk-yard part?  Thanks...KR
