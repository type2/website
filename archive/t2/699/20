I don't know if this is common across the US, but the small home-town Ace Hardware and True Value
Hardware stores near me have a really, really good selection of metric hardware.  Check in the
hardware aisle with all the little drawers and such.  Both of the local places near me even carry
stainless steel metric hardware.  I've had good luck at both places when I bust off an exhaust
stud or need a fastener for the engine tin.

The brand I see the most is "Hillman."  The local Ace Hardware has an aisle about 20 yards long
with drawers six feet tall on each side full of all sorts of stuff.
