I just discovered them and they have an awesome selection of metric items >>

My local Home Despot has a fairly large display of drawers of fasteners
marked "Metric"...Most of the drawers are empty, or have one or two
pieces in them (and usually not the size indicated)...I asked the young
person if there were any more up in the pallet racks...He checked the
computer, nope, all out and not on order...I'm a little ticked and wander
over to the customer service desk...I ask if they're gonna get an order
in soon or what...The manager said they don't sell that well so weren't
restocked that often...And I said then what's the point of having the
display...Not to mention that you can't sell 'em at all if you don't have
any... ;-(
