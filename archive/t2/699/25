Subject: altitude and performance, the bigger question

Greetings,

Hopefully there's someone out there that can explain exactly how altitude 
affects engine performance.  I know how it works for human systems, just not 
for buses.

The percent of oxygen in the air is pretty uniform up to about 70,000 feet 
(about 21%).  We feel winded because there's less pressure pushing oxygen 
across our lung membranes ("partial pressure") as altitude increases.  But, 
a bus engine just has to burn the stuff and not pull it across a membrane 
first.  Is the loss of power a compression issue related to the decrease in 
ambient pressure?  Come on, we drive buses, we're nerds, somebody out there 
must have the answer.
