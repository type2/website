Subject: Vacuum leak in FI plenum

Hi all,

I re-subscribed just long enough to warn about something I found while 
preparing to paint my fuel injection plenum. It's a hairline crack, 
caused by flexing of the shorter leg of the plenum, the one that bolts 
to the flywheel end of the engine.

What flexing? I assume that it has been flexed over the years and 
fatigued while I and various POs installed runners, throttle, etc. It 
shouldn't move at all once it's installed.

I'm going to have to find someone with a TIG welder to sew it back up.

I doubt that this stress fracture is common, but it's something to look 
for if you are hunting for vacuum leaks and coming up one short.

Mark
