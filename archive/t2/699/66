Subject: Re: [T2] Best Battery Cables.

Chris,

See my rant for the year last december on this very subject.

Buy the ones at the flaps that *don't* use lead.  They are much better and 
come in various lengths.  The ground cable that I bought for my bus(78) 
actually had two grounding places on it...one of them happened to be 
perfect for attaching under the bottom ECU box connector.

They are generally marked for Hondas/accura or ford products.  If they 
don't sell that kind there, then go someplace that does.

They cost more, but that work about a zillion times better.

Cheers, dave
