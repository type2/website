Check out this metric catalog:

http://www.belmetric.com/html/catalog.htm

I just discovered them and they have an awesome selection of metric items
for our buses: wavy washers, exhaust nuts, bolts, nuts, studs, screws, fuel
and vacuum hoses, clamps, bulbs, terminals, etc.

Unfortunately they don't sell to the public...
