Subject: Where to buy dashboard bulb holders ?

Those plastic holders that take the 12v instrument panel bulbs
http://www2.cip1.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=VDO%2D600%2D808

They wear out and eventually never properly hold. Both the bus and the
golf need some of them to be replaced.

Buying them locally would be best / CIP1s price is outrageous.

Thanks  - Arnaud
