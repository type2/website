You should never ever smell gas in your bus. If you smell gas, you have a
dangerous gasoline leak. You are just super lucky you have not been burned
to death so far. I am sure you need to replace every connection going to
your gasoline tank and all the fuel lines on the engine.

I have put a bunch of pictures of burned up busses on a web site. I will
send you the pictures. You need to correct this problem because it is not
just you who could be hurt, but the other people when you get in a wreck
because you loose control of the burning bus.

Please go to the web site and look at the pictures. I have also included a
picture of the hose connections going to a 1978 Fuel injection bus gasoline
tank.

Please look at the pictures here:
