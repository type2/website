Amen Joe! Suprised I haven't seen you around the neighborhood.
We take our babe across country every year from Belmont Hills, PA to 
Spokane, WA with more pleasure than troubles. Currently having some 
rebuilding done on a head so we can get back across this summer. But 
this is just one of those aging problems that came from the PO using a 
rebuilt head that had been redone one too many times. I feel like I have 
had more problems from short, daily driving wear and tear than the long 
haul, highway driving. Our baby loves the road trips!
