It depends on the model. 68-71 is one length, 72-74 is another and 75-79 is yet another. The last cable mentioned is the longest at 48". It's 25mm2 which is about 4 AWG.

Most of the generic replacement cables are the smaller 6 AWG size. My original cable was in perfect condition, only the terminals had gone bad so I replaced them:
