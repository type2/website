Whoa- you advance your timing at  sea level, you risk detonation.  Use 
high octane gas and you will reduce that detonation.  Obviously one can 
lower the octane at altitude or they wouldn't sell it that way.  So you 
buy regular gas at altitude  and have your timing advanced-this wouldn't 
put you back to square one and risk detonation?

Shouldn't matter.  Higher octane gas resists *unintentional* early ignition
  and detonation, but in this case you're *intentionally* setting it off 
earlier
  than normal.
