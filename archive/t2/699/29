Some only measure the airflow like L-Jet, some the mass like LH-Jet.

Mass is the key at altitude: At 5,000 ft. above sea level, there is 14% less
oxygen in a given volume of air. At 10,000 ft. that amount drops to 30%
less. Not only is the engine getting less oxygen by mass it's also getting
less by volume because the atompheric pressure is lower and this means the
cylinders fill up with less air during each cycle. The cure? Lean out the
mixture slightly or advance the timing if driving at altitude for long
periods of time.
