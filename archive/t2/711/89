Subject: verify this hose size :)

i'm working on a little database for vw hose sizes.  could someone verify
the Inner Diameter of this hose for me.  i have two different entries in
my database.

N 20 361 2   Red Vacuum Diesel

also does this other hose have a "N" number associated with it?

443 121 107A  Vacuum & Cooling Hose Smooth
