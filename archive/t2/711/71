Your distributor is vacuum advance, so I'm pretty sure you want 1847V.

I am using 1847V, yes.  I used it with the stock coil, and also with  
the new high-output Compufire coil I installed along with my Mallory  
Hyfire 6A CDI.  Unless your coil is worn out, or you are installing a  
high-output ignition system, there is no reason for you to change coils.
