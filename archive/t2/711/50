Subject: Automatics & oil pump

Hello.  Below is an old archive message, and I have a question:

Mark says the oil pump in an automatic is different.  Q: How much different 
and why is it different.

Thanks.

Hello jamie   It was my understanding that they were done like that so that
when the motor was on the assemble line the tech would know that it was to 
be
an automatic motor taking the special oil pump and flex plate   Later and
