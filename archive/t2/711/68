I haven't given-up on Electronic ignition.  But having
achieved engine operation stability (big words meaning
"get the SOB running right again") was the goal.  So
we fell-back to points.  Now, over time, I will
convert back to Electronic Ignition.  
    
I try to make but one change to the bus at a time. 
That way, I can better gauge sources of trouble. 
Achieve a couple o'weeks of stability, and then make
another change.
   
It is unlikely I will return to the Accu-Fire /
Compu-Fire solutions.  T2 list members have indicated
a clear preference for both Pertronics and <MSD?>.  
   
I am using an Bruck "205" distributor.  I see the
Pertronics Elecronic Ignition model specified for a
205 is model PER-1847, along with a recommended
Flamethrower 1 coil.   Is that what you are using?
