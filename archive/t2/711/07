Subject: Re: [T2] LED lights.

random thoughts:

are RJ45 terminals as moisture-tolerant as automotive connectors?  (i would
think not, since the leads are clustered together such that one well-placed
drop of water could short them together -- if i were to use these i'd think
long and hard about how to keep them dry)

if you wire four 3-volt LEDs in series to make a cluster, can you then connect
such a cluster in parallel to a 12-volt supply?
