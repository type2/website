Subject: Cold being a relative term...

Hello Everyone,

I have a 1976 with FI that was starting rough about a month ago. Due to 
work duties taking me away for the last few weeks, I hadn't had it out 
since then. Yesterday, I went out in the morning and it wouldn't start. 
The temp was about 50 degrees F. Later in the day after basking in the 
sun and an air temp 70 or so, it started right up. So took it out for 
couple of short trips to the grocery and hardware stores. Today, the 
same thing, won't start when "cold" in the AM, but by 1:00 PM no 
problems....

I had it professionally tuned up at the end of December by a reputable 
local repair shop so I wouldn't have any problems passing smog (which it 
did just fine). Had anything been amiss, I am confident they would have 
let me know then.

Two years ago I put in a Bosch starter relay, so I am wondering if this 
has finally worn out and needs to be replaced. The battery is less than 
a year old, so I don't think that is the problem, but I can have it 
checked. Is there something else I should be looking into?

Any advice would be appreciated.

Thanks,
