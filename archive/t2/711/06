One more comment on non-baywindow conversions. Of all the ones out there,
the most amazing is the WBX6 kit from Oettinger.de (aka the Okrasa folks):

It's based on a 6-cyl waterboxer that Oettinger was designing for VW and
when VW dropped the idea, Oettinger bought all of the tooling and rights and
completed the work.
