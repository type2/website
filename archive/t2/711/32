The clutch disc looks good. Just make sure there is 2mm of material from the
top of the closet rivet to the surface. A new clutch has about 4mm so that
will give you an idea how worn it is.

You're flywheel seems really blue compared to what I'm used to seeing. Has
the clutch been slipping?

Your pilot bearing looks a little dry. Put a heavy grease in there, like
distributor grease.
