Subject: almost free transport available from Medford, OR to SF Bay

Hi Volks,

On Wednesday morning (March 23) I'm towing a 83.5 Westy from Medford, 
OR to the SF Bay Area.

I'm renting a U-haul truck in order to tow the U-haul trailer.

The cargo space of the truck will be empty!

Hopefully someone has something they need moved from the Medford area 
(or south of Medford on I-5)  to the Bay Area.
(engine, tranny, parts, boxes, etc?)

I'll help you move it, perhaps you can contribute something towards my gas?
