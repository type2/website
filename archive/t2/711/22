Subject: Clutch condition?

Hello all!

Had some time this weekend to get back to my task of swapping parts
over from my dead engine to an AVP rebuilt 2 liter ('83 aircooled). As
an indication of how little I really know about what I'm doing, I must
ask the list's advice as to the condition of my clutch assembly :)

Some pictures are posted at the links below - would you mind having a
look to see if you're able to tell the condition? I must warn you that
the files are large (~700KB) so not for the faint of bandwidth. If I
had to guess myself, I would say that the clutch looks in very good
shape - I think it was replaced when the PO had a GEX installed around
15000 miles ago. But I have no basis for comparison...

The metal surfaces are smooth and shiny, with the markings shown in the photo.

Thanks kindly for your help! I can't wait to get this thing rolling
once again :)

Cheers!
