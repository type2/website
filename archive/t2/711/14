I did.  I used the kit from EMPI they make for beetles.  It's a nice
kit, but being for beetles I had to make two modifications to make it
work in a bus:

- I made a bracket out of aluminum right-angle stock to hold the spool
housing to the seat base.  This was pretty straightforwards; I got the
pieces from a scrap yard, had them cut it to size, and then I drilled
the holes on my drill press.

- I had to move up the attachment point for the receiving end of the
buckle on the side of the seat base.  I drilled holes for the bolts, and
used very large fender washers to reinforce the mount point.

Overall, it was a pretty easy mod, and well worth it.

If anyone in Seattle wants to check it out, let me know.
