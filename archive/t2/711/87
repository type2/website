Subject: Windshield Frame Rust

Hi Gang,
 
Back after a long absence...work sent me from San Diego to Philly for the winter; I just got re-assigned to Phoenix (huge step in the right direction). Bus is still in San Diego, and that pesky rust under the windshield is getting bad. I don't have too much rust elsewhere, and the long term plan is to get the whole body preserved and repainted by someone who knows what they're doing (which will not be me). Anyhoo...I want to get the windshield thing fixed up in the meantime. Does anyone know of someone in SD or Phoenix who they'd recommend and what would the cost be? I know where to get the metal  replacement panel, but I've heard about fibergalss panels being used for that area. Anyone know about that?
 
Thanks,
Rick
