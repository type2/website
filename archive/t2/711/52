Subject: Vanagon Jump Seats (or other alternatives)

Howdy all,

We are expecting an addition to our family this fall, which will push
our total number to five.  Now, my '69 Westy only has four seat belts,
and I would like to extend our total seating capacity to six by
removing the sink and jumpseat units and replacing them with Vanagon
jumpseats, if possible.  With good seat belts.

Does anyone know what a fair price is for these, where I could get
some, or another alternative that I haven't even though of?  I would
really like to not have to sell the Bus to buy a passenger version;
(or a...gasp...Vanagon) but I suppose that is one of my options.

Thanks a hill, all.
