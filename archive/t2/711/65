Subject: [T2] Carwash Engine Death Update

Ran my 78 T2 through a car wash 2 weeks ago.  Failure
diag is in.  The Accu-fire (el-cheapo electronic
ignition) unit does not work well with moisture on the
magnetic pick-up.  
    
Off subject, but related...Now have successfully
converted from 009 distributor to Bruck "205" SVDA,
and from after-market Electronic ignition back to
points.  Engine is running better than ever.  Most
importantly, I offer opinion and evidence in favor of
SVDA distributors.  Too bad I wasted several years
with an 009.
