I had a very similar problem with my right turn signal prior to the madness
that I experienced lately (you may recall a post titled "Electrical
Adventures") -- all resolved by replacing worn-out fuses that still carried
some (but not enough) current.

I strongly recommend replacing all the fuses at the slightest suspicion of an
electrical problem... if they're old, they will fail partially without
warning.  As I learned myself, a partially failed fuse will cause you to go
chasing after bad connections when all that work isn't actually necessary.
