Subject: tail light question

Meg -- You are on the right track.  I've generally found lots of corrosion in  
tail lights. Acid fumes from the battery don't help. If you have a friend who 
(a) has a Dremel tool and (b) knows how to solder, try to enlist him to help. 
(Hint: the model train nuts generally do lots of soldering.) The crimp-on 
connectors may be solderable, but if there is corrosion between the existing 
conductor and the crimp area of the push-on connector, it may be best to 
replace with a new push-on -- get some ScotchBrite abrasive and clean the 
stranded wire; then solder.  Running a wire from the tail light housing to 
chassis ground is a good idea.  These steps will get you as close to a 
permanent fix as I know..... good luck.

Looks like what I am going to do is take both the tail light housing and the
side marker out and carefully clean all connections and tighten them. As well
as replace the fuse to the tail light. Then I don't know what but I will let
you know how it goes. Thanks for all the ideas. Meg
