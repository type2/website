Subject: Splitting a 2 liter case

Just for the experience, I am trying to split a completely trashed 2.0 case.

I have as many nuts off as I can see, and pretty much everything off  the 
outside (oil pump, fan hub, cylinders and pistons [3])  Everything except 
the FLEX PLATE!!

OK, the FLEX PLATE 'appears' to be welded on at three spots.  It cannot come 
off!! Again, this is a blown case.

I can see one nut under the flex plate that I imagine must come off.  I see 
the nut by BENDING the flex plate enough, but I cannot get to it.  I will 
probably have to cut through the flex plate at that point to get a 13m 
wrench on it.

Are there any other hidden fasteners behind the flex plate??  It will 
probably take me an hour to cut through the flexplate at that point, and it 
would help if I knew of other hidden obstacles

Thanks
