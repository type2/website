Subject: Re: [T2] LED lights.

Being an LED geek myself, I have a few comments.

First, many bulbs are available in LEDs. They go right into the stock sockets.

Second, LEDs have a VERY narrow beam compared to incandescent bulbs.
For brake lights, unless they're arrayed in a curve they won't be as
safe. The aftermarket LED bulb replacements overcome this by using the
stock lenses to diffuse the beam.

As for taking 3.3v LEDs and using them on a 12v circuit, no prob. Just
need the right resistors. ;-) Calculate your resistors for 14v. The
LEDs will be a bit underpowered but you won't burn them out when the
charging system hits 14v.

Personally, I'll be using LEDs as interior lighting, but not exterior lighting. 

A great LED source with lots of good specs and info is http://www.lsdiodes.com .
