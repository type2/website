Yes, I am Karl.

Sorry, when you live in a state that requires 100% functional AND totally correct emission control you tend to
not call it crap and BS!

When removing what you call crap causes you to become a 'gross polluter' and there is NO limit to the amount
of $$ you have to spend to correct the tampering you did to the emission control systems, you tend not to call
it crap or BS!

After finally beginning to see mountains 50 miles away after living here 30 years because the smog is slowly
clearing, you tend not to call it crap os BS!

After seeing countless shade tree 'mechanics' screw up cars because of a lack of education on how an engine is
supposed to run when each individual system works correctly, you tend not to call it crap or BS!

If you want to keep your customers coming back because you don't to tell them the truth, THAT is crap and BS!

The 1st step to fixing something that is wrong is understanding how it works. If you don't know that, how do
YOU fix it?? Call it crap and BS and sell the guy a 009, Weber carb, and a lot of chrome?




 

pretty much and end of story and saga thanks mark i did know what crap you were talking about and again thanks for putting it into my terms so that i would understand what crap you were talking about before the BS really hit the fan....

either way the crap is fixed now and either way this crappy shade tree mechanic fixed it 3 states away....

now to go finish tilling the garden....

 hope i dont step in dog crap doing so... OHh crap...could be worse could be Bullshyt..

have a grateful day....

peace and love
