Subject: Re: [T2] REV HAPPY

hello Guys  The formula vee guys will rev to about 6500 rpm  this is with a 
40 hp motor tweeked to put out about 63 hp this is using stock valve springs 
and push rods. I think that the points will float out about 6500 rpms  . 
Remember that if you push this you take the chance of the gland nut coming off the 
flywheel and trashing your flywheel and crank  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
