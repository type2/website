Subject: Alternate Trannies.

Are their any Automatic Trannies from various other vehicles that
could possibly be bolted on, maybe with a kit to a '76 bus?

I'm thinking that it would be great to have a good auto tranny with
just push buttons or something on the dash for gear selection.

On a slightly different thought, has anyone ever looked into putting a
not only a different engine (like a subby) into our engine bays, but a
tranny as well? I'm thinking maybe like a Nissan Maxima, or a Honda
Vtec style setup. Just put the engine in "backwards"?  Might have to
relocate the gas tank, but that's not biggie eh?

Anyone ever see alternate tranny's in Bays?
