Subject: RE: [T2] Windshield Frame Rust

The only thng I saw about this repair was to cut from a donor bus and
transplant the piece on the sick bus.  I already did a repair making very
small piece at the time to "guide" on remaining sheet metal but this is a
very long process.  If new sheet metal is available I am also very
interested to know.
