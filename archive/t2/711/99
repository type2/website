Will it not crank when it is cold or will it crank but not fire? 

If it won't fire (but cranks) then I would check the thermoswitch for the cold start injector. Your engine might require the thermoswitch to work when it is cold, but once it is warm it doesn't care whether the engine gets that extra squirt of fuel or not. These switches might be fragile because I have YET to find one working. My engine would start without the cold start injector at temps above 40 if I cracked the throttle just a bit. Below that and I'd have to "prime" the engine with a squirt of WD-40 for a starting fluid. 

Lastly check your fuel pressure.
