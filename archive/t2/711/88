Have you checked in the archives? There are a few jet combinations listed 
there. I thought mine were listed there but couldn't find them. :(( I'll 
dig out the scrap of paper they're written on and list them.

There is also some good info in the Type 2 library about progressive 
jetting (and adjustment)

Cheers,
