John,

As faster laster said, it could be either.  Might be very easy to do this, 
clamp a hose off between the pump and the carb and see if it leaks into 
the case.

If it leaks more, it is surely the pump casuing at least part of the 
problem...you might still have carb problem too, but at least you will 
know about the pump...

Cheers, dave
