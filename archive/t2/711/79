Subject: pulling engine without a jack

Hi everybody,

I'm very proud of myself, so I figured I'd share that with you. :)

Yesterday I pulled my (very heavy) 911 engine (w/ tranny) out of the '75
bus and did so without a floor jack. Being by myself, I was not looking
forward to the prospect of having to balance 400+ lbs of engine on a
jack. Moreover, I wanted the engine to be on a palette.

I should note that my rear valence is cut out, a la pre '71. (I'll
reattach it later.)

So I bolted 4 caster wheels to the palette, slid the palette under the
engine with 1 inch of clearance left. I then deflated the rear tires
until the engine barely sat on the palette, removed the engine crossbar
and the bolts supporting the tranny, and finally reinflating the tires
to allow the tranny support bracket clear the tranny.

The hardest part was inflating the tires with a manual pump. That took a
lot of time and sweat...
