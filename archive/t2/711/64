Hi Blake,

You don't really need a full passenger seat for what you're planning, 
you just need an anchor point to mount a child's seat onto. Using an 
adult seat as a mounting place for a child seat is a compromise at the 
best of times, because the child seat and the adult seat are never 
designed specifically to work together. A recent roadside survey by 
Ontario traffic police found more thhan half of the car seats in use 
were not fastened to the vehicle correctly.

Please note: I am not a transportation engineer, nor do I play one on 
TV. Nor am I a lawyer. Use the following advice at your OWN risk, not 
mine. IIRC, we bolted the child's seat into the rear-facing seat on our 
73 westy and it worked fine. But that was more than 7 years ago.

What I would do in your situation is design a strong furniture-grade 
plywood box using heavy metal brackets inside and bolt it firmly 
together with M8 bolts. The car seat would then bolt to the box, and 
the box would bolt to the floor. This would be at least as strong as 
the Z-bed. Put a cut-out in the front of the box and it could be used 
for additional storage of camping gear, etc.

Happy trails,
