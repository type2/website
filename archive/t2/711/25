Subject: Re: tail light question

Last weekend I stumbled across the problem that was causing one of my 
taillights not to work. The tricky bit was that there was 12v showing at 
the socket when the light should have been on. No amount of cleaning, 
swapping globes, etc worked. The problem was that the fuse had broken but 
was still touching. Presumably this allowed the multimeter to register 12v 
but did not allow enough current through to light the taillight!

Checking the other fuses I found another one that fell apart when I touched 
it! I have replaced all of the similarly ancient fuses and suggest that 
everyone does likewise - it can save you a lot of grief.

The problem I was tracking down when I found the dodgy fuses was that the 
driving lights fitted by a DPO had been wired with a relay and a switch, 
but with the full current to the lights passing through both the relay and 
the switch! The wire bringing power from the fuse box also had two inline 
fuses - one at either end. :) I have fixed this wiring but found that 200w 
(2 x 100w) of driving lights is probably borderline for the alternator (if 
you want to run other stuff). I'm going to swap over to 2 x 50w b/c I still 
like the extra light. ( FYI My headlights have 60/55w halogen globes)

Cheers,
