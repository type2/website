Subject: Fuse panel replacement.

Thanks to those who replied to my earlier message about the turn signal 
problems. Turns out it was the Emergency Flasher Relay and after a good 
cleaning it's as good as new. Thanks.

Anyhow I really dislike the fuse bus that is currently installed for the 
"German type" fuses. I was wondering if anyone knew of a after market 
replacement for use with blade type fuses or any type of better solution.

Thanks again,
Andrew
