Subject: Compression test results

I've just done a compression test on my 79 FI engine.  The results are as 
follows:

3 = 120     1 = 120
4 = 140     2 = 140

     I double-checked each cylinder just to make sure.  I have read that 
there should be no more than 3 percent difference between each cylinder.  
So, what does this mean?  Does the engine have to be rebuilt or something?  
I also tried spraying WD-40 into cylinder #1, but there was no difference.  
Here is how I checked:

1) Removed all spark plugs
2) Disconnected coil
3) Disconnected Fuel pump
4) Screwed in compression tester to cylinder 1
5) Turned over engine with the starter 3-4 times
6) Checked compression gauge, release pressure, repeat

Repeated steps 4-6 for each cylinder, then again for cylinder one and three 
to verify.

Any thoughts on this?  Did I do the test correctly?
