Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon Jump Seats (or other alternatives)

This is a topic also important to me. Can anybody provide pics of suitable frames if I wanted to use front seats for jump seats? I am thinking a frame made of square tubing with a triangulated brace on the sides in case of impact. And I suppose lap belts would be enough? 

I've added Vanagon seats up front and want to use the original front seats for the jump seats. My other option would be to use a narrowed Z-bed facing backwards but of course I'd lose the walkthrough ability which I'd prefer to keep. 

Opinions on how to fasten them to the floor? Thinking plates similar but larger than the seat belt anchors. 

Would be nice to keep them removable. 

Chris
