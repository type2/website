Subject: tail light question

Hi,
Looks like what I am going to do is take both the tail light housing and the
side marker out and carefully clean all connections and tighten them. As well
as replace the fuse to the tail light. Then I don't know what but I will let
you know how it goes. Thanks for all the ideas.
Meg
