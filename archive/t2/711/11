Well, that's why! You haven't named him yet!!! 

;-)

If you have the $$ and really want to learn about your baby, buy an
AVP engine from Bus Depot and then tear down your stock 1700 and
rebuild it yourself. If I had the dosh that's what I'd be doing.
Especially now that I have a garage to do it in.

What exactly is wrong with your bus that is keeping you from driving
it? My 73 has oil leaks, carb issues, etc etc etc, yet I still drive
him every day.
