Subject: POR-15 Solution

Hi.  I bought some POR-15 and POR-20 last weekend for touchup on the VWs, 
butI did not get any POR-15 Solution, the authorized thinner for the 
products.


Does anyone know what I an use instead of POR-15 Solution for a thinner; 
what IS POR-15 Solution??

Thanks.  Barry sends
