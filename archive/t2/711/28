Subject: was alternate trannies, now engine conversions

Has anyone found websites with info about, or companies that do, the Porsche
6-cylinder conversion? There are a couple of these Porsche-powered busses
running around Colorado, but they all seem to be one-off jobs done by someone
who knew a lot about Porsches and wanted the ultimate "sleeper". (okay, pun
intended)

BTW, that Oettinger conversion looks freakin' cool!

One more comment on non-baywindow conversions. Of all the ones out there,
the most amazing is the WBX6 kit from Oettinger.de (aka the Okrasa folks):

It's based on a 6-cyl waterboxer that Oettinger was designing for VW and
when VW dropped the idea, Oettinger bought all of the tooling and rights and
completed the work.
