Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon Jump Seats (or other alternatives)

Alternatives to go from 5 to 6 passengers??

Replace the rear seat and suicide cabinet with a full width setup.  Just 
add/replace a larger back and fanny wood section, cover the addition with 
foam (the seat and the fanny foam are different thickness and different 
widths, so you will have to tailor the foam.)

You can recover the longer rear seat and the jump seat with 'new' vinyl.  
Just staple them on..

[BTW, our local Hancock Fabrics store had a March sale that included 
sections of vinyl.  I didn't know the vinyl was on sale, and I was there 
just 30 minutes before closing on the night before the sale was to start.  
They gave me the sale price on the vinyl because they said they had posted 
the sale prices already.  I got some really fine, fabric backed vinyl at 
LESS THAT $2 per running yard, 54" width!!] Hey, at ten yards, $20, you 
could redo the whole back section.

Also, fabricate another jump seat.

The Vanagon jump seats are fairly hard to come by locally (I have only seen 
2 pairs in 8 years), but they are on the auction site.  A bit pricy, though.


OK, a real reasonable alternative is to get the swivel seat base pedestals 
from a junk yard conversion van.  They bolt/unbolt right through the floor.  
There may even be suitable seat belts for these conversion van seats.  If 
you get the tracks from the seats and the seat pedestals as well, you could 
attach those conversion van seat tracks to late bay/ Vanagon seats and you 
are home free....
