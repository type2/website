5400 rpm I think is the number. Depends on the valve train first. Valves floating I think in this engine before anything bottom-end has problems. Hard on the valve seats too because the valves bounce at highest revs. Can wear the seats and stretch valve stems. All this from memory so hopefully I have given you topics to read up on to confirm my info. 

www.shoptalkforums.com has alot of gurus if Type 2 doesn't have enough info for you... 

I also recommend reading the Berg technical notes. I have a set and remember that they were good the last time I read them in 1997 or so.
