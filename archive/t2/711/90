I got off work early last Sunday.. which enabled me to run out to the
triple X drive in waaaaay out in Issyqua washington.. very nice turn
out of cars and buses and bugs.. about a 50-50 mix of air and water
cooled Vee Dubs.. Kudos to the NWVWC for organizing this GTG. It's good
to see that the air and water cooled crowds are starting to mix it up.
I had a conversation with a fellow air cooled Dubber and he was kind of
lamenting the fact that so many water cooled kidz showed up..
  My response is this.. welcome them in.. show some interest in their
passion.. then it will be reciprocated. These days the air cooled crowd
puts on the large "legacy" shows.. that being the ones that have been 
going on for a long period of time. As time crawls by.. the kidz will
be
taking up the task of keeping them going.. Welcome them in now and you
and
your air cooled will be welcomed in then.

The person who says it cannot be done.... 
should not interrupt the person doing it.
