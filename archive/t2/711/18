Subject: RE: [T2] Compression test results

All,
     I just read Ratwell's faq's online.  According to his directions on how 
to do a compression test, I should have warmed up the engine before I did 
these tests.  I'm not sure how much that would affect these numbers, but 
I'll try this again tomorrow after warming the engine and see if it changes. 
  This is also a FI engine, with hydraulic valves, so perhaps they weren't 
'pumped up' when I did the test?

     I'd still be interested in hearing what you think about these results, 
in case they don't change :-)


Thanks,
Jaybird
