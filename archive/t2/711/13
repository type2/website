3 of my plug wires weren't well attached to the bakelite ends and the
wire part was corroded. I just cleaned them as well as possible and
screwed the ends back in. These wires are about a year old. Kinda
ticked me off.

Yes, I need a new draglink pin.

A while back I had cleaned and coated my chin shield/pedal
shield/whatevertheheckit'scalled with spray on truck bedliner. Still
no chips, scratches, or rust. Very impressive. Just mud and dirt.
