Subject: Re: [T2] pulling engine without a jack

Sami.
Your ingeneous! Much more refined than I!
 I have done something like this before.. but I use an old tire.. I just yank
the engine off the transmission so it comes right out, and falls straight down.
PLUNK on the tire!  ,,, then I tip the engine around enough to drag the tire out
from under it..... and then drag the engine out from under the bus... come to
think of it.. I think that is how I got the missus home after the last
campout... caveman like! hmm,,, or was it the other way around??
