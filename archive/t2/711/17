Subject: Re: [T2] Compression test results

I've just done a compression test on my 79 FI engine.  The results are as
follows:

3 = 120     1 = 120
4 = 140     2 = 140
---------------------

i have very little experience with aircooled engines but i do play with
1.9 wasserboxers :).  that said i hope i don't start a flame fest about
this, this is what i have seen on all the 1.9's i have played with.
cylinders 1 and 3 always have lower compression on well worn engines.  i
have split a few of these engines and this is what i have discovered.
the main crank bearing closest to the flywheel was starting to move
around due to the crank beating the journal out of round.

i think that what happens is as the crank starts moving around that puts
minor angular stresses on the components at that end causing the parts to
wear faster and thus the early compression loss in those cylinders.  i
have no way to prove this i'm just trying to back figure from the data
that i have taken and seen myself.

i would guess that your engine is sort of like the ones i had in that it
still has good power and produces no real noises.  so on the rebuild end
if you believe me its just a question of how long you want to keep beating
up those crank journals.  that in concert with what you personal financial
situation is.
