I've still got my pump and the canister thing that sets on top of the
fan shroud. Just need a pulley for the pump.

I'm not gonna worry about it yet until I get the carbs rebuilt and see
if I need that equipment to pass smog here in Colorado. As long as I
stay stock I plan on having all of it installed eventually.

My injection tubes are *mostly* intact. They were cut towards the rear
of the engine (front is front) for some reason. For that matter, most
of the ones I've seen were cut there. Hmmm...
