Subject: Re: [T2]Copper gasket seals /exhaust leak problems????

hello Don    These had a rubber connector that was always broken on the ones 
I have seen here on the east coast. I would think that they would be NLA since 
they only came on about 3 years of the buses and I think some of the porsche 
914 . I might have some here at the shop seeing as they arent used here much 
at all . Post it on the list and see if any turn up  .  On another note  how 
are you enjoying Colorado?  Have you had a chance to meet Troy Wical Do so if 
you can he is a real good guy. I  helped him fix his motor  acouple of years ago 
when he lived in North Carolina   later and have fun  Mark Dearing
