 Just to be clear, that bolt still is inserted from front to back, and it 
 screws into this flange.  I'm off to the hardware store this morning to 
 pick up a new bolt.

A word of advice:  Get a Allen headed bolt!

The original 68 bolt was a D bolt with the nut on the engine side. The trans has casting to allow the 
head of the D bolt to lock in place.

Now you are wanting to put a hex headed bolt in from the trans side.......
Guess what happens when that hex head locks in place?
It is not a pretty picture!
