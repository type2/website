Subject: Front Door Weatherstrip/Seal Question 

Howdy,

I hope somebody might be able to answer a quesion about the front door 
seals.
I had thought I had gotten the Genuine Door Seals from OE but when I put one 
on today the fit is terrible so perhaps I didnt get the Genuine ones.

With the drivers side door open looking at the inside of the door straight 
on here is what I notice from the one I have and an original one I have on 
my 68 Double Cab.

The lower left corner does not come to a 90 degree point on the new seal I 
have.
The upper left corner does not have the extra 90 point to rest against the 
body.

Basically the only place that the new seal comes to a 90 point is under the 
door stop on the lower right corner.

I notice Bus Depots say 'Genuine German OEM VW Seal '.

Am I to assume that the seal is correct on all of the corners?
And that the corners that have a 90 degree point (which is basically almost 
all of the corners that come to 90 degress) on Ron's seal have the corrrect 
corners?

Thanks
Kevin
