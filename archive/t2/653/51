probably not and since the connection to the crank is the same it may be
same components.

torque converter would probably be fine, but since the actual gearbox used
in the bus is the same as the early rabbit/scirocco/dasher/ &  Audi
fox/100LS/5000.  so the question of handling the extra would probably not
be a big deal.   but I wonder since the tranny seems to be the weak point
in a bus (auto tranny) it seems it would be putting a lot of extra stress
on the weak link.  doubt I would try it but it is your tranny.
