Subject: High Temp Powder Coating

High temperature powder for header and exhaust manifold applications! We're
pleased to present this range of 4 High Temperature Exhaust System coatings
similar in color to our popular liquid high temp coatings. These high
silicone content powders withstand temperatures up to 1000 degrees F and
offer superior durability when compared to brush and spray-on coatings. Must
be applied to clean bare metal. For best results abrasive blast and spray
with PRE Painting Prep (10041Z) or acetone. Do not use over surfaces
pretreated with any product that leaves a phosphate coating like Oxisolv or
Metal Wash.
----------------------- Clip -----------------------------
You'll find out that 1000 degrees isn't enouggh heat range for any parts
close to your exhaust ports.
It will probably work fine on a muffler or tailpipe but 1200 + is normal at
exhaust ports even without turbo charging.
