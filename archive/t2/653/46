You've already noted the pressed-in mount bolt on the bellhousing flange
to take a bolt from the front.

The reason for this is that the '71 has a doghouse cooler that makes
getting at that nut rather difficult.  The cooler needs to have a duct
that passes through the '71-only front engine tin, so make sure that those
parts are in place.  If you leave the duct off and simply dump the oil
cooler air in the engine bay you will compromise your cooling system.
