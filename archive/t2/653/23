I bought European OE seals from OEVeedub in June 2003. All of the window
seals were top notch. The body seals were excellent except for two:

- engine lid seal. See http://www.ratwell.com/technical/EngineLidSeal.html
- front door seals

The front door seals weren't identical to the original (missing top corner
at rear) but they fit properly on the driver's side and while the passenger
door was harder to close they kept out water, air and light so I didn't
worry about it.

I went with this seal to save a few bucks...

...when this seal dropped in price to $59 I purchase a pair.

It is identical to the original:
