Hey guys,

I worked hard to get those links posted before I had to go to work today, 
and just read the CR article myself. I apologize that it isn't complete...I 
didn't realize. I wish I had the other pages to it but didn't receive them.

Maria if you are out there I'd like to get them if you have them!! Hope the 
bus is coming along ok, I deleted your email so contact me at 
robhenley(-at-)baywindowbus.com if you are still out there.
