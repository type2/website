How about anyone looking to peel off $25 to $30k for a late model Eurovan?? 
The Baywindow done right will
cost half as much to keep serviced than the Eurovan. It's a big bargain and 
will halve your cost per mile
for 10 years or 200,000 miles as a most reasonable goal. Every Eurovan I 
ever saw more than 5 years old
that had a history file showed some big invoices in there. Much of it 
related to extended service
intervals the marketers like to market.

Know as well, if you want to service the Eurovan you will need a code 
scanner to DIY. Very few to none of the
low cost peg hook scanners will access the system. And oil change requires 
a lift, as the undercover must be removed to access the oil filter, a big 
one costing twice as much as an OC-108. And you thought the vent and vacuum 
lines were confusing on your Bus??? The Eurovan Bentley is 2 volumes both 
twice the thickness of the Bus Bible, and correspondingly 3X the price.

So, put 20 large in something for interest or equity gains and spend 
$10,000 on the Bus and forgo the Eurovan. Your retirement will love you for 
it.
