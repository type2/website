Subject: Re: [T2] 80-83 Vanagon site search

A big thanks to Tom and Richard for their info on the heat tubes. Tom sent 
me a couple pictures that described the correct orientation. Quite helpful! 
Richard said to check for a part number stamped on one end of the tube, this 
being the end that connects to the heat exchanger. Turns out that this rule 
of thumb holds true for the 80 Vanagon, just like the bay window bus.

Having two different perspectives to look at and having bothe confirm the 
other leaves me confident that I have it right.

Thanks to you two and all the others who sugested some great web sites to 
check. I have tried to keep track of the Vanagon sites that have info about 
the 80-83 models and will post them soon.

You are all the best,
Tom
