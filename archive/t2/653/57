Subject: Windshield Wiper Questions

Pardon me as I have looked for an answer here in the archives: no luck...

The wipers on my 71 Westy at times barely move across the windshied and then
at other times seem to move fine. You would think there was a vacum issue here
or something.

They do work but so slow it's painful when raining . I've applied 3 gallons of
RainX  to help here but it's driving me crazy.

And when its moving slow I can turn the knob to the fast position and it
doesn't get any faster....

Thanks,

Trey Jung
71 Westy
