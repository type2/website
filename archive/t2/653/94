Subject: Re: [T2] 1978, window crank failed

$30 new.  I was getting quoted $20 used all over the place so figured 
$10 extra was a no brainer considering their lifespan. I was in the 
same boat as you, been driving VW's for about 25 years and this is the 
first crank that's taken a dump on me. I added a little more lube 
before installation just to make sure it'd run smooth. Left and right 
are different. Here's BD's link:

good luck.
