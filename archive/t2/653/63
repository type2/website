Subject: Re: [T2] AFM core value

Steve,

I believe the busboys and busdepot list core values.
Though I think maybe one of them started just selling them
outright recently.  Wouldn't chuck it. Somebody'll want it.

Billy

does a used AFM that doesn't test to spec have any value, is it repairable,
> is there core value, is it all out trash?
