Just to be clear, that bolt still is inserted from front to back, and it 
screws into this flange.  I'm off to the hardware store this morning to 
pick up a new bolt.

Ah, I was wondering about the tin.  It has the opening for the oil 
cooler.  There are also 2 other pieces of tin with it.  I'm sure I can

the whole thing.  Thanks for the tip!
