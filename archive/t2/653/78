Subject: Itty Bitty Bosch starter

Just got Freebirds turnkey 2 L dual carb engine today (300lbs shipping 
weight!   I was intrigued with the Itty bitty starter.  The sticker on 
it says Bosch SR15N part number's 6 004 AA0 021 and it's just about the 
same size as a 14 oz can of beans (not including the solenoid).  I 
researched it and found on the Autohaus Arizona website they say "From 
time to time, we hear the complaint that on some cars the SR15N (Bosch 
new starter) cannot be installed properly due to an interference between 
the starter solenoid and the heat exchanger/hot air box. This condition 
seems especially prevalent on VW Type II and Bus/Transporter vehicles." 

Has anyone experienced this with their bus, it'll be a few weeks till 
I'm ready to put the motor in my 74 so I'd like to know?
