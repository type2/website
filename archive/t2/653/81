=D

Since I'm completely rebuilding my interior, the 73's bizarre interior
isn't an issue. I happen to really like my 1700 and stock dual carbs
(but I'm always looking for a complete FI kit!) and since the brakes
and everything else is about as modern as it gets I'm happy.

I don't know what I would do if I didn't have that engine hatch
though. LoL!!! I can't imagine trying to tune the carbs while reaching
in from the back!
