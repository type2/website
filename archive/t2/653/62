Subject: High Temp Powder Coating

Hi All,

So I'm wondering if anyone has experience with high temp. powder coating?

Here's a URL:
http://www.eastwoodco.com/shopping/product/detailmain.jsp?itemID=91&itemType=PRODUCT&iMainCat=710&iSubCat=717&iProductID=91

I'm thinking about buying a bag to do the exhaust system with but it's 
fairly expensive so I'm hoping to see if anyone has dealt with it before 
I do.

TIA,
Harry
