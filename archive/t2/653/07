Subject: Re: [T2] Front Door Weatherstrip/Seal Question

My new seal (not from BD, but "OEM" label) has the same problem. In
fact, I can see daylight from the top front corner of the door when
it's shut. There are supposed to be big meaty corners at the tops, but
these aftermarket ones don't seem to have them. I'm NOT buying another
so I'm probably just gonna mickey mouse something to fill those top
corners.

(I still wonder WTF the manufacturer was thinking when making the
BOTTOM of the door seal better than the TOP. 
gggggggrrrrrrrrrrrr.............)
