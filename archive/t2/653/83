Since I'm completely rebuilding my interior, the 73's bizarre interior
isn't an issue. I happen to really like my 1700 and stock dual carbs
(but I'm always looking for a complete FI kit!) and since the brakes
and everything else is about as modern as it gets I'm happy.

Well........ the rear brakes could be a little more modern by installing 
Vanagon self-adjusters.  And hydraulic lifters....... And electronic ignition
[preferably the 79-83 Calif magnetic set-up]......
