That sounds to me like the fuel vapor reclamation system.  This system 
includes:

- small hose that connects the fuel tank vent lines to the a charcoal 
canister mounted on the firewall just to the left of the decel valve.  
This small hose connects to the end that faces right.

- large hose that connects to the left end of the charcoal canister to 
a nipple on the fan shroud.  This provides a small amount of air 
pressure for the system.

- large host that connects to the right end of the charcoal canister to 
a valve on the air cleaner.  This lets reclaimed fuel vapors enter the 
intake air stream to be burned up.

- A vacuum hose that connects to a small nipple on this air cleaner 
valve that causes this valve to be when the engine is running at speed 
(not idling).


The Fuel Pressure Regulator is located on right side of the engine at 
the rear tin, beyond the #1 fuel injector.  It is the last thing on the 
fuel rail in the engine compartment.  It's kind of hard to reach, and 
much easier to see if the AFM has been removed.
