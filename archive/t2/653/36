Subject: Difference between 1971 vs. 1968 Engines

I have a 68' with a stock SP 1600.  That engine needs a rebuild, and since 
I'm moving I decided it would be much quicker and cheaper to drop a new 
(different) engine.  I got my hands on a solid running 71' DP (engine code 
AE 300194) and swapped engines yesterday no problem.  My question is, what 
are the differences between the two engines that I need to know about.

I've noticed some interesting things, like the top left bolt that holds the 
engine and transmission together is different.  On the 71', the engine case 
has threads, where as on the 68' has just a hole and uses a nut to secure 
(like the other 3 bolts).  Can I readily buy this bolt?  It also appears 
the oil filter is different, as I couldn't get my spare from the 68' into 
the 71'.

It also looks like a different distributer, so I'm assuming that means 
different cap, rotor, points, and condenser.  What about the plugs?  I'd 
also like to install my Petronix in the new engine.

Anything else I should be aware of?  I'm taking it from Chicago -> DC in a 
couple of weeks, so I want to make sure I have it completely tuned up and 
have a full complement of spares.

TIA.
