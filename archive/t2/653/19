Subject: Re: [T2] Front Door Weatherstrip/Seal Question 

Hiya Kevin,

After my experience with front door seals, I'll offer up a little well-meant 
advice.  Before you do anything else, get in contact with Ron Salmon.  Ask him 
about the seals and the options you have.  Ron is, in my opinion, the best 
possible source for this sort of information.  He imports it and has to sell the 
stuff.  He knows the product and the market.

I went to him after a terrible episode with West Coast Metric seals.  He 
shared his knowledge with me (and remember, he does handle WCM products) and I 
wound up buying VW Brazil seals.  Not aftermarket Brazil stuff, but genuine VW 
parts.  Fit like a glove.  No, these did not have the corner pads, but they were 
very satisfactory in all other respects, including price.

Give the guy a call.
