Now you've done it!  The type IV folks will be on you like ugly on a pit
bull!  :)

The type IV engine is actually a great improvement over the type 1.  The
only "problem" with it is the fact that not nearly as many were produced.
This means that parts prices are higher.  The tradeoff is that you don't
need to buy those parts nearly as often!

Done right, a type IV engine will make better power and last far longer
than a type 1.  The cases are far more durable and the lubrication system
is superior, including a (gasp!) oil filter!

Now, I like the type 1 in my '71, but I wouldn't reject a nice '74 with a
type IV engine.
