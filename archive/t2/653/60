Trey,

Time to get serious.

After 30+ years, pull everything, grease everything, clean all 
connections, including the fuse holder for the wipers.

Volkswagen  windshield wipers to not work on vacuum, but plain old battery 
power.

Do be carefull on reinstall...put the wipers on last!..after you have 
tested everything else and are sure that they park correctly.

Oh, and watch out for fingers...windshield wipers motors are geared very 
strong and will eat fingers....don't ask how I know<grin>.

Cheers, dave
