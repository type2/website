Yes, I Have a single tail pipe muffler which my Local VW mechanic  
recommended, I think he said something about a little more horse power. I does  not 
extend past the frame, it is a few inches short.
It is fairly new so I am considering putting one of those chrome extensions  
to put the pipe past the frame and past the bumper.
What do you think?
 
 
 
Thank You, any advice will be welcome
