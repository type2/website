Subject: 2 litre heads

Some of you may recall the trouble fellow list member John Baird was having
with an issue where he couldn't get up to speed with his bus. Turns out he had
2 problems: a cracked head and a worn cam lobe. He found a good cam and
lifters (thanks Michael Knight), but John

needs a good 2 litre head on the driver's side (the one tapped for the temp.
sensor). His bus is a 77 and so he needs the oval ports, not the square port
heads found on the 79 baywindow or Vanagon.

Ironically John also rescued Laura Blue's old bus and it turns out that the
problem with her bus is a cracked head on the same side!!

So he needs two of these 2 litre heads, one more desperately than the other as
his bus was his wife's daily driver.

I am thinking that it is possible to use the head from the other side and tap
the hole for the temp sensor, but neither of us have the experience or the tap
and die to do this. Would it be a tough job or something we could do if we
only find the heads withought the hole. Lastly this brings up the thought that
John can no longer use the cliche that he needs so and so like he needs a hole
in his head!!

If any of you have a good used head or two and are willing to sell and ship to
Charlotte, NC you can email or call me 704 649-4527 or John 704 545-0713. John
has cash or between the two of us we have a fair amount of parts to trade bus
and beetle.

Thanks for any input,
