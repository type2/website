I must concur, also having owned several. 1971 is probably the best of the
bug-engined bay-window busses (thanks to its servo assisted disk brakes and
dual port engine), and is what I'd look for if I wanted the simplicity of a
Type 1 engine. But I still prefer the Type 4 engine myself, especially in
1.8 to 2.0 liter configurations. (The 1.7L offered a minimal performance
improvement over the bug engine, with added parts cost.) In its later
incarnations, the Type 4 engine is noticably more powerful in stock
configuration, and you don't overheat your engine if your V-belt fails. Of
course there's that pesky valve seat design flaw, but it's nothing a pair of
AVP heads (which we sell) won't fix.  Coupled with a superior camper layout
(the '76-up Westy has largely the same interior layout that continued all
the way through the Eurovan camper), this has made the '76-up my favorite
Westfalia.

This actually began in '75 (or more accurately, late in '74), not in '76.

> hydraulic lifters that do not require frequent valve adjustments

Only on '78 and '79.

> engine access is much better with removeable top hatch

This began in '73.

> they have disk brakes

This began in '71.

The double bed up top began in '74, although the "ground floor" layout was
improved in '76 (at the expense of passenger seating).
