Subject: lights dim

hello everyone,

if anyone can tell me what this means would be awesome.  what may it mean 
when my headlight dim when accelerating when stopped????  and my lights are 
pretty dim all the time??

i have a 72 w/pancake, weber progressive carb(which is a pain in the neck 
now temps are dipping below 30 degrees) and 009 dizzy.

aside from lights dimming, it also has trouble with power when trying to 
speed up.

any thoughts?

thanks,
patrick
