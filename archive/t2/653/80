Subject: High Temp Powder Coating

Most ceramkrome header coatings require an oven cure at 750 + degrees.
Most powder coatings reach full gloss potential at about 450 (f) oven
curing.
I'm not saying that Eastwoods 'Hotcoat Powder Satin Black Hi Temp' wouldn't
work on many exhaust parts.
I'm just saying don't expect much if you coat pipes next to exhaust ports
that easily reach 1000 + degrees.
I figure it'll be just fine for tailpipes, mufflers and exhaust two or more
feet from the exhaust ports.
Other than just the aspect of appearance I don't see any claims of improved
exhaust gas flow, improved HP, reduced engine bay temperatures or rust and
corrosion resistance.
I'd like to hear about your experience with the Eaastwood product if you
choose to use it.
