I've actually seen that quote before and found it an odd commentary. There's
also no mention of that in the archives.

Could this be a problem with the 67 bus? That model uses the same 12v
starter and the heat exchanger exits from the rear on the Type 1 engine. All
the previous starters were 6V so they would be a different part number.
