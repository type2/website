That would not be powdercoating, that would be ceramic coating which handles
temps above 450 degrees. Powdercoating melts at about 400-450 deg. which is
what mufflers reach fairly easily.

I had a shop powercoat my exhaust pipes on my motorcycle that were all

discolored. They coated them with an aluminum compound and they're still

clean 2 years later. Only cost me about $25 per pipe.
