Richard,

Typical "at the port" installation of air-conditioning.

The guys at the port got paid by the vehicle and were often under pressure 
to get it done so that it could get on a truck and get to the dealer to be 
delivered.

I don't think that *any* installer ever did it according to the specs in 
the installation sheet.  Mine had about 3/4" of opening around almost all 
of it....just wonderfull to suck hot muffler aair right back over the 
engine.

This is one fo the reasons that I did all the extra work to install the 
rotary compressor in mine *and* have all of the original tin intact!

Cheers, dave
