Harry,

You can see a different color of hi-temp here.

The heater box and heat dump tube were done with their hi-temp 
coating...still looks great.

A bag?

You do have a powder coat gun, right?

Remember that it has to fit in an oven and that you can *NOT* use your
regular kitchen oven.

Otherwise, you need a radiant(infrared) heater like the ones here...

Might be easier to send it out for hot jet coating...one of the list 
members does that for a living.

Cheers, dave
