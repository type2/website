Ok, an update.

I thought a little about the problem last night, and determined that 
the problem must be the use of the tach output from the CDI box.

So, this morning I went out to the bus and made a very simple 
modification to my terminal block wiring.  I remove the "tach output" 
wire, and jumpered the "from points" CDI wire to the terminal where the 
"to tach" wire was previously connected.

Bus now starts and runs.

However, it seems to be running VERY rich.  At first I thought it could 
be the normal warm-up enrichment, so I let the engine idle for a few 
minutes to warm up.  Unfortunately, it continued to stink up the 
neighborhood, and seems to be idling much lower than it did before 
after the warm-up was complete (isn't this also a symptom of running 
too rich?  too much fuel for the air charge that's provided leading to 
poor idle?)

For variable elimination, I disconnected the tach adapter.  Bus would 
not start, so that piece definitely seems to be mandatory.

So, for reference, here is how the wiring now looks:

  1---2   3---4          9--10  11  12
  |   |   |   |          |   |   |   |
  5   6---7   8         13  14  15  16

Vertical bars indicate shunted terminals, and horizontal bars indicate 
permanent jumpers.

Permanent connections to the terminals:

  3 - tach
  5 - trigger output of Pertronix [black wire]
  6 - FI trigger
  7 - to Test Network terminal 13
  9 - power for Pertronix [red wire]
10 - power for reverse lights / double-relay
13 - +12v from ignition switch
15 - to coil +
16 - to coil -

For the Hyfire, the Hyfire needs to sense the trigger, we must provide 
switched +12v to the Hyfire, and the Hyfire must control the coil.  
Thus we remove the stock-configuration jumpers and connect the 
following Hyfire wires:

  1 - white (points input + tach adapter lead)
14 - thin red (+12v switched input + tach adapter lead)
11 - orange (to coil +)
12 - thin black (to coil -)

NOTE: The yellow "to tach" wire of the Hyfire is unused!

For the stock ignition system, we want the coil to sense the trigger 
and get power from switched +12v, so we make the following connections 
after disconnecting the Hyfire:

Jumper 8 -> 12
Jumper 14 -> 11

As far as the "running rich" problem... I am guessing that the FI is 
triggering too frequently.  I am pretty sure I have the Hyfire 
configured for "4 cylinder mode", but I will pull of the side plate 
today and verify that.  I suppose I could have set it to "6 cylinder 
mode" by mistake, but I'm not exactly sure what that setting causes the 
Hyfire to change in its behavior.
