Scott,

You missed my point and the point of the origional
post. I didn't mention using the distributor rotor for
anything. I said "TDC is not the loosest point in the
valve train on type IV engines". In theory the valve
clearance should be the same at all points of the base
circle but in actual use it is not. Possibly because
of the opposite lifters pushing on the cam or a
designed difference in the base circle. Your method of
locating the lifter exactly opposite the lobe obvously
works but setting the piston at TDC allows both
opposing lifters to push on the cam lobes for that
cylinder at the same time, but not nearly as hard as
one valve pushed completely open.

What I'm wondering is whether the difference in
clearance is due to the opposing lifters pushing on
the cam or a manufactured difference in the base
circle, possibly to allow additional oil to enter the
space between the cam lobe and lifter.

I'm not refering to aftermarket, poorly manufactured,
or extremely radical cams here, factory stuff only.

I'm not looking to start a flame. I'm just offering my
experience from over 40 years as a VW technician and
seeking to learn from other's experience.
