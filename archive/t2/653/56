Rob, 

Thanks for those!  And a question!

THe consumer reports article says max width thru rear opening is 42.5".

The report was written in 1971, so thangs may have changed along the way, 
cause I can get a 4x8 sheet of plywood thru my opening with about a half
inch or so clearance on each side.

Did we cover this once before?...or are they talking with the spare tire
and cover in place?

Cheers, dave
