Subject: Re: [T2] 80-83 Vanagon site search

Thanks For the suggestions Richard. I looked around Vanagon.com but haven't 
found what I was after yet. Was hoping to find pictures of an engine going 
back into an 80-83, Showing these tubes and other things that I should have 
taken pictures of. I guess I should take some as I put mine back in and see 
if I can figure out how to build a site to display them.

I haven't checked the part number yet but I hope to this afternoon if the 
snow slows down.

Thanks again,
Tom
