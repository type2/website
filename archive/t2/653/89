Subject: Re: [T2] 1978, window crank failed

Weird, as I just did this today on my 68. Got a new regulator from BD 
and just popped it into the driver's side door by leveraging the window 
channel (forward part by the wing) outward with a small pry bar while 
quickly slipping the regulator in through the small gap I created 
between the interior and exterior sheet metal of the door. In my year, 
the toughest part is just up and left of the crank where the two sides 
of the door come together for a couple of inches. Don't forget to 
remove the bolt here. I accessed everything via the large interior gap 
under the interior door panel. The hardest part of everything was 
replacing the plastic sheeting (cut and glued) to the frame before 
reinstalling the panel. I did it with the window in by holding it in 
place all the way up with a large bar clamp. Took about 25 minutes all 
told.
  hope that helps.
