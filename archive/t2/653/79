The 74 CA automatic models only. Pretty rare I'd say.

The 72 really is a model to avoid in my opinion. This will upset folks who
have them but if you have a choice get the non-72 body. If you are not
planning to work on it yourself your mechanic may take a look at it and make
up an excuse not to either. Viva la 73.

Didn't somebody want to know if the 72 had the paint can lid in the engine
compartment? It does.
