Not sure if I have mentioned this before, but we have a few NOS Type 4
thermostats. They are more than 35 bucks, but ours are still good :-)

We also have OE type 1 thermostats that will work well in a type 4 bus with
a very simple modification. The mod is on our tech articles, which is linked
from the product page.
