i used to be that way too, until about yesterday when customers began going
through banana boxes for my pottery. i'm making some decisions on parts
because i am emptying out the engine room and creating a long overdue
gallery space. i should have some decent used stuff for sale or giveaways
soon. anybody want a defective seven pin AFM, got shipping? this ought to
get me in a cleaning mind-set  :)
