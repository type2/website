I bought a bolt with an allen head.  It was a little tricky to tighten 
because the clutch cable (actually, the adjustment wing nut) was in the 
way, but it wasn't too difficult to screw in.  Now I just need to add an 
8mm allen key to the engine removal toolkit.

I guess the washers could have worked, but the allen head bolt was pretty 
simple and straight forward.
