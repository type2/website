Subject: Sunroof drain question

Hi all,

I'm hoping another sunroof bus owner can help me out.  As it is, the 
rear metal drain tubes (visible at the forward upper edge of the 
cooling air scoops) just dump water down into the engine bay.  Though 
I've been surprised before ;-), I can't imagine VW intended to dump 
water onto the top of the battery.  It also leaves nice rust stains on 
its path down.

I'm thinking of trying to finesse some plastic tubing onto the ends of 
the drain tubes in hopes of routing the water out through the body 
drains.  Does anyone know how VW did it?  Any clever-er solutions?

thanks,
