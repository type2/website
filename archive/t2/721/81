Subject: Bus Depot Clearance Sale - For Listmembers Only!

We did some spring cleaning this week, and found a lot of accumulated
one-of-a-kinds, N.O.S. parts, customer returns, etc. that have been
gathering dust. So I've decided to run our first-ever Bus Depot Garage Sale.

Everything in the Garage Sale is below cost - typically 50 to 80 percent off
- and most is brand new. There's something for almost every VW, from Busses,
Vanagons, and Eurovans to Beetles, Type 3's, and Golfs.  I have about 125
items there now, and will be adding some more later this week as other items
sell out.

This clearance sale is not being advertised to the general public - it is
only for List Members.  (I'll also open it up to TheSamba contributors if
someone would care to cross-post it there.)
