Well, THAT didn't work. :-D

But, I did discover that the column makes a neat "cookie cutter" for thick
cardboard when it is used as a padding material to prevent damage. Luckily
the horn wire shoved down in there prevented the little cardbaord circles
from going too far down or I would have been all night trying to pick them
back out.

I'll try Mark's suggestion next if the local small-town AutoZone has any
pullers in stock -- and is open past noon on Sunday.
