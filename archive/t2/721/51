I may speak for a few others here- because of the high gas prices (from 
NJ it's over $200) and Nyssa finishing midterms at Sav. Col. of Art and 
Design this week we'll miss EveryBus-(she  painted the KafeeBus sign 
last year). We must pick and choose events, so we've decided to make 
High Country Bus Festival and Westies in the Woods (WITW) for sure, and 
maybe Riverside Westies, Vt or Kampers by Knoebels, Pa also.  Hopefully 
by HCBF she'll have the anime murals on her bus she is planning.  One 
thing I have noticed is that fewer Bussers from Carolina/DC/Va go to 
northern events than visa versa- why is that?   There is some very nice 
hiking at WITW Stokes St Forest, NJ.  Sure would like to see a better 
showing there; you'd get to see the Frankenbus and Corvair camper!
