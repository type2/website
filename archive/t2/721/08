Subject: RE: [T2] Tent trivia

I believe there is a blue circular ink date stamp on the inside of the
rubber floor to the left of the zipped door opening.  One of my tents
has it, the other does not for some reason.  Maybe its just worn off. 
Can't wait to set it up again and stay in the same spot for a few days.
Too much work for just one night really.

This reminds me... Is there any way to identify exactly what year a
Westy tent is?

Aside from weighing the poles, of course.
