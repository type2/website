Subject: Re: [T2] 78 muffler

<That means, of course, that the muffler doesn't fit into the concave spot 
that the strap snugs the muffler to.  It hangs a tiny bit lower.  This bit 
lower makes the tailpipe even lower.  If the muffler was a little smaller in 
diameter it might work - or - if the tail pipe was longer>

Install without the tailpipe, rotate as necessary and then go to a muffler shop to have a new pipe made for $10 or so.
