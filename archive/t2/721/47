Subject: Re: [T2] Swapping transmission

We recently did this with daughter's 75 bus- put in a 77.  Needed the 
longer nose starter, longer trans mounting bolts and engine studs, 
flywheel, etc.  I had no problem mating the shift rod to the nosecone.
Since a mechanic previously had a (bad) 77 in there with the smaller 
bell housing, 75 flywheel, and early starter I don't know if he did 
anything to modify the shift rod; I doubt it.

  1. The flywheel, clutch and pressure plate on a 1975 engine are 215mm,
  the bell housing for the 1976 transmission is 228mm.
  2. The 1975 starter's drive gear is too short to reach the flywheel in
  the '76 transmission.

  3. Either the nosecone or the bell hosuing (I forget which) of the '76
  transmission is longer than the '75, so the shift linkage will need to
  be shortened somehow.

  If you swap the bell housing from the 75 transmission onto the 76
  transmission then problem 1 and 2 are taken care of. Problem #3 might
  take a bit more work to sort out.
