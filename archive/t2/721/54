my first thoughts would be
.  oil spilled somewhere burning off (not likely)
.  some reason the cooling system is compromised, slightly (most likely)
     the reason I think this is you get 50km before overheating, a totally
messed up cooling systew will overheat in less than a km.
       . is the fan belt adjusted properly, slipping maybe?/
       . as mentioned before is the cooling ring in the back functioning
correctly
       . something blocking the cooling system
       . the oil pump and cooler not working correctly (my first quess)

I would have it trucked back to your home base, at least you can watch it
and take care of other minor things...just my opinion
good luck
