Hi Dino,

I'm glad the hatchet technique worked for you... I first heard of it
from Jamie Rivers.

The vanagon hatch is so large that it doesn't work with the vanagon
cupboards either!!  I was looking inside the cupboards this afternoon
on my Dad's Vanagon westy and I noticed that there's a section in the
floor in the front of the cabinet made out of galvanized sheet metal...
Westfalia put it there because the vanagon cupboards need to be
clearanced at the bottom to make it possible to remove the rear hatch.

You could put the vanagon hatch in your bus, but you'd have to cut the
cabinets the same as they did with the Vanagon.

Happy trails,
