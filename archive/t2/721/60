Subject: Back plate

Hi all,

While updating the brake system of my 68-bay window, I unfortunately broke
one of these little clips that is attached to the back plate and holds the
adjusting star in place... It's the left-front wheel and these back plates
are not available in Belgium anymore.
A guy specialised in aircooled VW's told me I don't need this clip because
the star will stay in place by itself and because if it moves I will soon
notice and re-adjust.... I do not trust this advice though, and we plan this
very long trip next year so I want optimal braking systems...
Any advice? Any Europeans who can help me locate this part?
