My bus did this once when it was overfilled. I think two things happened. Either the oil got sucked into the PCV system in my bus (but where - the rear top of case?) or the piston rings could not deal with the excess oil. 

I too had a MAJOR burst of smoke at 60 mph and the oil level corrected itself. No further problems for many miles.
