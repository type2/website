Subject: 78 muffler

I put my vw trailer hitch on today and the muffler just does not seem to 
work with it.  The hitch goes on perfectly - then the bumper - but when I 
put the muffler back on the hitch gets in the way.  I couldn't use the bolt 
that goes through the strap - had to use one that was maybe ... 1" longer. 
That means, of course, that the muffler doesn't fit into the concave spot 
that the strap snugs the muffler to.  It hangs a tiny bit lower.  This bit 
lower makes the tailpipe even lower.  If the muffler was a little smaller in 
diameter it might work - or - if the tail pipe was longer then maybe I could 
turn the muffler in such that it would sit a bit higher and the longer 
tailpipe would extend out past the rear of the bus.

So ... is there another type of muffler that I could use ... maybe a tiny 
bit smaller in diameter than the muffler I currently have - I figure the 
muffler I'm using is a stock style.

TIA
