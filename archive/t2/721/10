Subject: Re: [T2] vacuum advance

Just want to point out that most folks saying their 009 equipped engine is
running well are comparing it to  NOTHING.

Vac advance will allow it to run cooler, smoother, and with better MPG, if
the carb is properly equipped with the requisite port. The guys switching
from vac advance to 009 because of ignition problems have simply not been
able (or tried) to identify why the vac advance dist was faulty. Most people
are not away that Bosch VW Distributors are worn out and require a rebuild
at 80k miles. Most are not rebuilt, and are worn out, and this is blamed for
poor performance. But it's the fact that it's worn out, not that it's vacuum
advance. There are worn out 009s too, right?
