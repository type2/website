Subject: RE: [T2] Kadron carbs

Hi Volks- I would not let AJ Sims touch my Kadrons (again). Had a set built
for a 1776 and had to send them back 3 times. First time was when the
secondary venture(?) was not tightened down and fell into the engine
requiring new pistons,jugs,and heads.. Second time the throttle shafts were
so tight that they would not return by themselves or by the stock spring.
Third time I got the carbs back with an extra spring on each carb rather
than solving the problem correctly. Of course, I had already paid him $400.+
so his fix was the cheapest one for him. Ted
