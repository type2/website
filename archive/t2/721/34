Subject: Re: [T2] Swaping transmission

Bonjour Andre,

Swapping the transmission is no problem, the 76 transmission will fit
perfectly where the 75 transmission goes.

The problem is with the stuff that is associated with the
transmission....

1. The flywheel, clutch and pressure plate on a 1975 engine are 215mm,
the bell housing for the 1976 transmission is 228mm.

2. The 1975 starter's drive gear is too short to reach the flywheel in
the '76 transmission.

3. Either the nosecone or the bell hosuing (I forget which) of the '76
transmission is longer than the '75, so the shift linkage will need to
be shortened somehow.

If you swap the bell housing from the 75 transmission onto the 76
transmission then problem 1 and 2 are taken care of. Problem #3 might
take a bit more work to sort out.

Happy trails,
