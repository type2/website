Subject: Head castings: What are the differences?

I picked up off the list a 1700 head: 021-101-371Q

I was verifying on the Tunacan site that it's a 1700 and found there
were three castings with different numbers, but the same valve sizes.
Any differences between them?

Here's the different part numbers:
021-101-371J 
021-101-371Q 
021-101-372
