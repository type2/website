Subject: fuel filler hose

As far as I know, filler hoses for 68-71 (and possibly other years) are 
NLA. By Googling on "fuel hose" I see various hits for manufacturers of 
filler hoses for marine and industrial applications. Here is one example:

http://www.tridentmarine.com/stage/fuel.htm

I would like to research this but I don't know the size of the filler 
hose for a '71. If anyone has the dimensions for a 68-71 filler hose (or 
any other NLA years) I would be happy to make some phone calls/emails to 
try to find a substitute and post the results to the list. I would need 
a measurement of the diameter and an estimate of the 'unbent' length 
and/or the number of degrees the hose is bent.

Or if anyone has looked into this before were there any results?

Sincere Thanks,
