Subject: FW:  Omaha VW Show n Shine

Hey friends,
 I'm Going to remind you about the upcoming Omaha VW
Club show Held this year on Father's day weekend June
18 campout at the Gretna KOA the 17&18 more info at
http://www.omahavwclub.org 
I am looking for a few items for our raffle bus,
Penny.  Penny still needs the right-rear side marker
light housing and lens, the wind shield washer
squirters, and I just noticed the Volkswagen badge
that goes on the rear hatch lid is needed (it was
never there and we didn't fill in the holes). We also
need 5 lug nuts and the correct rim, narrow five, for
the spare tire. If anyone would like to donate those
additional needed parts, it would be greatly
appreciated. 
This is going to be the best car we have ever given
away. Some lucky person is going to ride away in a
great 1970 Westy that has been upgraded  to 1776
engine, 1974 front beam, 74 trans/rear brakes, new
tires, fresh paint, most all the window seals and
scrapers are replaced. If anyone has any parts they
would like to donate please p-mail me or call
712-322-5835
