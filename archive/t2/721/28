Subject: Re: [T2] vacuum advance

009s are centrifugal ONLY, so they do not have a vacuum port. They are a
budget distributor. While they will get you home, IMO they are a poor choice
for a distributor to be used as the main unit, UNLESS the engine does not
have the proper vacuum port on the carb(s) or FI.
