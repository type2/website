Subject: Everybus - not this year... Beetle info request.

As much as I'd like to attend, due to two mortgages currently we'll have to pass. Hopefully the old house will sell and we can get out and about with you good people. 

Garage coming along pretty good (organization), garage sale the 30th, and I'll be adding a shed to the property. Planning to add 4ft to it's length and our Beetle will be returning from the extended family barn to live in the shed.

Does anyone have a '65 Beetle that they can give me some measurements from? Mine lacks bumpers and fenders so I cannot generate the numbers myself. Anyhow, taking a 10x12 shed and adding length and additional floor strengthening to become a bug shed.
