IMHO, busses need to be driven, not stared at like a
museum piece.  They were designed for dependable
transportation, comfortable mobile living, and fun and
enjoyment.  I say get that thing out every weekend you
can and have fun.  All the other campers will marvel. 
And when your paint gets worn or your upholstery gets
torn, you can always replace as needed.  And any bus
can be restored to show condition if you want to do
that.   If you're careful, you can minimize the wear. 
Wash and Wax frequently (somebody's going to scream),
use seat covers, rugs on the floor, polish on the
cabinets, etc.  But you own a fine bus that looks like
new.  It'll do you nor anyone else any good in your
garage except for your counting it as money in the
bank.  Cheers...KR
