Took mjy '74 Westy Campmobile on it's first campout
this past weekend, down for a float trip on the Upper
Buffalo river in NW Arkansas. It ran flawlessly, a
mostly 65 mph freeway drive until we got to the
mountains of Arkansas. It continued to perform well on
the twisty, steep roads. I realized I had never driven
a manual vehicle in mountains before and it made me
think about my bicycling in the mountains, how similar
using the gears are.

Anyway, I am so happy with the camping part of it,
too. in a '74, the bed is long enough that my feet
don't hang over the edge (I'm 6' tall!). I also like
the curtains all around. You can get buck naked, dance
around and no one can see you!

But here is something i want opinions on. You see, my
'74 Westy was bought 2 months ago. It is pristine, a
real garage find with 41k original miles, original
paint, upholstery hardly sat on. you get the picture.
My poll question is this: Would you store it, only
taking it out on those "perfect" days, hoping to keep
its showroom patina intact? Or would you use it, not
as a daily driver, mind you, but doing a lot of
camping (which will surely result in more wear and
tear than it has seen in 30 years)? I look forward to
the debate this may stir.
