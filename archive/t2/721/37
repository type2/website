We restore good cores. It is not cheap though. It takes a lot of work.

I also recondition the metal part as well. Straight no filler powder coated.

Call if you want a quote. I need your cores. These take a long time to tune 
around.

We use an expensive 3M plastic repair epoxy.

68-72 are not the same as 73-79. The latter's are better and differ only 
because of the hole in the rubber for the Allen head mounting bold. The 
earlys had a bot that was simply cased within the rubber and once the nut 
rusted the bolt would just turn in the rubber. This is a nightmare.
