<and give the center thing that the 
steering wheel attached to (under the horn button of course) - the biggest 
whack you can - and keep whackin' - you should be able to get the steeing 
wheel off undamaged>

And this doesn't beat the bearings in the steering box to death? Whacking on bearings is not good... 

Use a big steering wheel puller... I also have large, medium and small 3 arm pullers. I'm sure one of those would work too.
