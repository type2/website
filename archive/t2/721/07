Subject: Re: [T2] I have lots of endplay (advice?)

Hello Guys    heres how I check end play take the flywheel off remove the 
seal and shims replace the flywheel without seal and shims and set the engine on 
TDC  install a dial indicator and using a rubber dead blow smack the flywheel 
into the engine set the indicator on zero then smack the pully end of the 
crank and read the dial. reset to zero and smack the flywheel in again and reread 
the dial .. On type 1 motors if thye readings are .055 in.  or more then it is 
time for rebuilding and lineboring  the case.   with the endplay at .055 you 
will not be able to get the endplay back to tolerances which should be .002 to 
.006  You should use only 3 shims to set the end play of a type 1 motor .  
You can get some more life from the motor but only by setting the end play 
loose. This will also wear the case out even more and can casue the main seal to 
leak   later and have fun  Mark Dearing
