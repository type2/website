I second the thought about doing what brings you the most joy.

For my part, every time I see a true show room vehicle of any
make and model my first thought is "Wow! look at that", my
second thought is typically "I want to drive it."

  I love to look at showroom cars.  Crystaline snapshots into
automotive past or future to come.  But no matter how much I
look at them, I always come back to 'I want to drive it' or 'I
want to sit in it',.. you get the picture.

  This gets particularly acute when the engineered worth of a
vehicle is primarily a utilitarian one, such as with the type
2.  While they are as beautiful to my eye as any sleeker
faster roadster, their beauty is made that much more
significant to me by the simple fact that they are quite
successfully multipurpose.

I say drive it, you owe it to the engineers.  Don't enduro it,
respect it and use it.  Having a new condition bus is nice,
camping/driving in a new condition bus is greater still.
