My 78 2.0 FI Federal occasionally does the same thing.
 From prior T2 discussions, I believe this is normal. 
T2 members, tell me if I'm wrong!
  
In the past, we have heard the same noise during the
first minutes after cold start-up.  We have adjusted,
and re-adjusted the valves, and still have the same
symptoms.  I do note though, that if I use the bus
every couple of days, then the errant hydraulic
valve(s) don't seem to leak-down and make that noise. 
But if I let the bus sit for a week or more, then I
frequently have a noisy valve or two for up to 2
minutes.
   
Compare notes:  Our valve adjusting uses the Bentley
procedure.  Position #1 (-at-) TDC.  Loosen both valves. 
Tighten to "just snug" or "just in contact"  Turn 2
more turns and tighten.  Rotate engine 180 degrees. 
Do Cylinder 4.  180 & 3, 180 & 2. (If I remember it
correctly.)
