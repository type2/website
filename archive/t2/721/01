Subject: Anyone from Chapel Hill area going to Everybus?

Hi,
Unfortunately, I don't think my bus will be ready for everybus this year.
I was wondering if their was anyone from the chapel hill, pittsboro, durham, 
raleigh, siler city, (NC)etc area that might be able to bring a set of 
shocks to someone there for me.  Of course I could drop them off at your 
house or job or wherever so you wouldn't have to go out of your way at all.
Thanks,
Kyle
