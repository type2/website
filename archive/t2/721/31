But I need shorter standoffs -- probably slightly "beefier" ones too.
Still have some wiring to clean up and repair. Many "extra wires" that
didn't seem to go anywhere (probably for radio or whatever) and MANY MANY
that weren't even in the right place on the fuse panel. 

Have to add connectors to make power available to the gauges that will be
sitting up on the dash until I figure out where to mount them and then
bundle up all the wire a bit more neatly.

Working straight through to midnight the 17th (from 7am to midnight) and
working on the Rivi for a few hours each night between midnight and 7 so I
can't get replacement standoffs. Doesn't look like the location will
actually interfere with pedal operation, I'm just afraid I'll kick it and
snap the darn thing off.
