Thanks, Karl.  You 'da man.  I printed out your
detailed email and will get to work on deciding which
way to go.  Actually, my bus runs very nicely.  Purrs
like a cat, in fact.  But no vacuum advance!  I need
to order a Bentley manual and also the Muir book. 
I'll let you know when I get ready.  I'm sure I'll
need more advice.  Cheers...KR
