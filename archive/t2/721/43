Subject: Converted 1.8l Type 4 Engine Data needed

Good Morning

I've bought a 74 VW Camper with a 1.8l Type4 Engine. It is equipped with a
single carburetor, mechanical distributor and a electronically ignition
system (Hall unit). Unfortunately the previous owner does not know how to
tune up the engine properly (nor do I...)
I guess I can not change the dwell but how about ignition timing (I've got a 
cheap strobe light and Tach/dwell meter) and spark advance curves? Do you
have any data or know someone who can help me?
Thanks a lot
