Subject: compufire - was The factory's official take on Pertronix

btw, just so everyone knows, compufire is pretty slick too.  Plus, 
there's no gapping to do at all.  All I had to do was screw the pickup 
where the points were and stick the magnet plate in there.

I've never checked the dwell.. I should take a look and see what it's at 
for comparison...
