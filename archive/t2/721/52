Subject: RE: Stuck in Princton, BC

Hi All,

Very many many thanks to Bob, Miles and others with your advice.

Checked oil, etc.  Bus started right away, drove slowly about 50K.  Burst of
oil & smoke again so stopped, let it cool down and carried on.  Stopped quite
a few times because of this.  Finally a towtruck stopped who picked me up. -
sob.

Wanted to say I would never even have started it again without  wise advice
from this list.

Left bus in Kelowna and will go back in a couple of months.

Cheers Ginny - busless in Winnipeg
