sure, but you are kinda limited in the techinque, due to the space
restrictions ;)

This it the one problem a lot of people have with nice buses. I think
it boils down to what brings you more joy. Having that rare clean bus
that looks great, will help you if you desire for the bus to pay you
back in the show circuit. Lots of really nice unused buses at those
things. I however get a lot more joy from driving and camping in my
buses. I'm also one of the guys that drive everyday, and my bus shows
it. Dings dents, crappy paint, but a really happy driver ;) I think
Jay Leno summed it up "Restore it to 95% then drive it back to 50%"
(paraphrased)

either way, enjoy that bus.
