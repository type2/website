I bought the type 4 manifolds from your same prohibited auction site
for $30. They were for different carbs, but it you are patient, I'm
sure you will find some. I see them from time to time.

 Hi guys.  I want to buy some Kadron carbs off Ebarf to
 put on my 1.7L engine.  I've seen some good deals.
 Most of them there come with manifolds for beetles or
 superbeetles.  What do I NOT want to buy and where do
 I get the right manifolds for my Type IV engine?  I
 can't afford new ones.  My budget is nowhere near
 $500.  I have to buy a new distributor to replace my
 009 also.  Thanks...KR
