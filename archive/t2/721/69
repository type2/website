Subject: build your own westy tent poles

I saw a few folks askin about makin your own tent poles to replace the 
broken ones from the westy tent set-up.

Tom Cates built a set.

there are 2 pages of instructions he wrote up -  include all of the part 
numbers that you will need to order from canopy masters.

here are links the instructions........thanks to Tom for writing them and 
thanks to dewey for hosting these two pages
