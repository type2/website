In the distant past I was an instrumentation engineer, and I tend to see 
measurement problems from a different perspective. True, the dwell on a 
pertronix set up might measure higher than expected, but might it not 
depend on exactly how your dwell meter works? I would suggest to anyone 
having doubts about the dwell on their pertronix to beg, borrow or steal 
another meter made by a different manufacturer, and see what results 
they get. Solid state electronics .v. points have some interesting 
differences - my home made electronic tachometer worked perfectly with 
points, but when I changed to pertronix, only worked under particular 
conditions. In the end I traced the problem to the pertronix earth not 
being identical in voltage to the chassis earth. the difference was a 
few millivolts, not enough to stop a spark being generated, but enough 
to upset the electronics in my instrumentation.
