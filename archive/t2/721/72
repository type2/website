volks

was phutzing with my 78 today doing a few minor things and I noticed when
I started it up one of the lifters (probably 3 or 4 exhaust??) seemed to
take awefully long to build up and stop clacking, maybe 2-3 minutes, I had
driven it about 5-6 hours earlier a short trip maybe 3-4 miles.  haven't
noticed this before, I popped the cover and checked and everything seemed
to be as it should. no valves sticking up, no loose lifters (hyd anyway)


??? is a lifter sticking or failing???

thanks
Bob
