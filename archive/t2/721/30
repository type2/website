Subject: Re: [T2] vacuum advance 

This is a very interesting thread for me too, because our 78 came to us  with 
dual Weber 40's and a 009 installed.  Has always run well, but also  always 
needs some gas pedal pumping etc to get it going and keep it going.   We 
compare it to our 77 Westy that has the stock FI.  Very reliable, fast  easy 
starting.  In the box of stuff that came with the 78 was the original  205 
distributor with the vacuum canister on it.  Why is it not  installed?  Not sure.   My 
best guess is that there isn't  anywhere to hook the vacuum to, so the person 
who put the Webers in just said  screw it.  I assume that on the stock carb 
models there is somewhere  on  the carb that the vacuum would go?  What should I 
do?  Where  would I attach the vacuum canister to if I put the stock carb back 
in?  
 
Of course the best thing I could do is go find a FI setup somewhere,  
junkyard, etc and put it back how it "should" be!
 
Any and all advice is welcome and appreciated!
