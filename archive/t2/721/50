Well, the day has come.  Later this afternoon we'll be heading out to EveryBus
from CO.  Still look's like we are the furthest Left so a carabus doesn't seem
quite possible.  Unless I can still manage to drag Don out in the Great White
:)  We'll be taking the 63 double cab as originally planned but our route is
still somewhat undetermined.  In any case, looking forward to seeing everyone
out there and hope everyone has a safe trip.  We got dumped with about 16
inches of wet snow which hopefully will melt in short time.
