Subject: Kadron carbs

Hi guys.  I want to buy some Kadron carbs off Ebarf to
put on my 1.7L engine.  I've seen some good deals.  
Most of them there come with manifolds for beetles or
superbeetles.  What do I NOT want to buy and where do
I get the right manifolds for my Type IV engine?  I
can't afford new ones.  My budget is nowhere near
$500.  I have to buy a new distributor to replace my
009 also.  Thanks...KR
