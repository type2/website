Subject: Free* typeIV thermostat

I found a nice used typeIV thermostat today, complete with bracket and cable ready to install.

Free* to the 1st person that:
1) Really needs it......
2) Makes a donation to the list fund
and
3) Answers a simple trivia question:)

The question is:

Name the rock group of 4 members, one was murdered, one was shot, and the other 2 died of natural
causes.......
