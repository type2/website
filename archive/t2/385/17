Hiya Marc,

Yes, the blinker relay is attached to the fuse panel.  More about that later. 
 

First........Are you sure all your connections, bulbs, and fuses are in good 
working order?  Before I go monkeying around with the fuse box I'll check all 
the easy to see stuff first.  And ask yourself this........did this all 
happen suddenly or has the system been going out piece by piece?  If 
suddenly, the blinker relay may well be at fault.  If piece by piece over 
time it is almost certainly not the blinker relay.  In any event, cleaning 
the contacts (remember those grounds) and replacing the bulbs (if needed) is 
a good thing to do.

The relay you are looking for is (I believe) a 211 953 215C.  Commonly 
available at swaps for under $5 and still available new from certain VW 
dealers across the country.  It is built for the system you have.  It's just 
a simple matter of plugging it into the fuse box.  Of course getting the 
fusebox out of its hiding place is one of the great feats of VW 
prestidigitation.  Another reason to check the easy-to-see stuff first.

Good Luck!
