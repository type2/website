Subject: Re: [T2] worn hydraulic lifters

> I'm working on my 78 westy engine and I pulled out all the lifters.  6
are shiny and smooth and the two frontmost lifters (bus front, I think
cylinders 1 & 3) that ride on the same cam lobe have noticable wear.  Is
there a reason why these two are worn, and what's the best way to fix
this (if needed)?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hate to be the bearer of bad news but........you have to replace that camshaft. It is history. The lobe is
wiped out. Why did it happen? Not sure. When it wipes the lifter like that, it means the lifter stopped
rotating.
