 finally got the bus down the road today wasnt at all that cool though cause it was so slugish but when takeing off in first the whole bus sounds like it is comeing apart and that its going to give you really bad whiplash.????

It was doing the very same thing when the old tranny was in.

doesnt seem to do it in any other gear i didnt get her passed third.

thanks 
Cha
