The blinker is plugged into the botton of the fuse block.  You have to pop
the spring clip loose and lift the entire fuse panel to get at it.  The
blinker (along with the headlight beam relay) sometimes get filled with
water due to their being mounted in an inverted position.  I drill a 1/16
hole in the bottom of their housings (as mounted) to allow moisture to
escape if it should get in there.

I'd try replacing the flasher first.  They're not hard to find.
