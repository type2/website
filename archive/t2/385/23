Subject: Pinion bearing?

In my 69 I've noticed that in all gears but mainly 1st and 2nd there is a 
fairly loud groan. I drove around the block (not registered yet) and put in the 
clutch while moving in second and the noise goes away. After talking with the 
local VW flaps and he said it might be the pinion bearing and that they didn't 
do that kind of work anymore. I asked him about the possibility of me doing it 
and he said that it required a special jig to set all the inards of the tranny 
back up to ensure proper fit or something to that effect. Anyway, has anybody 
done this and if so rate difficulty based on never having done any tranny work. 
I checked out a site called Long Enterprises and it's very good for the novice 
and they offer a CD "VW Transaxle Rebuilders Course" for $24.95+S/H. Opinions 
please.
