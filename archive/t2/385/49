Subject: bus refusis to start when hot

My wife cara and I drove the Playpen for its first long distance drive today
it's about two hours straight up and down big hills whe stayed about 60-75 mph
we stoped at or destination and shut playpen down and started to set up camp
my wife told me to park the bus nearer to the trees for shade in the morning
so I jumped in and attempted to start her up but she just clicked and thats it
when she had cooled off about 2 hours later she started no problem any hepl
with this problem would be awsome thanx
