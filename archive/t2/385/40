If you have stock heater boxes from 75-79 the hose on the right side of the
aux. fan is a plastic round corrugated hose. It then hooks to a  molded oval
shaped plastic piece before exiting the tin in the engine bay. On the
outer/bottom side of the tin it is an oval shaped metal pipe that clamps to
the heat exchanger. www.Busdepot.com has the correct hoses here
