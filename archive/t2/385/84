Subject: Re: 73 Bus for sale with or without the engine..

This is just to let you know... If it does not sale by 5/21/03...

IT WILL BE PARTED OUT AT Manassas, VA bug out 5/25/03 and the rest crushed...

I can sell the Bus with or without the engine.

If you want the complete engine and 091 tranny it is $1800.  I drop and ship 
or deliver for a fee.  
*I can bring  the Bus or Engine to the Manassas Bug out, but WILL need a 
deposit.  

I also have a lot of T2 73 to 79 Bus parts for sale at the Manassas and ALL 
MUST GO because it cannot go with me.

I do not want to part, but must part to part with the parts before I depart 
for another state...
