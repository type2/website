Subject: Re: [T2] do I need that thermostat?

Please save your self the expense of this mistake.
I removed my flaps and T-stat and threw them away years ago on the advise of 
some fool.
Now that I see the light is cost me $90 bucks to replace what I once had.
Those Germans put it there for a reason and if the could save a few bucks by 
leaving the parts off the would have.
If it aint broke don't fix it.
