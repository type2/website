Subject: Rear Wheel bearings

I'm thinking about servicing my rear wheel bearings, and wondering if
I'm setting myself up for a major pita.  In the past when I have taken
the big nut off, I torqued it back as tight as I could with a six foot
cheater.  
And let that be good enough.  Bentley says precise torque is  essential.
What's the scoop on this job?
