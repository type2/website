Get a bottle of Sta-Lube GL-4 and the pump with hose from places like NAPA or Car Quest. Remove #21 in this

Put your finger in the hole and see if the level is up to or near the edge of the hole. If it is, it is full.
If not, pump in theGL-4 until it is.

Remove #21 and see if the oil level is up to the edge.
#22 is the drain plug.
