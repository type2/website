Subject: Distributor ID??

Hi Volks,

I have a 70 camper with the typical 009/34 Pict combo
on a 1600 DP.  Recently I came across a distributor
that I am considering using.  It is in excellent
condition.  The markings on this "mystery" distributor
is as follows

211.905.247 on the base that fits in the drive gear
211905271B on the vacuum advance
211.905.295 on the condensor hold down

My question are these???

Would this be appropriate for this engine combo?
What points/rotor/cap can I use and where to get them?
Timing??   With or without vacuum line hooked up??

Thanks,
Chuck
