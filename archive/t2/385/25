Subject: Re: [T2] Pinion bearing?

Setting the pinion depth and backlash will be required
after bearing replacement. Compared to the difficulty
you have had setting the timing on your 009,
this repair is off the scale. Don't be discouraged.
Get the CD from Long Enterprises, and amaze yourself
with the info provided in your Bentley manual.
Consider this- find the fill plug and remove it.
Put your finger in the hole- any gear oil in there ?
Remove the drain plug and empty the old gear oil
into a clean white bucket. That plug has a magnet on it.
If you find steel fuzz, that is normal. You are searching
for metal chunks. Any is too many. Refill to the level of
the fill plug and road test. You may just be low on oil now.
But the original diagnosis is a definate possibility.
