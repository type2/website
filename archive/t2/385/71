Subject: correct acelorator cable?

accelerator cable broke on the freeway yestarday.The vehicle is a 75
(manual OC) with dual weber ICTs with a hexbar linkage. I have it patched
up but I need to get a replacement cable. Should I use a standard FI cable
or should I get the 72-4 solex cable replacement?
