Hello All,
For quite awhile now my fuel-injected 79 bus has been undergoing a high
idle/surging problem.  In the mornings it fires right up and the RPMs are
real high but in seconds after the cold start valve has done its thing, it
lowers down to a normal-sounding idle.  Upon driving a ways and then
stopping at a light or whatever, it will then be idling quite high again --
and will continue that way at subsequent stops.  Sometimes it seems like
outside temps have a hand in this, as the idle sometimes eases down to
normal levels when it is warmer outside.  And sometimes as I sit and listen
to it, the idle will go from very high down to slightly high and then back
up again after a few seconds, and then repeats.  I assume these are the
symptoms of a vacuum leak but am having a devil of a time finding it.  Can
anyone suggest a few good places to look for this kind of vacuum leak, or
does anyone have any alternate suggestions?  This seems hard on the engine
and would like to soon get it back down to normal RPM levels.  Thanks!

Travis
