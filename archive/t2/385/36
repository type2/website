First, level the bus.

It's full when it's just weeping out the side hole. You can put in your
finger and feel where the level is.

Many gear lube bottles are so shaped so you can squeeze it in the side hole.
If you get a regular container, purchase a $4 transmission oil pump at the
flaps to pump it in:

Remove the drain plug also and clean off the filings on the magnet before
refilling.
