Safety? Also, the chances of you getting "lucky" and springing a leak you'll
notice while the engine isn't running is remote.

Why run the pump when you don't have to? Fuel line pressure will build to 36
psi then return to the tank.

Find out why the wire was added. Someone was smart enough to know to wire it
there so they may not be a complete DPO after all.
