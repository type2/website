Subject: Re: [T2] ruff gears new/used

In my experience, used gearboxes typically have no oil in them.  What 
I'd do is go get three quarts of StaLube 85W90 GL-4 oil. (NAPA usually 
has it.  Chain stores may have it too. Usually on the bottom shelf.) 
Remove fill plug. Then put a pan under it and remove the drain plug. 
(Located under the differential) The drain plug usually has a magnet on 
it to collect the garbage. Clean it off and look at what you've cleaned 
off...  Slivers are typical. Chunks are not.  After the gearbox has 
drained, replace the plug and fill it back up. You should be good to go 
then. At least you'll know that the oil level is not the problem.
