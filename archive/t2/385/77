Subject: Re: Rear Wheel bearings

Regarding the axle nut torque, from my experience incorrect torque on the
nut is less likely to shorten the life of the wheel bearings (the quality of
the bearing does) but it does shorten the life of the spline in the drive
flange. I have seen a number of people strip the spline out of beetle and
type 3 drums, and it's always people who fail to use a torque wrench.
I do all the work myself, and re-torque the nut myself as best I can
(without a torque wrench), take the bus for a short drive and have a local
mechanic set the correct torque.
