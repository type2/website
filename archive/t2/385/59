Subject: Re: Rear Wheel Bearings

Just did this for the first time myself a month or so ago.
It went well.  

I used my chinese large size metric sockets as drifts to get the bearings 
out. Did the same to get them back in, with the help of my freezer.
Tap gently to get the started straight.

While you are there do the full brake service and check/replace the 
shocks.

Oh yeah, remember to tourqe the lug nuts when you are done.  Guess how I 
know.
