Okay, I'll bite.  I've wondered what the actual purpose of the "black box"
on the speedo cable is, any answers?

It mechanically counts the miles and informs you (by lighting up the OXS/
EGR, I forget...), that your FI system needs servicing. Modern cars go
way beyond that (one that I know of has a sensor that should indicate
an over full canister for gas tank fumes; but fill the tank to the neck
and it lights up automatically). Michelin is trying out a 'chipped' tire to
warn of under/over inflation and worn tread (we won't go into the track-
ing aspect of the chip...)
On the other hand, even the Good Grey NY Times had an article on modern
hot rodders called, "Gentlemen, Hack Your Engines", lightly viewing the neo-
shade-tree-mechanic wielding a lap-top rather than an box wrench... ;-)
