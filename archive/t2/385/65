Subject: Carb ID req'd:

Hi Volks,

My new 77 sunroof Automatic bus is going to be a bit more work than I 
originally anticipated. Not impossible, but there will be a bit more 
work required than I had thought. It took most of a day to get the door 
latches working properly, now that the vehicle is secure I will be able 
to focus on the running gear and eventually I will be able to get it 
pretty.  The wiring is a bit dodgy, so I have yet to get it to turn 
over.

  Meanwhile.... It is wearing the following carb: Can someone ID this 
for me?

I'm pretty sure it's a weber, but I have no idea which one. I don't 
seem to see any identifying number on it, so if you need more info just 
tell me where to look.

Also, if someone can recommend a supplier for an inexpensive set of 
sunroof cables, I'd be grateful. Used is OK if they're in good 
condition.

THANKS!!

Happy trails,
