Interesting, I did not know that. I hope the lady is secure in her
retirement.

It makes no difference wrt to copyright, though. =^ )

FWIW, assembled aircooled multitudes, the Muir engine sounds tape ain't no
lost Atlantis. I've been there and all I got was this shirt, and I had this
shirt before. =^ )

It's a set of fairly muddy recordings of common engine problems. Also some
uncommon ones (maybe in the 70s in the New Mexican desert, LOOSE PULLEY was
a problem people had to worry about a lot, but have you seen it lately?) Joe
maintained this on the web for years, it was not a runaway hit although
everybody knew about it. I'm not saying it's not useful, but if you missed
it, its certainly nothing to panic about.
