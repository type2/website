Subject: [T2] ruff gears new/used

so if the gear oil can be changed like this then can the ruff gears be a example of low oil in the gear box.

I just put this trans in used and am not sue of its condition?
didnt check the oil level in it while out though learn as we go i guess?

karl i tried to see the picture but it was to small all i could tell was it was a tranny torn into pieces.
 couldnt see a # 21 or 22.
thanks jim i know which 17mm you are talking about i think.

gears just dont feel right like they are not changeing right or something?
Cha
