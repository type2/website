Subject: Advice on interpreting my compression  check results on 78

Two Questions I could really use help on:

1) Compression Check Results
2) Noisy valves

Question 1 - Compression results
=========================
I have a 78 Westfalia with original 2.0 engine at 122,500 miles. I purchased it about
a year ago and have put about 4000 miles on it in the last year (stored winters here in Michigan!).

I had a compression check by a VW mechanic when it was first purchased April of 2002,
and results per the mechanic were:  1= 100, 2=115, 3=95, 4=100.

I wanted to follow up this year after 4000 miles and just completed my first compression 
check using the checklist provided here on the type 2 list (warm up engine, remove all plugs,
 have helper turn over engine a few seconds for each cyl). 

I have a screw in type compression tester
and received the following results today: 1=90, 2=120, 3=115, 4=115.

The common problem from last year seems to be cyl 1 at 90 pounds. Not sure why the
others numbers don't line up with test from last year, only thing I am aware of is mechanic
has a push on rubber tip tester, not a screw in tester.

Overall the engine seems to run fine with reasonable power. I travel 65 mph on the freeway
for the 2 hour ride to northern Michigan quite often. I try to "baby" the engine as much as possible
and not lug it.

Can someone provide advice on what the compression numbers mean, assuming my numbers
are correct from today's test ? Any actions I should be considering ?

Question 2 - Noisy valves
=================== 
Ever since I have owned this Westy I have struggled with noisy valves. I have found that
if I overfill (at least looks like it on the dipstick) by 1/2 to 3/4 quart then the valves will pump
up and quite down. If I fill exactly to full line on dipstick then I can never get rid
of the clatter. The oil type does not seem to matter. I ran synthetic last year, and
switched to normal 30 weight last fall due to excessive leaking with Synthetic.

Any advice or insight for me ?

Thank you !
