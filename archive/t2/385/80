Subject: worn hydraulic lifters

I'm working on my 78 westy engine and I pulled out all the lifters.  6
are shiny and smooth and the two frontmost lifters (bus front, I think
cylinders 1 & 3) that ride on the same cam lobe have noticable wear.  Is
there a reason why these two are worn, and what's the best way to fix
this (if needed)?

Here's a picture:

I burnt a hole in piston #4 (reason for the rebuild).. would this have
any effect on these lifters?  Number 4's lifters are perfectly smooth.

Thanks,
MIke
