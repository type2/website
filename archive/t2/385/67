Subject: Need Flex Plate Bolt help

List,  I am removing and tearing down the 1800cc engine in my '74 bus with
automatic transmission.  The torque converter is mounted to a flex plate that

is bolted to the crank with 6? bolts.  I don't remember if these are torx
heads or some kind of star pattern bolt head.  I would like to find a source
to obtain the tool to remove these when I get to that point and also a source

of replacement bolts should that be necessary.  Can anyone help?
Thanks!
Jim
