Your really don't need a torque wrench if you know your own weight and can
measure with a ruler.  Take the torque required in ft-lb and divide it by
your weight in pounds.  Multiply the result by 12 and mark that
distance in inches from the square drive of your breaker bar along the
handle.  If the breaker bar isn't long enough, slide on a cheater and
mark that.

Put the socket on the breaker bar and put it on the nut with the breaker
bar pointing horizontally to the right.  Stand on the mark (don't bounce!)
If the breaker bar is no longer horizontal, move it back up and stand on
it again.  Repeat until the nut doesn't turn any more.  Check the nut to
see if the cotter pin will go through the castle and hole (check both
holes for alignment!)  If the holes aren't aligned, tighten the nut a bit
more until the holes are aligned.  Install the cotter pin and you're done!

Do check the tightness of the nut in a week or so.  It's good practice.
