Every vehicle I have owned with visible rust through had significantly more 
rust elsewhere that was NOT visible.  My first beetle had a very small amount 
of visible rust through inside the rear fenderwells.  3 weeks after I bought 
it an entire shock tower on the front beam broke off due to rust.  

Subsequent closer inspection by someone who knew cars better than I did at 
that time turned up dangerous interior CO levels due to rusty heater boxes; 
the other shock tower was just as bad and the base of both front door pillars 
were just about ready to let go of the rocker assembly that supported them.

Though the car did not even violate the "safety of my sense of aesthetics" it 
was NOT safe to drive.
