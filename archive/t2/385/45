Subject: FI wiring esoterica

I've spent a while diagnosing a variety of problems on my engine with 
L-Jetronic FI system.

Along the way, I noticed that the fuel pump turns on when the key is 
turned to the ON position, before the engine is started and that this 
is not normal.

After much studying of the circuit diagram and measuring voltages,  I 
come to find out that the DPO added a wire to carry 12V from one of 
the CR2 contacts to terminal 88a  -  thereby powering the fuel pump 
and the auxiliary air regulator when the key is at ON.

I'm tempted to cut this wire to restore stock operation. On the other 
hand, the car has been running this way for a year.

Can anyone suggest a reason that I should remove this "feature"?

Thanks, jack
