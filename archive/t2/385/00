Perhaps we should, as a society, simply let the chips fly and hand out

Darwin Awards to those who don't care enough about their own

self-preservation to keep their vehicles roadworthy.

OK, but what about the guy behind your bus? Are his brakes well-
maintained? What about the guy in front of your bus? Are his brake
lights workin' ? I tend to think that cars have become the victim of
their own success...Just too many (cars outnumber households in 
the USA) to 'just' be cars; they've crossed the line into necessities/
appliances and are going to be subjected to the LCD (Lowest Common
Driver) requirements...Lots of new cars practically 'tell' you when
service is required...Not that you would (or in some cases could) do 
the service, but that a trip to the dealership is due...(Got a late Bay?
Got a black box on the speedo cable?)
