Subject: Re: [T2] the thing between the fan and the crankshaft

I've removed the fan hub on different engines perhaps a dozen or so times
and I've always used the following technique:

Put some fairly heavy pieces of metal (I use big 'ol washers) behind the
"ears" of the hub, next to the case.  Insert your 3 fan bolts and tighten
then down until they just touch the metal pieces, effectively "pining" them
to the case.  Then go 'round and 'round tightening the bolts *very slightly*
(like, a 1/16th of a swing or so) and you'll eventually push the hub right
off.
