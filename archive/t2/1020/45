Subject: Cht gauge question

I've been lurking in the background for quite some time. My 80 bus has been
doing fine since I installed the rebuilt engine a couple of years ago. Sold my
75 right around Christmas. I wasn't driving it and needed the room.

I recall someone posting temperature correction figures for VDO cylinder head
temp gauges. I've been searching the archives and can't find it. Does anyone
have a link or an explanation of how cold ambient temps affect the readings of
a non-compensated CHT gauge?

A couple of weeks ago I took a trip to Phoenix and got some high CHT readings.
Found a split in the Y fitting on the vacuum line that feeds the brake booster
and deceleration valve. I replaced that and fixed another leak at the EGR
valve. I figured the temps should drop after these repairs. I had to make
major adjustment to the idle speed after fixing the vacuum leak and checked
all other tune-up specs. The gauge seems to still be indicating a bit high
according to my memory. Keep in mind that my bus doesn't see a lot of miles. I
was getting readings of 300 to 350 depending on the terrain. Now it indicates
about 350 to 400 degrees? Is this because of the extreme cold ambient temps
right now. My memory says that for every degree the temp drops below 70
degrees the CHT reads a degree hotter than true temp, if the gauge is accurate
at 70 degrees. Is this right? It's been so long since I read about this I
can't remember for sure!

I really need to get a compensated gauge!

TIA,
