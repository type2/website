A few minutes after sending the email about M&S Tires and winter driving 
conditions, I realized that it was basically inappropriate for a list 
restricted to type 2 bus content. I hope you will all forgive my lack of 
concern for your bandwidth, and my poor judgement about what is appropriate 
for this list. My judgement was clouded by several horrible and terrifying 
experiences with black ice, and my concern for the guy driving up from 
Florida with no winter driving experience. Again, apologies.
