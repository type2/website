Subject: Prices for Nason paint per gallon

Just wondering what people are paying for Nason Ful-thane single base paint in
various places. Here in Nanaimo on Vancouver Island, I was quoted 224 dollars
for a gallon of L20A Chrome Yellow to spray my van. Has anyone priced out
paint in their area? I'm wondering if this is in line or because it's the only
show in town, I'm being seen off.
Thanks,
Courtney
