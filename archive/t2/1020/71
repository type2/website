Subject: Driving in the snow

I've lived in Colorado off and on for most of my life, since 1977, at 
least. I've been driving a VW bus since 1982, in all kinds of weather. 
The most important thing to remember is SLOW DOWN. No matter what you 
are driving, stopping on ice, and especially with snow on top if it, is 
a seat gripping experience. Give yourself twice or three times the room 
you would normally allow for the space in front of you. I'm a big fan 
of using the emergency flashers, also, to warn off tailgaters and 
impatient lane changers. I wouldn't trade the bus for all the HumVees 
at Ft. Carson. Let the cowboys go around you, and honk and wave merrily 
as you pass them when they end up in the median facing the wrong way.
