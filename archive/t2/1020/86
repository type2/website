Subject: Upgrade to Xenon lights?

Has anyone seen the Xenon light sets for sale on Ebay? You can get an H4
replacement setup that uses Halogen on low, and Xenon on high. These are the
real deal with ballasts etc, not the fake lightbulbs you can buy. They are
amazingly cheap thanks to Chinese wages, and having a set on my Mazda 3, I can
tell you they DO make a HUGE difference for night driving. Do a search on Ebay
for xenon, and watch what comes up. Interestingly, they use less power than
regular lights to run. Would this be a good deal for our marginal
alternators??
