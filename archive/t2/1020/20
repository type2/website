Subject: Re: [T2] rear axle nut tool dimensions

Hi Dave
Thanks for the dimensions..
I am making a torque multiplier... and I figured if I can use one of those
wrenches .. why not... I need to make the outer end accept the starter gear on
a shaft..

here is a picture

C2.jpg

it looks like it is about 1" too short,, but I can weld on what I need.  My
first thought was I might be able to just drill the end of that wrench. It
will probably be easier for me to make up an end and weld it on anyway.

  3-9/16" and since everyone else editorialized about
  them, I have used mine probably 4-5 times and am very
  happy with it. The square hole has worked for me and
  the whacking capability has worked just fine, thank
  you! Ya gonna make some?- Bah
