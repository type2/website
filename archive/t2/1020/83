I was hoping to get it on the rotisserie, or at least get the plates
fabricated tomorrow. I am using an "auto twirler plus".
http://www.autotwirler.com/models.html

I plan on mounting it to the front and rear bumper mounts, depending on how
I gauge the strength when I get that far. It is best to have the mounts as
far at the ends of the the vehicle as possible, but if the front bumper
mounts aren't strong enough, then perhaps the two front beam bolts. The rear
bumper mounts are really burley, but if they don't work, I'll go for the
engine hanger bolt locations.

When I get it designed, I'll be sure to keep good notes and photos.

It looks like you and Jack are having fun.  When will we see this thing 
on your new rotisserie?
