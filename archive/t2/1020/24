Subject: Finding spot welds amongst other things.

Well, I've just been under my bus, and thanks to my swiss-cheese inner rockers
I can look right through and see the backs of the outer rockers. I don't
appear to have any "middle" rockers like I see on the schematics. It looks
like my rockers have been replaced once before, since I doubt the middle ones
would completely rust away so perfectly.
I purchased the "easy slip in fit" inner rockers to do this job which have cut
outs to go around the outriggers. It looks like I can butt them up and tack
them into place after I cut away most of the old inners. I also have new
outers, but in looking at mine they are actually pretty solid. How are you
guys finding the spot welds on the rockers where they are joined onto the body
and along the bottom where they are welded together? Will grinding them down
show them up? Any comments on the easy fit inners? Any comment on the missing
inner or middle rockers?? My bus looks fine without them, I haven't noticed
any visual differences, and the pinch seam along the bottom looks good with
just the inner and outer rockers.
Thanks,
Courtney
