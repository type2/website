Subject: 1.7L cylinder head gaskets needed

Hi Volks,

I am trying to get a VWoC reman 411 engine back together and it turns  
out that the heads have been flycut deep enough that I can't seal the  
combustion chamber properly without using gaskets between the  
cylinder and the head. Or else I send them out for machining that I  
just can't afford at the moment.

The gaskets that were in the engine when I pulled it apart were  
disposed of due to warpage and all the gaskets I have on hand (3  
sets, all new) are sized for 1.8/2L engines.

Has anyone got a set of 1.7L gaskets on hand that they'd like to get  
rid of cheap? I need to get this thing going soon so I don't wind up  
sleeping in a tent at TCWBC.

Happy Trails,
