Subject: EGR hole?   

just got a 72 westy that had been laying up for awhile yesterday.  I fired it
up and it sounded like there was a huge exhaust leak.  Upon further evaluation
if was shooting exhaust out of a hole in the head.  The hole looks like it is
taped, and is on the #2 cylinder exhaust port near where the intake manifold
mounts to the head.  It is in a spot that normally I would expect a tin screw
to go into, but it is about the size of a spark plug hole.

Before pulling the head I thought I would ask if this is some type of factory
egr, or something that should be there.  I looked at me other 1.7 liter heads
and they have a screw hole for the tin there.

Thanks in advance.
