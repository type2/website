Subject: Re: [T2] EGR hole?   

Airic said:

 just got a 72 westy that had been laying up for awhile yesterday.  I fired
it up and it sounded like there was a huge exhaust leak.  Upon further
evaluation if was shooting exhaust out of a hole in the head.  The hole
looks like it is taped, and is on the #2 cylinder exhaust port near where
the intake manifold mounts to the head.  It is in a spot that normally I
would expect a tin screw to go into, but it is about the size of a spark
plug hole.

 Before pulling the head I thought I would ask if this is some type of
factory egr, or something that should be there.  I looked at me other 1.7
liter heads and they have a screw hole for the tin there.

It is NOT EGR.

EGR is Exhaust Gas Recirculation. EGR is introduced on the intake side. It
is there to dilute the fuel mixture to keep combustion temps below 2500F,
otherwise NoX gas will form. EGR did not appear on the buses in 1972, it
came on 73's.

What you have are the ports for air injection. AIR or Air Injection Reactor
involves adding fresh air to the exhaust side to complete the burn and lower
HC and CO. VW used a smog pump to push air in.

If I remember right, the ports are 10 x 1.0

They are #1 here:  http://www.ratwell.com/technical/Microfiche/t201800.gif

#10 screws on to them.

Some 1.7's used 2 ports on each side, some used 1 on one side and 2 on the
other.
