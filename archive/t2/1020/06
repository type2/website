J,

I notice that the wiki page you reference says that burning isopropyl will 
not form carbon monoxide...

This sounded a little sketchy to me so I checked out the MSDS for CO, 
which seems to provide conflicting information: that it *can* produce CO:

 	http://msds.farnam.com/m000673.htm

Thoughts?  (I was planning on bringing a CO metere when I did this anyway, 
but...)

Cheers,
    Tom
