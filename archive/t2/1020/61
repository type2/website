Subject: Re: [T2] SoCal  beach campsite in February ?

Try Bolsa Chica State Beach next to Huntington. Website below:

http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=642

right margin of website has camping info. Bolsa Chica is a nice big beach with
fire rings, etc. Kinda windy though. And you need to camp in the bus (no tent
camping per the website).
