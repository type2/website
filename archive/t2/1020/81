Subject: Re: [WetWesties] Prices for Nason paint per gallon

Seeing as Nason is Dupont's Econo lower scale in quality refinishing
material, I would have to say right off the top of my head the gallon
price may be a bit too high.

You talking just the paint--no hardener, and no reducer--right?
It may be close to OK--

I will tell you the EPA has their finger's in the pricing of paints--
and has so for the last 3-4 years.

I remember a gallon of  RED Centari (#72182 Mack Std, Red) with the
hardener, & a gallon of reducer was at $129.00 for the paint and all.

Now paint prices are off the wall--thank you EPA.

I just got done with a Mack 6 wheeler        (straight Dump bodied
truck) and the price of the red single stage urethane including the
hardener & reducer was $2276.43.

Yellow paint doesn't have much pigment in it, so it should be cheaper.

Hell, a gallon of Sherwin Williams Ultra Fill primer is 90 bucks plus
tax---

I could check with my Dupont buddy and see if they are smoking your
wallet real bad.
I need the paint number.
