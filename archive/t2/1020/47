I fixed mine by mixing bits of shreded steelwool into JB weld
slathered this on shaft and pushed on the nylon gear. built a nice
fillet up around the edges and let it sit undisturbed for at least
24hrs. it lasted about 7-8 years until motor failed. be carefull not
to let the JB get into the motor shaft housing

good luck
