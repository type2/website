courtney,

the price sounds about right, but you don't need anything close to a  
gallon to paint a bus. more like 1 1/2 quarts, depending on how much  
(if any) of the inside you are painting. most paint is a 1:1 mix with  
hardener so a gallon of paint is actually 2 gallons in the paint gun.

good paint materials are not cheap. between primers, fillers and  
paint & hardeners you could easily spend 1000.00 for a complete job,  
inside and out. and single-stage acrylic paint is getting more and  
more expensive as water-borne paint phases out the solvent based stuff.
