Your right Tom... anything that burns is dangerous! ...
I was tongue in cheek when I wrote that reply before,, in fact.. I personally
won't use a open flame heater in my camper.
ah,, and due to recent events.. don't ever want to see a flame near my camper
again!

That picture is for reference only,, although the event was real... everyone
had a fire ext in there hand until the flames were out.. then the camera's
came out.. so .. there are no real pictures of the burn....

  J,

  I notice that the wiki page you reference says that burning isopropyl will
  not form carbon monoxide...

  This sounded a little sketchy to me so I checked out the MSDS for CO,
  which seems to provide conflicting information: that it *can* produce CO:

  Thoughts?  (I was planning on bringing a CO metere when I did this anyway,
  but...)
