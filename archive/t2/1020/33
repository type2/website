Sorry folks, for some reason the link didn't work. It's at a site called
www.tire-easy.com . Type in the size 195-80-15 and the two tires come up
there.

  The popular Les Schwab,Nexen, Jupiter, Signet, WooSung SV820 is also
available in 15". I didn't know this, and have been going crazy to find tires
to fit the CalImports 5 spoke Empis for our bolt patter of 5X112mm. Here is a
link to the tire for those interested. At approx. 75 bucks each plus shipping
it's interesting to note someone is STILL making a 195/80-15 tire in the
correct weight range for Westies.
  https://ssl.delti.com/cgi-bin/order.pl There is also the Mastercraft tire in
the same size for the approx. same price.
