Subject: Best PNW scenic route?

My wife and I travelled the 12 from Yakima out to Centralia this past summer,
and have to admit it is one of the most beautiful roads we've taken in many
years. Anyone else travelled along there and seen the dams along the way, and
the backside of Rainier? Any other trips that are as gorgeous as this one?
