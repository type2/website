Subject: Shipping a Bus BE CAREFUL!

Be VERY careful! I've dealt with a number of auto shipping companies and they can be a very unscrupulous group. Do not accept the lowest bid. Here's how it works. You request a bid and it goes out to a number of different brokers. The broker will contract with you to move the car and require a deposit. Then the broker puts it out to bid to the haulers. The haulers will take the cars that will pay them the most money. If you've taken the lowest bid, by the time the broker has charged his fee, there isn't enough money to make it appealing to the hauler. Also, if you are shipping from Florida in April, the competition is very heavy. All those snowbirds are shipping their extra cars back to Minnesota.

So, your car will sit for weeks until you pony up another $400 bucks to sweeten the deal. Since you've already paid the deposit, and it will take forever to get it back if you cancel, you are stuck. I've had brokers take the money and then disappear. I've had contracts signed and then they held me up for another $400 to get the car moved. 

And, even if the broker is a good guy, he is not the one driving the truck. The drivers are a mixed bag, too.

I've found one broker that was honest, honorable and reliable. The driver was flaky, but the broker stayed on top of things. Company name is Autozipper. Here's the info: www.autozipper.com, 310 379 3200, email is info(-at-)autozipper.com. Also, check http://www.transportreviews.com. I used one firm that was rated well on the list, this was the one that stole our money, so you have to be really careful, that company was MLAT, Main Line Auto Transport. If I ever ship another vehicle, it will be with Autozipper.
