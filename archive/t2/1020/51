Subject: Re: [T2] Two Barrel Weber Carb Setup Question

Go to this link for basic instructions:

http://datsun1200.com/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=18048&forum=1

If the link is in 2 lines be sure to copy both lines to your browser.

Also, from experience, make sure that both butterfly valves close fully 
before starting the procedure. My 2nd barrel was open just a crack and idle 
was impossible. Try removing the carb to get a good look at everything and 
preset the idle mixture screw to 2 turns. I had to make a short tool to get 
to the mixture screw once the carb was installed. Currently my carb is 
working OK on a 1776. I suppose that a dual carb set up would be better from 
all the posts I've read.

As for jets, try:
idle primary = 60, idle secondary = 50
main primary = 135
main secondary =140
air correction main = 180
air correcttion secondary = 165

Or there  abouts.
