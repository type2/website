Paul asked:

  Anyway, I'm interested in any measurements regarding the size of  
the engine
compartment, but first-off I need the distance (in MM) from the  
flywheel end
of the block to the midpoint of the support bar.  If I don't get a  
response,
I'll crawl under my bus and measure it when my back allows it.  I  
hoped to
spend my recuperation time drawing the engine compartment in sketch- 
up.  It
seemed like a useful way to spend my cant-move time.

What year?
