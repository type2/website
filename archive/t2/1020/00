Subject: rear axle nut tool dimensions

I am looking for the dimensions of the tool in the picture.. it is a 46mm 
rear axle nut wacker [lol]
If you could measure from the flat of the nut to the outside past the small 
square hole..   I want to know how long the "handle" is past the edge of the 
nut hole...  I hope that is clear... lol
