Subject: Driving in the Snow

As someone who lives in a ski resort, driving in the snow is second nature.
The most important thing to remember is that real snow tires are made of a
different, softer rubber than just "got lots of traction" tires. Real snow
tires cannot be run in the summer or they will wear out very very fast. They
are sometimes called Ice tires. Remember however, when your tire runs over
just plain snow, the pressure turns it into ice, and now, magically you are
driving on ice. Unless it is very cold, such as -30C and down, where your
traction magically improves, just plain snow is in reality ice.  ( the
wetter the snow, the more easily it turns into ice, try it with a snowball)

Up here north of the 49th parallel, all our real snow tires have either a
little snowflake or a little mountain (around 1/2" across) impressed on
them, nothing else is legally a snow/ice tire.  If you are in an accident,
the first thing the police do is look for the tiny snowflake or mountain, if
they don't see it, you get a small fine, but more importantly your insurance
company assigns all the blame to you.  That's a bad thing.
