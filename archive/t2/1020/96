Subject: distance from end of block to support bar?

I posted this question on the IAC board (http://www.itinerant-air-cooled.com/viewtopic.php?t=3494), but I thought cross-posting to this email list might be a good idea.  I tweaked my back on Saturday up on Mt. Hood, so I can't slide under my bus to take this measurement myself.  I spent quite a while trying to find it via Google, hitting ratwell.com, the archives, etc.  I apologize if it's in the Bentley, but I can't get to my copy of that either (in the bus, and I can't really move much).

Anyway, I'm interested in any measurements regarding the size of the engine compartment, but first-off I need the distance (in MM) from the flywheel end of the block to the midpoint of the support bar.  If I don't get a response, I'll crawl under my bus and measure it when my back allows it.  I hoped to spend my recuperation time drawing the engine compartment in sketch-up.  It seemed like a useful way to spend my cant-move time.

Oh, and yes, it was a great day in the snow and I hope to get back up there in a couple of weeks :D
