Subject: Need help with O ring # 021-101-173

I have been unable to locate an O ring (the one that seals the oil pickup tube where it enters the case on a type 4 motor)? 
It is VW part # 021 101 173.? It is described by the VW dealer as 13 1/2mm x 3 1/2mm.? Makeup of the material isn't descibed.
I have tried everywhere I can think of but it is unavailable everywhere.? I really need one (or 4).? If anyone knows of a source for this part please let me know.
Alternatively, what type of material would hold up in this service?? Viton?? Possibly then?I could hunt by size.
Thanks,
Greg
Moundsville, WV
