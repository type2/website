hey jamie  When you see Norton again ask him about the westy he burnt  to the 
ground.  It was a friend of ours bus and Norton was driving it back  to the 
shop while we went on a week canoe trip and it threw a rod and came out  the 
top of the case and chopped the cold start injector clean off and flamed  away.  
Burnt the whole bus up.  When we got back and pulled into the  shop we saw 
the burnt bus and I told Tim  , you know that kinda looks like  your bus except 
it is burnt up .  :)     good photo  work  later  mark d
