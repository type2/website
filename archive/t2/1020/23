Subject: FW: [arizonabusclub] Attention : Sunday breakfast run

We meet at 16th st and Glendale Mc Ds 8;00 AM due to the marathon  by PF
Chang on Camelback Please pass the word Please

O.K. Here's a bit more of the story . As I will be
the navigator on this outing and did a pre-run on
thursday here is my assessment of the second part of
the run. This part can be done by a stock bus or a
stock bug . If your bus or bug is lowered i would not
recommend it. I repeat I would not recommend
continuing on the second part of the run. Just jump in
someone's bus for the second half and ride along, we
loop back to the starting point so you can pick up
your ride at the end. 


My other concern is the meeting place on sunday as the
marathon goes right along camelback road. The
congestion will be bad at the Coffee Plantation. I
have made a recommendation to Jerry to move it to the
McDonald's on 16th st and Glendale just west off the
51. This is Jerry's call as it is his run, I am just
the humble trail boss. At this point we will not
change the starting point unless we hear from Jerry.
