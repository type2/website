Subject: I found some tires suitable for 15" use on Westies

The popular Les Schwab,Nexen, Jupiter, Signet, WooSung SV820 is also available
in 15". I didn't know this, and have been going crazy to find tires to fit the
CalImports 5 spoke Empis for our bolt patter of 5X112mm. Here is a link to the
tire for those interested. At approx. 75 bucks each plus shipping it's
interesting to note someone is STILL making a 195/80-15 tire in the correct
weight range for Westies.

the same size for the approx. same price.
