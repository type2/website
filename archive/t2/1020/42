Subject: Re: [VB] Going to Havasu from No. LA Co. thursday

Coming from Ventura - CA126 East to I-5 South to CA14 North To Pearblossom
Hwy/CA138/CA18 East to I-15 North ((-at-) Victorville) To I-40 East to AZ95 South
into Lake Havasu.

I will check the current WIND conditions before leaving - up to 60mph NE
gusts predicted for Thursday morning at last report.  If too gnarly via I-15
& I-40, I will take I-10 East to Ehrenberg, then north thru Parker to Lake
Havasu.  It bit longer route, but it may be a bit better wind wise.

Departure is anytime after 3AM Thursday, but NLT than 7AM.

See everyone there.....
