Subject: Re: [T2] distance from end of block to support bar?

Paul asked:

 Anyway, I'm interested in any measurements regarding the size of the engine
compartment, but first-off I need the distance (in MM) from the flywheel end
of the block to the midpoint of the support bar.  If I don't get a response,
I'll crawl under my bus and measure it when my back allows it.  I hoped to
spend my recuperation time drawing the engine compartment in sketch-up.  It
seemed like a useful way to spend my cant-move time.

What year?

What engine?
