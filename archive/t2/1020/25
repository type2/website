Subject: Kadron Vacuum Port - where to drill?

Hi All,

Well, after much delay and taking my time, I finally got the engine back 
into my bus.

I changed from the stock FI to dual Kadrons.  No flames please. 
However, there is a snag.

I'm currently running an SVDA dizzy, and like it much better than the 
009 that was in the bus.  But, the Kadrons I have don't have a vacuum 
tap on them already.

I can see 2 places where passages have been plugged, and I believe I 
traced one out to provide vacuum above the butterfly, but wanted to ask 
before I went drilling on it. :)

I've searched the 'net, but it seems that "where to drill" the kadrons 
for vacuum is a closely guarded secret. :/ I'd rather not have to buy a 
new throttle plate for one of them, as I'm already pretty far out of 
pocket on this rebuild already.

Thanks!

Shad H.
