 I know that the argument about tires has all but been exhausted. However, I
heard about these Green Diamond Tires on the radio and was curious if anyone
out there uses them and has any feedback. The website boasts that they are
all climate tires and have little granules in them that give them better
traction.

 So far, with my engine half taken apart, I have not had the chance to go
try out my Hankooks in the snow to feel their handling. However, I always
like the idea of a new product that offers improvements and is enviro
friendly.

 Just curious if anyone knows anything about them. I have an email into them
to see if they make their tires in a 185R14. We'll see.

I went to their website  http://www.greendiamondtire.com/productswest1.html

but I see NO specs listed at all for max load weight. THAT is your biggest
concern. As a C tire, for Commercial not passenger C class, they need to be
at least 1450 lb rated.
