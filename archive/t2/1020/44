Subject: Re: shipping a bus

Sorry to see you leaving us here in SoFla Andy... as for shipping a Bus, 
there are a few websites out there. If you go to GigaMoves 
(http://www.gigamoves.com/) and select "Auto-Transport" you can specify 
information and you'll literally get about 30 or so transport companies with 
exact quotes by the next day or two.

They're pretty reasonable. I was going to have a Porsche 924 Turbo 
transported from Dallas to Fort Lauderdale, and it was only like $500 in 
un-covered parking.

If you can make it to Orlando, you can take the Auto Train which stops off 
in NC (Raleigh Durham). That's $250 bucks.
