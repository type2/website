Hmm, when we had the mysterious hesitation/lack of power (even after 
fuel filter and pump change) in our 78 on the return leg of a NJ to 
Indiana and back trip (like 2nd gear most of the way on back roads from 
around York Pa through Lancaster, King of Prussia, Doylestown, etc late 
at night), I left the fuel gauge attached (with a good fuel line clamp) 
so I could watch it when the symptoms appeared- I now know what fuel 
starvation looks like- the gauge swung wildly back and forth due to what 
we later found to be LARGE flakes of a coating a PO had used in the gas 
tank, which would block the line opening- blowing up the line let me 
drive for a while until it happened again.
