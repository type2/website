Similarly to Bob, I used plain old epoxy on mine with no bits of steel wool
and it's still going strong after 10 years (low mileage).  Try not to
overload the motor (i.e. don't try and start it when frozen, and turn the
wipers off as soon as it stops raining).  One of my shafts (that the arms
mount on) was completely seized as well, I'm sure this doesn't help...
