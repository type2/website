Subject: Need shipping suggestion FROM Germany (light, LONG part)

Does anyone have a suggestion for shipping a relatively light but long VW part (10lb or so) but unfortunately in a box about 4"x6"x48" from Germany to the US.   Shipper thought DHL would do it initially for about $75 (twice what the part cost) but ends up not due to size constraints, and the United Parcel Stealers want $250, which of course makes this ludicrous on a $40 item.  I'm willing to spend some cash as I want the item but am not wanting to go much over $100.  Anyone have any thoughts?  Anyone coming back in the military?  I'm in no time rush here.
   
  Thanks
  John
