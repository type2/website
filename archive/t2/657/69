Subject: Re: [T2] advice-shipping parts to Canada

UPS sucks coming to Canada,, they do GREAT going to USA...48 states from Canada
USPS is my preference, USA to Canada!
Canada is 6 time zones wide.... Ontario Canada,, the destination, is 3 time
zones west of Vancouver,, the place of the Customs agents with a beef..<err,
labour dispute>. apparently they are following Homeland security laws to a "T"..
sounds like a good thing until you find the law that contradicts the other law,,
oh my what a headache!

I have to thank a few folks for suggesting Postal shipping ,, as USA wouldn't
accept anything over 100cm ,, apperantly they have increased that to 200cm's
My hitch to Hawaii will go Canada Post to USPS ... as this time UPS wants me to
pay for them to take a vacation while they are there delivering the hitch!
Thanks ! Ron Salmon  , V W TECH-Bob,
