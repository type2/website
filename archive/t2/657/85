I have never understood why nobody ever marketed a beefier auxilliary heater
fan.  Sure you can add a bilge blower, and insulating your heating system or
providing a method of rear vent for recirculating your heat into your heater
system helps,.. but it takes more effort.

  I'm still surprised nobody capitalized on human nature to be a lazy butt.
