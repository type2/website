Subject: Foamy trans oil and the "S" word

Hi gang,

I finally had the cash to plunk down for some needed tools today.  One 
of them was a 17mm hex key.  I feel much better now that I can check 
the tranny oil.  Also funny, it brought back memories of working with 
Dad on his old M-B diesel.  I think it also required a 17mm hex or 
something similarly huge for the drain plug.  Must have been a strange 
'70s fad in Germany!

Anyway, I have some experience with 90wt from my Land Rover days.  It 
had 8 (!) separate holes that needed 90wt regularly, enough to keep the 
smell around for at least a week at a time.  OK, back to the task at 
hand.  The plug came easily, took that as a good sign after reading the 
archives.  Wiggled my pinky in there, and it came back with that 
familiar smell but covered in foam!  I never encountered this with the 
Rover.  Would this just be moisture in the oil, or does it indicate an 
end of life on the 90wt?  The check was after a low speed jaunt to 
Sears.  I was planning to wait for some kind of warm spell (i.e. above 
freezing) to change the trans oil.  Is this urgent?  The trans moans on 
overrun, but it's a pleasant, non-life threatening sort of sound.

I hope the following isn't taboo here.  I'm wondering if anyone has put 
some miles on Red-line or another synthetic trans oil.  Any troubles?  
Couldn't afford to experiment in the Rover at the rate it leaked, but I 
might on the bus.

all the best,
