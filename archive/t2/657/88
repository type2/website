Hi Mike,

The BN-4 has a plastic duct that pulls air from the left rear quarter 
panel, just below window height but above the 4" mattress height. This 
duct fed air into the BN-4 which was located on the left side of the 
engine compartment. Ducting this air over to the booster fan is a mod 
I've contemplated, but since I don't drive the Westfakia during "Salt 
Season", it hasn't been a big priority. I've been too busy camping in 
it!

The BA-6 warm air intake duct was located under the Z-Bed on the right 
side.

Happy trails,
