 Paint is paint!
 I'm in the ceramic coatings business and I coat lots of Harley, Yamaha and
 other Air Cooled cylinders with heat dissipating ceramic coatings.
 The color is black and it prevents rust, makes the cylinders run cooler and
 with the internal Ceramic coatings on the cylinder walls it breaks the
 engine in faster and gives better long term compression readings because it
 makes the rings fit better.
 The same cylinder external coating is used on the bottom sides of intake
 manifolds, pistons, rods, rocker arms, engine and transmission cases.
 Yes it helps!
 Cost is about $50.00 for cylinder external surfaces and $20.00 for inside
 surfaces (different material).
