Hi Seann,

Here's an example from EveryBus 2004:

Rat = Performance enhancements rather than aesthetic enhancements.

There was a 73 bay panel in comparable condition I saw online last year 
that had a Porsche driveline and suspension installed... Would have 
been a nice toy to blow off the local rice-burners some Friday 
evening...


Happy trails,
