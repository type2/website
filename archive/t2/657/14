That's correct Jack. I found a little more from Hoover in one of his
other articles. He says Black Rustoleum. So to summarize, this is what
I find:

On general engine parts, particularly crankcase and valve covers:

Flat black paint - Hoover, Paint Your Engine
Self-etching flat black paint of the non-insulating variety - Fisher, p. 98
Lamp black - Fisher quoting Irving, p. 96
Black anodizing - Fisher and Fisher quoting ALCOA, p. 97

On cylinders:

Black Rustoleum - Hoover, Jugs (Free Engine article)
Flat black paint or black stove paint (avoid insulating paints like
VHT) - Fisher, p. 73
Hot Aluminizing - Fisher quoting Crown, p. 97
