With a little bit of fabrication you don't have to move the spare to the
nose-crunching/wind-grabbing location.

Using thin mild steel or thick sheet tin just make a plate that will fit in
the spare tire well high up on the front or rear "side" (in the curved
part, not the straight left/right sides).

Mount that plate with no spacers at the bottom and enough spacers at the
top to create about 1/4" 'air scoop' gap.

The tire should still fit if you stay under about 1/2" total thickness at
the top of the well.

There's probably also enough room between the outside wall and the
tire/well to fab a bigger vent in that outside wall between the inner and
outer skin using flexible hose to attach it and drop down into the engine
bay.
