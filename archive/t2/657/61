Subject: advice-shipping parts to Canada

Hi,

I need to ship some parts from the US to Canada. Does anyone have any 
experience doing this? I checked UPS online for the cost and compared 
it with UPS WorldShip at work and the price is about the same. What I 
am confused about it duty, taxes etc. Do I declare a value? Is there 
duty on shipping things that are not new and not really being "sold" 
but are more of a "gift" ?

Feel free to share .




thanks
