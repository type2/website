The year it's built. Your guy imported an older model and "updated it" to
meet safety/emissions standards for the year it was built.

You can buy a pre-'80 bus, bug, or whatever from another country and import
it with few problems.

But a 2004 model has to meet all current DOT standards for new 2004
vehicles. 

That means you're going to have to buy about 10 or 20 of them and send all
but one through a crash testing facility, making upgrades between
destroying them to try to make them meet current side and front-impact
standards.

You're also going to have to figure out a way to add airbags and update the
engine to something that will meet emissions standards for new 2004
vehicles.

Why do you think autos in the US are so expensive. The manufacturers (sp?)
have to crash and bury a lot of prototypes before a model that will pass
DOT specs can come to market. That's also why you don't see many new
radical body style changes from year to year. Cheaper to stay close to a
style that's already been proven (testing paid for).
