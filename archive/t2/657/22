If it's the only heavy gauge red wire coming through the harness from
the alternator, then that is your charging wire. Standard location is
to the starter. Could probably get away with sending it straight to
the battery.

That being the case, then where does your other heavy red wire go, the
one you traced that is already attached to the starter?
