Hmm... don't know.

It runs inside a jacket that goes inside another slightly larger jacket that
leads through the tin into the alternator.

At least I think it is.  I'm halfway tempted to attach it to the battery to
see if it works.  I should have taken pictures of the engine compartment
when I dropped it off at the mechanic's.

Is it possible that not having it hooked up allowed it get to 33 volts?  It
came back down as I rev'ed the engine.  I'm just a bit leary of sending that
much voltage to the battery.
