I recommend I40. I'm in Flagstaff Arizona. Texas is nearly flat. New Mexico 
is almost flat. Arizona is a gentle grade from about 3000ft at the eastern 
border to about 7000ft in Flagstaff. then everything to the west of here is 
down hill. I'm not sure if I intended that pun or not? Make sure you have 
snow chains. We ocasionaly get some nasty snow/ice this time of year. It's 
supposed to get down to 2 deg f tonight.

Enjoy
