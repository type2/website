I searched for these seals for a restoration on my soon to be ex-78. I wanted the best and that is what these are. These are all new never installed. $250.00 including shipping(heavy) to the 48 states/offer

I have 4 rear lenses, oem brand on package, red and white no orange area. Look euro,don't really think they are. I just liked the look. two complete sets.  $25.00 inlcluding priority shipping to the 48 states.

I also have a set(front and rear) of NOS bumper over rider for late bays WITHOUT the rubber impact strip. They are a powdery white finish,include the seals,rubber plugs,attatchements,directions,complete NOS in box,they will need to be painted as they are in factory prep primer. Very rare and complete in box never installed. Make offer.
