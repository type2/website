Richard, mike out the size of the aluminum on a Bud Lite beer can.  The side 
of the can is just about .004".  Cut a small strip, and that should be a 
good fit for setting the throttle openings on the PDSIT32/34 carbs (or you 
could use Michelob Ultra, which has only 2.6 grams of carbs!!)

Cut off the bottom, and find a piece at .016" !!  Oh what fun...  (OK, you 
'could' use a soft drink can, but what the ZAMM...)
