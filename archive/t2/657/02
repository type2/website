For those who haven't seen it, here's the Hoover article on painting engines:

I prefer Fisher as he is more research oriented compared to Hoover's
sermonizing approach.

Actually, Fisher recommends two other approaches than paint. One I
previously mentioned was black anodizing. He has a paragraph devoted
to the other advantages of this approach, but he also recommends a hot
aluminizing method for cylinders.

 However, I've inferred from my reading there may be a longevity value
 to painting the cylinders only on a T4 engine. As I initially mentioned,
 Mr. Hoover recommends painting the cylinders and the photo on the cover
 of the Wilson shows painted cylinders.  I've no plans to paint the case
 or the heads. I will repaint the tin, but more as a rust inhibitor than
 for dashing good looks.
 
 If someone has experience as to whether the paint has helped with
 longevity and/or coolin or not, I'd appreciate the information/anecdote.
 I'd also love to know what paint has or has not worked on your cylinders.
