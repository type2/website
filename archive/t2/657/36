Subject: Resolution of one issue, now another (was Vanagon suicide)

Hello all - 
 
Thanks for your help over the weekend.  It turned out my Vanagon was stalling due to a failing temperature sensor.  The wire was frayed, and when the vehicle was moving, it wasn't giving good information to the computer.
 
A second question - how hard should it be for an air-cooled Vanagon to turn over on a cold (below 30 degree) morning?  I have to crank it for a good eight to ten seconds before it catches - is that normal?  Also, when starting in the cold, both the battery light and oxygen sensor lights stay on.  They go off as soon as I rev the engine a bit or drive away.
 
Thanks as always for your collective genius.
 
Marc
