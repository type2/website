Subject: Vehicle terminology

Several months back I was surfing around and found an advertisement for an
early bay panel van that somebody with some very bad customizing sense had
tweaked and welded on.  They claimed that it was a good 'rat'.

Last night I'm flipping through channels and came across Discovery
channel's, American Hot Rod, where they were modifying an old Ford and also
referred to it as a 'rat'.

What in blue blazes is a 'rat'?  what could a banged up panel and this hot
rod have in common?  is this a general term for a modified vehicle?

on a different topic,...
Are air bags a federal requirement for vehicles sold in the U.S. these days?
I'm seeing fewer and fewer car companies using the air bag as an add-on to
pump up their sales, and am hearing less about thieves smashing their way
into people's cars to steal them.  Could it be the the novelty of the airbag
has worn off due to it being a federal requirement?  Truthfully, I don't
think I've ever owned a vehicle that had them.  But I usually buy older
cars.
