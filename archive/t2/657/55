That fan on the Vanagon serves the same purpose as the auxillary fan
on the late bus which is mounted hanging from the engine compartment
roof.

 I was helping a friend install a vanagon engine the other weekend and
 noticed how VW attached the fresh air fan to the alternator.  Has anyone
 figured out a way to use this on a late bay with a pancake engine?  This
 would blow air much stronger than the engine fan.
 
 Any thoughts? Pros/cons?
