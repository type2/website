Darn, my mistake.  I traced the loose wire, not the others.  It appears that
it is indeed the charging wire.

The wire definetly comes from the alternator.  The harness splits just where
it comes through the tin behind the heater duct.  The harness is like
your's, in that it splits into two.  It certainly looks factory to me.

Anyone else on the list agree with John and me about hooking it up to the
positive terminal on the battery?
