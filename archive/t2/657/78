Ahhhh now that takes me back... Chevelle SS. Circa 1967-8

Mouse motor = small block Chevrolet. 265, 283, 327, 350 c.i.
Rat Motor = big block Chevrolet. 396, 427.
Crate motor = A new engine from the dealership. Targetmaster 
replacement motor.  At $1250 a new 350 four bolt main Targetmaster 
motor was a steal. Available at your local Chevy dealer's parts 
counter.  Larger dealerships had them in stock. The 427 crate motor was 
a bit more... ($4k) and usually special order.

Rat motor was predominately used to describe the 396. Mouse motor the 
350.

A comparison for T2 purposes would be the type1 motor which be the 
equivalent of a mouse motor and the type4 motor that would be the 
equivalent of a rat motor. Especially around 1970-72.  1600 to 1700, 
only a hundred cc's but completely different engines.

(See George! I got type 2 content in there. ;o) )
