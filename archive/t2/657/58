yes BUT I have to say the stretch thru Glenwood Canyon has got to be some
of the prettiest roadway in the USA.  I go out of my way to take 70 thru
the canyon, also I have followed the Colo river from Winter Park all the
way to Green River in Utah so I am hardly the one to ask, heck last time
out there I drove over Loveland pass rather than go thru the tunnel, just
for the heck of it...(of course it was a rental car since I had flown into
Denver and was going skiing at Snowmass) but I have driven a 65 in those
mountains too,  going fast is only possible on downgrade, and then you
pull over and let the brakes cool occasionally.

take care, enjoy the drive etc etc etc....
