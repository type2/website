Hi Mike,

You could replace the squirrel cage fan with a blower but if you're 
only keeping the squirrel cage as a T adapter in the airflow I would 
recommend using something else... the squirrel cage is not designed for 
this and would block a lot more airflow than a proper Y connector.

Reheating air from the passenger compartment was stock in BN-4 and BA_6 
equipped buses, it makes sense because it can provide warmer air to the 
heater and helps equalize pressure in buses that are otherwise 
airtight. If you replace all the seals on your bus and everything is 
tight, how do you expect to pump warm air freely into the vehicle? 
Sucking cabin air into the heater intake will improve heater output.

Happy trails,
