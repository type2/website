At this point I feel very confident that your loose wire is the one
that was supposed to be connected to the starter. At this point you
could temporarily hook it to the battery so you can test the voltage.
Once you verify everything is in order, you can move it to the starter
where it belongs. You may want to run a remote starter wire from the
starter solenoid to the battery so you can start the bus from the
engine compartment and thus minimize the running time while you check
for abnormal voltage.

 I got under the bus and attempted to trace the wires on the starter.  It
 appears that only the heavy wire to the battery goes back into the engine
 compartment.  The red wire with a white stripe, the smaller red wire, and
 the heavier of the two wires on the spade connector go toward the front of
 the bus.
 
 There doesn't appear to be any other wire going from the starter back toward
 the alternator.
 
 My only concern about hooking the loose wire up to the starter is the
 excessive voltage at idle (see above).
 
 Does anyone out there know if the 33 volts from the loose wire will correct
 itself when properly hooked up to the battery?  Can I temporarily hook the
 wire directly to the positive battery terminal for now?
