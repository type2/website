Having messed with both 70 and 80 after recently moving to Denver, I would
highly recommend heading north on 25 through Denver and getting on 80 of you
are coming up this way.  70 just plain sucks and we just had a huge land
slide take out a good section of it which is going to take extensive time to
repair.  I believe only one lane is open currently.

Assuming you're headed for Southern Cal, you probably want to take the 
40 across the Texas panhandle, NM, AZ, and meet up with the 15 in 
Barstow, CA. The grades are much gentler than on the 70. (The 70 from 
Denver to Dylan is serious climbing).
