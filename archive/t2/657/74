Congratulations! 

The only point I see in moving the wire to the starter is because that
is where future mechanics / owners will expect it to be. Myself, I
always thought it was kind of indirect to have the current go to the
starter, and then from there go to the battery for charging. I guess
since the bus really runs off alternator current when running, it
creates a more direct route for the current to go more directly from
the alternator to the rest of the bus electricals.

 I hooked it up to the battery and viola!  It works.  No more glowing
 alternator light at night and there's 14.1 volts at the positive post on the
 battery.
 
 Thank you to everyone who helped out.
 
 I'm not sure if I want to go through the trouble of running it through the
 grommet and to the starter, but I might replace the end of the wire and do
 it anyway.
 
 It was so good to drive to the store and back without watching the alt light
 get brighter and brighter.  And my low/high beams work properly now.  I
 didn't need a tailgater to light the road in front of me. :O)
