Subject: Re: [T2] paint for cylinders

Just for my 2 cents worth,
When I re-built my motor I applied a very thin film of "cold galvanising". 
It's a zinc rich paint which handles the heat fine. I applied it only to 
reduce the build up of rusty scale some cylinders get, not for looks.
I initially wanted to have them "electroless nickel" plated but the cost was 
prohibitive (~$100 per cylinder). This is the same coating most spark plugs 
have.
