This is what I do,

Cut the back end off first just in case
Grab what you can of the cable in front with a pair of vise grips and yank 
and with sharp jerks
Let the winding unwind and pray.
If you then brake it all and there is no more to grab onto then,
Cut the tube about half way down the bus and try from here
Then slip a 2 inch section of fuel hose over the cut tube to repair it
If this doesnt work then your in trouble
Remeber to apply lots of grease for the next 30 year cable replacement job

Good luck and better yet good skill,
