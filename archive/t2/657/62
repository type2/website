Subject: Darn pesky little fresh-air lever spring-clip!

I removed the front grille and the two fresh-air flaps from the 
Wonderbus to replace the gasketing. Starting to get cold in the morning 
and old gaskets were leaking quite a lot, making it a bit breezy in the 
cabin when driving on the freeway.

My local FLVWPS did not have stock on the OEM style rubber gaskets so I 
contact-cemented some regular hardware-store foam gasketing on the flaps 
after wire-brushing the old adhesive off. To get "tall" enough gasketing 
I bought some wide, thick stuff and cut it down to 3/8'' wide. 
Re-installed it all and everything worked as planned . . . except for 
one little detail. While flipping the fresh-air levers up and down to 
check action and make adjustments I heard this little rattling sound . . 
. like something falling down forward of the dashboard. Took a gander 
behind the flaps and -- sure enough -- one of the little spring clips 
used to secure the lever's operating rod to the rear of the gasket had 
fallen off. I must not have snapped it all the way one. Darn. I also 
noticed that another was missing from the cabin side of one of the rods. 
So I need two.

Are these things available anywhere? Has anyone found a cheap and 
cheerful substitute?
