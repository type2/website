Well, I visited all of the links on the Heat page in the Library.  I found a
picture of an intake vent that did not go through the fuel tank space
(yikes!), but not a detailed description to go with the picture:
http://www.type2.com/library/heat/intrir3.html  The pic is part way down the
page on the left.

I'll look at a comple of different ways of getting cabin air to the
blower/cage.  The intake in that picture partially blocks a little bit of
the rear hatch opening.  There has to be a better place for it.

More later...
