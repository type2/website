Subject: Alternator Questions

I've been trying to figure out a charging problem with my bus.  It seems to
have finally been narrowed down to the wire that normally goes from the
alternator to the starter that charges the battery.

For some reason, the mechanic never reconnected this wire after an engine
replacement.

Here's what I have at the moment...

I used a volt meter to check the wire.  With the engine off, it's at zero
volts.  With the engine at idle,
it's at 33 volts.  Rev'ing the engine up (using the carb linkage), it drops
down to something like 15-19 volts.

Is this normal?  I just read the Bentley (thanks, Richard) and it states
that to run the alternator without a battery in the circuit can severely
damage the alternator and/or regulator.  Is this a symptom of a damaged
alternator/regulator, or what would normally happen without the wire being
hooked up properly?

I'm afraid of hooking up the wire (thought about just connecting it to the
battery positive terminal just to see if it works) with it putting out 33
volts.  If this is just a symptom of not being hooked up and the voltage
will drop to a normal 14-15 volts, it should work fine.  I'm just not
knowledgeable enough to know what the correct thing is to do.

Should I just hook the wire up?
