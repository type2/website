The build up of crud behind the pedal should be vacuumed periodically, and 
a bit of grease wouldn't hurt. But if it does fail, it's very easy to fix 
temporarily to get back home for a proper fix.

3 years does not even approach the definition of 'long run'. My Bus is 30 
years old and it has never left me stranded in 10 years of daily use. I 
fail to see how anything could be more reliable. Through standard 
maintenance inspections I always find any weakness months if not years 
before failure, so have lots of time to budget time/money to fix it at the 
next inspection. Easy squeezy.
