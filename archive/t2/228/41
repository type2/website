I'll respectfully disagree.  The stopping time is given by dividing the
inital velocity by the deceleration:

V=Vo+at  (where V is final velocity, Vo is initial velocity, a is
acceleration, and t is time.

The final velocity is zero:

0=Vo+at

we're working with deceleration, so a is negative

0=Vo+at

rearranging:

Vo=at

t=Vo/a

Plugging in the numbers:

t=88/23

t=3.8s

This is assuming a constant deceleration.

Your equation also assumes a constant acceleration, but you are using
the stopping distance as your input.  An easier way to do it is to use
average velocity:

s=Vat  Va=V+Vo/2

s=(V+Vo)t/2

167=(0+88)t/2

solving for t gives:

t=3.8s
