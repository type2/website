Subject: Re: [T2] 1970 westy~sliding door inside handle

[...]

Well, d'oh! on my part. I didn't even see '1970 westy' in the subject line
until I hit send.
OK, then you need the double-ended handle.
Like I said in my 1st reply, it is pretty much unobtainable now. Very rare to
show up on ebarf.
The double-end made it slightly easier to open the door with the sink unit in
place. If you don't have the sink unit, you can use the standard handle.... as
pictured in the ebarf link I sent earlier.
Only the later Westies got the rear helper handle as pictured in the link. I
only sent that link to help you identify your handle. As I said earlier, the
standard handle is the same as the one pictured. The only difference is the
bracket that mounts on the door. LIKE I SAID AT THE BOTTOM OF MY MESSAGE!

BTW, they don't normally show cracks on the outside. But if you remove the
handle and look on the back side around the metal insert, that is where the
cracks appear and weaken the handle.
