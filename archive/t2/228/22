Subject: Re: [T2] US spec vs. Euro

i would assume the amber ones are Euro because on my 65 beetle, american
cars had solid red, mine was supposed to have red/amber lenses... it
would stand to reason they kept to that theme throughout the years,
regardless of what year bus you are talking about (since that wasnt
stated in the original post). my bus (1970) has all red... so i dont have
the white as you said in your original post.
