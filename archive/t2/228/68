Subject: Re: [T2] newbie repairing totaled bus

Jacques in Yakima-

If you think you can fix this bus, do it.
Since you took the time  to have it inspected
by a frame specialist and he suggested you
replace the wheel assembly components,
then is is repairable, so do it.
Replace the whole wheel assembly and go for an alignment.
This will show any additional work to be done.
And then you will no longer claim beginner status.
