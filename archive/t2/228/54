now I'm really confused.  I just ordered a set of the taillight assemblies
and ordered amber/red/white and was told they were Euro spec taillights,

now my 78 delivered in the USA (got the birth cert) came with
amber/red/white so it should be USA spec....?????

and the list now can't make up my mind so did they change at some point??
most of the later ones I see on the USA roads seem to have the
amber/red/white when I notice
