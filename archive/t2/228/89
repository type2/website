Subject: poptop seal ??

Hi.  The poptop seal on my 78 westfalia has gone bad.  I have ordered a new 
one and it is due in next week or the following.  My question is....

Can I safely take the seal off and leave it without one for a week or so?  I 
would like to get the rust and crud cleaned out before the new seal gets 
here.  There are also a couple of shows I am going to this weekend and I 
really don't like popping the top and having three feet of seal hanging all 
over.  Would taking the seal off pose any threat to the body, canvas, top?

Thanks,
Susan
