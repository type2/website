I just took 4 pics of the early bay Westy handle. They are:

This one shows them looking pretty good.....but if you look close at the left
one, you will barely see a fine crack at the base of the small handle.

This one shows them from another angle. The left one really shows the cracks
at the hub.....that crack at 11:00 is the one that appears in pic 1.

This is a close-up of the left one. Sorry, it is the best I could with this
camera. Besides the big crack at 11, it has a half dozen other small cracks.

Here is the right one. No major cracks. But a few fine cracks.

Then just to show what the later Westy handles look like, I took pics of the
front and rear handles. The rear one is just a helper handle. It does not
move. It is only mounted on a fixed square shaft. There is no linkage in the
back of the door for the handle.

Hope this helps.
