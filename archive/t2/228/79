I'll second that. I had a 1971 Buick Wildcat (What is it with me and
'71's?!!) that was really awesome. It had a 455 engine, one of the biggest
stock engines every made by GM and a true muscle car, but fully equipped
luxury, too.. I LOVED that car!!! It got in a bad accident and the front was
totalled. This was many years ago, before I understood the meaning of the
words, "You can't do that!". People told me it was goners. Not only was it
not a goner, but I located and installed a complete front end on my baby
before a week had gone by. Yes, I had to take it to have the frame
straightened. No biggie, said and done! Love will find a way!
That Wildcat and I had a lot of fun times after that. If you want to save
your bus, it sounds like it is probably salvageable. But keep one thing in
mind.. When an insurance company totals a car, they do so because it is
cheaper than fixing it.. That doesn't mean it cannot be done.  Jan B
