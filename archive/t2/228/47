not always possible... if i have cars behind me, i am not going to stop
at the top and wait for the front car to get ahead of me, thereby forcing
traffic behind me to pile up and cause generally unnecesary congestion
(not to mention a bunch of angry motorists)...

sometimes i can not anticipate the car in front of me going as slow as
they sometimes go. i am constantly amazed by how horribly some people
drive... totally oblivious to the fact that they are NOT the only people
on the road. when they get to the end of the ramp, they just expect to
get on... regardless of other drivers in that lane NOT wanting to let
them on. maybe it is just Tulsa drivers...

but in general, i agree with you... i DO try to hold back IF i see the
person seems to be taking their time AND there is no one behind me... or
whenever otherwise possible. but like i said, it isnt always an option.

waving to all the bad drivers around here (just won't tell you which
finger),
chris, the girlie, but not always ladylike one

ps~ the bit about one's leg in the other person'a trunk was funny, too.
