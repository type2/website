Richard,

My guess (and this is *just* a guess would be wheel bearings or king pins
('64, right?  has the king pin front end?) with other things to look at
being rust in the front axle beam, tie rods, and shock mounts. I don't
think the brakes are the problem, I think they are a temporary cure.  As I
am reading it, whatever is going wrong, it starts up a vibration during
the turn and the braking is stopping that vibration.  Check?  There are a
lot of things up front that can go into a cycle of vibration if they are
not tied down properly and many times the stress of braking will break the
cycle and calm it back down for a while.
