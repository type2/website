Jay,

No fuel pump, pretty much *no go*.

Gravity feed is only of interest during a fire.  Repalce your fuel lines 
now!

Air cleaners are pretty important also...75% more wear or more with no
air cleaners...try breathing during a dust storm...you get the idea....
and your engine "breathes" a lot morethan you do.

You can buy air cleaners for each carb at your
Friendly Local Auto Parts Store, or vwflaps.

Measure the outside diameter of the carb top first.

Cheers ,dave
