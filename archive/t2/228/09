Well, it will stop, just not as quickly. The coeficient of rolling 
friction is higher then the coeficient of sliding friction, hence keeping 
the tires rolling allows you to stop faster. The fastest you can stop is 
holding the tires just shy of the skid point. This is what anti-lock 
brakes do. If you have ever seen the marks on the road from a panic-stop 
with anti-lock brakes you see a long trail of short little skids as the 
system moves the brakes from just past the skid point to just shy of it. 
On average it is holding the tires at just shy of the skid point.
