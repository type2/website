Subject: Re: [T2] US spec vs. Euro

Huh??? Before more BS gets thrown around over this. Whoa!
The original postee that asked this question lives in the US and has a 78 bus,
if you had read all the way to the bottom of his post.
Here is his info:
Richard
1978 Westfalia CDN
Austin, TX

ALL USA spec buses from 72 up with the long taillight is Amber on top, Red in
the middle, White on the bottom.
Here is a pic of a 78 bus from the 78 factory brochure:

Here is the spec page from that brochure:

Stamped on the bottom is the dealer it came from in Fairfax, Virginia. And if
you read the * it says 'based on 1978 EPA....'
so it is a USA brochure.
