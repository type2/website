No.  The torsion bars in passenger vans are different than the torsion
bars in campmobiles (Westies) and in commercial vehicles.

Jaques,

What you are contemplating is certainly possible, but when the rear
torsion
tube is bent, you are at a major decision point. In my book, your
insurance company is correct... your bus died.  With enough money,
however, resurrection is possible for a car.  Certainly the "restorations"
of some early Rolls Royces prove this!  Start with an original gas pedal
and build a car around it, basically :-)

I would really prefer if Kelly would weigh in here (and I actually called
to ensure that :-), but slicing out the rear housing and installing a new
one is a *MAJOR* project.  First, it is a big sub-assembly, second,
alignment is *critical* and third, your life depends on the welds not
cracking.  All three of these militate toward getting a real pro to tackle
the job.  If i had a bus that I was so sentimetally attached to or if I
had a bus that was so valuable that I would attempt this, I would look for
someone like Kelly, who has *years* of experience and the tools to attempt
it.
