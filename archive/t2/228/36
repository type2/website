Subject: Re: [T2] newbie repairing totaled bus

from what i have been told, the campers were from the factory, stock
sunroof busses. they were shipped to whichever camper company did the
conversion (westfalia, riviera, sundial...). so yes, regular bus and
westy rear ends are the same. i may be "just a girl" and not very
knowledgable, but this should be right. please, someone correct me if i
am wrong.

chris, the girlie one
70 westy
65 euro beetle w/ metal sunroof
