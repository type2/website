Karl,
Thanks for the picture of the early bay Westy handle for the sliding
door (double ended). Now, here's the tricky part...does anyone know
where one is available?
A not-so-careful "friend" has broken mine into bits.
I have called VW salvage yards that I know of and cannot find a
replacement at all.
Thanks for any leads.
