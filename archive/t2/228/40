Subject: 1970~sliding door inside handle

hey guys, my ex broke my bus >:(
we yanked on the inner sliding door handle like it was excaliber stuck in
the stone... SNAPPED IT RIGHT OFF!!! i was so mad... what was he
thinking??? i mean this bus is older than both of us! i just cant believe
he used such excessive force! i have never had trouble opening it (once i
figured out HOW to open it from the inside *blushes*). anyway, i have
called BugHaus here in tulsa ( http://bughaus.com ) and they dont have
any in stock, they only come straight from VW and they cost $39.95!!!
YIKES! so i call one of the two VW friendly salvages in town and they
think the owner gets $50!!! GEEEEZ! i'd rather have the new one anyway!
well, they told me to call back monday when the owner is in, so i will.
but if he really does want that much, and bughaus cant get it, i will be
needing help from you kind folks to hook me up. there is no reason this
item should cost that much. it is just a plastic handle, for crying out
loud! so if anyone has one, please let me know... thanks. i think what
upsets me more than anything (because he really really feels bad about
it) is that it was something i actually didn't need to replace... NOW I
DO! and i wouldn't have if he hadn't yanked it as hard as he did. i
honestly believe it would have lasted ME a very long time.

oh, in case you were wondering about the other salvage... he is the one
who was storing my other 65 beetle and decided to sell it on me, so i
refuse to do business with him unless it is a LAST resort... even then, i
will have someone else go there for me. 

thanks, guys,
chris
