Subject: Re: [T2] poptop seal ??

Here's the risk. Without the seal and driving at speed, air can get under 
the top and lift it, and in the worst case, tear it right off, the whole 
top ending up in someone's windshield. If you will be just running around 
town at 25, not too much risk. But if you have to travel at 55+, just a bit 
risky.
