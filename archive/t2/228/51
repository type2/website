Subject: Re: [T2] US spec vs. Euro

Euro specs tailights have amber on them, US don't.
For example my '69 bus is swiss market specs and the tailights are 
amber/red white US specs are
solid red. Models after 71 are amber/red/white for Euro, red/red/white for 
US specs. Turn signals are
at the top of the housing.
Hope it helps,
