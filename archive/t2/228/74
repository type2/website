And what the rest of us really want to know.... Can I stop *before* or
*after* I hit the car in front of me???? :-)  Both 3 and 7 seconds are way
too long to contemplate this question and the only meaningful answer comes
after the panic.  the best way to assure that the answer is "before",
regardless (OK, George and Bob are both welcome to post the equasions)is
to...

As you are driving, no matter what and no matter where... watch as the car
in front of you passes some fixed point (a mile marker, a dash in the line
in the road, etc..  Count (slow, full second count)  to three.  If you
have passed that same point before you reach three, then you are too damn
close! Drop back!!!!!
