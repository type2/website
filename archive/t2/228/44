Subject: Drove a VW Winnie w/$26K Video/Audio Gear Today

Well since its Friday.....

I've been killing time until school starts again for the fall semester on 
the 19th by working at a friends RV shop.

A 2001 VW that had a Winnebago rear end came in today for a couple of 
fixes.  When all was said and done, I drove it back to the owner's office a 
few blocks away.

He had recently added an audio/video system that would make most home 
owners drool.

48" wide (not diagonal) Plasma display at the foot of the bed, satellite 
(direct TV) antenna on the roof with tracking system to keep the antenna 
pointed while in motion, DVD, VCR, etc.  13" monitor for passengers and 
even had a 14" LCD display in the front dash which just about any signal 
source could be routed to it.

His assistant said that the van just came out of the installation shop and 
just over $26K was spent on all the "goodies".

Did I mention that the guy bought a Lamborgini at the same time?

He's headed up to NorCal later this month and it should be interesting 
seeing that thing pull the grapevine.  Not much pickup left in that engine 
with all that extra weight.

Oh well.... back to the wrench turning.
