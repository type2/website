The item is definitely a rare find in a junkyard.  If you do go hunting
don't dismiss the location at the rear of the sliding door that rear
occupants can use to close the door.  They are sometimes hiding there
especially when the sliding door is broken which was the case when I found
one.

I didn't even know about this 2nd handle until I saw the campmobile manual.
