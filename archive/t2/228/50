well that plastic ages and not gracefully it might have been ready to let
go at any moment anyway..... I use my sliding side door everytime I use my
bus so it gets lots of abuse...after breaking a couple of those plastic
handles ($$$$) I just broke down and made one of aluminum bar stock and
it has not given me any problems in 7-8 years.  figure if I ever sell the
thing and it makes a difference I will put the old one back on, but form
follows function....
