Subject: need rear defogger advice


Folks,

I am getting ready to start putting all of my 78 bus windows back together
in preparation for installing.

I tested the resistance on the rear window defogger grid and get nothing.

All traces appear to be in great shape.
I can get continuity down each side from the clip on each side, and then
about 1/3 of the way down each cross grid.

Never had a chance to test the window before I took it out, but it "looks"
just fine.  Anyone know how to test this other than continuity?...No ,
I don't have  really big freezer<grin>.

If it is bad, does anyone know of a good fix?

Cheers, dave
