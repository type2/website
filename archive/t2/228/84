Subject: Pair O'Busses

Okay everyone happy weekend.

I know I've threatened before, but I really gotta sell my two Busses.  Big
changes in life that don't include them make this necessary.  Not that I
really like it.

Bus #1.  1976 Transporter.  Ugly brown.  Air conditioning with all the parts
but not working.  Runs pretty good for having lots and lots and lots of
miles on it.  Needs a master cylinder and a battery.  Real good body.

Bus #2.  1979 Transporter.  Orange.  Doesn't run.  I suspect it is because
someone ran it without an engine seal for too long and it gave up.  Body
real good, all FI stuff there and supposedly working.  I bought this Bus for
parts, but realized it was way too good to cut up.

The vans are in Atlanta.  Anyone interested give me a shout and I'll give
you the down and dirty.  Anyone interested in the '76 if it had brakes let
me know.

I'd take $800 for the '76 and $350 for the '79, or for the really ambitious,
$1000 for the pair.  Both have good titles.

This is really it.  Next step may be drastic.  Thanks for reading.
