There's another reason for "totaling" a car...the title. You or I may 
be attached to a car (I've got a Morgan "basket case" spread through-
out my house and garage), and spend the time and money to bring it
back, but the next buyer would/should know that. Lots of cars are
totaled and suffer unsafe damage to frame/structural components,
but are rebuilt. Fires and floods are other causes for changes on 
titles. The problem comes in when unscrupulous resellers "wash"
the title to remove the notification. This would be worth knowing
on a 2 or 3 year old car and certainly would affect my decision to 
either purchase a car or not. On a '71 bus or Wildcat (or '62 Mor-
gan), again, I'd prefer that I knew the history...
A buddy of mine bought some cheap wheels a while ago (a twenty-
something year old Ford van with low miles) to use as a work truck.
It had been hit by a falling tree limb years before; totaled by the in-
surance company (this time because of cost, as you said), but re-
paired and in use. The problems came up about a year later...The
windshield leaked (no prob, more silicone, it's a work truck), till
the front end collapsed (luckily entering a driveway and not at
speed) from internal rust - I'm sure there's Bus owners who can
relate to that! 
My point is, repairs can be made to anything, but they should be 
done right and documented.
