Be careful though... We chased codes on a Cavalier one time and we replaced 
$200 of parts before we discovered that the MAP sensor was bad - that code 
did not flash until the other items were replaced which of course implies 
that the other parts were defective as well. Some of them were, some were not.

A mechanic I talked to said it still took some experience to understand how 
two codes for separate problems might actually point as a third yet unnamed 
sensor.

I do prefer (more) modern systems than the '70's systems because of the 
efficiency and air pollution improvements but they take experience just 
like the vintage Bosch systems...
