I'd recommend Rex Key and Security on 1908 University Avenue in Berkeley.

A couple months ago when my fastback ignition/steering lock mechanism
fell apart I went to my local junkyard and pulled one off a squareback for
10 bucks,
then brought it down to them and they Took my old ignition and put it in the
new housing - same key - for another $10. They indicated that they could
have
keyed it but it would've cost more. They do have VW blanks. I'd try them.
