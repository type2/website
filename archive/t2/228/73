Subject: Making Progress

My project before going to Buses of the Corn is to replace the heads on the 
'71. I was hoping to have the 1904 cc built by Kurt Mezger ( cover of 
Trends light blue turbo bug) but the crank was not finished in time and we 
don't want to rush things. I dropped the engine tonight and started to 
dismantle what I could. It looks like the rear main seal is leaking (pool 
of oils in the tranny). I just add it onto what I need to do. I found that 
I am missing the oil cooler sheet metal so I'm in search of that tomorrow. 
Wish me luck!
