Subject: grateful dawg

it's friday, i recorded grateful dawg on monday night as promised, so
anyone who wants a copy just e-mail me and i will tell you where to send
a video tape. ironically, i was at blockbuster on tuesday looking for
something to rent and guess what i saw on the shelf? irony... gotta love
it! so anyone can go rent it if they like.

Barry Burneskis, e-mail me and we'll talk about getting you a copy of the
movie, or tell me if you just want to go to blockbuster yourself.
