Subject: 63 FS; Free Camping (NJ) for help on 75 bus

The SO and offspring are off on a combined business trip to CA- I'm free
this weekend to work on the 75bus (trans gottas be replaced) and will
offer free camping on the 16 scenic acres to any bussers who want to
help, and also check out the 63 van/camper I want to sell to make room. 
Mostly need help getting the 75 into the garage, which is built into a
hill at at least cool inside.  The 63 has been garaged for at least 4
years, solid underneath, painted by PO and converted into a basic camper
with pullout bed, Ice box, cabinet sort of like a 70 Camper.  Has new
rubber, and I have the one windshield it needs, and extra seats Karl
sent.  PO said it had a knock reminicent of a rod, but it turns.  Don't
have time for it and would like to see it get a good home.  A negotiable
$1200.  The 71 in the woods has a good engine that can be taken.   I
have all sorts of Westy bed covers, eary 70's bed, closet, and 74 camper
available for stripping (I want the trans)- has good dual carbed orig.
engine (140K) in parts and camping stuff.
I'm 12 mi west of Princeton, NJ- Steve D, Tony R, Long Island people,
anyone in Pa, De, Md, NJ, NY out there?  I can be reached at
609-737-3867; if no answer, try 609-731-4703.
