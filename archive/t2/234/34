Subject: bus sighting-mov. "Collateral Damage"

In the latest Schwarzenegger offering "Collateral Damage" did any one
notice the brownish VW Westy, bay, with the roof painted the same color,
a tire on the front AND a tire on the rack, with a bike hanging in the
rear?  It drove through a scene front approaching you.  Any one 'fess to
knowing this one?
