Hey all..
I just got my 1978 Bus up and running. It had been sitting for over 3 yea=
rs...I bought it about a week (or so) ago and the place I bought it is a =
VW garage...They know the air-cool...anyway, the engine had been rebuilt,=
 and new alternator is in place...new oil...new sparks...the whole nine y=
ards...About the only problem it was showing was an odd oil leak around t=
he left hand side valve cover...After taking it off, cleaning it, new gas=
ket, then running the bus around a bit, adjusting the cover some more, th=
e oil leak seems to be gone. =20
So I drove it here and there, the speed an average of about 40 MPH...Then=
 tonight I took it out to Miramar (about 20 miles from where I live in Mi=
ami) and cruised along at about 70...Seemed to be fine. Stopped and let m=
y brother off at work. Engine purring. Turned the corner--Stall. Got abou=
t 40 feet. Let it sit for a few minutes (thought it might be hot)...Turne=
d over, and it would start, but then stall. Figured maybe the gas gauge i=
s inaccurate, so pushed it to the Chevron right around the corner. 3.180 =
gallons later, it was full. So I knew it was not out of gas. Jumped in an=
d started, drove home about 3 miles, when it started to stall again. Long=
 story short, I got home in third gear, limping...It would go up to 40, t=
hen sputter down to 30, then up to 40...and so on. Barely made it home. W=
hen I did stop at lights, and sit, the engine would be fine. Then I would=
 put it into first, and it would almost stall...thus why if I left it in =
third, I got home. Weird. I have had 11 VWs in all (4 Type 1, a Type 3, t=
wo Type 2, A Ghia, and three Rabbits) and never had I run into this befor=
e...Any ideas? I am tired, it's late; maybe I'm missing the obvious...
