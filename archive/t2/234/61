2.0 FI heads have small valves.( 37.5 X 33 )
Even the 1.7 L 914 are bigger ( 39.3 X 33 ). These will fit with a flycut.
For this larger displacement, find a pair of 1.8 carb heads ( 41 X 34 )
or have yours modified, with new seats and mild port matching.
Additional breathing ( like the vents in 914 heads ) is a good idea.
Consider dual carbs for more, direct intake, and a non-stock muffler.
Choose a cam for torque over horsepower ( for the towing application ).
