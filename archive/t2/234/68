hey,
 i actually just bought a 68 squareback. im trying to sell my bus now, for i 
have no garage room. i love squarebacks! parts arent hard to get. you can 
find a place on the internet. ill send you a link that sells all type 3 parts 
if you would like. i personally like the older models better. the 60's models 
are the way to go. they just look sharper. well theres my input, and i'd say 
gor for it. ok well talk to ya later,. see ya
