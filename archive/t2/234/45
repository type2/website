So, go down to Haight Ashbury and find a burned out Dead Head with wire and 
pliers. At least he will love buses. Better invite him along if you don't 
want to be left low and dry in the desert after everyone else leaves. At 
least then you will have company to get parched with.

Seriously, do you really think that actually making your 30+ year old bus 
safe and reliable can be done by someone without the skills to be worth 
something? If he does have the skills required, do you think it is 
reasonable for him to put aside prior scheduled commitments, with damage to 
his reputation, so he can sneak you in ASAP at a reduced rate of return??? 
Do you really just need to leave for Burning Man, or do you also need to 
make it there and back??

I suggest that getting towed from Burning Man to the nearest shop from hell 
will not meet your need for cheap. You have a week to get things fixed so 
you still have enough time to find a real mechanic with real skills to 
really fix the bus, but don't expect that means it will be real cheap. In 
reality, if safety and reliability are needed, by far the cheapest way to 
get there and back is to do it right, regardless the cost to do so.
