The steps from my own experience going from Canada to the US are:

- import
- police check VIN (jurisdictional)
- safety check
- emissions check (jurisdictional)
- registration (possible transfer of title)
- license/insurance

Start here:

Then go here:

I would call the given phone numbers to get the particulars before you get
too involved and end up buying something you can't legally import.
