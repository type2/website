Subject: Re: [T2] Problem Solved! Rebuilt Engine Troubles + WV

You guys are great - within just a couple of hours a list member Emailed me
with what proved to be the solution.  So simple - the plug wires were hooked
to the distributor wrong.  All the stuff I checked and changed to try to get
it to work right, and yet it was that easy!  I drove it for about 40 minutes
and after some initial scare with a lot of smoke coming off a "very" hot
engine when I stopped for gas, the bus was fine.  Now all I need is a decent
exhaust and I am all set.  Thanks Andrew!  GW
