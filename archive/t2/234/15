Subject: Re: Camping AC set up.

Why bother putting it up there? Stand it outside, isolate the output
(take off the AC grill) and feed it into the bus through a vent window! 
Quieter too.  Provide an outlet fof the pressure by opening a poptop
window a bit.  Of course you may have to chain it to the bus (+

 5000 BTU unit on the luggage rack, with a piece of 3" foam under it to

 Now I take a 8" flexible duct ( much like dryer duct only bigger) and
 attach it to a piece of masonite, or 1/16th plywood and attach it to
the
 output side other AC unit-----
 Now I run it to the screen / window of the upper bunk, with another
 piece of masonite, or plywood, with the correct circumference hole.
 I just lay the plywood up against the inside of the pop top--and crank
 the AC unit on----n8-
