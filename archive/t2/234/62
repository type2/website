No, It's a non-hardening sealer used for gaskets and case halves.  VW de
Mexico uses it on the brand new engines.

Look at the Permatex rack at your FLAPS.  It comes in a small tube.  It is
a blue color stuff slightly less viscous than common RTV silicone.  It
never hardens, but it seals the gasket to the cover very well.  It does
not dissolve in hot oil, so it won't go away like grease.

When you do the cover the next time, all you do is wipe the old Hylomar
off.  You don't have to scrape the cover like you do when you use gasket
glue.
