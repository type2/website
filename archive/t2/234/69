Netflix: The Perfect Movie Every Time!Hi all.  We have our engine wired =
up to where it will run.  It is acting very strange.  I would sure =
appreciate any comments on this.  It runs great when sitting still now =
that I have installed a new carb.  Idles great, revs up great, no smoke. =
 The trouble is that the thing when moving has no power at all.  On the =
level, it will go up to 45 or 50 but hit a hill and you will be lucky to =
get up it going 15.  It does not do anything too odd, though.  Just sems =
very weak.  Thus far I have replaced plugs, dist., wires, coil, carb, =
rubbed all kinds of RTV over the intake to seal it if if it could be =
leaking, checked throttle cable, checked the timing 5 times, wired the =
coil right to the battery with a big thick wire to make sure, checked =
the choke, etc.  Is there something they could have done when rebuilding =
it that would make it run great but act this way?  Thanks for any =
information.  Is there anybody on the list in WV I could pay to come =
here to Clarksburg and look at it?  Can't drive it anywhere.  Glen Ward
