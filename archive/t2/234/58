Subject: 1970 engine operating parameters

Drove NewBus around a bit today out West of Houston for a country road trip 
of 200 miles.
1970 Westy - 1600SP - all stock

Cylinder Head Temperature not hooked up so no readings for that parameter
Tach not arrived yet for installation

Ran in the 55-60 mph range with some slight hills, but mostly flat land
Temperature outside was 85-90 degrees F - very high humidity
Oil Pressure reads right around 38-40 PSI, with a lowest value of around 20 
PSI at idle
Oil Temp reads just under the 180 degree mark - Idled for a long test 
period using a higher than normal idle speed so as to make the temp climb 
to a highest obtainable reading number of 190 F.

Don't know how accurate the VDO gauges and senders are, but those are the 
numbers.

Have a good weekend

Bob
