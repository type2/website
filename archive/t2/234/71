Sounds like it could be the distributor is not advancing. Check total 
advance at 3000 rpm. I've seen similar problems with Champion plugs. Make 
the whole ignition system all Bosch to rule out any possible problems there.

Sometimes a motor gets assembled with the wrong shims/deck height and you 
could be running at 6.5 to 1. Rule this out with a simple compression 
balance test.
