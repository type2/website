Stock compression for a stock build using 92 octane gas. Drop the ratio a 
bit for regular 88 octane. Best bet always is to set deck height stock with 
stock cam/heads/pistons/fuel system. Change anything and risk problems 
unless the whole setup comes from a vendor who has thoroughly tested the 
set up and will warranty the results.
