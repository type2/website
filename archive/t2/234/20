Subject: Re: [T2] Sliding door step. 

Sorry, I am having a "senior's moment" right here.

Are you asking about a sliding door_step? (which ONLY fits on the 
passenger's side, and the door step actually slides out when the big door is 
opened, and slides back when the big door is closed, like the Lincoln 
Navigator, but not electronic, but mechanical)

Ron Salmon has/had them for about $600

One other type is running on EBay.  Last time up it did not get the reserved 
price, and it was advertised again.

Are you asking about a sliding_door step? (which fits boths sides of the bay 
window bus).

See previous posts for these stationary side steps .
