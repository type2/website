Frank,

Check the sealing surface on the head.  Use wet/dry 200-400
grit sandpaper.  Makes sure it is shiny clean!

Had the same problem on mine that the stupid po tried to fix with 
rtv...really bad bad bad idea.  Surface on the head didn't "look" bad 
untill you ran your finger around on it...then I found that it was covered
in old "glued" on small pieces of gasket.


The usual on the rest...covers absolutely spotless and bails on correctly.

Cheers ,dave
