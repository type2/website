Subject: Re: [T2] Leaky Valve Covers

In my experience with the type 1V engine, the bulky heater box
interferes with VC removal-replacement. The cover tends to ride up if
you use a pry tool to pull up the bail, so 1. grease the bail path 2.
Insert a piece of wood about 6-8" long (I use 3/4" thick ground down to
a taper along the edge) at the top as you pry- helps to keep it
centered. Usually the head is hard to move after bail is placed.
