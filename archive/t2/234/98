Subject: New bulb chart in Library

All,

There is a new bulb chart in the Type2 Library at 
http://www.type2.com/library/electris/bulbs.html .  Eric&Barb and
Bill Bowman provided copies of the dealer accessory catalog pages
with these bulb charts.  I transcribed them into HTML and added
the ANSI and Normteile info.

I hope this helps!  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Matt Roberds
