Subject: Westy shelf cut-out

After years of owning my camper I just noticed this modification while I was
examining the plumbing and wiring of the sink and pump (removing my water
tank on the weekend).

This is the middle shelf under the sink in my camper.

I can't figure out why it was cut and then re-attached this way:
