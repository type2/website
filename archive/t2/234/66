Subject: squarebacks

I know that this is out of the subject for this list but it is Friday so 
here goes. Let me get everyones opionion on Squarebacks. I am seriously 
considering buying one. What about Parts? are they easy to find? Cheap? What 
types of engines will fit?? What are the main differences between them and a 
Bug or Bus? What year would be best if there are any better years? Any 
feedback at all would be appriciated. Thanks
