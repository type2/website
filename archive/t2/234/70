Subject: PS- [T2] Rebult Engine Troubles + WV

Not sure where the Netflix ad on my other message came from...Hi all.  We
have our engine wired up to where it will run.  It is acting very strange.
I would sure appreciate any comments on this.  It runs great when sitting
still now that I have installed a new carb.  Idles great, revs up great, no
smoke.  The trouble is that the thing when moving has no power at all.  On
the level, it will go up to 45 or 50 but hit a hill and you will be lucky to
get up it going 15.  It does not do anything too odd, though.  Just sems
very weak.  Thus far I have replaced plugs, dist., wires, coil, carb, rubbed
all kinds of RTV over the intake to seal it if if it could be leaking,
checked throttle cable, checked the timing 5 times, wired the coil right to
the battery with a big thick wire to make sure, checked the choke, etc.  Is
there something they could have done when rebuilding it that would make it
run great but act this way?  Thanks for any information.  Is there anybody
on the list in WV I could pay to come here to Clarksburg and look at it?
Can't drive it anywhere.  Glen Ward
