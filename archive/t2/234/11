By the time you getdone rigging up this off the wall inetrior cooling
system, you could have bought a nice nostalgic Swamp cooler out of E-Bay
at a quarter of the price and aggravation.

Plug in and go---simple, and a  done deal--

case fans (or DC car fans of some sort) either right on the radiator, or
at one end of a custom housing to force the air through the radiator.
Run vinyl or silicone tubing from the radiator through holes in the lid
(sealed around edges with expanda-foam), one for intake, one for return.
buy a cheap aquarium or marine bilge pump that runs on 12V DC and use
that to circulate the cold water through the radiator. >> 
That DC cooling plate is gonna heat the bus (ask Maxwell's Imp ;-) I
tend to think that there just isn't enough mass in the ice to cool much.
Try an experiment...Fill the cooler with ice and put it in a closed bus
with a thermostat hanging from something. Leave the cooler open and see
if the temperature of the interior goes down by much...
