Anyone with a younger air cooled bus won't be as lucky as those with 77 or
older vehicles unless they are willing to wait or go through the hassle.
Four years ago, the thought of waiting until my bus was age 25 was
depressing.

When Importing to the US, 25 years old is indeed the magic number.
Importing to Canada seems to have the conditions reversed and also is
stricter: any vehicle 15 years and older isn't necessarily barred from entry
but they still require the scrutiny of an inspection and compliance and
there is a lot more paperwork than importing to the US.

Just taking a brief look at the Canadian Import requirements and considering
bays, there is going to be a problem for most owners converting the
speedo/odo to read km because a lot of speedos only read in mph. If you are
lucky you can change the speedo yourself and when you get inspected it was
simply be made note of that it now complies.

Another interesting point is the requirement of a "valid alpha-numeric
17-digit VIN". No bay window bus is going to pass this one.

It's all these little details that make the process difficult.  It's not
impossible, just a pain to deal with.
