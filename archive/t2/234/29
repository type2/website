Or , if you can find a level stretch of interestate where you believe 
the mile markers are correct.....

Get the number of seconds it take you to do a marked mile.

divide 3600 by the number of seconds....gets average speed in the mile.

Warning!  Not all states have their mile markers set correctly!

Do it over several miles and then average.

Cheers ,dave
