No, that is the sender for the "clean the filter" warning light.
You MUST get this hooked up.  As the filter collects crap,
the pressure builds on the "in" side--which bends up, and will
eventually ruin the filter screen--while the pressure drops on
the "out" side--less oil gets to where it's needed.  Eventually,
none gets there.  Obergs DO NOT have a high pressure bypass.......

To calibrate, loosen retaining nut, tighten screw until light just goes on,
then back off a half turn.  Tighten retaining nut.
