Subject: Re: [T2] 70 speedo adjustment?

Hey list
For the couragous do this........

Find out how much you speedo is out.  Have a friend in
a new vehicle drive beside you at 30, 50, etc etc.

Find a good factor to adjust your rate of speed. (mine
was 1.2 since my PO had a bad accident with my 78
westy)

Remove the speedo from the front panel (I wont go into
details here, you all probably know more about taking
it apart than I do)

Remove the bottom of the speedo cable from the egr gear
box.

Put the cable end into a drill and pull it on full. 
With my Delta it went about 60 mile per hour.  In my
case I needed it to read 72 mph.

Open the back of the speedo and see where the coil
spring is mounted through the cast iron fork (clamp). 
Dont unlamp it; use needle nose pliers pull more spring
through the clamp, or push a bit back.

Im trying to remember but I think I tightened the
spring a bit since my factor was greater than 1.0

Then reassemble the speedo,  and retest using the full
position on the drill.

This did the trick for me.  FYI my factor was good at
low (less than 60 mph) speeds. But the speedo is still
out a bit above 60 mph, but right on less than that.

Once you get it close enough reassemble it up.....

By the way I had too small tires on mine (8%) and
putting CR21's on MADE NO DIFFERENCE, hence the speedo
change.  Go figure.
