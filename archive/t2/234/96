Hi Tom,

    Sounds like a fuel delivery problem to me. Check the filter first, look
for, rust or trash in the old filter, you may need to clean the tank if its
been sitting a while.
    Good luck!

It is still fuel injected, correct?
Check the large hoses going to the big S hose. Especially the one going to
the
breather box. If any of them have slipped off, this will cause your problem.
As the engine moves under torque, the gap gets wider. At idle, the engine
does
not move.Get more from the Web.  FREE MSN Explorer download :
