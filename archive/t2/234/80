G'Day:

One of mine did this.  I found it was not setting properly because the sides
that the gasket fit up against were angled in too much and not fitting over
the cylinder head.  By using pliers I was able to bend the side out a little
all the way around the cover just enough for it to fit over the head.  No
more leak!!!

Hooroo,

Ian
