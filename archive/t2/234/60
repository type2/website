Subject: Re: adj hydr. lifters (was leaky VC's)

Drive it to make sure lifters are pumped- not critical if you have a good
feel and loose adjustor bolt threads. Yank distr. cap and turn engine  with
7/8 wrench on alternator nut until rotor points to #1 plug wire and TDC mark
on crank pulley is at TDC on scale.  Turn engine 1/2 turn counterclockwise
to get to # 2, etc. No mark 1/2 way?  Make your own, starting with TDC mark
on pully (not the timing mark) and measure with a nonstretchable tape to 1/2
way (guess close).  Flip tape to opposite direction, make same mark.  1/2way
is centered between marks.
Anyway, yank valve cover (if it's stuck, whack the SIDES with a rubber
sledge/mallet, then pry.    Loosen both adjustor nuts (six sided wrench if
you can find it- ok to loosen with six sided socket, but you need the wrench
to tighten and verify slotted bolt isn't turning as you tighten nut).  Back
out the bolt by hand a(may be 2 turns or so) and turn in again, feeling when
it JUST hits the valve end.  Depending on whose dogma you follow (Boston Bob
or Bentley) turn the screw in a complete turn or two more- what you are
doing is centering the eventual lifter piston position BETWEEN the limits of
its travel, to allow for changes in engine dimensions or valve clearance.
Memorize the slot position and put a wrench on the nut to tighten the
adjustment; you may have to hold a large screwdriver in the slot to keep
bolt from turning- this is more critical on non-hydraulics.  MB  "The Turtle

for my upcoming valve adjustment (hyd. lifters) -comments on hyd lifter
valve adjustments? my first one. don't laugh.
