  Hello All,
    After spending last night on the river camping, I needed to run into =
work this morning for a while. I couldn't see taking a personal day when =
the kids are not even here yet.=20
     When I got up this morning we has 7 buses not including the awesome =
SS FARFRUMFLOTIN.  Everyone seems pumped up for a great weekend.  So if =
you are on the bubble, pack up and come on out.  By the way Ric, you can =
solve your problem by bringing an extra bus for the girls.
