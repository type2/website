Subject: O'Berg Filter

I want to change my oil in this engine, what do I clean the O'berg filter
with?  Is it cleanable?

 I have a (don't know what it's called) the extra oil reservoir...do I take
the traditional screen out as well and clean it, or heck is that screen
still there with the extra oil thingy.

I love this bus stuff, new bus, new engine, new learning experiences!!
