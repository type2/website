Subject: Re: [T2] Leaky Valve Covers


I find sometimes what looks like a lot of oil on the driveway in fact is a
very slow leak that you can drive with for months.  Nonetheless, I recently
tested out Sean Bartnik's technique of adding the bearing grease (in
reference to the library).  I found it worked very well, although strangely
enough it dripped a bit for a few days and sealed up well soon afterwards.

Most people i meet swear not to use the gasket sealer.  I tend to believe
this as i've found chunks fall inside after use and also it's a pain to
clean.  you're better to really make sure it's very very clean.  this means
getting steel wool, perhaps a razor blade and/or sandpaper.  Then add some
solvent like gasoline and clean up the inside.  Add your grease and you
should be good.

Good Luck,
Shawn
