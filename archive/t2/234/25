Buy one of those standup a/c systems that simply have an exhaust hose. Put 
the exhaust through a dryer vent through a window. The a/c unit would fit 
in the bus with you between the front seats.

I suspect you could find one that would fit in the upright spare tire 
cabinet behind the driver's seat in that late Westies.

These type of a/c units were popular in Italy when I lived there but I have 
seen them here in the USA too.
