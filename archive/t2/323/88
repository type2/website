Subject: Subwoofer between the front seats

I made what I feel to be a decent subwoofer box that goes 
between the front seats.  It holds (just barely) a 12" sub, but 
only used that because I had it lying around.  If I had it 
to do over, I would use a 10" or possibly even 8".  The cabinet is built 
out of laminated particle board shelves that you can get at Home Depot.  
The sub fires straight down, although with a smaller sub a more optimal 
rear-firing arrangement could have been done.  I wanted it to be completely 
hidden though, and not look like a piece of audio equipment so I 
sacrificed a little sound quality.  The top of the cabinet is recessed 
about 2" and I have a small "console" sitting on there with cupholders, 
coin slots and cassette rack.  There is also room for a box of kleenex 
and my travel log.  It is low enough that we can step over it to get 
to the rear of the van without too much trouble.  I have a 300 watt amp 
(shipped by mistake, they let me keep it!) driving it and I can 
drown out ANY amount of road noise.  Planes overhead?  Doesn't matter.  
Diesel truck beside me?  Can't hear it.  :) 

It only took a couple of hours and some common tools to build it.  Drill, 
jigsaw, drywall screws, glue gun, and an insert with pushbutton wire hookups.  
Not the fanciest nor the best, but entirely adequate for my needs.  I can 
remove it from the bus in less than a minute and thieves don't give it a 
second glance.

Here are some pictures I just snapped:
