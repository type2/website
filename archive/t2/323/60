Subject: Re: [T2] service intervals

What the manual states isn't really true for our 30 year old busses.  I like
to grease the CV's every summer before the camping/traveling season and the
wheel bearings both front and rear everyother year.

With the bearings getting old, they seem to need grease more often.  I have
greased rear wheel bearings with only 15,000 between packing and have
noticed the grease was really getting bad.

I'd rather over grease than under grease, I've heard too many "beside the
road" stories when it comes to wheel bearings and CV's.
