Hi Bob,

I put an intermittent wiper kit into my (long-departed) 72 westy back 
in 1986.

It was a PITA working behind the dash, but I got them installed in an 
hour or two. The only fussy part is sorting out the "park" circuit to 
put the wipers back where they belong. Newer systems *should* be easier 
to sort out. YMMV.

Happy trails,
