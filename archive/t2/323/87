Subject: Re: [T2] pulling crank gear

I've rebuilt a couple of Vanagon engines, and I don't have a gear puller.
The crankshaft timing gear can be removed by heating it with a propane
torch - go 'round and 'round the gear with the torch to get even heat
distribution - and, using a pair of heavy gloves, pull the gear off by hand.
