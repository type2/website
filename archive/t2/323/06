Subject: Fuel cut off

Just offering some advice.
I have installed a solenoid cut off in the fuel line straight after the tank
outlet on my bus ('77 2L type 4 dual carb) as well as a fuel pressure gauge.
What I have noticed when running the pressure is ~3.5psi, but when I turn it
off the pressure has risen to as high as 12psi. (it takes ~3 to 5min. to
drop down to zero)
I'm assuming when turned off, the heat from the motor heats the fuel in the
line which is locked between the solenoid and the carb needle valve causing
the high pressure. What this now does is make it MUCH more likely to push a
hose off, or burst an old line. So just beware. I'm now wondering how to
relive this pressure!!
