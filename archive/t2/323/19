Karl, the first site in your note says

... "If you  inspect the base of the master cylinder, you will notice that 
there is a groove in the base just below the round bore.
This slot acts as a drain when the master begins to leak, hopefully keeping 
the fluid from entering the booster."

and you confirm the explanation below...

I guess this answers the question, Why is it there...

It seems like such a reasonable answer that the next questions is,   "Why 
did they NOT put the weep hole there in later MB  Cylinders???"
