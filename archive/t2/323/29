As I found out from a snotty guy at Jerome a few years ago, ALL factory high top busses have metal roofs.  The fiberglass ones were all added on by aftermarket companies.  The model I saw was a 72 "ambulance" and had partitions behind the front seats that extended all the way to the ceiling (creating a walkthrough "doorway") and a metal (euro) dashboard.

This gent became very indignant when I told him I also had a high top bus.  "No you don't, what you have is a CAMPER".  Ooo-kay, whatever...
