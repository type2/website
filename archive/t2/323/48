In Italy we called these fees Road Taxes. They were supposed to encourage 
smaller cars and trucks.

Just remember that this will not necessarily increase your gas mileage and 
may restrict how fast your van goes on the highway (thus making you 
dangerous).

Also you may end up with a bus that is geared too high for the engine (in 
other words were the Type I powered busses geared lower?).

A roommate had a 1200cc Beetle with the 3.88 gearbox. It was a US spec 
Beetle with a tiny Euro spec 1.2 liter engine which was common in Italy.

Nice, nice cruiser at 65 mph if there wasn't any wind or any hills to go 
up. Low rpms, hot engine and no power.

FWIW.
