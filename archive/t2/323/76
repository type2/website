I could be wrong but my understanding is that the VW that came from the factory as high tops had fiberglass roofs after about 11/67(1968 model year). 

Looking at those pics, I have to agree with you.  In addition I have seen many tops that look like the ones in those pictures over in Germany, on commercial and military vehicles, including Vanagons.  Most were painted body color and I thought they were metal, but after viewing those pictures I bet they were fiberglass.

p.s. My bus turned over the odometer yesterday - 200,000 miles!  Or possibly 300,000 - it had 67,000 miles on it when I bought it in 1988 and it was already 15 years old.  Could have been 167,000 but I will probably never know.
