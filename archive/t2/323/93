Interesting theory, but I'm not sure if the braid has that much effect with
thick walled hose.  Hoses tend to stick after a while anyway, so that you
need to give them a twist before pulling them off (you can feel it 'give'
when you turn it).

I think the main reason not to use clamps is because it's just not necessary
if the hose is not under pressure (or is under vacuum).

Just my two small units of currency worth.
