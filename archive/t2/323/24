Subject: Piston rings and Gasket kit

Dear List,
       I need some help (info )  I need a set of Piston rings and a gasket 
kit for my 1969 1600 motor in my SC.  Here is the problem....

FLAPS =$24.69..........$22.99 respectively
GEX    = $80.00..........$12.00........ But the rings are "total seal "
Rocky = $21.00..........$7.00

I an looking for Good parts not just cheap ones

Flaps are made by Field-Poller and Bakaley (sp?)
GEX ....................      ?          and      ?
Rocky..................     junk       and      junk

Are any of the above OK ? Or should i try to find German.   Where can I get 
German parts        ?    Also can i use the push rod tube seals from the kit 
or should I go for Viton ?
Thanks
Paul
