Well, common sense would dictate that you would be correct.  However, there
is an additional,friction based mechanism in the retracting reel that causes
it to lock based on the speed with which the belt is pulled from the
retractor.  So, even without the inertia devices installed, the belts lock
when they're supposed to.  I test them very time I get in the car, by giving
them a sharp tug after putting them on.  So far they have NEVER failed to
lock when tested that way.  If that were not the case, these belts would get
a big thumbs down from me and I would have installed something else long
ago.

Having said all that, I would feel much more comfortable if I could
re-install the inertia devices, but there was no way I could get the belt to
pay out of the retractor when it was supposed to, with them installed.  I'm
still looking for a solution, and if I find one, I will put those things
back in promptly.

Aren't the "ball bearing doohickeys" the inertia sensors that lock the
reel?  If you take them out, the reels will indeed run in and out but they
won't lock after an accident!

The inertia reels have to be mounted upright to allow the "ball bearing
doohicky" to disengage so the belt will roll out and in.
