It only takes a small amount of fine powered rust to suffocate the filter.

Based on my own experience, the rubber fuel lines will likely be lined with
rust much in the same way brake lines get coated with dark colored brake
fluid. This rust will continue to flake off and continue to come down from
the tank but eventually enough gets washed out and fuel filter change
intervals go from tens of miles to hundreds to thousands.  The Bosch filter
is pretty fine so expect this to take a while unless you can do some
flushing of the system.

On the topic, I picked up some 10mm fuel lines from the MB dealer thanks to
Karl's part number help.  Be sure to ask them if they have 1/10th meter
price if they aren't handing out small 4" pieces for free.

I would hazard a guess that the pulsing of the fuel pressure would be more
than the ECU could compensate for and as you say, lack of power.  Remember,
pressure quickly builds in the fuel rail and the pressure regulator adjusts
the pressure in time with the engine vacuum. If you get a blockage at the
filter or pump, the fuel pressure can't increase as quickly to match a drop
in vacuum.

No sludge is great news but did you look at the underside of the top of the
tank?  That's where is goes rusty.

The baffle has a hole in the side about an inch up but I thought it also had
a large gap at the bottom. Wish I had a picture...

Awesome.
