That is correct.

This last bit is not exactly right. The computer wants to have the 
pressure gradient between the fuel and air to be constant at the 
injector tip. This way the computer always knows how much fuel it is 
delivering for a particular pulse width, and doesn't have to worry about 
what the pressure is in order to adjust the pulse width. If fuel 
pressure did not vary, when vacuum was high the injector would deliver 
more fuel per unit time than when the vacuum was low, and the computer 
would have to make the pulse width shorter to compensate. Because 
injectors have a minimum opening time, and the computer has a minimum 
amount of time it can send the signal to open for, it is more desirable 
to keep the pulse times longer. Thus when vacuum is high, the regulator 
lowers the fuel pressure, since there is less pressure at the tip of the 
injector to overcome. The pressure regulator is really trying to 
simplify things for the computer, and allow the computer to keep pulse 
times long enough that it can control the injectors properly.

Note that thinking in terms of vacuum is rather confusing, because 
vacuum increases as load decreases. It is much more natural to think in 
terms Manifold Air Pressure, which works the other way around. MAP is 
the intake manifold pressure which is positive in comparison to zero 
absolute pressure, rather than negative compared to atmospheric, This 
also makes more sense when you are talking about boost. If you want to 
talk boost in terms of vacume you have to talk about negative vacume, 
and well, english doesn't like double negatives. :) Thus in terms of 
MAP, when MAP goes down, the fuel pressure has to go down to keep the 
difference between the two constant. This is much easier to visualize 
than the inverse relationship that thinking in terms of vacume requires.

Correct. As per above, the pressure varies not with rpm, but with vacume 
which tends to vary with rpm. The goal is a constant gradient between 
fuel and air at the injector tip.

Muir said it, but he was just being xenophobic. There is no more danger 
in jump starting a FI bus than any other bus, unless you connect things 
wrong while attempting it and end up frying your battery, and then it is 
just as dangerous. ;)

Probst agrees with this with 1L / 30 seconds or more of fuel delivered. 
I would be suprised if it was really your problem though. Check the 
injector spray patterns to verify that they are operating properly.

I highly recommend the Probst book "How to Understand, Service and 
Modify Bosch Fuel Injection & Engine Management", though the modify part 
pretty much says don't bother, because you can't make it work any better 
than Bosch did.
