Subject: To Westfakia or not to Westfakia?

Hi Everyone,
I've run myself into quite the delma and thought that some of you might be 
able to help being in simalar situation.  Here's what I have one vanagon 
westy 1980 rebuilt top end lots of money spent on parts but needs some work.  
Alittle rust around each window not cancer because I've poked it with a screw 
driver some surface rust on drivers floor from a leaky clutch master  body 
needs a resto but lots of great mecanical parts that can be taken off. Now I 
just bought a pass van that the body is perfect with no rust fresh paint and 
ton's of new parts including a fully rebuilt motor avp with 8k but a bad 
tranny and perfect intior.  Trying to deside if I should just swap all the 
good stuff off the westy and make a westfakia  least money spent and have 
ton's of spare parts or fix the pass van sell it to finsh the resto on the 
westy which will still have a good out of pocket expense and probaly more 
time spent.  Is it bad to part the good running restorable westy to make 
another great vechilce? Any advice would be great.  
Thanks
Kevin
