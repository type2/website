Subject: Wiring Harness?

I am in the process of trying to bring my 72 westy back to a somewhat 
original state. One of the previous 3, 4, 5... owners decided the original 
wiring in the engine compartment needed to be eliminated or extended, since 
VW probably didn't know what they were doing.

So my question is. Is the wiring harness that comes from the front on either 
side of the engine continuous or is segmented? Do I have to replace the 
whole wiring harness or only a portion of it?



Thanks, Phil.

72 Non-Pop Top Westy
