Hello List, please make all inquiries "Off list"

    I have a Snap-on YA 219 A MIG (M etal I nert G as) wire feed welder for
sale. I am told it is made by Miller, and sold by Snap-on. I do not know
this for sure.
    It is very well taken care of, and in 100 % working order. Complete
outfit ready to weld steel, or aluminum. This a perfect machine for body
work, comes complete with everything needed to start welding, except an
ARGON bottle. This is either rented or purchased from your local welding
supply house. Machine will weld in the following modes, SPOT-WELD,
STITCH-WELD, CONTINUOUS-WELD. All modes are fully adjustable. Please note:
The low pressure gauge for the pressure regulator is broken. I have a new
one on order, if it does not arrive before sale, I will either ship it to
buyer, or discount price $25.00.
