I'd seriously go look at Bus Depot's website or call them. I've had great 
service from them.

I know, I know the list goes round and round on Bus Depot's service and 
quality but where else can you talk to the owner of the business if things 
go afoul?

There is also www.aircooled.net , and a few others on the list. I would 
seriously try to do business with someone on the list.

FWIW.
