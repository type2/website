Subject: Westfalia

After years of owning a passenger bus I just picked up my first Westfalia
yesterday and everything is great so far.  It's a 77.  I've already combed
through all the technical articles on the site.  I was wondering if anyone
knows of any documentation as far a manuals and instruction books that are out
there for these things.  I'm especially interested in the AC system,
refrigerator (mine is a dometic) and the auxiliary power system.  Also, how
can you tell if the fridge runs on propane or not.  I have gotten it to turn
on with battery power but I don't know if it even is the propane model.  I
think I have most things on the bus figured out but I would love to hear some
advice from those who have dealt with all of these things before.  Also this
is my first time back on the list in many months so hello again to everyone
out there!!
