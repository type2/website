Subject: great door speaker location!!!

Just a little tip if your trying to find a decent spot to mount your front 
speakers...

The PO had them in the obious spot WAY down near the bottom of the door, but 
it sounded like crap and you had to turn them way up just to hear.

Well, I just picked up a pair of MB Quart's (german made!) and when I pulled 
the door panel off, I realized there is JUST enough room higher up on the 
door panel, inbetween the roll down glass and the roller mechanism. When you 
pull the panel off, there is a VW logo stamped into the back of it. If you 
center your speaker hole around this logo, it's the perfect spot to stick 
your speakers.

These are 6.5's and the magnet, while fairly deep, fits right in that little 
space, no problem. The sound quality is 30% better at least. It helps that I 
finally upgraded to better speakers, sure, but having them this much closer 
to ear level made a world of difference. I put the tweets surface mounted up 
just a bit higher, where this little channel runs up towards the small 
window in the door, so the screws holding them in place had someplace to 
hide.

Right now I am just running them off of deck power, but i'll change that 
soon enough. =)
