Subject: headliner light - poptop mold ?'s

Hola,

two questions for those wiser than I (perhaps not as big of a wise-ass 
though, per my father)

1. The westfalia wooden headliner - that light in the roof, is it ok to 
touch the factory insulation, or should the insulation be spread apart so 
its not touching the light at all? That little bulb gets plenty hot (ask my 
finger how I know), and im nervous that it would start that stuff on fire?

I replaced mine, and I want to say it was touching before, but I dont 
remember now.

2. The inside of my poptop roof is moldy. Can I get the mold off with any 
sort of cleaner, or am I looking at needing to sand that crap off of there? 
I can see that becoming a nasty job, but it looks gross as is.
Sure, I could just cover it up with something else (tapastry, whathaveyou) - 
but id rather not.
