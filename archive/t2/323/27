Subject: Electronic flasher box

Has anyone installed an electronic flasher box (relay?) into their bus?  I would like to swap out the mechanical one for an electronic version but the electronic ones only have two connectors whereas my factory bus box has (IIRC) four terminals.  Is this just because there are separate circuits for right and left?

Thanks,

-David
