This means something is wrong. It could be just out of adjustment or it may 
need several hundred dollars of parts to correct.

That's a good idea. Be sure he does a compression test and looks over the 
whole cooling system for possible problems. Wrong coolant??? Any coorosion 
on the head seals/water pump or any of the hose fittings??? Have $4000+ 
ready for a new motor.

If they gave it to you for nothing, it still might not be a bargain. Add 
$2000 for a clutch and tranny to that motor and see what I mean?? How about 
$600 for CV's?? Check the brake fluid reservoir. Black and ugly?? Add 
another $600

Valve noise could be 1)wrong weight oil, 2) non-stock oil filter, 3) bad 
lifters, 4)rockers not properly adjusted.
