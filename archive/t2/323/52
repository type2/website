Subject: Electrical circuitry help needed.........

Anyone have  a link that tells what the various vw electrical circuit
numbers are for?

I mean things on electrical pieces like

85
86
30/51
85

I am trying to diagnose some wiring to a relay that was disconnected on my
412 and want to do it right.
