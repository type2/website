Subject: petrol smell in cab

I'm getting a really bad small of petrol in the van, especially when the van 
is over 1/2 full and i'm on winding roads. It's been like this since I got 
the van and I really need to sort it out.

Can anyone offer any suggestions as to where to start? I understand you have 
to pull the engine to replace the fuel tank.....is the only answer to my 
problems? Is there any other way of patching it if I find where the damage 
is?

Thanks,

Sam.
