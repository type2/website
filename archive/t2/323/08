Subject: Purchase decision?

This week my wife took an interest in an '85 Vanagon for sale down the
street so we went to take a look at it today.  I realize there is a
Vanagon list but I'm sure there are at least a couple of you on this
list that can help me decide whether or not to jump into this purchase
having never owned a water cooled VW (or even a Type 4 engine).

Here's what we have - a currently registered California (no rust) 7
passenger Vanagon that is pretty clean, inside and out, for $1300.  It
is generally drivable with good brakes and decent tires.  Performance
seems good but there's 2 things I just don't know about.  The valves on
both sides are very loud to my ear and the idle has a strange cycle
where it speeds up and slows down about every 5 seconds or so.  Since
I'm in California I've reminded the owner that she is responsible for
smogging the vehicle and I've agreed to pay for an inspection by a local
VW mechanic to determine what the issues are.  I'm wondering, is this
vehicle, given its overall condition, worth the price in spite of what
might be found. And, what are the possible causes and solutions of the
valve noise and idle fluctuations.
