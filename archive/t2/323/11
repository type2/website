I have been searching the net for a description of why that hole is supposed to be there....but alas, I have
stuck out.

Yes, the hole is supposed to be there. It is the drain hole for when the rear plunger [secondary cup] seal
leaks. It appeared when power brakes came along. Because of the vacuum on the end of the master when it is
mounted on the booster, they had to add a rear seal. This keeps the vacuum from sucking the fluid out of the
master. When the secondary cup seal leaks, it is supposed to drain out the weep hole. The rear seal is
supposed to keep the fluid from draining into the booster.
I did find this website about a guy changing his Toyota master cylinder and he talks about the drain hole:

This site talks about the master cyl. leaking onto the booster, but not why...:
