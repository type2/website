Subject: Braided lines

Hey, volks..  This is just a little bit of trivia, but maybe some of you will
find interesting. We were just out, working on the 78 and replacing the fuel
guage sending unit and all fill hoses, vapor hoses, etc. (The engine is out
anyway, and this is a good chance to do all this stuff before we put the
engine back in). The vapor hoses are not clamped, and I thought that rather
odd. I'm used to clamped hoses. One of these lines we cut the hose too short,
a patch between the steel line and the yellow plastic line for the vapor
pressure equalization system. So, I went to replace that little piece of hose
with a longer one, and when I tried to pull it off, even though it went on
easy, I had to really work to get it off! Then it occurred to me, the answer
to a long-wondered mystery.."Why do some VW hoses have a braided covering?"..
Here it is. When you, or something else,
applies a pull to that hose, the braided covering locks it down, just like one
of those old "Chinese finger trap" puzzles. How about that? The hoses push on
easy, but resist being pulled off! Simple, and ingenious!
