Charles,

The vw crank gear puller you often see will not work. It will only work on a
type 1 crank gear.

The cam gears are really on there tight, and with the steel of both the
crank and the gear being so hard, they can be difficult to remove. You need
a very substantial puller to get it off, I really doubt a sears 3-jaw deal
will work, mostly because the jaw ends don't have enough of a projection to
get into the small space below the gear. Even if you have a good puller, you
might try putting the whole assembly in the freezer for a spell and then
carefully torch heating only the gear. The type of gear pullers that have
straight arms that slide across the top bar will work. Kukko is one brand,
hazet also make them.  They are not cheap...

The brass gear is normally a press fit, you are correct.
