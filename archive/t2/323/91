Subject: [T2]  so long and thanks 

Hi Volks,
     I have been on the type 2 and vanagon lists since 
about 96. Today I sadly watched my 78 westy  leave 
for the last time as it was sold and is heading for a new 
home near Seattle. 
    Many thanks to all who have helped me in time of need 
 with knowledge, parts and support.  The list has been of 
great  value to me and my bus. 
    I plan to hang out on the eurovan list now as we 
get onboard with our 97 evc. 

Thanks again to all
