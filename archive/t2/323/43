Subject: Re: [T2] RE: BeetleMex retractable seat belts

George, I got 2 rear seat belts from a Jetta. I had to remove the ball
bearing doohickeys because I couldn't pull the belts out at all with them in
place, they were jammed solid. With them gone, the belts work great. They
roll smoothly in and out, but if you pull them quickly, they lock right up.
I can only conclude that there must be 2 systems involved, motion
sensor(ball bearing) and speed of rotation sensor, which is still in place.
I was very cautious about removing part of the mechanism, but the belts
still work. I really hated the stock setup!

Aren't the "ball bearing doohickeys" the inertia sensors that lock the
reel?  If you take them out, the reels will indeed run in and out but they
won't lock after an accident!

The inertia reels have to be mounted upright to allow the "ball bearing
doohicky" to disengage so the belt will roll out and in.
