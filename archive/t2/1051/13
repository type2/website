Subject: Creaking side door

Can anyone lead me in a direction on how to cure a creaking sliding
door.

Usually it happens at slow speeds on bumps and uneven pavement.

Thanks,

Alan

P.S. The roller seems low and does not fill the channel.

The paint guy may have installed it wrong.

How do you shift it all up?
