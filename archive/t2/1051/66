Subject: Friday Post: North East US Bus sought

Hi,

Happy Friday kind bus folk.

I'm in the market for a bus in the North East US. My '71 was recently
mashed up a bit in a rear-end collision (I was rear-ended). I'm
looking for a suitable replacement vehicle, a bay window campmobile
68-79 though preferably a '71 or a late model with 2.0 and FI.

I've got the well used and damaged '71 in my garage - I'm waiting
until I procure a new bus before I start hacking my old love to pieces
- but if anyone on this part of the globe needs parts, let me know.

peace
jules
'71 1600 dp westy (awaiting final dis-assembly in the garage)
'??  ????????? (help me fill in the blanks)
Troy, NY
