Group.  I'm making a gag gift for a friend who's turning sixty - I want to
make him a walking stick with a Porsche gear shift knob as the handle. so, I
need an old Porsche shift knob.  If anyone out there has one laying around
in their parts pile (the more beat up the better) and is willing to part
with it - please email me directly.
TIA,
Wayne
