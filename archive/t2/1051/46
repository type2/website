Subject: Re: [T2] Open dashboard space

There was a clock option, but they are rare.  I searched in the 
junkyards for years and years before I finally found one.  These days 
your best bet is probably to look on that auction site or thesamba.com, 
but expect to pay close to $100, especially for the later, black-faced 
model which has a superior mechanism (IMO).
