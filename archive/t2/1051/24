Subject: 72 Bus  Balljoints

I have a 72 Bus with worn balljoints.  I'd like to replace upper and  
lower joints.  I would like to remove the torsion arms and take them  
to a shop and have the old balljoints pressed out and new ones  
pressed in. I understand there is a special rig that the shop must  
have in order to do this.  I don't want to take a chance on messing  
up the arms so what should I ask the shop BEFORE they do the work?
Thank you,
John Ingram
