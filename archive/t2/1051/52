 Well, I'm getting different stories so I turn to the experts. Have a
74transporter. I was told that the third space in the dash was for a clock
onsome "deluxe" models. Now I'm told it was just left empty and there wasnever
a clock option for transporters. So, was there a clock option or notand if so,
do any of you know a place where I might find one? Thanks! --Jeff Newman

That space was definitely for the optional clock.

Go here and you will see it in the VW parts manual as #11:
