Subject: Weber ict base spacer

I installed a secondhand set of weber icts recently, and, after various
trials and tribulations with jetting, etc, got them running ok. Recently
I noticed that when the engine is turned off, fuel boils in the left
hand carb which causes it to sputter out the accelerator pump into the
throat. I first thought it was to do with the fuel leads contacting the
top of the engine and moved them out of the way. The real problem is
heat transmitted up the manifold into the carb from the head. I notice
some kits include a spacer presumably to stop this occurring. Is it
possible to get these spacers separate from a kit? Could the stock carb
spacers be used? Is there another alternative?

Martin.
