Dear Mr. StCroix:

Thank you for your e-mail concerning a Volkswagen Bus you have seen offered
in Brazil.  It's always a pleasure to hear from a true Volkswagen fan, and
enthusiast!

At present, we do not have any plans to bring the Volkswagen Kombi to the
United States market.  We truly appreciate your desire to see this great van
brought to the U.S., and I have documented your interest internally.

As a valued member of the Volkswagen family, you are important to us.
Again, thank you for your e-mail.  If I may be of further assistance, please
don't hesitate to contact me again by e-mail at
*www.vw.com*<http://www.vw.com>,
or through our Customer CARE Center at (800) 822-8987.  If I am not
available one of my colleagues will be able to assist you.

Sincerely,


Amanda Porter
