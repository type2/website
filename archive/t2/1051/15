Subject: 76 Riviera dies after starting

Hello all,

I have a 1976 Riviera, 2L FI which I purchased in July.  Over the past month
it consistantly dies after 4-5 seconds of idling.  It starts up just fine,
idles nicely for 4-5 seconds, then dies.  I thought that it must be a vacuum
issue, so I identified 2 bad hoses and replaced them.  It ran fine for a week
and then started with the same problem.  If i disconnect the AFM, i can get it
to start up.  If I then let it warm up for a few minutes and reconnect the
AFM, it will continue running and drive perfectly fine.  At this point it will
restart easily after shutting off, but the next day it will again die after
4-5 seconds.  Revving the engine does not help.  It looks like the AFM is
clean and the needle moves upon starting, so I am guessing that is not the
problem.  I can identify no other bad vacuum hoses, other than those initially
replaced.

One more bit of potentially relevant information (or not):  I am trying to
pass Oregon emissions, and thus far have failed twice.  HCs are 800-900 and CO
is 6%.

Thanks in adavance for your thoughts...
