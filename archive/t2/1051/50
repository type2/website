I have often thought of what to put in the "clock" location. If money was no object, I would have a digital multi gauge made to fit in the space, with quad CHT, TACH, Oil Pressure, Oil temp, amp and voltmeter, time, MPG, trip odometer, etc...

In the mean time, I'm looking at a dual CHT, like this one;
