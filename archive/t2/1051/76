	The facts are consistent with an anomalously high current 
drawn by the starter circuit, leaving too little for the coil.  Thus, 
when the starter circuit is not pulling hundreds of amps, the coil 
gets what it needs to make good spark; but when the starter is 
filching bulk power, battery voltage and therefore coil current is 
enfeebled.
  	It is also possible that the coil circuit has developed some 
unusual resistance, which allows a functional spark if not lavish, 
but only when the starter circuit is not sucking bulk.

	These postulates are testable with suitable meters (if not easily) ...
