Subject: low idle til its warmed up

Hi i have a 78 2.0L with F.I.
since i have replaced the cam followers i am experiencing low idle at start
up
 for about 5 min til the engine seems to be at running temp.
i dont think this is a cold start valve issue since its summer...any ideas?
do i need to re-do timing?
Joe
