You can, but you have to set up some sort of circuit to regulate the
voltage and frequency of the current.  The engine would have to run at
constant speed.

There have been special external regulators made to allow a standard
alterntor (minus diodes) to create AC for power tools.  I wouldn't wnat to
run it into electronics, though!  :)
