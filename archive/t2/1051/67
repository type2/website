I got injectors and a resistor pack from Troy (Thanks man!). I got 'em
in over the past couple nights (did you know 1/4" FI hose will fit if
it's heated up a bit?)

No difference. :(

This morning I hit the junkyard and there was a bug. All that was
useful off it, unless a beat to crap case and swiss cheese pan are
useful, was the distributor. I grabbed and for giggles tossed it the
Guac. Holy smokes it worked!!!

My tach doesn't peg and bounce anymore, the bus runs great, etc etc.

Something in the two distributors I have must be shorting out, or the
ground strap while passing eyeball inspection has a weak spot. I'll
spend some more time checking those out later. Right now... ROAD TRIP!
