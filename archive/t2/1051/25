Subject: i'm back - quick question

after 2 years busless, me and the 70 are in portland, oregon.
more on that later, but i had a quick question:

to replace the POS aluminum case (you DO remember that saga, don't 
you?  :)  ), i bought an nos german as41 from a local man. some 
questions... one, part number 043 101 101A, GERMANY,  H and the 
vw/audi logo are cast into it.  dual relief, 8mm studs, partially 
filled behind #3. has fuel pump hole.

  two, no serial number cut into gen stand.

  three, it is FUGLY - casting flash, sharp edges, warts on the flat 
surfaces. i sorta found it hard to believe fritz would let such an 
unfinished case leave thefactory without cleaning it up a little. or 
a lot!

still has cosmoline on it.

what is it? i would normally say standard mid/late 70s universal 
case, but it has so many casting and machining edges left sharp or 
flashed that i can't imagine it was meant for a passenger car. i'll 
have to work on it just to get it smooth enough to not hurt my hands 
when i lift it!  my thought is that it might be an industrial-use 
case (fans, pumps, etc) where looks ain't important.  or that it is a 
factory reject that made it out LOL!

any ideas?
