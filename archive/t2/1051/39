Subject: Guac Update

I finally got to do an AFM swap. No change.

The resistor pack tests perfect when cold. Run the engine for a little
while and instead of 5-7 ohms of resistance per resistor, I get
3.4-ish on 3 of the 4 resistors.

I swapped resistor packs with Jason yesterday and the guac ran MUCH
better. Still not perfect, but better. Although his resistor pack
tested similarly.

It seems that the injector coils were damaged by overvoltage for a long time.

I'm looking for a new resistor pack and set of injectors. BD has the
injectors for $35 each, way cheaper than anybody else. But I'm on the
lookout for used.

Here`s to hoping!
