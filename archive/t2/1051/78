I agree .. if you install a dwell meter.. you can tell if the points are
adjusted correctly.. 50 deg...  which really effects starting a cold
engine..

or a voltmeter at the coil power term 15 ... especially if you have a
min/max setting.. and you can see the voltage drop off below 10 would be
bad..

which of course you could simulate with a test lamp and it might dim
drastically at the point the engine isn't gettting ign power..
