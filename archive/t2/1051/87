Subject: Loctite on bolts from flex plate to cam?

'74 with auto tranny and 2.0 GE FI engine here...

Is this advised?  Im replacing the flex plate (aka drive plate) after  
the mishap during our trip to the Great Sand Dunes National Park (see http://calivw78.com/2008/07/13/great-sand-dunes-national-park 
  )

After that incident, I know for sure I am going to use loc tite on the  
bolts from the flex plate to the torque converter, but wanted to see  
if I should also use it on the bolts going from the flex plate to the  
cam.

Peace, Troy   www.calivw78.com
