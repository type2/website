I agree with Phil. I've tried both, and the MityVac is easier to use.
I had a Fiero with a leaky clutch slave that had to be bled every
couple days. By hand it's a total pain. With the MityVac it's easy.

Which reminds me... The Guac has been setting for like 8 months. I
should flush the brake lines.
