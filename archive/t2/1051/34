Subject: More on water (injection)

This morning I found this site.  An interesting (and informative)  
tome on water in general.

Scroll down to the bottom (nearly) to find another point of view on  
water injection.

This web site debunks a lot of urban myths about water, but it does  
not dismiss the benefits of water injection (just some of them).
