Subject: minor head scratcher on starting

description of setting

  1978 stock sunroof bus
  strong battery
  cranks well and fast
  does not fire at all for the longest time
  runs perfectly when once finally started
  re-starts easily even if only driven 5 minutes

and for the odd part... it starts in a flash
if it is roll started rather than cranked

I have not tried parking it for roll-starting
in reverse, but otherwise this is a pretty
reliable/repeatable/complete set of observations

outside temp does not seem to matter

just head scratching,
