	They did get around to organising alternators in that 
sensible way, with no electricity in the rotor ('armature').  That's 
how they've been of latter years (taking advantage of the powerful 
modern permanent magnets).
	However, for some decades alternators used field coils not 
permanent magnets, and the armature was wire not magnets, with 
slip-rings collecting the electricity generated in that rotor.
	The big difference  -  if you can get your eye into position 
to see it  -  is the way the electricity is collected from the 
armature in non-modern alternators v. generators.  A generator 
collects by carbon brushes bearing on a commutator  -  a cylinder of 
copper strips, one pair for each coil on the armature, separated by 
much narrower insulating strips (which have to be 'dug' from time to 
time  -  I forget the proper verb).  Slip-rings need far less 
maintenance.  The price you pay is that the electricity generated is 
alternating  -  no good for charging a battery.  When solid-state 
diodes became cheap enough to rectify c.400W of AC, the alternator 
took over  -  beginning with the Renault 16 (1965 or 66); VW caught 
up, sluggishly as with disc brakes, c.1973.
	T2-wise, if you can spy a commutator just fw of the pulley 
bearing, it's a genny; if not, it's an alternator.
