Hi Chris

Thanks for the link to the article.

Read the article on water (well most of the stuff I could understand!!).

This web site debunks a lot of urban myths about water, but it does  
not dismiss the benefits of water injection (just some of them).

As described in Robt Mann's articles water injections has been around  
for decades.  Yes, it does work but is not magic.  The gains achieved  
by aeroplane manufacturers &
rally teams is mostly the result of a lot of money, time & effort --  
far beyond what you or I would or could put in to achieve huge power  
gains or economy gains.

I know water injection works.  My father built & installed systems on  
a number of vehicles he owned.  When installed on an early '80s  
Suzuki Carry van, fuel economy (my
Dad's main aim) went from an average of 45 mpg to around 50 mpg.

My reason for installing water injection is similar -- greater fuel  
economy but also cooler engine temperatures.  My system is still  
under development so I do not have
hard & fast facts yet.  However, I do not expect huge gains in fuel  
economy but would be happy with 1-2 mpg improvement if engine temps  
were lowered as well.

My only information is purely 'seat of the pants' which indicates a  
slight increase in power (marginal) & lower temps by about 5C degrees.

I have just had my bus tuned so will attempt to obtain some actual  
data.  As we warm into spring/summer 'down under' I hope to get some  
better indications on temperatures.
I have a 400+ km trip coming up in a few weeks so hopefully I will  
have had time to install the new water tank lower in the bus & have  
the system 'drawing' water as it should.
