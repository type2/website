Subject: Re: [T2] Brake bleeding

I find that the Mityvac vacuum bleeder has some advantages over the Motive 
power bleeder. It requires only one person which I guess is also true of the 
power bleeder. Neither require the pedal to be pumped which is an advantage 
because pushing the pedal to the floor can cause the master cylinder to fail 
by damaging the rubber piston as it travels over sediment/corrosion in the 
"far reaches" of the master cylinder. Not unusual for a master cylinder 
failure to occur a few days after bleeding the system. Problem I have with 
the Power bleeder is that the cap does not fit the reservoirs on several of 
my cars and the set-up is not as easy  as the Mightyvac . Also the Mityvac 
seems to be better at bleeding the clutch slave on some cars. Finally, the 
mighty vac is a also handy diagnostic tool for pressure and vacuum related 
problems. No, I don't own stock in Mightyvac.
