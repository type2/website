You could also get 120V out by bypassing the diodes and then regulating
the field current to get 120V out.  Although this is beyond the normal
operating parameters of an automotive alternator the voltage is still low
enough that it will not arc across the windings or insulation.

The regulation is a bit tricky, as the field has to be supplied with DC at
a level that decreases as the AC output voltage increases.  That will
allow the alternator to self-regulate.  You still have to address
frequency issues, though.
