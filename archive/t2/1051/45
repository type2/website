Well, I'm getting different stories so I turn to the experts. Have a 74
transporter. I was told that the third space in the dash was for a clock on
some "deluxe" models. Now I'm told it was just left empty and there was
never a clock option for transporters. So, was there a clock option or not
and if so, do any of you know a place where I might find one?

Thanks!
