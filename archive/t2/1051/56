Subject: FS: Front Doors

I posted these on Craigslist, but thought someone on the list might  
also want them.

Front doors from two VW Vans. One needs new upholstery, its from a  
78. The other needs some new metal on the outside, the inside metal  
is fine, its from a 77.

$25 bucks for the pair to anyone on the Type 2 list.
