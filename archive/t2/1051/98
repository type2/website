Subject: need bowden cable for accelerator

Hi everybody,

I probably haven't posted on this list since 1999 or 2000, when I
completed my '75 bus to 911 power conversion (see type2.com/dakhlia).
Well, the 911 gave up the ghost a couple of years ago and I just
wasn't willing to invest close to $10,000 for a rebuilt 3.2, stronger
transmission, etc. Besides, the costs for parts were simply outrageous
(e.g., $700 for a distributor!). But it was fun while it lasted :)

So... I'm back to VW power and back on the list! A 2-liter flat-4 is
back where it belongs and is running fine with the '75 "1800" FI
equipment. I just need a few parts, in particular the Bowden conduit
for the accelerator cable. If anybody is parting out a '75-'79 bus,
please keep me in mind. '72 through '74 models might work as well, but
I'm not 100% sure.

While I'm at it, I will also need a whole new rear valence from a
donor bus. (I had carved out a big hole into the old one to fit the
enormous Bratwurst-shaped Porsche muffler.) Give me a holler if you
just happen to have one lying around, hahahaha!

Anyway, looking forward to being active on the list again.
