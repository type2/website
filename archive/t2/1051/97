Not really a dumb question,, and yes. you can do it.. and you don't even 
need the transformer. 

just full field the alternator.. and you will get the voltage up to what you 
need. 

now.. it won't be good quality power like you get from your mains... the 
voltage will fluctuate.. with the frequency ,, etc 

about the only thing this power will be somewhat safe to use is for 
lighting.. and devices with brushes.. like hand drills
a true ac motor won't like the bad frequency,, but it will still work..
and iirc.. if you lower the freq to a motor it overheats.. if you increase 
the frequency it isn't an issue. 

the old 25 cycle motors will run on 60hz.. and it isn't really cost 
effective to have higher freq . . . or you might start to transmit AC thru 
the air.. and the copper mfg wont' like that .. and you might end up like 
Tesla...
