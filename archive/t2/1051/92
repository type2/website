Subject: Re: [T2] Genrator or Alternator?

Dumb question- can one tap that AC before the diodes and then through a
1 to 10 transformer (stepup) and directly get 120v AC?

   An auto alternator puts out AC volts. In reality, it is really called 
a AC
   generator. All alternators have diodes to convert AC to DC.
