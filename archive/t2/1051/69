Subject: "Montreal to Toronto" Mule needed

Hi Volks,

I am still trying to get hooked up with a Mexican Baywindow transmission 
that has been headed my way since January. It seems to be stranded at 
Ben Huot's shop in Montreal right now. Are there any list-members who 
will be traveling from Montreal to Toronto in the near future?

If so, please email me offlist and we'll try to work out the details.

Happy Trails,
