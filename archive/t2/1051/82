OK, I have wrote about this bus before.  I am having to rewire the whole thing
because 90% is patched or replaced.  While working this I have come across the
generator (?) that needs to be wired into and I have some questions.  1972 sun
roof, AE engine, 1600cc.  72 was a transition year and this one was built in
Sept of 71.



One of the many books I have says that 72 only had generators and that if you
can see the windings exposed through the case behind the pulley/shaft, then it
is a generator. I see the windings (Copper).  There are supposed to be 4 wires
coming off of it, (there are 2).  There is supposed to be a voltage regulator
on the right (facing the engine from outside the back) wall. (nope, but I see
screw holes where it may have been.)  Can a bus run on a generator with out a
VR?



So I think I have a generator, but there are only two wires coming off of it
and there is no VR on the back wall.  The generator body is round, and on the
top of it is a > ' thick, 2 x 2" box that the wires attach to.  Does this
sound familiar to anyone?



Of course I cannot just pop the generator off (can I?) because the backside is
connected to the fan.  I think it says I have to remove the fan cover to
access the fan to remove the generator.  Does this sound correct?



All I want to do is wire it up, but all the books are confusing me.  I am just
trying to figure out what type unit this is so I can figure out how to wire
it.



Any help is appreciated.



Paul
