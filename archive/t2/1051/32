Subject: 68 double cab

I have a question someone might be able to answer.  I have a 68 double cab I'm
in the process of putting it back together, and the gas tanks is shot!  I
heard they don't make any aftermarket tanks,and I don't want to salvage a used
one and go through the whole sealer game.

I was thinking of using a saddle tank for from a pickup.  Has anyone out there
tried this?  I would have to do some modifications to the filler tube and
straps.  I was hoping to use a plastic tank(no rust in the future).  If anyone
has successfully accomplished this and can give me some tips or another
solution that would be great.  Thanks

Jon  (68 Doppelkabin)
