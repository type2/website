Subject: electrical system affected by rain?

So , on Saturday night we left tha campground in NH since Hurricane Hannah
was moving in on us, on the highway there was about an inch of water, i
couldnt tell if it was paranoia but i thought i could feel a light misfire
or so , only once or twice, but later as the storm worsened and the water
was gathering , there were obvious misfires or skips, like the engine shut
off for a full rotation , not what i needed with the wife and baby in the
bus .
if i went 50mph it did not happen , but over that speed it did..
im thinking it was the water affecting some part of the electrical system ,
anyone ever have this situation happen?
