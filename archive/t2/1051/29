I have a  72 Bus with worn balljoints.  I'd like to replace upper and   
lower joints.  I would like to remove the torsion arms and take  them  
to a shop and have the old balljoints pressed out and new  ones  
pressed in. I understand there is a special rig that the shop  must  
have in order to do this.  I don't want to take a chance  on messing  
up the arms so what should I ask the shop BEFORE they do  the work?
Thank you,
John Ingram
hello John  I don't know where you are located but the way we do this  job at 
my shop is on the bus.  much easier if you have the correct tools  and 
experiance. I would check with your local VW shop or front end shop.   Better using 
a mom-pop outfit than a brand name service place.  Some places  sell the arms 
with new ball joints in them as replacements. try Bus depot, bus  boys etc.  
If you really want to do this job yourself. It can be a PITA to  R&R the arms.  
 You also need to be aware that there are 2  different size ball joints.  
check the bentley for this info   later  mark d
