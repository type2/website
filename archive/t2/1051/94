Mike,

You could theoretically attach a transformer, however (damn howevers), with 
the widely swinging engine rpms, and the resulting changing frequency of the 
alternator output, any transformer you attach would not work very well. 
Commercially designed transformers are made to work on either 50 or 60 cycle 
power. Additionally, the voltage output of the alternator would rise and 
fall with the rpms of the engine and thus your transformer output voltage 
would swing wildly (times 10). Try it for fun and games sometime, but be 
careful out there. 120VAC bites.

Dumb question- can one tap that AC before the diodes and then through a
1 to 10 transformer (stepup) and directly get 120v AC?
