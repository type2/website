Subject: Re: [T2] Genrator or Alternator?

Paul,

Your 1972 is an early one, production began in August 1971, but it still should have a CB code 1700cc if it was built for the US market.  Your AE code 1600 is a 1971 which have a generator, unless it has been replaced with an alternator.  

The easiest way that I can think of, for me, to explain the visual difference between a generator and an alternator is that a generator is the same diameter at the fan end and the pulley end and an alternator is larger at the pulley end.  However, since there is nor regulator, it sounds as if you have an internal regulated alternator.

Hope this helps.
