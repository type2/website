Subject: Re: [T2] minor head scratcher on starting

lol..  now I am scratching my head..
what is an after-market ignition in the back.

Is that a remote starter switch...  then it is just that... remote starter..
and with it.. you need to turn on the key to run.. then use the remote
starter switch to bump the engine over to start.... or just use the RSS to
bump the engine over while doing a tune up for example...

so.. to answer your question based on that guess... I'd say Yes... it only
passes starter [solenoid] power  and not ignition power..
