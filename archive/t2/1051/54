All,

   Does anyone know of a good VW bus mechanic in Indiana or Southern
Michigan?  I have a 74 sportsmobile that has been sitting for a while and I
would like to get it road worthy again.  I am looking for someone who can do
a full engine rebuild and other major service work.  The bus was my daily
driver until a few years ago.  It has been sitting for the last 4 years or
so and I need to get it up and running before its to late.

Jason
