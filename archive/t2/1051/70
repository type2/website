Hi  Volks,

I am still trying to get hooked up with a Mexican Baywindow  transmission 
that has been headed my way since January. It seems to be  stranded at 
Ben Huot's shop in Montreal right now. Are there any  list-members who 
will be traveling from Montreal to Toronto in the near  future?
 
   Mule? Say, what's in that transmission anyway... ?-)
