Another option is to make your own. I scanned a spare speedo face and 
recreated the numbers in an illustration program, then created a graphic 
I could output on my inkjet printer and glue to the inside of the clock 
pod hole. I then drilled the center of the placeholder plate and 
installed a battery-operated clock that I picked up at the local 
dollarama using some expoxy.

If anyone wants a copy of the JPEG file, just p-mail me and I'll send it 
   to you. If you'd prefer to buy a finished product, it'll be $20 + 
shipping from Toronto. I have enough faceplates on hand to make three 
clocks. Please specify if you would prefer a gray face (68-74?) or black 
face (75+?) on your clock.

Happy Trails,
