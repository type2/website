RE: My tach doesn't peg and bounce anymore:
 
I had that problem when I first installed my VDO tach.  It would  settle down 
when I hooked up my dwell meter - but I was never certain as to why  that 
helped.  I found out - and the VDO help guy confirmed and sent me a  bulletin 
describing this - that installing a diode in series with the signal  wire 
(negative coil terminal to terminal ? on the tach) to the tach solved the  problem.
