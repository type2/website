Thanx for this interesting report, John Scott.
	I would only add that LPG is capable of causing far more 
widespread damage than petrol, in rare mishaps which have however 
occurred (mostly at filling stations).  It is a very nice 
clean-burning fuel  -  once you get it into your vehicle; but if much 
vapour gets loose, and then gets ignited, it can fry not only your 
fambly but also folks at surprising distances.
	I took a close interest in planning for bulk LPG, in the 
period 1989-85 when the bulk distribution system was being planned 
for New Zealand by oil companies.  For a brief period I was the 
leading theorist on LPG fireballs (paper in Combustion Sc & Tech). 
If a mobile tanker or filling-station static tank gets burst by fire 
playing on it  -  which has happened in many places  -  and the 
vapour bursting out gets ignited, all the fuel gets burned in a few 
seconds, causing a peculiarly hot fireball radiating a surface heat 
flux hundreds of kW per sq m  -  a heat flux that will cause 
secondary burns hundreds of m away (as well as igniting dry leaves, 
flaking paint etc).  And that is the shortest-range damage that can 
be done by such a release; delayed ignition can cause burn or 
explosion damage at greater distances.
	So if you see anyone smoking, or in any other way behaving 
dangerously, at an LPG filling station, or driving a mobile tanker, 
crack down sternly!  The lives you save may include your own!!
