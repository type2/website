How shot is shot?  Rust holes thru?  IMO, if you go with a salvaged tank and
seal it, that's the hard part, the install, fuel guage sender, straps, fill
tube all fit and work- sounds like the easy way to go.
   As far as reconditioning the tank, I think R. Atwell has the page using a
cement mixer to clean and prep the tank, which is what I use, but I use 1/4
muratic acid, 3/4 water, and about 5 lbs of old nuts and bolts.  2 hours and
the inside of the tank will look like new.  I like the POR 15 sealer, just
make sure you keep the vent lines, sender hole, ect clear untill it sets up.
As far as attaching the tank to the mixer barrel, I use a cargo/ratchet strap
to fasten the tank to the agitator blades.JT Beaufort, SCRunning: 1. 62 404.1
