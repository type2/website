Subject: Re: [T2] sensors for round dash holes

Hi Alan,

There are three gauges mounted below the radio. I drilled the holes
with a 2" hole saw and gradually widened them to 52mm with a dremel
tool. It took a lot of measuring and re-measuring before I set the
drill to the dash, but it wasn't really that hard to do.

Any Golf/Rabbit GTI or cabriolet is fitted with a set of VDO oil
pressure/temp and voltmeter gauges. A type2 listmember sent me a set
of these a few years back that he was able to pick up at a wrecking
yard and passed them along to me for $10. The sender for the oil
pressure gauge was sourced from GermanSupply, it fits in the same
place as the stock oil pressure switch but using a short hose to mount
the sender on the fan shroud. Two years ago Karl Van Saltzen sold me
the 914 sump plate sensor I needed for the temp gauge. The CHT gauge
was bought from GermanSupply back in 2002.
