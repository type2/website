Hi Mike,

Right now I have an oil temp gauge in there, with a CHT, oil pressure 
and voltmeter located under the radio. I'd like to add a custom tach, 
using about 20 LED's running in a semicircle around the border between 
the 2" oil temp gauge in the 3" clock hole.

I just need to find a schematic or a kit, and the time to put it 
together....

Happy Trails,
