AFAIK, no automotive alternators use permanent magnets.  Doing so would
make it difficult to regulate the voltage via field current.

The generator makes its power in the rotating part and transfers it via a
heavy commutator to the battery.  Generators use mechancial switching to
rectify current to DC, so the switching had to be put on the moving part
of the alternator.

An alternator makes its power in the
stationary coil and uses its rotating coil to generate the magnetic field.
The field requires low current and no switching, so simple slip rings
suffice to supply power to the rotating field coils.  The power produced
is rectified with semiconductor diodes so the output coil can be kept
stationary.
