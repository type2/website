Subject: Outer rocker panel replacement

Hey all,

Has anyone replaced the outer rocker panel on the non sliding door side 
of their bus.  Mine is a 69.  I have the replacement metal and can see 
the bottom is spot welded in place but I am wondering how you attached 
it along the top under the non sliding side?  If I cut the sides and 
drill out the spot welds will I be able to get that top section out?  
How did you go about doing it?

Thanks for your time,

Stephen
