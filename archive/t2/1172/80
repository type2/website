Subject: Bad SVDA dizzy, high idle, poor braking

So here's how everything has flushed out.

A while back, I posted to the list about my idle being too high and finding
that when setting my timing at 28 degrees full advance, that it would settle
back to only 15 degrees at "idle."

Thanks to the wisdom of the list, I started chasing vacuum leaks.  Using a
13mm seatbelt bolt, I plugged the brake servo booster hose at the carb.  The
idle came down, but was still higher than I would like.

I futzed around trying to get the carburetor to adjust down more and found a
lot of slop in the throttle butterfly shaft.  I could HEAR a vacuum leak
depending on how I tweaked it.  I had a spare carb (H30/31) that I put on and
found that I could easily get the idle to adjust down to 950 RPM.

Trying to adjust the timing, I could not get the distributor to back down more
than 15 or so degrees from full advance (about 4000 RPM).  I think the
centrifugal advance might be screwed up (I had the vacuum hose disconnected
and the vacuum port on the carb plugged).  This dizzy has about 48,000 miles
on it (about 15 tune-ups).

Anyhoo, I went after the vacuum leak in the brake booster system, plugging the
hose further and further away from the engine until I was at the brake
booster.  There was no change in idle.  Hooking the brake booster back up, the
idle went back up.

So I went and got a rebuilt brake booster.  Now all is right with the world.
My braking has improved, my idle can be adjusted, and I put my old 009 back
in.  Does anybody want to buy the SVDA?
