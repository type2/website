Mig is for sure the way to go.
The units are easy to transport, easy to use.
Make sure you get a small gas bottle, and if you can just buy one and
have it refilled whenever you do run out.
Check with your local welding supply /oxygen supply shop for pricing.

You will be shocked by how many things you can fix now, not just stuff
on your Bus.
Good luck!

Hi Guys.I got a gift from my wife for a welding class at a local
workshop.



They offer Oxy Acetylene, Stick or Mig Welding.



As purely a hobbyist what do you guys recommend? I have basically never
welded anything in my life before. I don't think I would ever do any
body
panel work, but would like to know how to do some basic welding of
steel.
I'd like to be able to make a frame for my single cab bed.



I don't really know when you use the different types of welding, what
the
cost implications of the different types are, and which are the easiest
to
learn.



Any suggestions?
