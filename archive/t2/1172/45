Sorry, I didn't reply earlier, just got back to my computer.

I found this at my local Staples. I forget the price, it was not as cheap as
a 4GB flash drive should be, but then again-a VW bus is not as cheap as it
should be. I think it was $15 or $20.

A bit pricey at 26.95eu (approx $37.00usd) for just a 4GB Thumb/Flashdrive.

Like Joe Luther asked, what office supply store had this and how much there?
