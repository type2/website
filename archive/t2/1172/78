List,
Today it shows in the Star and Stripes that Mexico City is retiring the
VW 'Bug" taxis as of Friday. The article said in 2006, there were 50,000
of our beloved Bug roaming the streets of Mexicao City.. Today there less than
3500..Humm were are the other 46,500 Bugs???
 
Cheers from Afghansitan,
Kevin
