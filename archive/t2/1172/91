Subject: Re: [T2] fan spacer thickness on AW 1.8

You can get an idea how thick the pulley at least is, looking at this samba
add picture, but like I say the shim seems a bit thinner to me in all
likelihood, though they could certainly be the same.

or is it a matter of "whatever it takes to clear the inner
housing"?  I have
shim stock and a shim die here at the shop so I can make a
spacer, I would
just rather make one of the correct thickness to start with
rather than have
to make a set and try each one to see what works.
