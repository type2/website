Subject: heat exchanger to cylinder head stud

Hey listers -

I took a day off work to finish off the engine for my bus (AW code 1.8
theoretically rebuilt by PO) and when flipping it over to put on the heat
exchangers, I noticed that one of the studs is missing.  Not broken off,
just MIA, plenty of depth.  The base threads appear to be ok because a screw
will thread in after some initial slop in outer diameter.  Looks like a job
for blue Loctite if I can find a stud.  

I've been asking around my local VW guys for a replacement and I am told
that they are different thread pitch at each end and somewhat unobtainium?


Does anyone have a source for these studs or any spares laying around?  I'd
rather address this now while the engine is on its side in my trusty wagon
than later from underneath.  

I don't have the heat exchanger to head gaskets with the spares that came
with the bus either, so I am waiting on those to arrive.   Thank you PO for
telling me everything I need is here.  *sigh*

TIA

Joe in SW Ohio
