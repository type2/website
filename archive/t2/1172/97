Auto darkening helmet are really the way to go. It keeps you from snapping
your head every time you want to start to weld. If you know of a local body
guy, ask him if you can have a fender or hood to practice on. My problem has
been grinding off too much weld and having to reweld  the thing again.

I have a Millermatic 135 that runs on 110VAC and it's been plenty for
the welding I needed to put my vert back on the road -- mostly
replacing panels. Welding thin sheet metal is definitely something
that takes practice so you don't end up blowing holes or having to
grind off lots of excess metal. My welds weren't pretty but they've
held up well. Find some old scrap metal to practice on -- it's all
about the feed rate, temperature, and the "feel" you get after doing
it a few times.

It's great to be able to fabricate metal objects. When the front
clutch cable attachment point wore through on my bus, I was able to
fill in the area and redrill a new hole for the pin. I've yet to make
a welded sculpture out of old engine parts, but it's on my list. :)

I invested in a welding shirt, gloves, and auto-darkening helmet. The
latter is especially helpful.
