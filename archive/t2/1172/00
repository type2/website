Tom, actually I don't know you are that far off as told for a late bay, but
more than one would think for early.  A long, long time ago on a list far
away, I bought all of the then extant late Westy plaid NOS stock fabric in
existance and sold it off to the list at pretty much cost.  This long before
they started repopping the stuff.  Now for a late Westy like that I figured
about 7-7.5 for just the lower cushions (front seats, rear/bed seat, rear/bed
cushion (front and back)) presuming 54" width which is most common for
upholstery fabric.  Now I can't exactly picture a '73 about the only Westy I
have never owned, but recalling Dolan's orange nightmare and what you say I do
presume a lot less, as your fronts will be beige basket weave presumably and
your top is a cot.  Early bed is pretty thick though, but I'd guess more on
the order of 5.5-6 yards presuming again 54" fabric.  However bear in mind,
always better (particularly if custom) to have
 more and keep it in a closet for years to come than less.  If you were
talking even $20-25 a yard or so, money well spent for when someone burns the
seat with a ?? or spills ?? on it that won't come off.  Plus presuming you are
going vinyl looks to go $5-10/yd on fleabay.  Now if you have found a piece
local and are hoping it is enough, that is another story, got to hope the
cover maker can be frugal.

Does anyone know the estimated quantity of
material needed to reupholster
the inside of a 1973 Westfalia Campmobile?  I
was told 7.5 yards and that
seems high to me.  The pieces would be the back
cushion over the engine, the
two pieces that make up the bench/bed, the
armrest for this bench, the jump
seat, bottom and back, 6 pieces in total.
