Subject: Re: [VB] welding class

Kevin, I've been welding for 25+ years, learned stick and gas from dad, then
MIG on my own, and am dinking with TIG now and then now.  In the day most
people would have said learn gas, cause you can do a lot with it, cut, weld
thick, weld thin (but note NOT modern high carbon body metal), pot metal and
other stuff if you got the guts, heat things, solder, braze, etc.  All that is
still roughly true, but honest to god, MIG has probably surpassed it for most
hobby work around the car and home.  It isn't as versatile in some respects,
but you can pick you up a good Miller 120V (and I get guff on that but stand
by it for portability and overall use) or Hobart or the like on the cheap off
craigslist (I paid $250 for a near new Miller with a full tank of gas), and go
and weld anything from your bus body, to frame, up to even 1/4 channel to
build a trailer (you can go thicker with a 220V machine but can't run it out
in the field or at your buddies house,
 etc.) 

So I vote MIG as the current all around best choice for what you are
likely to do.  And when it comes time to buy, do yourself a favor, spring for
the blue box Miller (or I guess a Lincoln or Hobart if you have to) not some
generic Harbor Freightish thing.  Note then that Century has been a generic
thing BTW for the last 15+ years.

YMMV a lot on this one.

John

As purely a hobbyist what do you guys recommend? I have basically never
welded
anything in my life before. I don't think I would ever do any body
panel work,
but would like to know how to do some basic welding of steel.
I'd like to be
able to make a frame for my single cab bed.
