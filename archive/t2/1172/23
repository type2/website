Originally the left was adjustable and the right not, but you can
interchange them or even make both adjustable. (As David Raistrick pointed
out, making both sides non-adjustable is not a brilliant move.)  CIP is
apparently reserving the right to ship you whatever they have on the shelf.
We simply list one as adjustable and one as not, and you can choose which
one you want. (Further down we do note that the adjustable one is stock for
the left side, but on some Buses that may have been altered over the years.)
There certainly no harm in putting an adjustable one on each side.
