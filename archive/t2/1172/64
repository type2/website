Subject: Heat Exchanger to Cylinder Head stud

If I remember right, it's a 'stepped' stud with an 8mm diameter on the nut
side and a 9mm diameter on the head side, and about 56mm long. But I could
be totally wrong because the last time I bought one was in the 90s from
Forum Auto parts in the Bronx. I also had to go to a company called
'Unimetric' to find some unusual exhaust studs for the bus.
