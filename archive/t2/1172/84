Gas is sweet but the challenge I had was learning to control the heat. I 
tended to cook anything I tried to weld. Just takes practice. Helps to 
have someone around that can explain things for you, be your 
knowledgeable critic.

Am halfway looking to buy a set of tanks for a the vintage torch and 
regulators my father gave me recently. He bought a set of good quality 
hoses/torches/regulators new at an estate sale recently for under $40. 
The torch I inherited is in good condition - just old.
