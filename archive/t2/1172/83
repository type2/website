Hey i've used the Lincoln 180C continuously to layer up steel to machine 
a new thicker surface.

I welded for 10 mins with .035 wire and no problems. I have a friend 
that said he overheated his once welding the chassis together on a kit car.

For an amateur doing patch panels I don't think there is much danger of 
overheating a basic MIG welder - the material is too thin, the right 
wire too small and if you are overheating it you are certainly warping 
the bodywork.
