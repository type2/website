Subject: Bus Birthday

This week my bus is 48 years old. I'm the second owner after my Dad. 
It was purchased on February 22, 1964. I was there. I learned to drive 
in that bus on the hills of San Francisco. I've been the owner/driver 
since 1972. Was my daily driver until 1995. Restored by Alex Pagado at 
ISP West in 2003.

Going to the OCTO show tomorrow at Veterans Stadium in Long Beach, 
California.
Hope to see some of you there. Look for the White over Velvet Green 
double door.
