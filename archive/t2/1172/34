Subject: wiper motor

In my '73 Westfalia my wiper motor has been operating very sluggishly, so
much so that high speed is just about the same speed as low.  I took out the
assembly and plan on fixing/relubricating  the motor.  Once I degrease the
internal parts what type of grease should I use to relubricate it.

 

I am not very well versed with electrical motors so if any thoughts come to
mind on what else I should look for that would be appreciated. 

 

Thanks,

Tom
