Subject: Re: [T2] wiper motor

The last time I took a VW wiper motor apart it was a spring morning 
(6th of April 1980) on a picnic bench at a campground by the Smith 
River in northern Calif, the wipers had almost stopped the day before 
in the rain.

I ended up having to mess with the brushes & springs.
