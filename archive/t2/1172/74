true but the cost for a "basic hobby welder" is a bit much. if I were into 
production yes, but I have a VW out back turn on the welder maybe once a 
month. the biggest difference between the Lincoln and the Miller is the 
"duty cycle" and the average backyard mechanic isn't going to work faster 
than the Lincoln duty cycle, I very rarely have mine shut down from 
overheat.

spend the money on a VERY good helmet, your eyes are valuable. and a 
decent gas kit.  I've had my 120volt (can't get 220 to my garage, long 
story) Lincoln for maybe 15 years now and looks and works like new.
  don't buy junk but unless your planning on going into business and using 
it continously for hours on end day after day miller is overkill.

just my not so humble opinion.

YMMV like he said, a lot.
