I did the same... It sounds like it's going to be a fun movie. What better
way of advertising ARES to those who don't know what it is and to those who
want to become a member. Better still to attach a face to the person at the
other end of the phone.

It's a Friday Post.  I just pledged $100 to get this VW Bus adventure
made.  Please visit the website, watch the video explaining the movie, and
consider helping to get this piece of Americana made!
