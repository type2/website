	I want to point to the Henrob gas torch.  It uses oxygen & 
acetylene, but less than an ordinary torch (paying for itself quite 
soon, in any workshop that does a lot of welding).
	Having never done any oxy-acetylene welding, I first tackled 
with a Henrob a seriously cracked cast-iron exhaust manifold. 
Feed-metal was piston-ring scraps.  It went like a dream.  I was 
startled.
	Even more startling was a busted pre-war oil-saturated 
aluminium {yes, that's the spelling  ;-)} motorcycle crankcase which 
the owner had, understandably, thought past saving.  I could see oil 
boiling out of the metal, but a tiny flame sufficed (with rod type 
4043  5% silicon).  The case was successfully put back in service.
	The VW magnesium crankcase is of course different again, and 
more likely than aloominum to bonfire/pyrotechnize  ...  there is a 
5356 rod  5% magnesium which might be the first one to try.

	I am not involved in trading Henrob torches, tho' my 
unplanned demo did succeed in selling one to my university.

	I don't make much sense of Henrob's propaganda about how it 
works; but I can attest that it does work.
