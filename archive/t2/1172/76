Actually $250 for a Miller, a used 2-3 times 135 with a real Miller helmet no
less, and a near new small tank of argon/CO2 blend, and in AK, no less. 
Hobarts are much cheaper than the equivalent Miller new and used.  I'm not
doubting I did extremely well, these are hard times, guy had to buy it for an
apprentice program which he quit and needed to sell it, he was selling a set
of Matco boxes and a bunch of stuff.  But it wasn't that uncommon of a deal,
I've seen several Millermatic 135 and 140s under $400 on CL in Alaska since. 
One certainly doesn't need to spring for something of the level of the $1300
Auto-Set mentioned in the Pop Mechanics review to get a blue box, a new 140 is
under $700.
 
And like I've said before until I had this thing, I didn't get
it, I've had an older Century 220V before, stick exclusively with Lincoln
"tombstones" and have run the lower end  Hobart and Lincoln 110 an 220V
machines.  For whatever reason (and again I don't know why) the damn Miller
just makes ME weld that much better on thin stuff, astounding for bodywork,
and is more than cabable up to 3/16" in a single pass with great penetration,
and no problems with duty cycle.  I think the Home Depot Lincoln's are
probably best bang for buck for $$ conscious folks, a local pawn shot up here
somehow got a load of them an was selling the 140s new for $350 and the 180s
for $500, in AK.  The deals are out there you got to look and have the cash at
the right moment when they appear.
But I don't think anyone can go wrong with
a Miller, Lincoln, or Hobart, and since Miller owns Hobart now, shit the small
welders may be the same under the surface and maybe you just are paying an
extra $175 for blue/white instead of beige/orange paint...  It is all just a
Ford/Chevy thing probably.

Or it was for me..Id take the oxy/acetylene or
stick class, and buy a mig.
but I think its very rare to find a hobart for
$200 as one person pointed
out, I have cruised the net for one for 2 years and
have not found a
machine that has decent duty cycle and can dial the voltage
low enough for
body work in a 110 model
