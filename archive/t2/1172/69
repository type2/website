TIG if you can afford it, MIG otherwise. Gas is nice and versatile but 
it requires the most work to get good at. Stick is nice but only suited 
to thicker materials.

I have a Lincoln Sp-180T at home, LincolnSP-180C at work, Lincoln 225 
stick/TIG at work, and Miller plasma. Also a gas torch setup at work and 
the same at home but no tanks at home yet.

I agree about looking for a 120V machine for patch panel work.

There is a great website:

He also links to some vehicle restorations that he has done with alot of 
welding usually.
