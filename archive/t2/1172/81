Remember, an SVDA is just an 009 with a vacuum advance, so open it up, 
clean out the mechanical advance (if it is in-fact not-functional), and 
you'll have a much better driving engine.  Go a step further and adjust 
the SVDA to match the correct advance specifications for your engine (of 
which the 009 most likely does not either) and you'll have an even 
better driving engine.
