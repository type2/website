Subject: Re: [T2] heat exchanger to cylinder head stud

Joe,

I can probably scare up a used one to mail.  I think they had gotten
scarce actually a bit ago, they used to be just $3-4 each or so.  They are
M8/M9, so I doubt actually that your "screw is loose" just more likely you are
putting an M8 in there and it is loose because it is in an M9 hole, locktite
wouldn't last in the heat of this application, real repair if boogered is weld
and retap, or you can (just) overbore one to M10 to use a helicoil with a
straight M8 stud (1.7's used straight studs) or to use an M8/M10 "repair" stud
(which you might find at a good industrial hardware place) but M10 is so close
to the edge it is sort of a bodge.  Anyway I should have some heads lying
about with one, unless all I got is 1.7 heads.

Or CIP still lists them for
$6.

and I presume other usual sources still have them.  Closer to you, perhaps
Larry's Offroad still has them (they didn't use to always list some of their
T4 stuff) or a good local VW shop still might.  In WV I could name 3 places
that would likely still have them on the shelf, though a bit dusty.  In the
day I could actually get these from NAPA in WV, but that day was a long time
ago.

I took a day off work to finish off the engine for my
bus (AW code 1.8
theoretically rebuilt by PO) and when flipping it over to put
on the heat
exchangers, I noticed that one of the studs is missing.  Not
broken off,
just MIA, plenty of depth.  The base threads appear to be ok
because a screw
will thread in after some initial slop in outer diameter. 
Looks like a job
for blue Loctite if I can find a stud.
