Subject: fan spacer thickness on AW 1.8

Folks -

Another thing my "complete" engine did not include was the thin spacer
between the fan and the crankshaft snout that allows the fan to clear the
inner half of the housing.  Does this spacer have a fixed/common thickness
or is it a matter of "whatever it takes to clear the inner housing"?  I have
shim stock and a shim die here at the shop so I can make a spacer, I would
just rather make one of the correct thickness to start with rather than have
to make a set and try each one to see what works.  

Thanks in advance.

Joe
