Thanks to some list members' suggestions, I was able to find one on
airheadparts.com.

 

They aren't cheap, but they are out there and if the web site description is
correct and it is the correct stud, the stud is the format below for the 1.8

If I remember right, it's a 'stepped' stud with an 8mm diameter on the nut
side and a 9mm diameter on the head side, and about 56mm long. But I could
be totally wrong because the last time I bought one was in the 90s from
Forum Auto parts in the Bronx. I also had to go to a company called
'Unimetric' to find some unusual exhaust studs for the bus.
