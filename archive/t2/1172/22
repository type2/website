and further into that thread.. Karl [rip] gets confooosed..
Even cip1 says the left side is adjustable:

And in the text for the right side:
http://www2.cip1.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=VWC%2D211%2D415%2D802%2DF

it says:
The right side tie-rod originally came as a fixed ( non-adjustable )
tie-rod. The adjustment for your front
suspension was enabled by the left side tie-rod which was adjustable. Some
suppliers now substitute an
adjustable version right side tie-rod in place of the original fixed type.
Either will work perfectly and
therefore when you order this item- it may come as adjustable or fixed. We
can not specify which you will
receive but most of the time you will get the non-adjustable ( fixed )
style.

Strange.......
