Subject: welding class

Hi Guys.I got a gift from my wife for a welding class at a local workshop.

 

They offer Oxy Acetylene, Stick or Mig Welding.

 

As purely a hobbyist what do you guys recommend? I have basically never
welded anything in my life before. I don't think I would ever do any body
panel work, but would like to know how to do some basic welding of steel.
I'd like to be able to make a frame for my single cab bed.

 

I don't really know when you use the different types of welding, what the
cost implications of the different types are, and which are the easiest to
learn.

 

Any suggestions?
