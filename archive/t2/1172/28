Subject: The Bus-documentary

Last night I was fortunate to attend a packed house unofficial premier of THE
BUS at the Missoula Documentary Film Festival. This is a great hour long
documentary on the bus that had the audience cheering. And I say this without
bias formed by the inclusion of my 'archival' 1976 Super-8 footage of my old
1961 double rear door panel van tooling through Montana and New Jersey. Ahem.
The director, Damon Ristau, of Firewater Films, will be making more changes to
the film, and it will appear on The Documentary Channel in the next few months
or so. Then, a longer version for dvd release.  It focuses mostly on the split
window, a lot of 'hippie' culture, and then a good deal on the synchro.  Lots
of interesting characters, including archival footage of John Muir and Ben
Pon. Or Pons? A number of bus folks trekked out from Seattle to see it.
Anyway, just a heads up.  Happy Feder, 1976 Westy.
