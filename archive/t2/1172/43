Went to the OCTO bus show on Saturday. Early morning before the gates
opened while waiting in line, I hung out with Scott and Everett
Barnes. Must have been close to 300 split buses.
Had a good time. Hot Dog Fred was there. Had a brat, delicious as
always. Found a stock fuel fuel pump that matched the unit in my bus
with 300K miles on it. Now I have a spare. Didn't win any raffle
prizes, however there were quite a few great ones. Koch donated a
steering wheel restoration. Lots of $25 certificates from West Coast
Metric. Several nice items from ISP West. Some tune up kits from Bill
and Steve's. Plenty of T-shirts. I managed to catch one of the give
aways thrown into the croud (a Strictly Vintage Familienfest 2011).

Clara was there! Howdy!

A Great time was had by all!
