Kevin, "flux core" kits aren't usually worth the converting, most of the time
you should go the other way round and simply get a MIG and can then always run
flux core if you like.  Usually the "converting" costs more than saving and
buying the MIG first.  Flux core is sometimes convenient, you can say go weld
on a tractor on a windy day in the middle of nowhere using a 3-4 kW generator
with a 110V machine.  But in the last 10 years I haven't gone though half of a
small roll of flux core wire when I've burnt up 2-3 big rolls each of 2
different sized solid wire so...
 
Money better spent going for what you need
the first time.  Sorry to hear the guy prattled on more about safety of stuff
you weren't even using than welding.  2-3 hours of real welding instruction
would have been more than enough to get you going, an hour may still be if you
get a machine and go for it.  You have the luxury of not being in a rush,
watch for a deal.  Pawn shops might be worth looking at BTW even for used but
only if the will let you fire it up for 10-15 minutes.

Additionally one
student had actually brought a flux core welder. I think
that is what it was
called. It was like a MIG welder, but no gas. The
instructor showed us that it
could be adapted/changed to work with gas. But
then he went on to explain that
this particular model (from HD) was sort a
junky.
