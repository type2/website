Subject: Re: [T2] RE: [VB] welding class

lets remember the question was what class to take, not what machine to buy.
In my opinion, taking a mig class is like taking a class on how to ride a
bike.
its just that easy.
Or it was for me..Id take the oxy/acetylene or stick class, and buy a mig.
but I think its very rare to find a hobart for $200 as one person pointed
out, I have cruised the net for one for 2 years and have not found a
machine that has decent duty cycle and can dial the voltage low enough for
body work in a 110 model..but I am prone to bad luck..hehe
im really interested in the  Henrob gas torch  Robert Mann talked about.
