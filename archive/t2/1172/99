Subject: re:Welding class

I have the privilege of working in the shop of one of the premier welders here
and asked him about the switching moment on auto darkening helmets.  I.e.
whether he was worried about being flashed.  His response was that he had
trained himself to blink at the instant of trigger down.  Clean, simple,
solution to those of us worried the the circuitry might let enough flash
through to be a problem. 

BTW he has a new ~$10k Miller combo with Profile Pulse that makes MIG welds
that look just like TIG.  Very impressive in thick, and thin, aluminum.  Way
beyond the home user today, but that tech will filter down soon enough.

As well as the PPE recommended by others, I recommend high quality wire. 
Makes welding a lot easier. Compared to your time and investment in other
aspects of your resto,  wire is insignificant $. The Tartan Flux core from
Rockmountnassau will make you look good.    Available in .030". The Tartan-B
MIG wire is available down to .023". "Designed for thin gauge mild and medium
alloy steels" and to work on less than perfect surfaces i.e. "dirty, oily,
rusty steels" and galvanizing.  Sounds like it was made for bodywork. The reps
are very helpful and in many areas will come to you to help you work out a
problem.
