That, or just get *any* other SVDA instead of the one you have because 
that's exactly what you're doing by putting an 009 in there  (less the 
vacuum advance), and it will probably *still* drive better than if you 
had an 009.  Remember, there's absolutely nothing magic about an 009 
other than the fact that it's a cheap replacement distributor.  It is 
not adjusted any better or worse towards your engine's requirements.
