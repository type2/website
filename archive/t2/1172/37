Subject: Re: [T2] wiper motor

Tom I may vary from a lot of folks on this but on the gear train I tend to use
a good synthetic moly grease, any brand is fine for me, something I've used to
stuff CV's with usually.  Key is that you must remove all traces of the
lithium based glue that will be present from VW.
 
Another thing to consider
is that the motor may only be a small part of your problem, your actual issue
may well also be in the wiper shafts, whose dissasembly is to me a real PITA.
 
YMMV.

In my '73 Westfalia my wiper motor has been operating
very sluggishly, so
much so that high speed is just about the same speed as
low.  I took out the
assembly and plan on fixing/relubricating  the motor. 
Once I degrease the
internal parts what type of grease should I use to
relubricate it.
