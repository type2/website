Subject: original list price

Does anyone know if there is a site with original list prices on our old
VW's?

I'm trying to determine how my city figures out the excise tax on my
vehicles? For some reason my '65 is less than my '69. At this point I would
assume they would both be at the minimum. When I looked it up, it appears to
be based on the original list price.
