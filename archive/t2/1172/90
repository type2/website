Subject: Re: [T2] fan spacer thickness on AW 1.8

Joe I'd have to go and find and measure but it isn't "shim" thickness per se
(at least what I usually think of that) as that can alternatively be the A/C
pulley flange as well.  Off top of my head, I'd say somewhere from
0.030-0.050" and I'd be leaning toward the higher end, perhaps even a bit
more.  I think likely when it is an A/C pulley might even be a bit thicker
than when it is a shim, going outward an extra 20-30 thou isn't going to
affect much and all.  Again, if you'd like one, I'm sure I can scare one up
with a bit of digging.

inner half of the housing. 
Does this spacer have a fixed/common thickness

shim stock and a shim die here
at the shop so I can make a spacer, I would
just rather make one of the
correct thickness to start with rather than have
