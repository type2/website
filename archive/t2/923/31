in my old 65 Westy I had my spare mounted between the frame rails
amidship. it was jacked into plaace and help by a bolt. the bolt could be
uundone from inside the bus and the spare just fell to the ground. I
figured it would be easy enough to get out (the bolt was same size as lug
nut) and I would worry about putting it back when I got back to
civilization... only ever had to use it once and it worked but it was a
real pain to check air presure and usually was as dirty as all get out.

current bus with low floor it wouldn't work so it is on the nose. and it
did save the bus by being up there, a tractor trailer driver fell asleep
on the interstate and drifted into my right side, just clipping me enough
for me to be driving sideways at 55mph and the tire hit the side of the
trailer tire keeping me from possibly going under the trailer.  some small
dents (ok not that small) and a broken turn signal lens.  tire marks are
still on the tire cover they wouldn't come off.
