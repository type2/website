"some head professionals think polishing is bad, they port and then go
back and sand the surface with really rough sandpaper, this creates a
boundry layer like a golf ball and aids atomization."

Over the years I've heard both arguments. Some say the layer of
stagnant air just above a rough surface is great EXCEPT when the layer
is broken. Then the sharp protrusions become places to disrupt airflow
and allow atomized fuel to come out of suspension. The dimples on a
golfball are even, consistent, and smooth. It's impossible to do the
same through the entire intake path through the head. So I dislike the
comparison.
