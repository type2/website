Funny, i was told it was a 77 :-)  The stamp in the
door says "mfg 8/77" or something like that, so model
year 78 makes sense.

the engine i gave you with it was from my 72. It is a
hydraulic lifter'ed 1700 with a bad #2 exhaust valve.
The newly re-maned head came from Jim Arnott; i had it
r&r'ed for $50 (that was with a few new valve guides
too). I would have no problems with slapping that new
head in place and calling it good. Needs new lifters
and oil pump too as i poached them for the 1800 i put
in the 72.

inboard cv boots are new. wait, outboard may be too...

The tranny is from a 73 with 78 bh and nosecone.

glad that you are keeping it alive. That is what
really mattered the most to me. I would have hated to
see it parted out or crushed.

I was just the middleman, making sure she got a good
home.
