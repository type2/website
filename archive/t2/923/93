Subject: Re: [T2] Header Wrap

I haven't considered a header wrap, may be a great way to go, I was thinking about heat coatings but hadn't looked at pricing yet, we use Finish Line Coatings in Milwaukie for our racer, he applies coatings that keep heat in and heat out depending on the part, like an exhaust pipe next to an intake pipe, he will coat the exhaust to keep heat in and the intake to keep the exhaust heat out.

The price may make this unreasonable, I am interested in hearing about header wrap or any low cost option.
