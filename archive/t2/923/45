True but why does it have to be that way...

Why are we always comparing a set of (new) dialed in carbs to a malfunctioning FI setup?

Just go over the parts, testing them, fixing the PO and his mechanic abuses, make sure the electrical contacts are good and you'll find it's reliable.

The points and condenser are not part of the FI system. It sounds like you are confusing the electronic igntion setup from the 79 CA model with the AFC (L-Jet) fuel injection system. Only D-Jet setups had the FI trigger in the distributor.

I have no fear of driving 2,000 miles in my bus because I've put in the effort to make sure a 30 yr. old bus is road worthy enough to get me to the destination and back.
