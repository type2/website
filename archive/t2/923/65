Blueprinting an engine refers to the removal of manufacturing tolerances
to produce an exact dimension or quantity and achieve the potential designed.
Look at specifications for individual parts of the VW and the Porsche
versions of the pancake engine, you will find some interesting differences.
For instance, where VW finds variance of 10 grams in piston weight acceptable,
Porsche makes it 5. Blueprinting "should" remove it.
Other tolerances, such as bearing clearances, change as wear proceeds,
so the blueprint value is somewhat transitory at best.

Blueprinting can be expensive if it requires machine work to achieve,
depending on how much is required to obtain the results desired.
If you could simply pick a set of pistons which were made perfectly,
would you expect to pay extra for that selection process?

Could somebody please explain what a blueprinted engine is or what it means to blueprint an engine?

I thought I knew but saw a post earlier saying that blueprinting costs big bucks, so maybe I don't know.
