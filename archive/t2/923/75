Thanx Dave for defn & discussion.  I never heard this term 
"blueprinting" till 2 or 3 decades ago, and have always been 
suspicious of it.  I suspect extreme fixation on numbers is the last 
refuge of those who lack intuition (and want an excuse for charging 
more).   Burt 'the World's Fastest Indian' Munro had few instruments; 
his home-made "micrometer" for measuring piston slap was a long wedge 
viz. a hand-filed knitting needle.

	Several corporations were charging the Pentagon $5 for a $0.5 
diode selected I can't recall how but it did cost labour and looked 
to have a better life expectancy than an unselected diode.
	For a motor peaking as low as 4000 rpm, with low specific 
power, I doubt exact equality of piston weights would make much 
difference.
