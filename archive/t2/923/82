I suspect you are very right, and as I mentioned earlier balancing and
blueprinting have diminishing returns, the tighter the tolerances the more
expensive the process and the less you get for each increment, I chose
1gram because that was what I thought was the best I could afford for the
use I planned on giving my engine.

in Bentley pg 80-87 is a long list of tolerances and wear limits.  you can
find that pistons have a 4gram new 10gram worn balance limit. in the case
of my engine I balanced to 1gram not 4gram during rebuild so I paid more.
double the price I could have gotten 1/2 gram, double it again and get 1/4
gram etc...

as someone else said when you get it "Blueprinted" you better find out
what the builder "Rreally" means by that.

balancing though is basically for the moving parts, you don't baalance a
bearing, but you can blueprint a bearing but at what tolerance. the Type
IV main bearing journnal is 59.97-59.99  but you could spec it
59.98-59.90 a much tighter spec and you would pay dearly for it.

only you can determine what is "good enough" for you and your needs, as
was said by someone else there is no "Perfect" because we don't have tools
to measure that.
