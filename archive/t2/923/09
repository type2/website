I would think that anything disturbing the airflow in front the nose
of the bus would help stream that air around the side of my camper and
decrease resistance.

About 0.001 %

That's how I rationalized mounting my bicycle out front of the bus on
the (shameless plug) Jamie Rivers front hitch. (spare in the "luggage
rack" on top)
