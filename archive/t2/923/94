Subject: Re: [T2] Header Wrap

Be aware that headerwrap traps moisture and can cause rusting quite quickly. On my hiperformance 2276Cc engine, the header was wrapped in it, and rusted quickly due to condensation/moisture between the wrap and the header. I would suspect any salt water due to winter driving etc, would REALLY enhance the corrosion. 
HTH,
