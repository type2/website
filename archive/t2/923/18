This would be an interesting discussion.

I'm sending an email to some of my old clients (CRS's and dent  
pulling fanatics) and see what their experience has been. Most of  
these guys are in So Cal, so they have more recent experience of "old  
Bus VS newer car" than most...since there are still plenty of Buses  
on the road out there.

(Well, plenty compared to places like...say...Charleston, SC.)
