My record is 3 flats in 1 day out at Steens Mountain and White Horse Hot Springs, I repaired one with with a plug with help from a camper, and he aired up my other flat tire, but eventually I became stranded, at least I made it to the pavement and eventually got towed into Burns.

When I got to Burns the only tire store was closed, I tracked down the manager at the movie theatre where he was repairing the popcorn machine.

Its a much longer story, but it was Les Schwabs fault I got 1 of the flats so they waived the $75.00 fee for opening the tire store on Sunday.

Whenever I travel into SE Oregon/Northern Nevada/NW Utah I get at least 1 flat a week.

Now I have a nice portable aircompressor and a plug kit of my own, I put about 2000 miles on a plug once, only getting it repaired because it had a slow leak, and I carry a second spare on long trips.
