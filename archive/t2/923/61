Doesn't it refer to carefully measuring each vital component (pistons, rods,
etc.), comparing them to the specifications, and modifying them to match,
for example making the rods weigh the same?

Could somebody please explain what a blueprinted engine is or what it means
to blueprint an engine?

I thought I knew but saw a post earlier saying that blueprinting costs big
bucks, so maybe I don't know.

Thanks
