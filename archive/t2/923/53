Subject: RE: [T2] Driving Lights

Before I yanked the motor for a rebuild (in process), I ran a pair each of
Hella fogs and driving lamps with Silverstar bulbs.  These were wired
through relays and controlled by two additional VW switches I added on the
left side of the instrument panel, using the holes provided behind the dash
plastic cover.

I love them!

I also want to note that the stock 7" lenses, with Silverstar bulbs, are
quite bright on their own when properly aimed.  Honestly, they approach the
amount of light from my Touareg's HIDs.  Not as much "lumen overkill"  --
but the illuminated area is roughly equivalent.

Note:  keep an eye on voltage drop from 30 year old wires.  Run a new, heavy
gauge wire to the dash or at least replace the connectors on the existing
12ga red supply line.

Volks,

What has been your experience with driving lights or fog lamps
mounted on the front bumper?

Just wondering. I'll be replacing the sealed beam lights on my 74
High Top, but also want to add some additional illumination since the
roads here in the Lowcountry are REALLY really dark.

Especially the drive down 17 between CHS and BFT. Pitch black and
LOTS of leaping fauna.

Thanks,
Anton
