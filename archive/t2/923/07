To make a better slipstream around the front mounted
spare tire I am using an older Mercedes-Benz hubcap.
It's the metal painted style hubcap found on the 108,
114, 115, 116 & 123 series MB cars.

The metal clips on the hubcap hold it firmly onto the
stock steel VW bus rim.  It will not blow off the rim.
