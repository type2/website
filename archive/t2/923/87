I keep reading that Blueprinting means building for a specefic design, kind 
of like ISO9000, say what you are going to do and then do it.

I built an engine for an old hot rod once and wanted it to run loose like a 
well broke in motor, I asked the machinist to push everything as close to 
factory tolerance as possible, essentially machining it the same as a worn 
engine.

I guess in that case I was blueprinting, the factory specs for piston to 
wall were something like .003-.009, and I told the machinist I wanted 
.007-.009.

That was 13 years ago and I still have a friend that tells that story at 
gearhead gatherings, he called it "precision slop."

I got the idea from a friend that bought an old muscle car with high mileage 
and added performance parts and raced it getting it into the high ellevens, 
but it burned oil so over the winter he rebuilt it very tight and it slowed 
the car down almost back to the mid twelves.

If you do this you need a monster for an oil pump.

The tie-in, I am gearing up to build a nice motor for my '77 bus, it doesn't 
need one currently, so it is a long term plan, I would like to have it 
finished in a year, but I am looking for a donor that keeps stubbing 
somebodies toe.

Thanks for the great discussion
