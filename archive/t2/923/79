I doubt that it would.  The only reason someone
would disconnect it (and hopefully plug the
engine end) would be if it had a leak and was
causing the bus to run poorly.   Still whistling?
If yes, you still have a leak.  What is your
engine vacuum now?  Should be 17-20.  Even if the
bus is running better, you should take a little
time to ensure that it will continue running. 
Vacuum leaks= lean condition = burnt valves =
$$$$ = unhappy rodewarrior.
