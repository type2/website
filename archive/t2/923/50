Volks,

What has been your experience with driving lights or fog lamps  
mounted on the front bumper?

Just wondering. I'll be replacing the sealed beam lights on my 74  
High Top, but also want to add some additional illumination since the  
roads here in the Lowcountry are REALLY really dark.

Especially the drive down 17 between CHS and BFT. Pitch black and  
LOTS of leaping fauna.

Thanks,
Anton
