Subject: [T2] Hankook RA08 Report

This E-mail is in favor of Hankook RA08 tires.  
  
First 6 years of ownership, my 78 ASI/Riviera ran on
2-ply Load Range B tires recommended to me by a local
Tire Supplier (Les Schwab).  They felt and looked
unsafe.  Based upon the tire load numbers and the
weight of the vehicle, the 2-ply tires WERE unsafe.  2
years ago, I learned about the original tire specs
from VW.  Last month, I purchased 5 Hankooks from the
Busdepot.com.  2 Weeks of driving and 500 miles later,
I can tell you the Hankook 8 ply reinforced sidewall
load range D tires feel and ride better.  Huge
differences in handling.  And at $78 per tire, there
is no reason to take a chance on the plethora of
`comes close to the original specifications` tires by
Michelin, General, Bridgestone, others.
   
My speedometer is now reading properly.  
   
A drawback of the Hankook RA08 tires?  The spare tire
vinyl cover no longer fits.  Will need to custom make
a vinyl tire cover.  LOL.
