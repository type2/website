if you want the maximum reliability and power then it is almost mandatory
that you put the fuel injection system back into the engine.  Carbs may
look nice but you can believe that VW didn't go to fuel injection because
it was easier or cheaper, but because it was what got the most out of that
engine.  also better MPG too.
