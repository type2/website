AFAIK those are all VW of Mexico new crate
motors. Most vendors have them.  They are sitting
on the floor at BAP here in Tucson and Phoenix. 
Love being able to walk in and buy an engine and
walk out with it.  The prices have been rising
lately.  I've heard nothing but good things about
these engines except for a few guys building very
high power engines who muse about the propriety
of the crank being cast rather than forged.
