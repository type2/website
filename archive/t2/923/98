Subject: holidays, wish lists

Hey guys:  I LOVE this list.

Do any of the online vendors have a wish list or registry feature? My family 
wants to get 'involved' in the resto (without getting dirty hands and such - 
LOL), and purchase parts for holiday gifts - but they want to make sure I 
get the right parts. Neat idea.

Stephanie
