It didn't make it run any better because by that time I had screwed with 
everything else and had my spark plug firing order messed up pretty bad, I 
do not have any noticable vacuum leaks now, no whistling, everything back

It was unplugged because it popped off from the way that I stuttered it when 
I started it, it wasn't unplugged on purpose.

Thanks
