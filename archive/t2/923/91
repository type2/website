Hi Tony,

Ugh... We did the slider track on "Franklin", dad's 75 westy a couple  
years ago. We used replacement parts from CIP. They worked OK, but  
weren't even close to the original construction. Fitting them in was  
a huge PITA.

If I was doing another I'd buy a recycled OG part from Ronny or  
Bustedbus.

Just my $.02.. Be sure to look at pics of the part you're buying  
before you send the $$$.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
