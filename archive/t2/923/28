What else would you expect from Click & Clack?

Gotta give them props though...the first time I drove a Boss '69  
Mustang in wet weather scared the living daylights out of me. And  
that was just in 1st.

But what a looker the fastback was. Awesome design, and you could  
work on those beasts and make them much better than stock, of course.

But under the heading "Things that go boom" I would put the Pinto at  
the top of the list.
