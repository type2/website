Subject: Dead Engine; Need Options

Last winter when the crankshaft broke on my rebuilt (not known how many 
times) engine, I opted for a new 1600cc engine (Meximotor - available 
from many of our online vendors).  It has proved satisfactory, although 
it is lacking in power.  I assume it is because it is built with a 
lower compression ratio to accommodate cheap (poor quality) fuel that 
is probably the norm in Mexico.  This could be a boost to longevity - 
only time will tell.

All one has to do is pull the kaput engine, take off all the 
peripherals, then put them all on the longblock engine.  In the best 
case scenario, this can all be done in one weekend.

Buy a new clutch (and TO bearing), new dual port manifold boots and 
gaskets (2 each) , new exhaust gaskets (four total), new exhaust 
installation kit, new fuel pump gaskets, and new breather gaskets and 
plate.  You made need other seals and or pieces/parts for your fan 
shroud

Be advised that the new engine uses different spark plugs (NGK), which 
are gapped differently from the Bosch plugs, and usually have to be 
special ordered from your FLAPS.

Also the valve adjustment nuts are 15mm instead of 13mm.

Also, the block has to be drilled and tapped for the thermostat bellows 
mounting bracket (if you still have one).
