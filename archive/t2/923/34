Hi Bob,

VW 's goal with FI in North America was improved emissions. In markets
without emissions standards (Europe & Austrailia) they continued to
offer dual-carbs, and FI was optional. Heck, they even continued to
offer a single-carb'ed 1600 well into the Vanagon era.

I found my dual-carbed 2L to be very drivable... I switched to FI
partly for better gas milage but also for better cold-weather
performance and because the carbs I had were well over 30 years old. A
new set of dual-carbs should not be passed by out of hand,  esp as the
73 bus in question is not set up fo FI. It's not impossible to go back
to FI (I should know, I've done it), but if you have a set of new
dual-carbs in hand, it's a lot harder to justify.

If you're going to FI from scratch, it's worth considering MegaSquirt.

Happy Trails,

Greg
