Subject: [T2] Pics of the dangers of a front mounted spare

No offense, guys, but this topic is getting to be a morbid. My bus is my 
daily driver, and my one-year old rides in it along with me. Getting the 
willies before I drove the bus this weekend wasn't cool.

Just try to keep in mind: your bus, like you, are rare and endangered 
species. Take the compleat idiot's guide's advice, and drive like you're 
strapped to the front of it in some sort of Mayan sacrifice ritual. So far, 
that way of driving has kept me out of trouble - even on the freeways here 
in L.A.! Let's hope I didn't just jinx my luck!

IMHO: We're way better off in most minor collisions than the rubbermaid 
disposable cars manufactured today - front mounted spare tire or not.

P.S. - my spare is front mounted. It came to me that way. I'm leaving it on 
there to: 1. keep me from getting too over-confident when trying to park in 
the parking garage, and 2. because my best friend (fire-fighter) says he 
feels better that I left it on.
