Subject: Fwd: [T2] Header Wrap

Kevin: I read the ads from the heater-wrap vendors and liked the 
concept. I wrapped both a 1600 and a 1776. Then I began to read 
comments from users who had been there and done that. Rusting due to 
moisture trapped underneath the wrap is a real problem. I unwrapped 
both my engines and saw only traces of rust, but that was after only 
several months of being wrapped.
