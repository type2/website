Right tools for the job...

3/4 inch slide bar, 36mm 3/4 drive socket, 3' pipe to go over the slide
bar.  You'll buy them once and they'll last a lifetime.

Chock all wheels securely.  Put someone in the driver's seat, have them
step on the brakes.

Put the socket/breaker bar/cheater on the nut, pointing to the left.

Stand on the cheater, bounce if needed.

It should come loose.
