Subject: RE: stuck locks

In a pinch if one doesn't have a "slim jim", then one can pry the upper 
corner of the door out far enough to slip a coat hangar loop down and 
pull up the lock knob.  I once used this along with a "cat's paw" 
crowbar from Sears with cloth looped over the pry..  After seeing how 
easy this was, I often take out the lock knobs of the front doors- in a 
camper, it is too easy to pry up a jalousie and reach the front knob by 
hand.
