<Really want to unlock the bus to look inside, to see what I have.> 

FWIW You could slim jim the doors. I have not tried the bus but on my Beetle it was VERY easy to do with a long kitchen knife. I locked us out of my Beetle once in a tiny Italian town during siesta hours in '93. Asked a nice signora if she would loan me a big knife. She pointed at her restaurant with a smile (closed for business but left unlocked) and told me to help myself. In I went looking for the kitchen and then for a knife. Took 3 seconds to open the door.  

You slide it down inside the door along the rear of the glass. Watch the lock button as you push downward. What you are trying to push on is the back of the lock (lever that the key moves) or lift the lever on the door latch mechanism that the door lock lever moves (requires a hook not a knife) or the lock button moves. I had to push downward gently to move the inside lock button up. Make the button wiggle to prove to yourself you are in the right place before you give it a harder push. This was on a '72 Italian spec Super Beetle. 

Since this is the summer of Star Wars I'll throw this in: the small town (town of maybe a hundred people) was called Caserta Vecchia (old Caserta). It was located on a hilltop and over looked the Caserta Palace where Star Wars II was filmed... Neat place and the gardens were beautiful. I lived an hour or so away closer to Naples.
