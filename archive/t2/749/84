Subject: Re: [T2] Glove Box Mounting

On my '78 there is a metal band that connects the lower tab to the upper screw. Keeps the glove box from sliding in too far forward and from drooping. Like the glove box on my modern cars better (all plastic, no card board) but I like the bus size better... <grin!>
