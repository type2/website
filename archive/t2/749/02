I neglected to mention that this dealer has all 3 parts in stock:

      SONNEN MOTORCARS INC
      SAN RAFAEL,CA            

800-660-6521

You can probably order them from your local dealer.

According to ETKA, here are the part numbers for the seals in that area.
And the early Vanagon trans uses the same seal rings as the late bay trans.
Here is a pic of the trans pieces:

45 is a sealing washer  010 323 487C     61.4mm
