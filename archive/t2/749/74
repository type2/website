Subject: 82 vanagon timing indicator

Ok    I bought the Oregon Westy.  Drove it 988 carefree  miles (ok  a few 
turn indicator bulbs and a stop light and a half quart of  oil)  Got to Carlsbad 
CA (30 miles up the coast from San Diego)  Had  it tuned to specs   timing set 
at 7.5 degrees Back of TDC.    Go to smog and they tell me that there is no 
Timing Indicator.   I go  back to VW Paradise and he tells me that half of the 
air cooled he tunes do not  have the indicator so he chalks it...but the SMOG 
Station says NO CHALK....Can  anyone loan me an indicator to use for smog and 
I will fed ex you a prepaid fed  ex envelope with $25 bucks to buy or 10 bucks 
to rent.  It has two threaded  screws that I would need ......Help   camping 
reservations for the  week of the 4th  of July and I have some tweaking of the 
inside panels  too...btw   I need the back inside panel...I have two sliding 
door  panels provided by the previous owner so if anyone wants one  they are  
brown   I will trade one of them.
