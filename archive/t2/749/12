Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] deck height

I have a static CR Calculator on our own site, what I'm referring to is a
dynamic CR calculator. I have seen them, just never used them. They
typically require cam opening and closing specs, and rod ratio, and they
spew out a #, where 200 is the limit on pump gas if I'm not mistaken.

I found that on one engine I built, I tightened the deck and didn't get
piston/head contact until I was at .028" (at 8300 RPM). I backed it out to
.030" and left it there. Like you say, every engine is different. But
absolute " you can't run decks tighter then .050" or it will smack" are
rubbish.
