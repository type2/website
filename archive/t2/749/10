Subject: VPC Air Conditioner for Station Wagon

I have recently acquired an NOS VPC Air Conditioner with part number ZVW
203-270. It came complete with the original boxes except for the
installation manual. Anyone familiar with this A/C model? It's an overhead
type unit. According to the vendor, it was designed for the early bay
windows (68-71) and this particular model I got was meant for a single port
head
engine. I want to know if this model will work perfectly with the stock
generator.

 By any chance, does anybody have a copy of the manual? I was told that the
A/C was made for VW dealers and apparently they had the instructions. I read
in one of that archived threads from June 2002 that a certain "Dave C.
Bolen" used to work for VPC and has a buddy who was "THE" engineer for that
project. I'm a fairly new member and not sure if Mr. Bolen is still active
in this list.

What's the M-code for an A/C option? Or is it true that there is no such
thing as a "factory-installed" A/C and that only the dealers provided them
as an option? The reason why I am asking is I want to be consistent with the
period of my 1969 Kombi. And that I install only authorized equipments and
options available for that year. Will appreciate any input on the subject.


Cheers,
Sherwin
