Subject: Leaky Valve Covers

Hey,

I just got my new 69 on the road and she runs great!  Worlds better than my 
71 ever did.  However, I can not seem to get the valve cover from leaking.  

I have tried the old cork style, and the rubber rubber ones (twice) and they 
still leaking.  I have threatened to weld them in place (kidding) . Any 
suggestions?
