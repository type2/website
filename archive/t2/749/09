Subject: 72' Gauge Cluster gone, heads still available though

A listee is going to pick up the gauge cluster I am giving away, but the heads are still available if anyone wants them. They are 1700 cc AFAIK. Part number on prior post. I really dont want to throw them away so hopefully someone has use. 
 
Thanks
