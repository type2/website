Jen,

Is your beam rusted through?

The steering gear box changed after 1972.
The stripped beam is the same '71-'79
The trailing arms tie rods, swing lever and drag link are all the same.

It sound like you intend to swap out the entire beam complete.

I would prepare yourself with a few ideas before start into this.

This is a list of "do it right the first time, when you have it out". You 
can just swap it out and drive it, I just wouldn't recommend it.
The ball joints on the trailing arm should be replace with new ones at this 
point ( not just any shop can do this in fact most vw shops cannot)
All tie rods should be new as well.
The spindles are different on later models as well as the brakes '71-'72 are 
the same then '73 and later changed. everything together might be swappable
Flexible brake lines should be replaced new.
The swing lever pivot and bushing should be replaced with new.
Shocks ??
Brakes, bled at least, rotors turned???
Dropping a beam is not a trivial task it has a lot of parts that pass 
through the upper and lower beam.
All of it however is doable (in your drive way) except the trailing arm ball 
joints of course.

We have provided all of the parts to customers and done this work here in 
our shop.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions along the way.

Good luck and have fun. Keeping that in mind is the best tool in your shed, 
yet often misplaced somewhere along the way.

That comes from way to much personal experience with this sort of stuff.
