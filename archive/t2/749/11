Here is a compression ratio calculator. It seems to give me the results to
match other sources.

Just my thoughts; After 40 years of racing I've learned many tricks and one
trick is in an attempt to make the motors last a long time you have to
remember that each motor has it's own characteristics.

A VW rod might not stretch as much as a small block Chevy rod, a Chrysler
Hemi piston might expand more than a Chevy so all in all if you're building
a VW you need to stick with known VW experiences on CRs and deck height.

We seldom hear from Dirt Rat Desert racers on the Type II or Vanagon list
but they're the pros that know how much is too much and how far you can go
with a VW and still live.
