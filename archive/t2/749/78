Subject: How to make a 72 rear bumper fit a 71?

Howdy,

To make a long story short I was sold what was suppose to be a 68-71 rear 
bumper.
Since I am in the process of restoring my bus when I received it I 
immediatly stripped it and straightened it and painted it and it came out 
looking pretty good.

Well tonight I put on the brackets and when I went to mount it up and to my 
disbelief they were approxamatly 3 1/2 inches too wide.
As it looked the same as my old bumper just less beat up I had no idea what 
was the problem.
So I went inside and did some searching and low and behold it appears as if 
I have gotten the 72 one year only rear bumper.
Its identical in appearence but the holes are located in different places.

Can't weld or redrill this thing unless I want to repaint it which I really 
don't as it looks pretty good right now and I'm also about at the bottom of 
the paint can.

Has anybody had any experience making a 72 fit earlier years?
If so what did you do other than drilling new holes which I would have done 
had I known before I painted this thing?

Any ideas would be appreciated.

Thanks
Kevin
