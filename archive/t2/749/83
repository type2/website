Subject: Glove Box Mounting 

Hello,

I bought a new plastic Glove Box from EMPI and I am trying to figure out how
to mount it.  I don't have any of the original mounting hardware so I am not
sure of how the original GB was mounted.

In terms of support, there is a bottom bracket attached to the dash that
seems like it would provide the only means of support on the bottom of the
BG, but there is no mounting hole or place for a screw or bolt attachment.

On the top of the GB frame (on the body), there is a similar but lighter
weight tab that does have a bolt or screw hole for attachment to the GB
itself.  Other than these two attachments, I don't see any other way of
further securing the GB.

Is there hardware that I am missing or is the GB simply held in place by the
upper and lower center mounts?

Thanks for any insight or pics!
