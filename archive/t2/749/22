Subject: Wood Headliners

I have a 69 westy with a wood headliner. Before anyone asks, I searched the
archives all morning and couldn't find what I was looking for.

Anyway. The original headliner was removed and an attempt to put in a new
one, was done before I bought the bus. Whoever did it, didn't use
the right type of wood and didn't cut it correctly. It looks pretty bad.

This morning I found lots of threads about wood headliners, mostly
pertaining to refinishing them, or how to cut them without chipping them to
badly,
or the right type of wood to use is Baltic Birch 3mm Plywood in 5x5 sheets,
which is European.

but because I have virtually nothing to go by and don't want to guess, I'm
looking for a template, or exact measurement with radius dimensions and
all that. If i'm going to buy imported or special order plywood, I want to
do the job right the first time.

Any help is much appreciated.

Thanks
