Subject: RE: [T2] Leaky Valve Covers

Just thought I'd add a little related info here,
A trick I use to good effect to remove/install valve covers is to thread a 
piece of strong rag (or small rope would suffice). Grab both ends and give 
it a good sharp tug down at 45deg to the head. This is usually enough to 
remove the clip without the need of a bar or screw driver. Installing use it 
again to get the clip almost on, but you may still need a bar to do the 
final bit.
Regards,
Richard
