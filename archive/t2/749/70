Subject: vanagon 83 fuel tank for free, I am in CA

Hi guys ,
I am giving away my  fuel tank for a vanagon for free, the  body  shape 
is like new.
the only problem is that it a little bit rusty inside , because that was 
my first fuel tank and I used water trying to find a gas leak ( I 
assumed that the fuel tank was somehow rusty proof)
Anyway , the leak was because a grommet was missing ..... So if anyone 
want to clean inside , its a great fuel tank.
I am located next to SF, CA, I also have the filler neck ....


vanagon 83, ca
