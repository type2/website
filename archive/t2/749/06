There is too much parameters which can influence the interpretation from a
compression test to a compression ratio value.

Valves/rings condition, temperature, atmospheric pressure, rotating speed
while doing the test (some people even run the engine on all cylinders but
the one tested, cam duration, etc.

Compression ratio is a mathematical value and does not take into account any
dynamic parameter.  To have the proper values for calculations, engine has
to be dismantled.  Even there, measurements can be a little difficult: head
cc, piston dish cc, etc.  Some practice is required.

We have also to remember that CR value is important but an even CR between
the cylinders is more important in such good setting for a cylinder is also
good for the three others.

Hi John,

Is there a way to determine the compression ratio of an engine without
dismantling it to take measurements. i.e. can a compression reading (in psi)
be converted to CR?

Thanks,
Bill Moon
