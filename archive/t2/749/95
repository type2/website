Subject: Timing Scale found for 82

Three days in the shop and I was looking at my engine this morning and the  
cubby hole on the drivers side has the spare fan belt and I remember seeing 
some  other object in there when I started my trip from Oregon back to 
Carlsbad...you  guessed it, duh!  The timing scale was just laying there upside down  
and hidden.  Thank you for all the replies and help including my local  friend 
VW Tech Bob, (offered to loan me one off his '80 Westy,who has the  reputation 
as the best Air Cooled man in and around the Encinitas North County  area of 
San Diego.
Chuck
