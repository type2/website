While you are there, also get a can of carb cleaner. This stuff is made it
dissolve crud. While it has absolutely not lubricating properties is may
help to dissolve some of the hardened grease in there.

On another note: have you tried the rear hatch lock? They often fail in a
way that you can turn the lock thing without a key inserted. Maybe you can
get in this way or you could force the lock to fail this way by using a pair
of vise grips ...
