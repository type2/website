Subject: [T2] Adding gages -spelling

I can't stand it anymore. Today is Friday so I must comment. Gages is not spelled Gauges. I apologize but the english professor in my brain died a bit each time I saw that. Is gages how they spell it overseas?

	Steve Goodmanson:  You will need to double-up on that
	wire.  To do this properly, you will want to measure
	the current from the Alternator, and you will need a
	cable which goes to the cab, and another which comes
	from the cab.
	  
	Don`t attempt to measure the current for the Battery.
	During start-up, it achieves a couple of hundred amps.
	 Automotive Ammeters don't go that high.  Your wiring
	connections should be from alternator to ammeter
	in-pole, and from ammeter out-pole to starter motor.
	  
	Yes, there are short or long shunt meters.  But be
	careful of the necessary wire-lengths.  The wiring to
	the shunt is calibrated at the factory.  If you cut
	the wire(s) and splice in more wire, then the
	measurements will be off; the meter won`t read
	properly.
