Subject: Re: [T2] Adding gages

I would recommend Adam Cox, that you forget about the
Ammeter, and add another voltage gauge. 
   
Ammeter gauges, as delivered by most vendors including
VDO, require all of the vehicle current to go through
the gauge.  Bad design.  Now being an Engineer, I am
aware of current measurements using either a long
shunt, or a short shunt methods.  But cockpit gauges
instead expect 8 or 6 gauge wire feeding ALL of the
current from the alternator to the cab, and then back
again to the starter motor.  Recommend against an
Ammeter.
   
I am aware of your desire to install a 120v inverter. 
This inverter will require a separate battery.  The
reason for the 2 Voltmeter suggestion is a voltmeter
for the main battery, and a voltmeter for the aux
battery.  You would also need to wire-in a relay so
the aux voltage gauge would be disconnected when you
turn the key off.  This is not a hard thing to do.
   
When installing the aux battery, you will also likely
want to wire-in either a battery isolator, or an
additional high-current relay so the vehicle charging
system can keep the aux battery charged.
   
Now I have both Oil Pressure as well as Oil
Temperature Gauges.  But the Oil Temperature Gauge is
not yet wired-in as I haven't installed the Oil Temp
Sendor yet, which is a part of an external oil cooler
system I have not yet installed. 
   
I also have an hour meter.  Totally worthless.  Should
have installed a Cylinder Head Temperature gauge
instead.
