Subject: RE: stuck locks

We have had limited success with Marvel Mystery Oil.  In most cases, though, 
we've had to disassemble, clean, and lubricate the locks.  Many times the 
stuck locks will require some spring and wafer replacements.  We've had a 
few that couldn't be saved, as they were so corroded we couldn't even get 
them apart.
