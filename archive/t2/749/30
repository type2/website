it's also heavy as all get out....make sure you have a GOOD jack for it.

I bought a beam from Joe couple years back, had him press in the ball
joints and ship the mess half way cross the country.  it was as he said
not a trivial job, but it also was not difficult just a lot of steps and
working with some BIG pieces....

 read up on it, get some long breaker bars (5 ft piece of pipe) at a
minimum two jacks and two jack stands. 4 of each is better.  don't need a
lot of different tools but you will need some time with each  joint, heck
start hitting the nuts now with PB-Blaster or equivalent...

yes Joe is a well spring of good information, also get your parts from him
now before he gets a "Real" job.
