Subject: FREE 69 bus metal and glass. located in Oregon, no shipping.

i'm cutting up a 69 bus, and would like to give away what metal and glass
there is left rather than tossing it. no shipping available on this, must be
picked up. i've given first rights to someone who's coming on sunday for a few
parts for his bus, but after that everything left is free for the taking. most
small parts, suspension, and trans will be kept to sell off at swaps, this is
for the most part, just metal and glass.
