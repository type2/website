Subject: Re: [T2] Leaky Valve Covers

Always used to put Permatex or 3M weather-strip cement on the valve cover 
gasket surface. Recently I bought a new set of valve covers from Cip1 
because the were so cheap and saved cleaning and painting my old covers. I 
was surprised to find that the new covers came with a small tab/bump at the 
inside top of the cover. This "bump" keeps the gasket from dropping down - a 
problem with the bumpless covers. Because of the bump I decided I might not 
need gasket compound to keep the gasket in place. I installed the cork 
gaskets w/o glue and so far no leaks.

 I just got my new 69 on the road and she runs great!  Worlds better than my
 71 ever did.  However, I can not seem to get the valve cover from leaking.

 I have tried the old cork style, and the rubber rubber ones (twice) and 
they
 still leaking.  I have threatened to weld them in place (kidding) . Any
 suggestions?
