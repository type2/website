Subject: Re: [T2] Leaky Valve Covers

oh man leaky valve covers... i drove all day and night leaking oil from
one of mine and fried a 2000 mile perfectly balanced engine i had built.
had to rebuild last month in a driveway with two rods from who knows, a
welded up crank -- uh man, at least i made it across country. sh!t
happened :)

now that i'm here i kinda wish i wasn't. my hometown has become the new
east coast monte carlo and nobody will get there hands outta their pockets
for under $50 - my 69 popped its hinge on the decklid and i'm wondering
how do people remove the shrapnel without burning off the paint etc. all
the machinists have scattered too. or, does anybody have a good hinge to
sell and send?   - steve
