Steve Goodmanson:  You will need to double-up on that
wire.  To do this properly, you will want to measure
the current from the Alternator, and you will need a
cable which goes to the cab, and another which comes
from the cab.
   
Don`t attempt to measure the current for the Battery. 
During start-up, it achieves a couple of hundred amps.
 Automotive Ammeters don't go that high.  Your wiring
connections should be from alternator to ammeter
in-pole, and from ammeter out-pole to starter motor.
   
Yes, there are short or long shunt meters.  But be
careful of the necessary wire-lengths.  The wiring to
the shunt is calibrated at the factory.  If you cut
the wire(s) and splice in more wire, then the
measurements will be off; the meter won`t read
properly.
