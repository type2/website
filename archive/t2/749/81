I'm just considering adding an ammeter myself having overcome the advice 
to the contrary. My thoughts are this.  I agree it is less than ideal 
running another large cable to the cab. However, I am intending to use 
my ammeter to measure how much current the battery is delivering to the 
system/how much charging current is being used. With stock wiring, once 
your engine is running, the current for your electrics is all coming 
from your dynamo/alternator anyway,(from regulator to battery + to 
starter to fuse box). I am not intending to tamper with this much. I 
plan to run 7.5mm2 cable (a bit bigger than the normal 6mm2 already 
there) from regulator to fuse box, and use the existing cable to pass 
current back to the battery (via my ammeter). Obviously I will be 
removing the existing regulator to battery connection. Intellectually I 
like this idea because each wire has one function now, although I 
concede it uses more copper.

If all goes well I should see current flowing from the battery if the 
engine is still (running the radio and any lights etc I have been 
foolish enough to leave on), then current flowing back while the energy 
discharged in starting is replaced, and then hopefully no current at 
all. So, most of the time the ammeter (and the 32 year old cable) will 
have little or no current flowing through them, and only my new (higher 
spec) cable will be carrying any serious load.

I'm open to criticism!
