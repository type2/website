What is probably happening inside the locks is that the grease has gotten
so hard that the wafers are sticking in the "pushed in" position.  Get
enough solvent in there and they will probably work to get the door open.
then you will have to disassemble the locks and clean them out properly.

This is one place where WD-40 might be the "lubricant" of choice, as it is
mostly solvent!
