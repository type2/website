I was wondering about that, so I read up on it. Manganese phosphate

bluing. Not sure if the strength is adequate for lifters, unless it is
to preserve non-wear areas.

A stop-gap measure at best considering that the supply of used parts
is not endless. Why do I feel like I'm in some kind of Indiana Jones
movie finding technologies of long-lost civilizations that can no
longer be duplicated?
