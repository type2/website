the throttle is not stuck open?

the idle screw is not cranked all the way down?
did you set the carb to some initial settings? i dont know what carb or
engine you have.

 how about the throttle positioner? is it flipped around backward? that could do it.

just in case as to not be confusing...
the throttle positioner is that little flipper and step assy on the left
side of the choke butterfly shaft. the throttle lever rests on it.

good luck
