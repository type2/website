This is a question for the mechanics on the list...

On page 7 of Bentely's electrical section there's a photo of a vintage
voltmeter used to measure the voltage of each battery cell. I see this style
of meter is still sold but I'm wondering how useful it really was. Does
anyone remember using one?
