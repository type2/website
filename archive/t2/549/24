I did a clutch job on my Scirocco and got CV grease on the bolts 
(hindsight 20/20).

I drove for a number of days and coming home from work I put it in gear 
only to have it redline when I let the clutch out;

- All but one bolt had backed out, the last one was spinning with the 
axle, but the wheel wasn't.

(That poor transaxle.)

Anywho I went home to the 'spare car' and pulled some fasteners off it 
and retrieved my car from the handy parking garage I had been able to 
coast into.

I found a sheared off bolt in the flange, but it backed out by hand.

Now, In addition to the blue locktite I degrease the thread holes right 
before I reassemble.

btw, your a brave man to be so truthful in public.  ;P
