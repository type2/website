Subject: 68 beetle ...parting out...

I'm parting out my 68 bug...floor pans are completely gone ...I decided to 
part her out...if anyone needs a part please write me ...make an offer ...that 
will be easier then listing everything...I'm keeping the motor...[needs to be 
rebuild] ...tranny...and rear end...but if someone needs any of the 3 I'm sure 
we could work something out...thanks 
Jim~
