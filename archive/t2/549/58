I agree with Adam P but would add that is important not only to match the
lifters to the cam but in their original position as well. Build a rack by
drilling eight holes in a block of wood and label the holes by cylinder
and intake or exhaust.

As you pull and inspect the lifters look for the dome that is supposed to
be on them.  Take a straight edge and lay it across the face.  If they are
flat then they should be replaced.

                             OOK!
