dave,

i would suggest modifying the bushings, not the shift rod. this can be done
with a dremmel tool or sharp knife, it is a finicky job, but do-able.

it is not likely that you will find NOS bushings, so doing as you suggest
will not likely have any long-term repercussions, but it still makes me feel
a whole lot better making the the ill-fitting part FIT THE BUS, rather than
making the bus FIT THE ILL-FITTING PART.

by the way, when i last did this job, i tossed the aftermarket bushings in
frustration, they were absolute crap in every way - poorly molded, badly
fitting etc. luckily the ones i took out were fine to re-use.
