Subject: Re: [T2] why drive a bus?

To make Dune Buggers jealous of my Tranny!

Actually I aquired this bus in Oct. Nov. 2003 and it has been sitting with 
little attention. Why drive a bus? Because I can't let another one slip 
through my fingers without driving it. The past FOUR Aircooled VW's I have 
owned I have not driven. I still have two and plan to make good with the 
Aircooled Spirits of the Universe and drive them.

TravelOn,
