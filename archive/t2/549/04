Subject: Why I drive a bus/Useful load question

I drive a Bus because it's utilitarian, I can repair it easily and fairly cheaply myself, and because it's different than all the supposedly ultra-reliable sedans that all seem to look the same.  I don't drive my Bus every day, but it is also fun because it's so simple.  No power windows, fancy radio, power mirrors, seat warmers, power sliding doors or any of that other stuff that breaks and costs a fortune to fix.  Last weekend I hauled a bunch of old rotten deck boards to the dump and picked up a load of topsoil on the way home.  Bet you can't do that in a Camry/Accord/etc...  Which leads me to my next question:

How does 35+ years age affect the load carrying capacity of a Bus?  I hauled about 1/2 cubuic yard of topsoil, which I estimated at about 1300-1400 lbs (very rough numbers: 1/2 of 27 cu ft at around 100 lb/cu ft).  I had all the seats out and my Bus is a '68 7-passenger model.  My Bus looked like it was sitting about 3-4 inches lower than empty, and it certainly drove like it was quite heavy, but it was not bottoming out or having any other driveability issues.  From my research, the original rating of the vehicle was about 2000 lbs useful load, so I felt reasonably safe that I didn't overload it.  Does anyone out there have more information on how the suspension (I'm pretty sure mine is the original; front beam has no major rust or other problems I can detect) deteriorates over time and maybe some guesses at safe limits as time passes?


Thanks!
