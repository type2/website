Subject: 1700 Or 1800?

Hey Folks,
   I'm replacing the pistons and cylinders on my '72's engine, a 1700. I've
already got a new set of 1700 heads as well. Placed an order a couple of days
ago with Bus Depot for the P & C's, and they called back saying 1700 P & C's
are NLA, but I could go with 1800 P & C's. I was all set to do this, but Bus
Depot called back today saying they found a set of 1700 P & C's. How much
difference is there in performance from a 1700 to an 1800? Going with the
1800's will mean getting the heads flycut, and I'm not even sure who to take
them to here in N. Virginia to get that done-anyone know of a good machine
shop in the N. Virginia./ D.C. area? What would it cost to have the heads
flycut? The cost between the 1700 & 1800 P & C's is negligible. Thanks for any
advice   Jeff
