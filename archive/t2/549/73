Subject: Anybody going to Bug Meet 13 this Sunday?

      I was thinking if people had one or two items that they wanted to sell 
and didn't want to pay the swapper fee just for that, we could set up a 
couple of parking lot deals.  Maybe just hang out for a bit.  We'll be 
taking my girlfriends rodeo since there might be thunderstorms and my 
sunroof still leaks like a sieve :-(
     For those who may care but not know:

Bug Meet 13
Beaver Springs Dragway - Beaver Springs, PS
Sunday, May 2nd
INFO: 570-754-7209

     It's an okay even, mostly bugs, but aren't they all?
