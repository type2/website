Subject: She got the house, I got the Bus (was much longer head)

When I went through my divorce, I had the PO hold Liesl for me until 
all the papers were signed.

The Benz was a minor problem, but she got a nice new PT Cruiser and 
let me have that.  3 years down all is good for us both!  And I got 
the BUS!!!  Can't go to Burning Man in a PT!!! <g>
