Vacuum leaks.
Timing.
Throttle return spring.
The intake pipe at the top of the left carb. If it's missing its hose, put a 
rubber cap on it with a 1/8" hole in it.
Lubricate all the carb linkage.
Adjust chokes.
Adjust mixture.
(Captain Obvious) Adjust idle.

All of these things can cause your high idle, and were issues with my 73 
with dual carbs. I was able to get things under control by fixing all of the 
above.
