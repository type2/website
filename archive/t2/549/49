You can run 195s, though 185s are the preferred size

Stock is 185R14.  Since there is no section ratio, it defaults to 80 or
82.  You can run a load range C in this size.

A 195/75R14 is a bit smaller in diameter, and has less load capacity for a
given load range.  You need to use load range D in this size.

There are a few 195R14 size tires around.  They seem to be a good fit for
a bus, a little taller than stock and therefore closer to the size of the
original bias ply tires.
