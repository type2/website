Yep, I remember them well. They are actually a load
tester. Back when batteries had exposed lead straps
connecting the cells the tester could be pushed onto
the straps which would impose a load while measuring
the resulting voltage for that one cell under load.
There used to be battery rebuilding shops that would
replace just the bad cell.
