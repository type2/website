Subject: Re: [T2] what causes this???

It is more complicated than just switching heat exchangers, that is if you
want heat.

The heat exchangers for the square and oval ports hook up to the heat pipes
differently on the pulley end of the motor.

There are a lot of things that cause what happened to yours.   Most likely
improper rocker arm geometry.or the bus ran really hot and weakened the
seat.  No telling for sure just do it once and do it right!!
