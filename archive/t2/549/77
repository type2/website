Subject: 2.0 FI Hydraulic Camshaft upgrade

Hello all, I am now deep inside my engine and discovered a few surprises.  The camshaft lobes are scored and the bearings were quite pitted and worn, but inconsistently. The crank bearings were also badly worn, but again, inconsistently.  This probably means the previous rebuilder (not on my watch) did a few stupid things.

Anyhow, I thought since I will need a new or at least reground cam and lifters that I would take the opportunity to get something to mildly improve the breathing of the engine.  Webcamshafts.com have one which they describe as "Good overall power for engines with stock fuel-injection. Designed for hydraulic lifter".  I will need their lifter set with it as well.   Also CIP sells a few cam upgrades like a "TORQUE SPECIAL HYDRAULIC CAMSHAFT" and also a kit with lifters/pushrods/gear.

Does anyone have experience with these?

Thanks,

GG
