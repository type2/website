If it makes you feel any better I towed my Corvair powered Westy home from the grandparents' garage (3 streets over) and b/c I only had two axle bolts installed, and b/c my dearest wife (2 hours sleep in 2 days) left it in 1st when she thought it was in neutral... well we sheared a CV joint bolt and make have ruined the other hole. 

Feel better? Luckily the damage is only to the Corvair adapter. Unfortunately the Clark's Corvair kit is N/A again...

Hope I didn't ruin the threads...
