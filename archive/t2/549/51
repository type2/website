Do you know about the hot springs along Rt 12 out of Missoula (beyond
Lolo)?...I bicycled across country in 1984 and really enjoyed camping
there. .Followed the Lochsa river towards Kooskia; they were on the left
side.  Really cool views of the evergreens along the river; reminds me
of Kyoto Japan.    In 95 we followed that route in our 78 Westy camper
and found the same hot springs.
