Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust System - Oregon Emission Laws

Don't worry about anything. I just took my '78 through and passed with no
problem. I am running an extractor system also. As someone already said,
anything newer than '75 must pass DEQ and they only test for emission
standards on older vehicles. No dyno test. This one had me worried, I didn't
want some VW ignorant slamming through the gears not knowing where they
were. The guy that tested mine didn't even look in the engine bay or ask
about original equipment. He just put the wand in the exhaust, took a
reading of emissions at idle and then at 2500rpm and was done. Make sure
that your bus is in good tune and not putting out an oil slick behind it and
you should be good to go.
