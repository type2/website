"Sorry for the moment but it was mine."

James,
Although this is not helping the Listee that is looking for the auto tranny, 
I agree. I used to know a guy who had a bunch of Buses with no tranny for 
the very same reason. Yes he had a lot of Buggie friends. I second your 
"Ick". Can't they build those with Honda Trannies?

TravelOn,

Michael Knight
