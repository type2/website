Subject: Exhaust System - Oregon Emission Laws

Hello all.

Let me preface my post by saying that I currently live in Louisiana (where
we have no emissions testing), but I will be relocating to Portland, OR
sometime in July.

I'm planning on replacing the exhaust system (muffler only not heater boxes
etc.) on my '76 Westy -- the current setup is a one-piece extractor(?) type
system that bolts directly to the heat exchangers.  My intent is to replace
with a similar system for now to save some $$$, but I assume that this will
not fly in Oregon because I'm lacking catalytic converter, etc.?

Can anyone shed some light on emission testing in the Portland area.
Should I be planning on saving $$$ so that I can switch to '72-'74 heat
exchangers and install an exhaust system, which includes emission
equipment?  Or is my Westy old enough to be exempt from emissions testing?

Thanks for any insight.
Chris.
