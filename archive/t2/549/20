Subject: RE: [T2] why drive a bus?

Besides all the already-stated very good reasons why driving a bus is fun
and satisfying, there's a darker side to it as well.  So what is this dark
side of bus enjoyment?  Well, let me tell you...

Ever been in a small passenger car waiting to make a right turn onto a busy
street and a pickup or SUV pulls up beside you to make a left onto the same
street?  Ever noticed how 90% of them pull ALL the way up making it
impossible for you to see anything past their massive front-ends?  So you
end up having to sit there until  the (-at-)##hole goes.  In a bus you can make
the pickups and SUVs pay.  You can do the same thing to them that they do to
small passenger cars!

Now I don't want to hear from any of you safety zealots jumping my case
about this.  I've been driving for 25 years and consider myself a very
attentive and courteous driver.  And I know that doing unto others as they
do unto you doesn't mean I should make other folk's life difficult just
because they're that way themselves.  All I'm saying is it's satifying do
this every once in a while.  And besides, maybe it'll make them realize what
they're doing to people driving smaller cars.
