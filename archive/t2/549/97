Subject: RE: [T2] Thinking of XM satellite radio.

I do not have the sat radio, but I have friends that have it and really like
it. I am looking into it myself for my house and my TrailBlazer. I am thinking
about going with Sirrus (sp?) instead of XM because they are carrying all of
the NFL games this fall and XM is not.
