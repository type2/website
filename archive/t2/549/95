Subject: Hydraulic Lifter Bore Question

TGIF!
I split the case of a '79 Hydraulic Short Block last weekend. As I was 
cleaning the Case halves I noticed ridges in the Lifter Bores. I have never 
noticed these before in any of the Type I cases that I have had dealings 
with. Does anybody know if this is common? Will these have to be reemed? 
Does this mean that the case is junk. I will be splitting another one this 
weekend ('78) and I hope to not see these there(fingers crossed).

TravelOn,
