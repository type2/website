Subject: what causes this???

I just pulled one of my heads (from my 2L type 3 motor, not my shoulders)
and found the intake (the big one)

Valve had been pulled INTO the head..so no damage to any thing but the
head..

What the heck would cause this?????

The "air cooled/ dune buggy" store in town told me it may not be fixable???
Is this true???

Should I pull the head on the other side and look for damage???

I have acquired a set of SQUARE port heads (mine are oval port) booth seem
good would it be cheaper (if my head is toast) to put on the square port
heads and find new heat exchangers or just suck it up and get a
remanufactured oval port.

 

Thanx
