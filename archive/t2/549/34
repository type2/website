Subject: Getting to speedo/gas gauge lamps

How do you get to the two lamps that illuminate the speedo and the gas 
gauge? My 71 has a speedo in the middle, and a gas gauge to its left. 
The gas gauge also has the oil, gen and turn indicators in it.

Both of these instruments are housed in one large sealed metal can with 
a bunch of wire terminals and other connections on the rear. Disassembly 
does not look trivial, though I may be wrong about that and can plunge 
ahead if it is easier than it looks.

The problem is the instrument lamps that illuminate the gauges are 
pretty dim, much dimmer than the aftermarket VDO tach that is also wired 
to the same dimmer (it ain't the dimmer rheostat). I'd like to check to 
see if the bulbs in the speedo/gas gauge are the right type, and check 
the grounding, too.

How do you get to them? I tried gently pulling on the rear of the lamp 
sockets to see if they would pop out of the rear panel of the housing, 
but no-go.
