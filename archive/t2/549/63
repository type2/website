Richard,

I can't see the picture and can't find the online doc project any 
more either... but am pretty sure that I used one....

Gonna show my age here, but worked in a "full service" gas station when I 
was *much* younger.

IIRC, the picture shows a meter with a kinda squiggly thing across the 
leads and the leads are very "pointed"?

Cheers, dave
