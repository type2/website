Subject: Detonation?

Hi,

I live in Belgium and have a daily driver Transporter from 1969.
When decelerating there is some severe detonation (explosion) in the
exhaust. I already changed points and checked gap to be a little less than
0.40. Dwell angle is 480 and does not change at higher rpm. Valve clearance
is about 0.15 for in- and ex. Ignition timing is set at 7.50 before mark on
hot engine. Detonation still there. I changed condensator and vacuum advance
unit without success. Engine numer is AD 362 351.
Somebody help me?

By the way, I also liked the Bentley index!

Greets from Europe,

Bart
