Subject: Re:1700 Or 1800?

 Jeff. I rebuilt my 73 1700 using new 1700 cc cylinders and rebuilt AVP 1700
heads with no smog ports. For power, it starts, runs and can haul my family
loaded with gear for hours on end with no complaining. Never drove an 1800 so
can't say if ther's more power or not, I've heard negligible. I cruise just
under 60, maybe 57mph?
