On the subject of wider tires, remember that wider tires will require more
force to steer with the bus stationary, such as when parallel parking.

This is a particular concern for '72 and earlier buses with their fragile
worm-and-peg steering boxes.  I suspect that VW switched to the
worm-and-roller boxes in response to greater failure rates after the
switch from bias tires to radial tires.
