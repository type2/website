Spray Brake Clean is a good degreaser prior to using any Loctite
product--and dries real fast--

It does a great de- greasing job--

 
Now, In addition to the blue locktite I degrease the thread holes right
before I reassemble. 

Now there is a detail that I have ALWAYS failed to do. The degreasing
part. Thanks!
