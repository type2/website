Subject: RE: [T2] Detonation?

Hi,
Check your exhaust for leaks, especially at heat exchanger to
muffler/silencer fit.
Lean-out backfires can occur, especially on decleration in that case.

I live in Belgium and have a daily driver Transporter from 1969. When
decelerating there is some severe detonation (explosion) in the exhaust.
I already changed points and checked gap to be a little less than 0.40.
Dwell angle is 480 and does not change at higher rpm. Valve clearance is
about 0.15 for in- and ex. Ignition timing is set at 7.50 before mark on
hot engine. Detonation still there. I changed condensator and vacuum
advance unit without success. Engine numer is AD 362 351. Somebody help
me?
