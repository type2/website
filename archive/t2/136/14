Subject: Parts For Sale (-at-) Everybus

Seems like a lot of folks are bringing parts to sell, so today I looked =
through my stash, and here is what I've got:

Gauge cluster for early(?) Bay, (no EGR or CAT lights), odometer shows =
29K miles.

Rear hatch screen.

Incomplete set of mustard yellow curtains( no front curtain)and some =
curtain track pieces.

Sink pump (the kind that screws into the bottom of the water tank) plus =
the tank itself-from a '77 Westy

I'll probably come up with more stuff as search through the garage. If =
anyone is interested in the above items, let me know.
