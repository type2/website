Subject: living in an rv (no vanagon content)

This may sound a little bit ridiculous but I was trying to calculate whether 
it would be cheaper to live in an rv or an apartment over the course of a 
year.  I was being generous with all my figures and it seems that the rv 
would be more expensive so I was wondering if anyone could give me more 
specific info on how much it would cost to live in an rv for a month.  I 
would be curious to know what kind of gas mileage the vehicle gets, how much 
it would cost to maintain the range, how much insurance might cost, how much 
taking care of water/sewage might cost, and especially how much it would 
cost to run the generator that would have to maintain atleast a fridge and 
occassional uses of other appliances.  If anyone can give me further 
information on this it would be much appreciated.  Thanks a bunch guys.
