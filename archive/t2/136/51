Subject: rust

while sanding off all the layers of paint on the new
72 westy i found a spot of rust through on an unusual
spot.  it is in the back of the bus, left side right
to the left of that little piece of metal that sticks
straight out of the back of the bus where the two
panels are welded together.  it is about 3 inches high
and 1/3rd of an inch wide and goes all the way
through.  their appears to be two pieces of metal, an
inner panel and outer body panel here.  anyone else
have or had this problem and how did you fix it.  my
idea was to por-15 the inside the best i could and
then por-15 cloth the area before sanding smooth. 
sound good to ya'll?  any good ideas are welcome here
as the guy who fixed it before me thought shoving
newspaper and bondo into the area was proper and only
suceeded in making the problem worse as you can well
imagine.  also need ideas on the best way to enter the
area without tearing stuff up too much.  as with any
old vw i'm finding more problems the deeper i dig.
