Subject: hard data, and guessing games


This is a tough subject, and in no way shape or form am I a chemical
engineer, nor a physicist--I do not have a degree in mechanical
engineering, nor in metallurgy---

 I reflect upon the the principal's of seat of the pant's experience--

The Wright Bros, flew an aircraft, with no data whatsoever----It was
their own failures,and accomplishment's-- that they accomplished was
what they were there to do--fly---no wriiten data
Not so far, not too long but they did it through their seat of the pant
determination---no data, only  the input supplied from Clair Chanute,
who was experimenting with unpowered glider's---the rest was all on
their own--trial and error---

Same with Edison and the light bulb--Marconi with the radio, and a whole
broad expanse of other's in the early days of trial and error---zero
documented data---

And this is all I was attempting to convey to Tim and other's----
He is locked in to Mfg's recommendation and nothing else--according to
his prior statement's---

If it ain't recommended by the factory --It ain't right.

 So with this in mind--and he being of the air cooled mentality ( today,
I remember when he was on the Vanagon list ), straight weight oil is the
optima best for you air cooled engine, no sodium or titanium valves, and
God help you if you convert your type 2 suitcase engine to hydraulic
lifter's, because the factory didn't supply them unit's with that
set-up---

No Petonix ignition---it must be point's or bust, no platinum plugs,
because this isn't correct--and zero blue Bosch coils, it ain't factory
original----

All I'm trying to say here there are so many improvement's that can be
done to a Bus engine, including the use of Marvel, to increase the
reliability,and logevity,  of the air cooled engine waaaay beyond the
limits of the holy Bentley, or the factory issued repair manuals, that
are truly beneficial in the long run----

This is why I mention wearing blinder's in a prior message , regarding
this subject---- look beyond the stuck on stupid factory maintenance
recommendations --you'll be happier in the long run--and so will your
Bus---
