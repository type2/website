Subject: removing stickers

Hey everybody,

I just bought a mostly rough '71 camper that has a number of stickers all
over the rear.  I'd keep them if they were at all interesting and/or in
decent shape, but they're not.

Does anyone have any suggestions for removing old stickers from painted
surfaces without damaging the paint?

Thanks,
Brian
