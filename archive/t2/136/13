Subject: RE: [T2] Parts List to fix Troy's broken bus.....

CV's were looked at and given new boots and serviced about 2 years ago.
I believe they are 6mm hex bolts.  I will start squirting solvent
everymorning from tomorrow morning.  I must say that I owe you and
everone else that helping, a lot more than I can provide.  I am humbled.
Is there anything on the cheap end that I could bring.  Heck, beer or
food or whatever?  Thanks again.

I got all that with me.....even will bring the spare short block!  
Bring something to clean out the gunk you may find (solvent like Gumout
and lots of paper towels) and possibly some sandpaper to deglaze disk if
good and also the pressure plate.  If the bus is over soft ground, the
drop the trans with the engine crowd may prevail- when did you last have
any cv's off?  If never, start squirting solvent in the trans cv bolt
holes now; if you have an air blower (hell, I'll bring the portable
blower) blast the holes out- are they torx head (serrated loooking hole
or hex head allen (6mm)?
I got the wrenches for that also.
I  have a clutch centering tool also, and hose blockoff vice grip.
Assuming the 234,000 mi bus makes it down-  It's getting down to
borrowed time!
