A local powder coater that I use will work for $40 an hour per color. If 
you have a pile of white parts and need some red done too then that 
constitutes a new hour (b/c of the cleanup involved).

My friend and I had three sets of wheels powdercoated white for $40. We 
also had a huge pile of black parts - gas tank for my Beetle, propane tank 
for my Westy, the stone guard, etc done for another $40.

So... If you wanna do it cheap - b/c maybe you've got a thin budget - 
borrow or beg for a torch someplace, heat and beat the dents out of your 
bumpers - it'll take some careful practice. Have them sandblasted - our 
local cemetery monument company will do it CHEAP - and deliver them to your 
local powder coaters.

I live in a small town (~25K people) and we have all these services 
available. Check it out.

I have no doubt the guys that wrote the passage at the beginning can do a 
good job - I've never seen their product - but I know there are alot of us 
out there who want a nice repair or refinish job and can't afford $200 for 
a bumper. A bit of hunting, sweat, and planning (to get batches of parts 
done at once to save money - maybe even getting with a friend to share the 
cost) can save you money.

By the way - for those folks who get the Eastwood Company catalog. I've 
heard good things about the home style kit they sell but the cost of the 
kit far outweighs the cost to have a batch done professionally. Not to 
mention you need some way to cure the powder which normally is an oven. At 
my house my wife would be quite suspicious of car parts going into the 
oven. And a bumper doesn't fit in my oven anyhow! <grin>
