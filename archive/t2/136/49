They can be tuned to run good on a T-IV if you overcome some problems. Too 
many of them are not jetted right. No way to get good running. A set of 
jets and emulsion tubes accosted me $75 5 years ago. I took data from the 
Weber book from various applications for the carb and calculated the proper 
jet sizes and emulsion tube letter/numbers. You menchanic will have to 
mount and run the carb to test for proper mixture. If it is not right then 
he can identify the existing jets and either get a knowledgeable opinion of 
the proper sizes or do the calculations as I did.

Then there is the issue of the runners and manifolds. Every set I've seen 
don't line up worth spit and it can be a real pain to install properly.
