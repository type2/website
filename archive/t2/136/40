they were all meticulous people following the scientific method, and
learned from the mistakes of their predecessors.

I think both he and I know I am saying, "BEGIN" with the mfg
recomendations if you wish to change things read up on what others have
done,  I have synthetic lube, and Pertronix, but not before I did a lot of
research and checking up on things.

When I rebuilt my engine (2L 78) I made very very few changes from spec
and those only with a lot of thought..I lowered the CR a fraction, and now
I question the wisdom of that, and I used a "harder" valve seat, which I
have no idea if it helped because it hasn't failed and other air cooled
engines (not VW) use them successfully.

several years ago I had a 71 that had a blown engine but everything else
was in pretty good shape,  I dedcided to "play around" with converting it
to an electric drive.  Now while money was not unlimited I did have plenty
of time since I had other cars to drive and it wasn't blocking
anything.  I also had the assistance of my uncle, an Electrical engineer
with a major design firm and 7 patents to his name.

well it was figured to be a "test bed" more than an actual
prototype..after over 5 years and who knows how many $$$ I ran out of time
to make it work reasonably and needed the space so I gave it to a friend
to phutz with.  he never got it on the road either and after taking useful
parts off of it he had it crushed.

well I never would have done this if I needed to get this vehicle on the
road,  I think the smartest thing I ever did was not to add up what I
spent on it (although the records still exist) don't think I want to
know.  However I learned a lot and the exercise was not in vain.

but of course,  I have boxes of data on my van since the day I bought it
(organization was never my strong point) same with a house I am
renovating, I take photos of all the steps in all the work I do and put it
with the records, more than once I have yanked em out to see where I put
XYZ behind that wall.  same with my bus many many photos

yes and no, there are some improvements that can be done, I would neither
include nor exclude MMO because it has neither been proven or disproven in
my book.  I would include IMO pertronix, synthetic lubes, radial tires,
bi-metalic brake shoes/pads among other.

> >limits of the holy Bentley, or the factory issued repair manuals, that

the Bentley, Haines and Chilton are looked at before touching anything I
haven't done before and usually several times during the process, I never
try to remember torque settings etc.  and the few places where I have
discovered errors (and yes there are a few typos etc) they are marked iin
the book itself, changes I have made are marked on a copy of the wiring
diagram that I keep so I don't have to remember where I ran that oil
presure guage wire, etc

well the "list is great" has bailed my butt out of the fire more times
than I care to think of (send the list guru's a few bucks to keep it here,
5% of what you save even) usually filling in the blanks that the manuals
assume you know or tricks to make the job easier.  

this is like arguing religion, no one will really convince anyone else so
you might as well agree to disagree.....
