REMOVE ALL OF IT!

Old bondo can lead to 101 different problems.

I'd remove it and you may find that the metal is repairable better than the 
last guy/gal could have. It may have been just a quickie fix to sell the 
car at some point.

Ask around about metal impregnated filler. It is a bondo-like material with 
ground aluminum mixed in. Not as (or at all?) susceptible to moisture. 
We've used it over Swiss Cheese rust in non-structural places on Hot Rods. 
It's hard enough that it is easier to grind than sand if you miss the 
"window" where the material is workable.

Very good material for areas where moisture might get into the filler from 
inaccessible areas.

Regular Bondo is good but requires careful handling.
