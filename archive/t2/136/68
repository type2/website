Yeah - just make a trip to your favorite local junkyard and hunt for a 
passenger vehicle made in Japan. My '99 Honda CR-V has a clutch master 
cylinder reservoir that is perfect - if only a bit low on capacity for this 
purpose. All you are looking for really is something with a nipple on the 
bottom to hold brake fuild and be air tight. The idea that it is clear 
would be nice b/c then you could at a glance tell if you need to add more 
brake fluid.

Just remember the less capacity you have, the less fluid you have in case 
of a sudden leak - every pump of the pedal while you try to stop will get 
you closer to being out of fluid sooner.

Another design would be to add a container in line with the hose going from 
the brake fluid reservoir. Basically a pint size fuel filter copy (without 
the filter material) and then you could use a Honda style clutch reservoir 
and still have alot of fluid capacity.

The design would be - a Honda clutch reservoir, a bit of brake fluid 
tubing, your homemade container with a nipple at both ends, and then on to 
the master cylinder.
