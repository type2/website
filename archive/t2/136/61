Subject: Re: [T2] EGR filter

George,

My EGR channel (filter > valve > manifold) seems to clog in aprox 2 years. 
The filter is ~ $130 the Valve ~$200 and cleaning the manifold is a long 
dirty job. Maybe the filter protects the valve and manifold.
A good filter could let the valve and manifold live a little longer.

I am told some block the channel off and back off on the timing a degree.
