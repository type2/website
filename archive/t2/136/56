I have an opinion on the balance issue.  What exactly was balanced?  Just 
the short block?  Was the flywheel included?  What about pressure plate?  Fan?

My guess is that the balance probably included the short block and 
flywheel, and probably didn't include the rest.  Your problem could likely 
be with "the rest".  If you have lots of time and really want to figure 
this out, it's possible to narrow it down some.  All rotating parts are 
suspect.  Start by removing the fan.  Start the engine (briefly!!) and 
check for the vibration.  If no change, you have just ruled out the fan and 
alternator.  Next step would be to drop the engine, remove the clutch and 
pressure plate, reassemble and check for vibration again.  Two engine pulls 
required, but you will be able to rule out the clutch.  If none of that 
succeeds, you can either take the engine back to the rebuilder and ask that 
it be properly balanced, or just live with it.

Believe it or not, I actually helped a friend through the above process (on 
a Mustang, but work required was similar).  Took us a couple of days, but 
we determined that the problem was inside the engine, and took it back to 
the rebuilder, who did fix it.  Looking back, it was time well spent.
