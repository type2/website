That problem may have passed as my friend went back to get a set of hubcaps 
powder coated to match the body color - in this case a custom color - and 
for a bit of extra cost they matched it just fine...

Rough looking old shop but they turn out good work. I normally look for 
clean shops (much like looking for a clean machinist's shop) thinking that 
would help ensure careful attention to my project but in this case my 
"equation" was throughly sunk...
