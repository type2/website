Well, I have found the source of my high idle.

I was running lean, causing the engine to run hot as well. The cause? Not the 
brake booster vacuum line as I thought. Sitting down in exasperation after 
checking everything that I could think of (and some that others had) I 
noticed that the manifold was showing a shiny spot that had been untouched by 
grime. I pulled the rubber boot off, and sure enough, the manifold was not 
seated and was sucking air BAD. Apparently, while I was reinstalling the carb 
after putting the engine back in, I popped one of the manifolds free from its 
seat in the adapter manifold (the piece right under the carb on a Weber dbl 
bbl progressive) I popped it back in, checked the other three, reinstalled 
the boots, tightened down the manifold bolts on the heads, and cranked her 
right up. VROOOOOM!!! - I had forgotten to adjust the idle down. After I 
adjusted the idle and checked the timing, she put-put-putted like she did 
before.

Many thanks to those who offered advice. See you at Everybus!!!! I'll be the 
one with a big smile on my face. Like that narrowed it down any...
