Ok,
            Here is the list of parts that I plan to buy from Joe at
BustedBus and have shipped tomorrow.
 
Engine seal (Flywheel and Crank seal)
Transmission shaft seal
Clutch disk
Flywheel washer
Wrench for flywheel (Cant remember name, Joe said its special tool that
costs only few bucks.)
            
            This list alone will be pushing my budget.  From what I have
gathered, it seems I will need a small sledge hammer, torque wrench, and
some vice-grips.  Sorry to say I do not have these three.  Think I will
be able to scavenge these at EB?  I will be bringing basically all the
tools I have.  That should cover the common stuff such as sockets,
screwdrivers, pliers, etc.  I also have only one bottle jack rated at 6
tons and the stock jack that came with the bus.  I was also unable to
find a place to get a seal remover in short time.  So, anything missing
that I should add?  Oh, I would be willing to donate my engine to see
who is faster at pulling the engine or engine/tranny.  :-)
 
Thanks again everyone.
