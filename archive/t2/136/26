As the engine ages and the technology improves, it really
does become an improvisational dance. Just try to be consistent and
reasonably scientific(coming from someone who used to add a drop of patchouli in an oil change
and kept a crystal inthe tuneup kit). There are many technologies (hydraulic lifters and
solid-stateignitions) that really improve on the engine, many of the old techniques
get phased out.Just the other day I was  trying to set my timing (after my Dad tried
too). Dad came up and said'unplug the timing light and tweak the distributor until it sounds smooth
-  keep tweakinguntil it's where you want it'.

Oil and additives become real voodoo with these engines -
as they were in my Porsche 911. Nobody makes an oil that works really well
in oil-cooledengines anymore. Except, maybe, the oil that Harley-Davidson sells at
their  dealerships.If you want the rundown on oil and oil-cooling, ask a hawg rider.
Persoanlly, I use the same oilon my Type 4 VW engine as I used in my 911 - straight 30 weight. I'm also
planning to add andexternal oil coolar and reserviour, like my 911. Will the 10.5 quart
capacity of thereservior and cooler of the 911, Porsche recommended oil changes at 15K
miles - in time withvalve adjustments. Of course, Porsche used solid lifters through at least
1989, so maybethey are better than hydraulic.

Do remember - if the dance is improv - you need to keep an eye
on the lead - your engine - to remain in step. You can't depend on the
prescribed footwork of awaltz or a rumbha - and you can't depend on the prescribed maintenance of
Bentley or Muir(although Muir says about the same thing).
