This is likely to get me 'moderated' again, but it's been bothering me
all afternoon. (George, tell the other guys that I don't post this far
off topic often.)

Uhhhhh... Terry, I seem to recall that the Wright brothers "invented"
the wind tunnel... They probably just used it to cool the office though.
;o) 

A disappointing performance by the 1901 glider prompted the Wright
brothers to construct a wind tunnel to test the effectiveness of a
variety of wing shapes. Using the results of the wind tunnel
experiments, they constructed their 1902 glider.

"Dr. Orville Wright deeded to The Franklin Institute in his will and
through the Executors of his Estate all of his and his brother's, Wilbur
Wright's, original wind tunnel apparatus, model airfoils, test data and
drawings of their early airplanes. The collection also includes airfoil
models tested at McCook Field during 1910, 1920, and 1921 as well as
some of Orville Wright's experimental aviation devices with which he
worked during his lifetime.

Replica of the wind tunnel designed and built by the Wright Brothers in
the fall of 1901 to test airfoil designs. The blower fan, driven by an
overhead belt, produced a 25 to 35 mph wind for testing the lift of
various plane and curved surfaces. Aerodynamic tables derived from these
tests were vital to the successful design of the Wright 1903 Kitty Hawk
airplane. Inside the tunnel is a model of a Wright Brothers lift balance
used to measure the lift of a test surface.

When published aeronautical data turned out to be unreliable, the Wright
brothers built their own wind
tunnel to test airfoils and measure empirically how to lift a flying
machine into the sky.

Finally, remember Akin's First Law of Spacecraft Design 
(<http://spacecraft.ssl.umd.edu/academics/akins_laws.html>)

1. Engineering is done with numbers. Analysis without numbers is only an opinion.

Without empirical data to back claims of superiority, my gut response is
to go with the specifications provided by those with the most
experience.  Space launch vehicles? Martin-Marietta. Air-cooled
automotive engines? VW. Motor oil? Society of Automotive Engineers. 

I don't recall seeing the SAE specification listed on the can of MMO...
