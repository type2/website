Subject: Re: [T2] FI pump request

I didn't elaborate, but would a restriction in the suction line
actually cause the pump not to run? The last few times the bus hasn't
started it is due to this. I can simply leave the ignition on and go
back and lightly tap the pump w/ my hand, starts right up. I'm not
sure if I'm jostling the pump or the connectors.
