This is a good lead-in to something I was going to post to the list anyway...

This weekend,
after my father and I got the Weber Prog rebuilt in my '74, I   headed
down to Orlando to helpteach some yoga classes at a friend's studio. Saturday afternoon, after
the classes wereover (and spending the night in an excellent WalMart lot in Winter Park,
FL), I headed towardDaytona to cruise the beach. As I got closer to the coast I noticed an
unusually large numberof irridescent painted, wagon-wheeled 'thumpers' crowded with all
seat-belts occupied.Evidently there was some kind of African-American Spring Break happening
at Daytona andeveryone was headed to cruise the beach. The Florida State Troopers had
some kind of plan inmind and had all of the beach access points blockaded. They were letting
people through, butI didn't want to try to sneak my '74 westy through, especially with
expired tags from anothervehicle (another story - I'm waiting on my title). So I headed north to
Ormond.
About five
miles north of Daytona Beach you start getting away from the high-rise
hotels right on thebeach and start seeing beachside homes and condos across the street. Lots
of beach-sideparking but no beach driving -  which is cool by me... So I stopped and
spent a few hours on thebeach. I then cruised up route 1 looking for a potential parking place for
the night  and cameacross the Bicentennial Park in Ormond-by-the-Sea (the actual name of the
city). I pulled innext to a wedge vanagon and cooked a can of soup.

After eating I figured I would introduce
myself to my neighbor. He turned out to be this really cool retiree who
has been living in his'80 vanagon for four years. Prior to the vanagon he had a '73. His bus had
about 220K miles on itand recently received a transplant from a Porsche 914. I got to tell him
about the engine in myold 911 (compared to my bus, I guess it wasn't old). He gave me lots of
pointers about living ina bus. The interior of his bus was so clean you could eat off the floor.
He had stripped out thebed in the pop top to make extra storage. He had dual batteries mostly to
ensure he'd start inthe morning. He knew all the places to park for the night and put many
miles on his bus seeingnew parts of the country. We pontificated about Texas vs. Canada for late
Spring - agreeing onTexas for late spring and Canada for summer.

It was a truly enlightening experience for
someone just embarking on a life  'on the road'. I probably should have
hung out with him for awhile but I had to get back to Dad's to do a little more tweaking on the
engine. One thing I didnotice about this 'sage of the road' was that he didn't do much of his own
engine work. For me,half the storage space of my bus is occupied by tools and spare parts. But
I think he has aregular income to rely upon - not just sweat and the good will of friends
and family.
As far
as the question - is it cheaper to live in an apartment or an RV? The
answer is if you try to make anRV into an apartment it will cost more than an apartment. But compare that
difference to thecost of making an apartment into an RV! Just try moving that sucker to
another state!
Oh
yeah, the 'sage' said he prefers his vanagon over an RV because he can
park it anywhere andlook just like a regular car. Nobody drives an RV to the grocery store for
a quick trip - but hecan pull that story stepping out of the vanagon anywhere. He even took it
so far as to keep acollapsible bike inside instead of a bike rack on the back.
