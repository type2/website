Hello,

I was waiting for someone to ask me that. The hardest
part of this conversion to me was removing the
"extension" pannel at the bottom of the nose of my
bus. I ended up using an air chisel, hammer, flat
screw driver and a rotary disc cutter. i hade to take
it off in pieces seperating it from the bus at its
welede points. I cleaned and straitened all of the
edges and painted the inner pannel behind the
"extension" with rust converting paint (a desperate
attempt to ease my mind about some rust holes I found
behind it). I ordered The Lower Front Nose Panel for
use when installing late nose w/ 68-72 bumper , 68-72
Bus. The price was $24.95 and the part # waw 95 55
220. Just be sure not to cut off the lip that sticks
out behind the top of the front bumper. This is
important so you can "easily" weld on the replacement.
I cut if off and had to weld it on the HARD way. Make
sure that you align everything up several times before
you start welding.  Having more than a half dozen vice
grips also helps. Go to this link and you will find
pictures of my progress on the nose so far. There are
also pictures of a dash board. I striped the dash of
its padding, striped the paint off and welded sheet
metal patches in the unwanted holes. There is no hole
for the radio now but I will cut one if I ever put one
in it. I fixed the flaws and primed it. I plan to
paint it Bright gloss white.

Let me know if this link works. Have a great day!
