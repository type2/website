Hi Volks,

I have a pair of trustworthy jack stands I will bring. I also have a bottle
jack; but a nice dolly jack would make it a lot easier.

The flywheel wrench is probably just a locking clamp to stop the flywheel
from turning as you try to get its bolts loose.

Vice grips and duct tape: NEVER leave home without them.

Happy trails,
