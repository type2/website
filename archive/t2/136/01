Subject: retarded

My 300 mile engine is running too hot I fear. On the hills 240+ (I stop and
cool down at 240). I received an e-mail last night that recommended I retard
the timing a bit to run cooler. I time it at 28 degrees max advance. Vac
advance distributor.

Then today I found this in the archives:

<<<The biggest problem I find with VW's is the use of a timing light to set
the timing of a non-stock engine. On a weekly basis I have VW's coming in
the shop complaining about heat and/or running problems, after I look at it
the first thing I do is advance the timing a few degrees and that usually
solves the problem. Most non stock VW engines that I see are running to
retarded, which in turn causes them to run hot. The only time I use a timing
light is to check the timing after I have set it by ear, so I know where to
set it if I need to make changes to something and to check the advance if
the dizzy. Using a timing light to set the timing on a NON STOCK engine is a
NO NO, but to each there own. >>

What is the answer?

Another subject: There definitely is a rpm dependant vibration in the beast.
Pisses me off as I spent a lot of money having the whole thing balanced
before I assembled it. How long till this engine flies apart?

BTW 1600 SP dog house engine.
