Subject: Weber progressive

My mechanic says that the dual Weber carbs I bought were in really bad shape
physically and would take a lot of work to fix. Broken emulsion tube among
other things.

He wants me to bring down my old single Weber Progressive instead. I really
need my bus back, so I reckon I will. I never got an answer on why this is
such a bad carb. Why is this such a shunned carb on the list?
