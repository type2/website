I've been reading my Bentley and I can't seem to understand why my fuel =
pump would come on with the engine off and key removed.(1979 - 2.0 =
liter,automatic). I had just moved it and shut it off and happend to be =
standing behind it when I heard the pump start.
 This Bus had been sitting for about 6 -8 years. I've replaced the fuel =
lines ect. flushed the tank- too many filters too remember.
Thanks ~ Andy
