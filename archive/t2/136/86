Subject: Re: [T2] paint job?

 
--Recently I received quotes from the "sh*tty" shop for 600$, and from the "good" shop for starting at $5000, and everything in between. The painting thread is a painful one, my friend, with many a staunch opinion of how bad you'll F up your job the way you're doing it. Good luck!

P.s. to the list: Can my buddy's new 2hp, 5gal compressor push a spray gun rated at 11.3 cfm? what's the formula for compressor/tool interaction?

thanks,

billy
