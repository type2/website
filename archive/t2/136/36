Subject: RE: Removing a Westy Interior (and putting it back in)

I have the VW shop manual supplement for the camping equipment on my
website. It gives basic instruction for removal of 75 and up westy
interior. There is actually a specific order of removal since some mounting
points aren't exposed until another cabinet is removed
