Hear any pinking at all??? No?? Still could be too high compression from=20
not verifying deck height during assembly. Could also be just running too=20
lean. How did you adjust the mixture??? Float level too low will lean you=20
out =3D heat. So would a vacuum leak. A weak fuel pump that can't keep up=20
will likewise drop the fuel level in the carb and lean you out =3D heat.

A few possibles: fouled plug, cracked plug insulator, bad HT wire, cracked=
=20
dizzy cap, valve lash closing up, cylinder studs=20
cracked/stretching/pulling, piston installed 180=B0 wrong, head seal going=
=20
south due to unparallel machining of either the case or head or mismatched=
=20
cylinder shims. cracked or burned valve or piston or head from overheating.

Check and proof the ignition first, then the fuel system. If that's all=20
good, teardown is probably required to find the problem.

Note if it ran smoothly for 200 miles then developed the vibration, it's=20
not a problem with the balancing work. If it was out of balance initially=20
it would have vibrated from initial startup.
