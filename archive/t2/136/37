Subject: FI pump request

I have been having an intermitent problem with my fuel pump on my 79
bus. I suspect the pump is going out (engine stutters & sometimes
doesn't start & pump not running). I would hate to drop the $$ just
chasing an electric problem if it's not the pump. Does anyone (esp if
going to EB) have a known good pump I could borrow for a couple of
weeks to see if the problem goes away? If it is the pump I would
rather purchase a re-built or new one instead of having the trouble
rear it's head later.
