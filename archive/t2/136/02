Subject: (parts wanted) side step ends Last call for parts need  at Everybus

I have a aluminum side step. Does anyone have the end peices that goe in the
jack points.
When I was trying to remove it from a bus in the backyard they both snapped.
I am bringing a pile of parts for people to Everybus. What do you need?

Thanks,
Dave Parsons
