Subject: RE: [T2] removing stickers

Hi Brian,

	The best product that I have found for removing stickers is called
Goo-Gone.  It is available at most hardware stores or office supply stores.
WD-40 will also remove the stickers, but will leave a oily residue on the
paint.  If the stickers have been there for more than a few months out in
the elements there will more than likely be a bit of discoloration in your
paint finish from UV fading.  Be sure to try these products in an
inconspicuous place first to be sure that you like the results.

								Hope this
helps,

Hey everybody,

I just bought a mostly rough '71 camper that has a number of stickers all
over the rear.  I'd keep them if they were at all interesting and/or in
decent shape, but they're not.

Does anyone have any suggestions for removing old stickers from painted
surfaces without damaging the paint?

Thanks,
Brian
