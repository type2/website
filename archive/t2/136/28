VW of Mexico made watercooled bays with both gas and 
diesel engines.(I thing they still do, but the days are 
numbered) Perhaps parts vendors in Mexico cound supply 
some of the bits for this swap. How's your Spanish?:-)

OR: you could leave both of your current vehciles 
intact, sell them and go to mexico in search of a used 
diesel bus. More expensive, but a bit simpler.
