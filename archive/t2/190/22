Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel pressure and starting problems

Eddie,

35 psi at start is normal. In the run mode the fuel manifold pressure should 
drop to 28 psi(nominal). With these numbers a normal air manifold vacuum 
reading would be 14.4 in.Hg. This equates to a pressure drop in the air 
manifold of 7 psi. Note that 7psi + 28psi = 35 psi.

35 psi is a the normal differential pressure at the injector tip. As the 
manifold pressure drops at idle the pressure regulator senses this drop 
through the vacuum line and reduces the fuel manifold pressure to 28 psi to 
hold the differential injector pressure to 35psi.

If the fuel manifold pressure fails to drop to around 28psi you will run 
rich at idle since the differential pressure at the injector would exceed 
35psi. A fuel manifold pressure of 35psi along with a air manifold pressure 
drop of 7psi (vacuum of 14.4 in.Hg) results in a abnormal differential 
pressure of 42 psi at the injector.

It sounds like the pressure regulator is not getting the correct vacuum 
signal or not responding to it. Maybe you have a massive loss of vacuum.

Make sure the vacuum line to the pressure regulator is working and is in 
fact the air manifold line and not the delayed vacuum line from the throttle 
body.
