On a summer vacation to Venice we were driving my '72 Super on the 
autostrada as fast as the little 40 HP would carry us. We drove into a 
HEAVY downpour that had flooded the road with about 4" of water. 
Immediately my heaters, which leaked a bit of hot air, began filling the 
car with steam. In no time we could not see the road ahead so I slowed to 
25 mph and drove with the window open while my sister searched furiously 
for a rag to wipe the windows clean on the inside.

No accidents but things were tense.
