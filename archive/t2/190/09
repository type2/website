Velly intellesting...  it appears you do have a version of the carb without 
the central idling system.  For a guy who has only had his bus a month, you 
sure know your terminology.

My guess is that yes, you could do this.  You would adjust the idle the 
traditional way, by turning the throttle stop set screws.

Er, uhhh... :)  Not sure without the parts in front of me, but my memory 
tells me that all of the central-idling-specific parts are in the top of 
the carb, so it just might work.

My suggestion is to try the carb.  Plug the holes that are not attached to 
anything.  You will still need a crosspipe between the carbs so just plug 
the upper section of your current crosspipe (the part that used to go to 
the central idling system on the left carb).

Which carbs if you decide to replace?  No easy answer.  What is most 
important to you - 
Reliability?   Serviceability?  Performance?  Economy?  If you could state 
your priorities in these areas, you might get more helpful suggestions.
