I just thought I would give a heads up to a Westy (located in Minnesota) a
coworker has listed for sale on the type 2 page.  He lives in Minnesota and
I live in California so I have not seen this bus otherwise I would love to
have an extra motor and trans.  
 
On top of that we both are currently working in Monterrey Mexico.  He tells
me the bus has a fair amount of rust and there is a problem with the fuel
injection but it runs.  This bus also has a gas heater.
 
 
It might be worth a look and he may be able to send pictures if any one is
interested.
