I redid the timing because I measured the dwell a couple of weeks later and
it went from 50 to 52.5.  When I timed it two days ago I set it to:

Idle: 880
Dwell: 47.8 at idle (46.7 at 2000 rpm)
Timing: 7.5 BTDC
Vacuum: at least 17"

I was really happy then but now the vacuum is reading lower and I don't know
why.
