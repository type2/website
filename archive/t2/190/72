Bob, 

  I also am looking into the filling of my small tank. I tried to 

use a disposable cylinder and my stove leaked like mad. 

Not too sure if my stove is leaking gas from the hight pressure

of the cylinder (no regulator) or if it is just plain shot.

Anyway do you know of any sources for stove parts?

Also was your refill store agency a small mom and pop?

Thanks in advance,

Paul Saulsbury
