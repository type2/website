Subject: Re: [T2]  Waterbed - or a =?iso-8859-1?q?Pool=3F!=3F?=

All this talk of waterbeds in busses reminds me of the time I put a   
kiddie pool in the back of my double cab for some summer pre-concert  
relaxing a couple years ago. Driving home, gallons of water sloshing  
out all over the place at every stop and corner, funny-looking truck, 
late at night...                                                      
  Police officer walks up to my window after pulling me over, and     
expresses concern at all the liquid leaking from the back of the      
vehicle. The look on his face was priceless when I said "Oh, that's   
just the pool, sir."                                                  
:)                                                                    
  4 police cars and a good deal of searching later, we went on our    
way...
