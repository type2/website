Thanks,
I figured something like what you propose was
possible. It seems like there should be a knob or a
allen-head on the outside of the distributor so you
could adjust while the engine is running. But that
wouldn't build character.

Don't have a helper so I think what I'm going to do is
buy a new set of points. Feeler gauge the gap, pray,
then check with the dwell. It should make it a little
easier.

i owned several VWs in my 20s--ghia, bus, single cab,
squareback. I always set the points with a feeler
gauge and a file. Now, i get the 68 bus (i'm 50) and
try to use a dwell meter and I'm baffled. Now, I gotta
wonder if the point settings I did in my youth were
even close!
