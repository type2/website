The problem was in the shifter mechanism which is good news because I =
couldn't see anything wrong from underneath the bus.  The grease around =
the spring in there was so thick and covered with dirt it was preventing =
the spring from doing it's simple little job.  It's really cramped in =
there so I'm off to get a can of compressed air to clean it out but just =
after wiping some of the grime away everything started moving properly.  =
Good luck with your bus Brennan; let me know how it goes.
