Subject: Re: [T2] Bolt Behind Starter (Changing Starter)

If you have already taken the nut off from the engine side, it should just
slide right out, there is nothing to hold it in but maybe some mechanics
putty to hold it while putting the nut on.  If it is being stuborn, pull the
other starter bolt, take off the starter with the bolt in place, put a nut
back on the bolt and lightly tap it.
