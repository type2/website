Subject: RE: [T2] Vanagon block into a bay (was: vanagon seats & more)

Just back from visiting my vanagon and I think I have a plan.

The Vanagon is an 83 air-cooled with 67k original miles.  I've searched
the archives and it seems that I should be able to put this engine
into my 79 Bay, using the fan shroud and alternator from my 78 engine, =
and
drilling out the motor mounts to accept the larger bolts.  Am I missing
anything?  Are the FI components the same, or should I use the 78's FI =
system?

Thanks,

Rob
