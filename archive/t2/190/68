In reality, he is 100% correct. American english is totally wrong when it
comes to 'dimming' the lights. You are not cutting down the voltage and making
them dimmer!  [unless you have dirty connections.....]

Another mis-named item is a shock absorber. They do not adsorb an ounce of
shock! The springs do that. The shocks dampen the travel of the springs......
