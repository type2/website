Hi,

I'm new again to this list, but was on it a couple of years ago.  I'm Jen.  
I've owned many old VWs.  I have just bought a "new to me" '71 Westy.  It 
needs 4 tires and a battery and has been sitting for 4 years. But, it's quite 
nice otherwise and the lack of rust is eerie.  I figured for $300, it was a 
decent buy and will provide me with much entertainment.  Now for the fun, I 
have to bring it home.  It is 88 miles from my boyfriend's house.  The tires 
have rotted from underneith it. 
The plan as I've come up with it so far, is to get a car transport (4 wheels 
off the ground) from U-Haul and a 14' truck to pull it.  But it has no tires 
and I need to work on it a bit before I try to start it. Soo, I have ordered 
four "Uniroyal® Laredo® All Seasons - LT195/75R14 C" from Sam's club.  
Anybody use these?  Do you like them?  I read the tire FAQs and this tire was 
listed, but the person had only one on their bus, not all four.  Sooo, I'll 
get these tires, bring them to the Westy, put the Westy on stands and take 
the rims and tires to a local shop for mount/balance, put them back on the 
westy and uses a come-a-long to get the bus onto the car transport.  Does 
anyone have a better idea?

Also, the bus has no access to the engine compartment, small-ish tail lights 
and looks like a '71.  But, it has a pancake engine.  Could it be a 72 
instead?  Or could someone have put a pancake engine into it?

Thanks for help, suggestions and ideas!

Take Care,
Jen
