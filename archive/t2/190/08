Subject:  Waterbed (was Now I've Heard It All!)

I too have entertained the thought of putting in a waterbed. I sleep on one
at home and never feel comfy in my bus like I do at home.

Some thoughts are taking a super single matress and making a full cabinet
from the upper engine hatch out to where the bed would end for it to rest
on. You would probably also have to make some sort of retaining frame around
the whole thing to keep the mattress in place and have a good liner.

You would lose passenger seating and the bed could only be filled at the
campsite as I imagine it would be too heavy to drive with that much water.
Plus if for any reason it burst you would have a bad situation. Might even
have to remove the cabinet in most buses.

I am really thinking of doing this down the road though. If anyone has any
insights they are welcome. Maybe some of you have put in an air mattress and
can say if it works good or not.

Of course I know this is an impractical modification.
