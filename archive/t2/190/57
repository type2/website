Yo Mike

As I said - he is asking $1500.00 Canadian - but I'm sure they are open to
offers.  It's about 1/2 hour North of Brockville - you are close to Montreal
right? It's not that far.  As I said - it doesn't run - so I'm not sure how
you'd move it.  But if you are still interested lemme know and I'll send the
email address.

BTW - how is the Mango bus coming alone?
