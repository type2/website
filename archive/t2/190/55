Hi Volks,

I can verify Jamie on this; although his bus isn't quick; it does sound
"good" and seems to run smoothly with the pack up to 65 MPH. But it's a
**major** PITA if you get caught behind him on a long hill.  AMHIK. ;^)

I think this says a lot for the advantages of a well balanced engine; having
equalized performance on all 4 cylinders and (presumably) well balanced
reciprocating mass has helped keep this engine going long past where a
lesser collection of parts would have packed it in.

Happy trails,
