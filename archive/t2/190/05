OK,

Here is my trick on setting points.

You have to have a helper or remote start switch though.

Put the new points in and adjust "close".

Start the engine and see what the dwell says.
Pull the dist cap and rotor and have your buddy crank the
engine long enough for you to get a feel for the difference
in what it was running v.s. what it is when cranking.

Adjust points while buddy is cranking engine.  Tighten them
and start engine.  Check dwell...repeat until you are happy!

Cheers, dave
