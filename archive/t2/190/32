Subject: Re: Fuel Pressure and Starting Problems



I agree that this may not be a pressure related problem. It sounds to me
like the FI system may not be properly grounded or the fuel may be
contaminated, both of which have happened to me in the past and both
caused the short-run-then-die syndrome you describe. Especially check
and clean the number 11 ground wire where it connects to the crankcase.
The other thing I would do, if you have any reason at all to suspect you
may have got a load of bad gas just before all this started--you know,
like you had to stop at a cheapo discount station because it was the
only gas around, that sort of thing--is change the fuel filter, if you
haven't already, and go to a Chevron station for a bottle of Techron
fuel additive, some very good stuff for cleaning and conditioning your
fuel system right out to the injectors. You will have to (carefully!)
purge the system to get to the newly treated fuel in the tank. When I
had this contamination problem, but didn't know it,  VW service told me
I needed new injectors. When I went to the parts department to buy the
injectors, the parts guy told me I should try Techron first, and he sold
bottles right there. It worked and I'm still running the same injectors.
I now use only Chevron fuel that has Techron already in it, and carry
bottles of the stuff with me if I'm going into Mexico where I can't get
Chevron gas.

Hope this helps,
