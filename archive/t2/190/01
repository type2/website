Subject: Fuel pressure and starting problems

Hello list, I am experiencing trouble and hope someone can help.

Engine:1800cc Fuel Injected type 4

I previously had the problem of my engine starting, running for a few
minutes then dying. It would start up again, then die in shorter time.
then it just wouldn't start. I noticed that the fuel would leak from the
rail on the right side after many starting attempts.

So what I did was replace the lines and clamps and a installed a brand new
fuel pressure regulator (after some testing, my pump checked out)bosch,
ofcourse. I also
installed a mecahnical pressure gauge on the left fuel rail to get an idea
of waht is going on.

Now, the engine won't start. The pressure when cranking is 35psi.
Sounds about 7psi high, but If i recall it is a bit higher when cranking
until the vacumm kicks in to activate the pressure regulator. The pressure
remains around 30-35 for a half hour. I came back and a half hour after
trying to start and the gauge read just under 20psi.

I'm beginning to think that this is not pressure related. What could
replacing the fuel pressure regulator do to prevent my engine from
starting? anything? Where else should I be looking? I have good spark, and
i know the enigne ran with the old pressure regulator...just not for too
long.


Another question: Is it a bad idea to have the mecanical pressure gauge
hooked up to the fuel rail permanently? I clamped about a 8 inches of line
to
the rail to connect the gauge. 



thanks
Eddie
