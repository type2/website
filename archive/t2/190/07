Spend $100 for an hour of chassis dyno time.  Make sure they have a 
wideband O2 sensor.  Adjust the mixture via whatever means you have 
available to you (fuel pressure, AFM adjustment?  I'm no bus FI expert) 
until you are seeing 12.x at WOT.  Go drive your bus to your heart's content.

If your test equipment includes a gauge that reads your stock O2 sensor, 
don't put any faith in what it tells you.  All it can tell you is whether 
you are north or south of 14.6, nothing more.
