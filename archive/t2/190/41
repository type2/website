Hi Michael,

Your indicator switch is joined onto the loom by a connector which is a see
through plastic block with as many sections as wires, inside the plastic
block are male and female spade connectors one for each wire. These can work
loose over time and when you poke your hands under the dash you upset a
precarious connection and the flashers stop flashing. Ensure that each
male/female connector pair is firmly pressed together.

Don't suspect any other component before you have checked this.

The indicator switch connector also handles headlight dipped to main
switching and if that wire comes loose then you can be stuck on dipped or
main beam.

There is also a connector for the windscreen wiper switch (plus an extension
piece and another connector for RHD) where loose connections can make your
wipers do strange things.

Hope that fixes it

Good luck
