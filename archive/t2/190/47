I've got one substandard tire on my bus too - one the spare tire... <grin>

Seriously - sounds like good tires but the overall rolling diameter will be 
slightly smaller than stock. SLIGHTLY.

Short of borrowing wheels and tires - you have the right idea. Too bad you 
can't paint the wheels before you mount the tires.

I'd just put it on a flatbed trailer as is - and wait to install the tires 
when you get home. They won't hold air for even a few minutes while you 
load it?

Transition period bus?

Maybe Euro spec? Many of the improvements showed up in Europe 1 year before 
America. I had an Italian-spec '72 Super that was like a '73 American spec 
Beetle when I was in Italy. A '72 American spec Beetle still had a flat 
windshield.

Congrats on a good deal.
