Subject: Re:Brake Warning Light On

Chris-
I'm reading the list mail out of order so you may have solved the problem 
by now, but I'll tell you what I think I remember anyway.
I have a 72 westy that had the same problem with the brake light going on 
only when my foot was on the brake. As I recall the problem was that
water had gotten into the rubber boot on one or both of the brake
preasure switches on the master cylinder. I think the light goes on when
there is a different reading from each switch. Anyway, I dried and
cleaned the switch connectors and sprayed some wd40 or maybe PB Blaster
on the connections. That fixed it. I also hear that the switches tend to
fail after a while. I bought some but never put them in.

 Okay, I've seen others with this problem in the archives but didn't see any 
replies... the brake warning light is coming on in my 74 westy and only 
turns off when I hit the brakes....  I thought this thing is supposed to 
work the other way around... turn on when you press the brakes and there is 
no pressure in one or both halves of the master cylinder. Well the brakes 
are working fine but this light is on all the time... any suggestions?
