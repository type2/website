Hello list,

The only way that I could see a water bed being
feasible is if it were no more than 6" tall. If I were
to do somthing like this, I would use the regular Z
bed and have the water bladder deflated and rolled up
until you planned on using it. When you got to the
camp sight, you would have to roll out the water
bladder over the open Z bed and fill it with a water
hose. I sure as heck would not drive it for any
distance with it fully inflated. Even then, It would
be safer to have a lined frame around it.

That is what I think of it.
