Jamie, and others .................
Please read my original post.
I am talking about a propane cylinder other than a horizontally mounted 
late edition Westy propane tank.
My tank is a totally separate camping item that I specifically selected to 
complement my 1970 bus camping activities.
A 1970 bus does not have a "factory" tank.
