Subject: Re: [T2] compression readings

I put an engine together "temporarily" , just to get to everybus2001 and back..... 

The rings had .090 end gap,,, and I knew that was terrible,, 


So a couple of days ago,, I checked the compression, and thought my gauge bit the big one,, cause it wouldn't bump up the needle on any cylinders!

I took the gauge [ 30 - 300 lbs] and compared it to 2 other [0 - 150 lbs] gauges,, in 10 lb increments up to about 150 lbs ,, and they were all the same...  so, I found a 0-30 psi gauge, and thought
it will peg that one,, 

But, I tried the 0-30 gauge , and you'll never guess the readings!
This is a bus that for the most part is described as running perfectly , starts and runs fine...etc

23 psi per cylinder ,, give or take 1 lb ! 

then I got out the leak down tester,,, and got 60% on all 4,,,, all ring leakage.

I can still maintain 65 mph after about 5 miles to get up to that speed...

What do you think,, should I continue to drive it,, and wait til the rings roll up and disintegrate??

I have put about 4000 miles on the temporary engine,, fully loaded to almost 6000lbs GVW  and it still performs well enough to keep up to my travel buddies!

I do have to use 3 gear on hills now,, and one nasty second gear hill near Round Hill Va.
