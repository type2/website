Subject: '82 Heater Boxes

Finishing up a head replacement on my 82 and looking inside the heater
boxes.  Question one, when looking at the fins inside the boxes I see what
looks to me melted metal pooling on the bottom of the box.  Any ideas?
Massive overheating and melting of the fins is my only idea, but I find it
hard to believe that it could get that hot.  Question two, looking in the
same heater box I see that it is lined between the inner and outer box is a
fabric.  Asbestos?  This is a VW box of unknown heritage to me, not a Dansk.
Ideas?


Thanks,
Mark
