Thanks for those answers. They confirm my readings of Bentley and Probst.

In the vacuum line disconnected from the pressure regulator case, the 
pressure regulator would jump from a nominal idle 28psi to its maximum value 
of nominally 35psi (Bentley). This would cause a richer condition for almost 
any throttle position other than wide open.
