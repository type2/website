Remember St. Muir- timing is when you light the match; dwell is how long
it stays lit.  Dwell is is 1/2 the number of degrees the crank turns
while the points are closed.  Thus you should be able to tell dwell with
a timing light  or voltmeter and a degree wheel or protractor and note
where the points open on a proper 50 degree set and try to match that
gap!  Points tend to close, so if my gap makes it 48 deg, that's fine. 
Just reset the timing.  How much your timing changes over time should
gove an indication of dwell.  When my rubbing block broke, it wouldn't
idel or do hills very well, and I found out that the timing was like 12
deg redarded and the dwell was over 60!
