I was discussing this at work with some others .  We all remembered the 
waterbeds of that era but were all pretty sure that they were rather 
thin and based on a foam backer.  The beds we were thinking of would 
have been about 6 inches deep.  They also were in twin bed size.  (how 
wide is a twin bed?)  We had seen them in vans of that era but not in 
the small engined vw buses.  I remember a bean bag type of bed being 
popular in upper minnesota  in the late  60's.
