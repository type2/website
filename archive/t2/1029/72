My original message----
This is a '79 bus that I have been messing with for awhile. I've 
gotten it to run, actually drove it around the block a couple of 
times & did find reverse but it was hard to get into reverse.

I adjusted the shifter and started it and it was idling nicely, I put 
it in reverse and it died.
Since then I can get it to start when I turn the key to 'start', I 
can hear it running but when I let the key go into 'run' it dies.

My problem is the 79 runs good, I adjust the shifter, put it into "R" 
and it dies. Will not start AND run again.

Any suggestions?

Several great replies. I checked the coil wire hook up and it was 
correct, I checked the vacuum lines and everything was still 
attached. I put 5 gal of gas in because the fuel gauge does not seem to work...

Remember this 'problem' started when I tried to put it into reverse? 
I checked the ( 
http://www.thesamba.com/vw/archives/info/wiring/baybus_79.jpg current 
track 63 thru 67) back up light fuse (S21) and found it blown. I 
looked at the wiring diagram again just can't see how the fuse would 
affect the ability to stay running. No matter, it was something wrong 
so I changed it and the van ran!  This really beats me, maybe the 
whole mess is wired backwards? Lot of wire checking to be done I guess...

Oh ya, no reverse now at all. I guess it's time to mess with that some more.

I do appreciate the help, thank you.
