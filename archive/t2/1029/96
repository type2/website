Subject: Re: My rear hitch

Hi Alan...
did you ever get around to using the hitch I sold you?  It is made with 3/8 
thick x 90 deg angle that transverses the bus.. and it doesn't need to be 
welded to the bumper. 

"There is a 45 degree 1/4 round piece of thick metal " confooooses me! lol
that is easy tho...
it sounds like you have angle iron there 1/4" thick ,, and the point of the 
90deg angle is pointing down...  I can't picture a "round piece of thick 
metal" with a point! ... lol,, it is sort of like the round house , built so 
the parents can't "corner" the kids! lol hahah.. dumb joke eh? 

The 90deg angle "iron" that I use on my hitches has the "peak down" also.. 
and yes,, water will puddle in there,,, until you step on the gas pedal, and 
as you drive off like a rocket in your bus ;) that water will splash out.. 
or .. when you step on your brakes ,, the water splashes out.. and for sure, 
come august in PEI it will be hot enough to evaporate! :)
If not,, when ever you wash and wax your bus,, just run the chamois in the 
puddle to sponge it out. 

If the paint is good on the hitch... you shouldn't have to worry about 
rusting.. 

If your using a 1/4" angle.. then a hole smaller than 1/4" wouldn't make any 
structural difference to the hitch.. especially if you could drill the hole 
near the ends ,,or where it is welded to your bumper. 

Hope that helps.. otherwise you might have to get your welder to turn that 
angle around.
