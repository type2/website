Subject: Type 1 motor conversion in a 72 later Bay

Good AM, I am trying to find pictures of a type 1 engine in a 72 later Bay. I am interested in seeing how people made the enine tins or how the fiberglass kit from creative car crafts looks. I also want to see how the mustache support bar was adapted to fit the bug motor.  thanks
