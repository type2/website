Subject: Upholstery Question

I'm getting ready to install new seat covers that I just received from
Sewfine.

The questions I have are:

Should I replace the draw string with stainless steel wire?
Where can I purchase stainless steel wire and what type should I get - solid
or stranded?
What gauge?

I do not have the original rods that were used in the old upholstery. Any
reason I can't use
metal coat hangers or welding rods.

Thanks - Steve
