<becida(-at-)comcast.net>Subject: Gluing light fixtures This is on a '79 bus.I have
a rear side marker light that has the rectangular plastic "ring" that is
broken. Is there a 'better' glue to put this back together with?My plan (at
this point) is to use superglue but it would be great to hear from someone
that has done this already.

Glue light fixtures?   Do you mean trying to repair the black part of the red
side marker lens?

If yes, you are better off replacing it with a good used Hella lens.

I hear the Chinese/Taiwan/Brazil or wherever they are from new ones are crap:
