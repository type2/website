Yes, I think that could be it. The gas / liquid inside
the tank expands when hot and vents, there is a burst
of flame. As it gets hotter, the venting becomes more
drawn out. There is not enough heat yet to weaken the
structure of the tank and as long as there is not a
rupture, no oxygen can get inside. Yes, Richard, I
think you win the prize. Put one (more) silver star
next to Ratwell's name. -BaH
