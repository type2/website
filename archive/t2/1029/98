Subject: RE: 71 Westy Brakes

Michael,
Issue #1: I had this issue before, and it turned out that the rubber lines
between the caliper and the hard lines were bad.  Swollen shut on the
inside.  So you push the brake on, force the fluid thru the hose, push out
the piston, apply braking action, then there is nothing there to force it
back thru the swollen on the inside hose.  Except maybe sitting over night,
prying the piston back with a screwdriver... etc.  I would order some new
flexible brake lines for the application.
Issue #2:  Not sure.  Did you try the fitting that is there?

Best of luck.
