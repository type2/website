My original message----This is a '79 bus that I have been messing with for
awhile. I've gotten it to run, actually drove it around the block a couple of
times & did find reverse but it was hard to get into reverse. I adjusted the
shifter and started it and it was idling nicely, I put it in reverse and it
died.Since then I can get it to start when I turn the key to 'start', I can
hear it running but when I let the key go into 'run' it dies. My problem is
the 79 runs good, I adjust the shifter, put it into "R" and it dies. Will not
start AND run again. Any suggestions? Robbecida(-at-)comcast.net Several great
replies. I checked the coil wire hook up and it was correct, I checked the
vacuum lines and everything was still attached. I put 5 gal of gas in because
the fuel gauge does not seem to work... Remember this 'problem' started when I
tried to put it into reverse? I checked the (

thru 67) back up light fuse (S21) and found it blown. I looked at the wiring
diagram again just can't see how the fuse would affect the ability to stay
running. No matter, it was something wrong so I changed it and the van ran!
This really beats me, maybe the whole mess is wired backwards? Lot of wire
checking to be done I guess... Oh ya, no reverse now at all. I guess it's time
to mess with that some more. I do appreciate the help, thank you.

The black wire from the coil + side feeds the fuse for the backups and the
double relay.  The double relay runs the fuel pump.

Someone has wired the double relay feed wire to the output side of the fuse
instead of the input side. The fuse originally had two wires on the coil end
and one on the backup end.

Not a bad idea, since the double relay is expensive and has no protection from
a short. But it makes you scratch your head trouble shooting a problem.....

N is the coil and S21 is the fuse for the backups.
