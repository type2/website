Subject: RE: [T2] nuts for connecting rods

Nope, do NOT do this.

Reuse your connecting rod nuts or get some new ones. The last thing you want
is one of those suckers coming loose. A little locktite isn't a bad idea but
some say you don't need it. If you are going for a full quality rebuild get
new ones. If you are doing more like a Muir quick and dirty build reuse.
