Have someone turn on the ignition while you listen for a click in the 
engine compartment- that is the double relay- look on the left side
back wall.  If alone, run a jumper wire from the plus on the battery to 
the plus on the coil- voila, you should hear a click.  Push the bus fast 
enough and let clutch out, or jump the starter, and the vacuum in the 
airbox will pull the flapper in the air flow meter open and turn on the 
fuel pump via a microswitch so you can drive.

  Where is the double relay located (physically)?
