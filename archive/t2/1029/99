Subject: brake pull

have a strange problem.  (78 Auto tranny)

when I start driving my brake system works fine and I could do a hand
off panic stop from 40mph straight and true.
but the more I drive and basically the more I brake the van starts
pulling more and more to the right.

brake pads and all hoses are less than two years old and under 5,000k
on them. completely flushed system when installed.
uses no fluid and can find no signs of leakage.

pistons in front calipers moved freely when I last changed the pads.

got me scratching my head??

thanks

Bob
