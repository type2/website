Subject: Re: [T2] Rear Bumper Bolts - late bay

Interestingly enough and for whatever unknown reason, the printed 74 Parts
Book I have, the Parts Fiche, or ETKA - they do not show these bolts for the
73-79 Rear Bumper, but after a quick phone call to a buddy with a 76 gave me
the size and quantity - 4 per bumper (to the bracket) and they are 8x25mm.

The 113707191B (25mm) Chrome Bolts are also for Beetle Bumpers up to 67.
Sure, they can be substituted for the 15mm variety, which were used on Ghia
Bumpers (56-74) and Beetle (68-79).  These were originally 8x20 Carriage
Bolts, but were superseded by VW to the 8x25mm variety.  8x15 was not used
on Buses to the best of my knowledge.
