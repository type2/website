A muffler shop should be able to get them back to normal. They deal in
stainless mufflers and will be set up to weld your flange back on.

I've read last years thread "Can we weld new exhaust manifold flanges?" and
have concluded that I cannot. So can anybody recommend a welder to fix a
flange that is not yet totally separated from the manifold? I'm assuming
it'd be good to tack it in place before separating the manifold from the u
tube a.k.a. elbow. 

Let me say that I have welded a few times but I'm unlikely to manage this
myself. Any help, advice, or caveats are appreciated.
