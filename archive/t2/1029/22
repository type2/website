Hey Alan,, did you try Napa ... does Lee MacDougall still work there at the
Brudenell Centre?
They deal with Altrom.. so if they don't carry the Mann or Bosch filters,,
they can order them in.
Bosch 72137 .. or Mann W920/17   iirc

Of course if you want to drive over to Sherwood.. you can talk to Clarence
at Volkswagen!

Make sure you get some of the 20W50 oil that has the SL rating,, it is
getting hard to find!

Hope that helps!
