Subject: 1960 Single Cab Generator Question

Ok, here the situation.  Just bought a project.  My first pre '78 VW.  Needs a
lot of body work but runs OK.  I'm missing one small piece, but important one.
The voltage regulator.  The engine is a replacement, D1195820 and I think it
is a 1970 or 1971 40hp.  Not sure of the size.  Also, it was converted to 12v.
The Generator is a 14v 30A 20.  the part number, remanufactured is 0101 302
111 (DF D+).  No wires are there for the voltage regulator and I'm not sure
what and how to install it.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

thanks in advance.
