Volks,

I am very pleased to announce a special opportunity.

60 Years VW Bulli - The Poster / is now available for purchase.

Cliff Serna, the Photographer of the incredible "60 Years VW Bulli - The
Book" and I are making this poster available in North America.

The poster is a great companion piece to the book or as a stand alone
memento of our beloved VW Buses and Vans.

This is a non-profit fund raising activity for the VW Bus Community PiFF
(Pay it Forward Fund).

100% of the proceeds will go to help someone within our Bus Community.

If you are unfamiliar with "PiFF" it is a small charitable effort I
coordinate to help those within our community that may be in need of
assistance.

The poster is available for $19.99 ea delivered to you in the USA.
