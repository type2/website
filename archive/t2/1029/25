Subject: Re: Gluing light fixtures

I have made repairs to the side marker lenses on my 71, used superglue and  
it worked well, but I was gluing pieces on the edge that had been broken off,  
not the ring as you need to fix.  I would recommend using model airplane  
grade superglue - my experience with the grocery and hardware store variety has  
not been so good.  Tighten the mounting screw only as much as you  absolutely 
have to....
 
If that doesn't work, I think you can still get new ones from Bus  Depot.
