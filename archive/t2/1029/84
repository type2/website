...for not telling me to CHECK MY !(-at-)#$%^ MIXTURE!!!

I replaced the intake gaskets, sleeves, found some minor cracks in the
S-Boot so went to town on those with silicone and rattle can parts dip,
bought a new crap coil, checked my valves twice, etc etc etc.

I had a flash and started messing with the mixture dial, and apparently I
had gone too lean in my post-massivevacuumleaksmogcheck adjustments.

So it couldn't be MY fault for missing that critical step. Must be you guys
for not pointing it out. Bad list. Bad.

=D
