Besides being jumpy at all RPM's, my tach reads?approximately (but, by no means exactly) twice as high as it should, at all RPMs.? I checked it against an optical digital tachometer that I use for model airplanes.? I just put some light colored masking tape on the crankshaft pulley, and the optical tach sees that as a two bladed propeller.

When I connect my dwell/tach test meter, the VDO tach settles down and reads normally, and all three devices (VDO, optical, dwell/tach) agree at all RPMs.? I have to think the problem has to do with noise of some sort, and connecting the dwell/tach filters it out enough to make the VDO behave.

I contacted Siemens/VDO tech support, and they sent me a tech bulletin that recommended the diode method, pretty much verbatim from what I found in the Type2 archives.

Hopefully, I can try this tonight, and I'll report findings.

I tried the diode method, and it didn't change things. Haven't tried the pot idea yet. Though honestly, the jumpy tach only happens at idle for me. When I really want to see the information, it's at higher RPMs when the needle is steady. So I haven't put a lot of time into the problem.
