Subject: Re: help with wiring a VDO tach



I had this problem not so long ago. The list send me this: for the erratic

tach and wiring!



(1) Purchase a diode #1N4005 from your local electronics store i.e. Radio

Shack.



(2) Cut both ends of the diode so each is approx. > inch long.



(3) Crimp < inch female spade connector on the end of the diode with the

silver band.

(4) Crimp butt-splice connector on the other end of the diode.

(5) Crimp the opposite end of butt-splice connector to the wire connected to

ignition signal source.

(6) Connect < in female spade connector used in #3 above to terminal #4 on

the back of the tachometer.

(7) Attach a ground (-) wire to terminal #3.

(8) Attach a switched 12-volt Power wire to terminal #2.

(9) Set switches for the appropriate amount of cylinders.

Gary,



If you were to look at an ignition spark signature on an oscilloscope you'll
notice that the spark rings at the end of the burn duration. This can wig out
the tach as it thinks it's seeing multiple spikes during a single spark
event.



There ate two inexpensive cures I know of:



- wire a 1N4005 diode between Terminal 1 of the coil and the tach wire
(cathode end goes to wire). Sometimes this method works; sometimes not but
it's the
$0.25 solution.



- use a 50kohm potentiometer and wire it like so to damp out the ringing (^
is center tap on pot):



Terminal 1---/\/\/\/\/\/\---gnd

                  ^

                  |

                  +---- VDO tach wire



Start at 0 ohms and increase until you get a stable tach signal at all rpms.

My intuition is telling me that the diode trick should work, as I think it
will eliminate extraneous tach signal zero crossings that may be fooling my
tach.
I happen to have some 1N4004 diodes on hand, which are similar to 1N4005
except mine have only 400 PIV, while the 1N4005 has 600 PIV.
I'm guessing it shouldn't matter.
I might get a chance to try this tomorrow.
