Subject: more info - help installing connecting rods on t4

Also, we found the stamped numbers on the rod (stamped rod number
matches stamped rod-cap number).  When the flywheel end is facing away
from me, with the #3 rod landing to the left, and the rod attached, laid
down to the left, do the numbers face up or down?

btw, this rod has nuts on it.

Thanks,
Mike
