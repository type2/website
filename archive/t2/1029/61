The Back-up light Wire is on the wrong side of the
coil....Sounds like the back-uo light wire is on the
point and cond.side of the coil...I had this problem
with a friends 1971 bus ...we put it back to the hot
side of coil and had a big Laugh...Hope this is your
problem...If not look for cross over short in same area...Tony
