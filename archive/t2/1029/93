Subject: My rear hitch

I had a welder manufacture a hitch for me, he welded it to the bumper.

There is a 45 degree 1/4 round piece of thick metal running from end to
end of the hitch.

It is laying with the peak down and the 45 up.

This allows water to pool just under the bus about 1 inch away from the
back of the bus.

I have heard that the rear of the bus, if rotted out will finish off the
bus.

Would water at 1 inch out do anything bad as it will evaporate, or do I
have to go through the process of removing the bumper and taking it to a
shop for having the pointed end of the metal pointing up?

Drilling holes in the metal is not the answer to me.

The bus has been painted and rocker panelled at the back.
