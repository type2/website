According to most sources, Wix filters are the best domestic filters and are
readily available from Napa as Napa Gold filters. I only use Wix or Mann on
all of my vehicles.

Hi,

I am going to purchase my next oil filter for this spring.

Chrysler has one that mates with our engines, but it has one of those
loaded valves at the bottom of the filter.

Any suggestions?

Alan
