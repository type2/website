Troy, according to Vincent Molenaar and Alexander Prin's book: VW Transporter and Microbus", 'Specification Guide 1967-1979'  L-20E was NOT  an optional paint color from 68-79..  It shows 35 different paint colors available from 73-79 but that color is NOT among them.  The closest that was optional in '74 is L-20B, Brilliant Orange. Chrome Yellow, L-20A, only started becoming available in '76 according to the book.   Greg T.
