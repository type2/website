  Bentley specs
Single Carb engine 114-142 psi .. wear limit 100psi with max 28psi
difference
1700cc 100-135psi wear limit 85psi
1800cc & 2000cc 85-135psi wear limit 71psi
   
  IMHO Bentley and thereby VW were a bit optimistic on these.  From a practical standpoint a nice tight T4 will usually be up there around 120-125 and if one cylinder particularly is falling toward 95-100 it doesn't mean anything acute but it probably means when you tear it down, that one has been a little warmer, has the seats sitting a little lower, a bit more stain down the head where it hasn't been sealing quite normal, etc.  Might mean that one is going to have problems in 10-20k depending on how hard you drive it.  Conversely my old '78 Champagne Westy had #3 sitting at about 85 psi compared to 110-115 on all the others when I bought it at 115k and I drove it till 160k with it showing no worse.  Then we raffled it off to benefit Charlie Ford and I think it was/is? still going.  Total aside anyone know what became of that bus, guy down around Pax River MD won it.
