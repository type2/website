Are you interested in authentic appearance or in function?

If it is function, I'd suggest that you get an internal regulator
alternator.  That way you don't need a regulator, so the overall cost
would not be much more than the regulator alone.  It would certainly be
easier to wire.

Now, if it is a real 40 horse with integral generator stand then my advice
is useless.  I'm talking about a 70 or 71 1500 or 1600 engine.
