Subject: '79, starts but won't run

This is a '79 bus that I have been messing with for awhile. I've 
gotten it to run, actually drove it around the block a couple of 
times & did find reverse but it was hard to get into reverse.

I adjusted the shifter and started it and it was idling nicely, I put 
it in reverse and it died.
Since then I can get it to start when I turn the key to 'start', I 
can hear it running but when I let the key go into 'run' it dies.

My problem is the 79 runs good, I adjust the shifter, put it into "R" 
and it dies. Will not start AND run again.

Any suggestions?
