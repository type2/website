Subject: Re: [T2] 1960 Single Cab Generator Question

Having worked with several of them, the real 40 horse motors did not have generator stands 
cast as part of the case.  The 36 hp motors were the last with that feature.  My very first bus 
back in '74 (a 1960 model) came with what VW refered to as a modified 36 hp, the first 40 hp 
motors put in the busses.  A real pain because most of them failed within a year or so of 
manufacture (at least according to the dealership I got my parts from at the time), so most of 
the parts weren't available anymore.  Anyway, even that case had a bolt on generator stand.
