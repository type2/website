track 63 thru 67) back up light fuse (S21) and found it blown.

The black wire from the coil + side feeds the fuse for the backups 
and the double relay.  The double relay runs the fuel pump.

Someone has wired the double relay feed wire to the output side of 
the fuse instead of the input side. The fuse originally had two wires 
on the coil end and one on the backup end.

Not a bad idea, since the double relay is expensive and has no 
protection from a short. But it makes you scratch your head trouble 
shooting a problem.....

N is the coil and S21 is the fuse for the backups.

Thanks!
Where is the double relay located (physically)?
