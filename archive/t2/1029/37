Subject: Case cylinder studs problem

Well folks I ran into a snag on my type 4 engine rebuild. A cylinder case stud came out when removing heads, in trying to put it back in case it got jammed. Looks like threads in case are slightly damaged. Is there a tap I can use to clean it up or is the case ruined?  Do I need to take to a machine shop or can I repair myself?  I cant get the cylinder case stud back in w/o it binding.  Any suggestions? Case is a 2.0 ED engine code. TYVM  Luckily I have another GD code 2.0 case laying around I will be using for rebuild, but would love to save this case for another rebuild.
