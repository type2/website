I tried the diode method - used a 1N4004 because that's what I happened to have on hand.? The tach works perfectly now, needle is steady and agrees with my reference optical tach at all RPMs.

The tech support guy at VDO was actually quite helpful - sent me a VDO tech bulletin that described the solution quite well.

I ended up installing the diode in the engine bay, right at the coil, between coil terminal 1 and?my new?wire going to the front of the bus, that lands on tach terminal 4 - because I didn't feel like yanking the dash apart again if I didn't have to.? The cathode (banded end) of the diode points toward the tach.? Photos are available if anyone want's them.

It makes me wonder though, if the solution to this problem is that easy, why does VDO not just?build the diode into the tach from the get-go?

I tried the diode method, and it didn't change things. Haven't tried the pot idea yet. Though honestly, the jumpy tach only happens at idle for me. When I really want to see the information, it's at higher RPMs when the needle is steady. So I haven't put a lot of time into the problem.
