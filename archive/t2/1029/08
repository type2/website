Subject: Friday topic - 75 westy on California
Speedway


I"ve checked out from the type 2 forum during the past few years,
but I wanted to get back online so I could share this video with all of my
fellow airheads. Last weekend my co-pilot/wife Sue and I attended a racing
event at California Speedway in Fontana . While there, we were told we could
have a chance to take our personal car onto the road course for a modest
donation to charity, so we jumped at the chance to take our 75 westy hard top
out for a few laps. Let me tell you that the bus was received with cheers and
many thumbs up as we went onto the track. We also had some in-car video
footage that is pretty cool:

During the video, as I begin to gain speed you can hear stuff
in our campmobile falling all over the place and even some tire screeching as
we begin to take corners more aggressively. By the end, we were taking it to
the absolute limit..
