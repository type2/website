Subject: Tachometer Installed

It went pretty smoothly, except that it does not read correctly.  This  is 
the VDO model # 333 051D, 3 3/8" diameter, that fits in the hole where the  
clock would normally go.
 
The needle bounces around and the readin averages about twice what it  
should. I set the dip switches for 4 cylinders, according to the  instructions.  
What's wierd is, when I hook up my dwell/tach test meter to  the coil in the 
usuall way, the VDO tach is stable and reads correctly.  As  soon as I take my 
test meter off, the VDO gets flakey again.
 
VDO has a tech support #, guess I'll try that, but if anyone has any  
ideas....
 
I have pictures of the install, if anyones needs them.
