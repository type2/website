Hi Volks,

OK, the bill just came due to book Heber Down for BOTC, so now I need to 
get in some funds to cover it.

The first 20 people to respond and $END CA$H (or paypal) will be able to 
take advantage of the special one-time low low rate of $15 for the 
entire weekend!

Paypal payments should be sent to greg-potts *AT* Rogers.com . If you'd 
rather pay cash, send me an email off-list and we'll work something out.

The eighth annual ozone-friendly BOTC will take place August 8th-10th, 
2008 at the usual great location. Visit the website for more 
information: www.busesofthecorn.com

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
