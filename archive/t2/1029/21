Subject: Gluing light fixtures

This is on a '79 bus.
I have a rear side marker light that has the rectangular plastic 
"ring" that is broken. Is there a 'better' glue to put this back 
together with?
My plan (at this point) is to use superglue but it would be great to 
hear from someone that has done this already.
