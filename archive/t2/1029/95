Michael -

Issue #1 -  That you can pry the pads back indicate the caliper pistons
aren't stuck, so my next place to check and replace are the Brake Hoses.
After 35+ years, you may have the originals on there and they could have
become swollen to the point where fluid doesn't easily pass through.

Issue #2 - Actually the tube coming off the Manifold was was for 1/2" (12mm)
Hose.  Any reduction in size may reduce the effectiveness of the vacuum
signal to the servo.  They did make a Single Port Intake Manifold that had
the correct size pipe connection - It was for the Auto-Stick Beetles & Ghias
68-70 and was originally used to activate the Auto Solenoid and Clutch
Servo.  This would be perfect for your application, but finding one of these
will be challenging at best.  Try Derek at Wayout Salvage in Arkansas,
betcha he's got a few of these. (479-665-4126)
