Subject: Rear Bumper Bolts - late bay

How many CHROME rear bumper bolts are used on the late bay (1978 VW Type 2).

I see FOUR X 2 square holes on the bumper, but only  THREE x 2 holes on the
bumper brackets

These are NOT the (4) 17mm *bolts* holding the *bumper* to the body, but
these bolts:

I measured the bolts, and they are 15mm, but what are the 25mm bolts used
for??

Also, can I use the 25mm instead of the 15mm??  I would be saving  $.02 per
bolt.
