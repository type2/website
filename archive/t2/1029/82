Yeah, it would help if Ron put a bit more effort into his site and was a bit
more descriptive of the items he lists.  But....there's a LOT of numbers to
deal with too.  Here you go, courtesy of VW's ETKA:

281 843 718 A = Round Sealing Gasket, Outside Sliding Door Handle, Type 2
74-79

025 101 109 B 01C = Black Cap on Upper Left of Crankcase for Automatic Trans
Flexplate Bolt Access (for when removing the engine on automatics).
Installed on Type 2 73-79, 411/412 70-74 and All Vanagons Gas
Air/Wassercooled 80-91 regardless of transmission installed.
