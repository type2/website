Subject: Re: [T2] '74 bus color confirmation

Let me provide a little clarity.  Bus is orange in the sense. The areas
being touched up are being applied with L-20E, which the painter ordered. 
My concern is that may not be the color of the bus and it won't match up
right. Thinking the painter may have ordered it seeing that it closely
matched but that the L-20E was only for the Thing. Now, white balance
aside, I am having a hard time trying to figure out what color the bus is
from online pics.  It could have been repainted with L-20E in the past,
making this whole thing a non-issue.  To clarify what I needed confirmed,
I think I just want to make sure that the L-20E indeed was NOT a color
that was available from the factory for a bus.

Peace, Troy
