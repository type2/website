should is one thing, can is another.  depends on how long you want it to
last. each cam lobe and lifter machine themselves together, hence why books
say to keep them matched to the journal they rode on.  Crappy engine
builders don't care about that "rule" , as they may doubt the reason behind
the "rule", or want it cheaper

its only  $20 to get stock ones reground at rimco, to mate with your new or
reground cam.  Heck of a lot cheaper than taking it apart and putting a
newer cam in it because it wore out again,  in my opinion.

There is a book you may benifit from for this and many other questions,
entitled How to Rebuild your VW air cooled engine, by Tom Wilson.

The question on if the cam is the same or not, I have read many places they
are different grinds, hydraulic vs mechanical. Will they work in place of
each other, why not, will they work as originally designed, nope.
