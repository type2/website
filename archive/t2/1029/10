Subject: Gauge Wiring

A while back someone had inquired as to how to route wiring from the back  of 
the bus to the front for CHT, OP, OT gauges and the like.  I just  finished 
pulling a new wire for my tachometer, and have a series of photos that  show 
the pathway I used for the runing the wiring.  You can see the wires  for my , 
OP, OT gauges that have been in place for years, as well as follow the  
progress of running the new wire for the tachometer.  The sequence starts  in the 
engine bay, and ends in nose of the drivers compartment.
 
I don't have a photo sharing site set up, so I'll just email these to  anyone 
who is interested.  If somebody want's to put them up somewhere,  you're more 
than welcome to do so.
 
Rusty
