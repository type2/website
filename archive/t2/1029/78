Subject: help installing connecting rods on t4

I'm installing connecting rods on a t4 crankshaft and we're trying to 
figure out which way to install them.  There are no raised forge marks 
on the rods.  Does anyone have any advice on which way they're supposed 
to be installed?  This is a 2 liter 76 stock build.

Thanks!
Mike
