Subject: '74 bus color confirmation

Can someone please confirm that L-20A (Chrome Yellow) was one of the color
options for this year?  We are seeing that L-20E (Amber) was an option for
that year also, but only for the Thing.  I've looked at ratwells stuff and
a few other references online but would like to confirm for sanity sake.

Peace, Troy
