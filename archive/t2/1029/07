Hi Courtney,

I bought my replacement cables at Canadian Tire. The (+) cable was 48" 
long and the (-) 12". On the westfakia I also run a second ground cable 
from the chassis to the fan shroud as an insurance policy for the FI 
system as the braided ground cable between the chassis and the 
transmission is fairly corroded on my bus.

Happy Trails,
