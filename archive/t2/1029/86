Subject: Question about rocker arms

So, we're building up a new engine and I have a few sets of rocker arms. 
  One is from a 73/74 engine that was converted to hydraulics and I 
think it has springs between the rocker arms.  I'm pretty sure my sets 
('76) have spacers with the springy washers.

So are there any differences in the rocker arms?  We're building up a 
2liter with hydraulics.

Thanks!
Mike
