Subject: 71 Westy Brakes

I have a 71 Westy and I finally got a single-port 1776 put in it from a dune
project that I bought off TheSamba (look for the dune body to be sold in the
future).  In any event, now I am having front brake issues...

Issue #1 - Front calipers won't let go.  You can take the tires off and pry
the pads back.  I don't know what the issue is yet but suggestions for what to
look for would be great.  It may be related to issue #2 (see below) but I
wouldn'think that would cause the caliper to grip and not release (right?).

Issue #2 - Brake vacuum line.  The single port intake had a vacuum outlet just
below the carb but it was rather small (about 1/4").  I don't know if I am
getting the volume of vacuum I need compared to the old dual port intake that
was on the old motor (the old one look like about 3/8").  Advice?  I thought
about drilling and tapping a bigger vacuum on the intake where the smaller one
is now.  Suggestions?  How much vacuum is needed?

Any words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
