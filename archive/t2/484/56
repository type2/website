This is not directed toward Mark....

Come on people it was a good story. Yes drop lites are dangerous and so are 
repairs near or dealing with gas, it is FLAMMABLE! Drop lite does not reffer 
to the action it takes(the dropping) it refers to the cord. I could go on 
and on like this thread about drop lites.

OK OK OK I am sorry for the upheaval of emotion but this weekend after 
digging into my '77 Westy I discovered... not only has the PO removed the 
original Fuel Injection including almost anything attached to it, but I 
started to clean of the top of the case that was exposed and found a big, 
fat, ugly   GEX sticker facing me. Original engine my F*&%$#(-at-) Ass.

So what's the scoop on these GEX jobs?
Anybody out there that can tell about experiences or something  I can look 
for to diagnose the origin of this engine?
Are the GEX engines as bad as I have read? I have never read a good review 
about them except for the occasional add in HotVWs(their own).

Thanks to all and apologies as well,
