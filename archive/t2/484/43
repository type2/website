Tom,
You are absolutely correct with this thought process--
However, I believe that it wasn't the 110 volts that created the
problem--
It was the difference in the heat of the bulb, and the cold gas dripping
on it--

There wasn't much of it from the get go---all it took was the bulb to
break--a spark from the filament of the bulb--and we had ignition--

The fluorescent lamps usually have a clear plastic cover over the tubes-
and they do run cooler that the incandescent bulbs--so I think that the
chance of the Big Bang is 90 times less--

Hey--the Titanic wasn't supposed to sink--remember??
Anything can happen I guess--but in this case I believe the fluorescent
is a better deal--

Take Care--

Terry

Terry- I've got a fluorescent trouble light in my near future, as soon
as I get to a FLAPS. Are we sure they still couldn't be a firestarter
too though? Still electric after all?
