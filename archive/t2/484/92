well they remove the serial number and put one of their own on the case,
all that I've seen start with GEX#######

also there is a heat sensing device near the oil pump on the case, looks
sort of like a dounut about an inch in diameter, it changes color if it
overheats (and voids the warranty)

also I have never seen one that doesn't leak oil, even worse than normal,
mine used more than a qt in 500 miles, "brand new"

wheeeee don't do that.

just remember every now and again they screw up and build an engine that
lasts a while.
