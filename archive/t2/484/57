"Hhhmmm....you bring up a good issue I've never thought of.. the crankcase
breather hose is just cut off, like the evap. lines.  There is a canister.
Where should the breather hose go to? Right to air cleaner like the evap.
(then canister) lines?
I think Richard Atwell has a photo on his site of hoses routing?
With a non-stock K&N plain filter on top of a single carb, what would be
the way to do this, if the case?  -Chris"


First off I'm still not exactly certain what you are talking about when you
say single carb? If you are referring to a single solex on an upright motor
(1600) than my advice would be get the stock oil bath air cleaner and hook
up the hoses per Bentley or other sources. If you are talking type IV motor
(1700-2000) with a single 2 barrel progressive carb than you can do what I
did with my 72' when I ran that carb. Take the bottom flange of the filter
housing and unbolt it from the carb. Drill a 1/2" diameter hole near the
corner but where it will not interfere with the filter or the carb. Go to
FLAPS get a plastic or metal pipe nipple fitting that has machine threads
on the one end, (not NPT threads), get a nut that will fit those threads
and bolt the nipple onto the filter housing. Now you can attach your
breather and fuel evap lines. Basically what you are tyring to do is get
the crankcase vent and evap lines into the intake airstream.

Perhaps there are others out there running the 2BBL Progressive carbs that
can post a picture of how they have their crank breather line attached?
