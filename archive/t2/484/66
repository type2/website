Subject: Re: [T2] California Exhaust for sale

> I am taking offers for a complete california exhaust
 system from an 83 aircooled california vanagon 2.0L
 not including the right heat exchanger but including
 the left pipes off of the manifold are included.
 Highest bidder gets it and pays shipping, i pulled it
 off of my vanagon and went to a 72-74 exhaust so it is
 still in good condition.
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

I am confused.... 79 to 83.5 2.0L bus/Vanagon engines have square exhaust ports. 72 to 78 are oval port. How
did you get the oval port manifolds to bolt up to square port heads??
Or did you change the heads also?
