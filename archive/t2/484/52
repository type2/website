Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Evaporation line 

The line from that T should go to a tap on your charcoal canister.  There
are three taps on the canister.  Two are about 1 cm  and one is 3mm.  The
theory is that gas vapors will exit the tank through the small lines,
pass through the T and head for the charcoal where they are trapped by the
charcoal.  Then the big hose from the fan shroud blows them off the
charcoal and into the air intake where they are burned.

This would be truly worst.  If the rest of your vent hoses are intact and
you seal that T you would "run out of gas" once a sufficent vacuum built
up in the tank.  Opening the tank would relieve the vacuum and you could
go another couple of miles and then do it again.  If you choose not to
reconnect the charcoal canister just leave that T open to atmosphere.

The first paragraph had it best IMHO. Librarian is correct in the sealing
of your vent lines as not a good idea. Leaving them vented to the
atmosphere is not a good idea either though. If you over fill your fuel
tank raw gas will come out of the T and drain where? Into your engine
compartment? Not so good. You should be able to get that charcoal canister
working easily enough. If you don't have one I am sure some kind listee or
Busted Bus could help. All of the recent talk of gas spills and fire should
have us all pondering our fuel lines and vent hoses... Just my $.02 as
always YMMV.
