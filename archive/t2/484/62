Subject: gas tank vents

I'm curious about the T connector you have in your van.  My two vent tubes
were just hooked together with an L shaped hose.  When it cracked last
summer it filled the entire interior of the van with a very strong smell of
gas.  I replaced it with a length of tubing from the local NAPA store and it
works fine again.  Should I really be hooking this whole thing up to the
charcoal canister??
