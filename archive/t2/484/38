The line from that T should go to a tap on your charcoal canister.  There
are three taps on the canister.  Two are about 1 cm  and one is 3mm.  The
theory is that gas vapors will exit the tank through the small lines,
pass through the T and head for the charcoal where they are trapped by the
charcoal.  Then the big hose from the fan shroud blows them off the
charcoal and into the air intake where they are burned.

This would be truly worst.  If the rest of your vent hoses are intact and
you seal that T you would "run out of gas" once a sufficent vacuum built
up in the tank.  Opening the tank would relieve the vacuum and you could
go another couple of miles and then do it again.  If you choose not to
reconnect the charcoal canister just leave that T open to atmosphere.

                             OOK!
