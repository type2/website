Ted,

      So there might be hope. I am having problems though. I have driven 
this ride only about 1 mi. totall. This is just like I just got it but it is 
not ready for the road. Windows out etc. But I have been checking out the 
engine and related. I am grafting the as is to the as was...as should be. 
Damn it goes farther and farther. But no the GEX at seems okay. This 
ambition box in the rear of my Westy has a story to tell. I just need to 
spend some time with her, feel her out every knook and crannie. But mean 
while I have to research th epros and cons of the GEX heart of this new gal.

Thanks,

Michael Knight

'77 Westy AT "Green Machine" aka "el Verde"
