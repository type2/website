Subject: Re: [T2] 79 FI will not start

Did you pull off one of the injectors to see if gas squirted out?
Also, Are you certain it is timed properly and the points are set properly. 
Do you have spark at the spark plugs ?
Let us know more specifically what does/ does not happen when you try to 
start it.
