Subject: Fuel Evaporation line 

There were some recent threads on this, and it
motivated me to replace mine.  Unfortunately one was
completely missing and I can't determine where it goes
?

77, fuel injected, all original (except for missing
parts !).

I've got a great diagram from the type library by
Richard Atwell.  What I can't determine is where the
fuel evaporation lines that are on the top of the
engine compartment at the back of the bus...they meet
in a T, this is where mine stop, the other end of the
T goes nowhere and there is no hose.  Looking at the
diagram it looks like it goes to the air cleanear or
the charcoal cannister, but I'm not sure.  Also there
is no place to connect it to either, is it supposed to
T into something.  

Worst case scenarion I was going to replace the T with
a simple connector, is this a problem ?

Any help appreciated.

Thanks  
Bob
