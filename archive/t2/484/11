Subject: 78 FI won't start.

Sorry to repost.  Spent some time trouble shooting this morning.  It
appears as thought the fuel relay may be bad.  After following the
procedure in Bently, we could not get any parts of the relay to test
positive using the ground from terminal 85 but they tested just fine
when grounding to the body.  Anyone else experience a ground in the fuel
relay going bad?  Just throwing some feelers out there before I sing
$65-95 into a new relay.

 

Cheers,


Duke

Not sure what to make of this one.  Went to start it up on a cold day.
It fired right up and I let it run for about four or five minutes.
Backed out of my parking spot, put it in first, gave it some gas and it
died.  At first I thought I just stalled it, so I restarted it, let it
run for a minute, and then it died again before I even put it in gear.
And would not start after that.  The engine turns over but it won't
catch.  I think it might not be getting spark but I'm not sure.  Any
help is appreciated.

 

Cheers,


Duke
