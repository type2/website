Karl,
I bought a 71 only gen for my 71 a while back and when I went to hook it up,
same problem the pulleys didn't line up.  At that time the list told me I
had the wrong backing plate.  Someone in town gave me a bug gen that worked
and was well till it died.

Unfortunately the backing plates are not interchangeable.  The 6V is correct
and original.  With the 6V gen it is thinner than the 12 V one so the
backing plate holes don't line up.  The backing plate I had on the 12 V
engine was flat.

The 6V gen if measured from where it connects to the original 65 backing
plate to the V is 6 5/8. If measured from the flat part of the backing plate
to center of V 7 1/4 maybe 7 1/16.
