Subject: 72 & 75 VW buses For Sale

  Posting this for a friend of my moms son. 1972 and 1975 VW buses for sale,
don't even know what styles they are.  Says 72 in bad shape, 75 good. Call
Philip Reichard 707 928-5674. They are in Middletown Calif. where ever that
is. Might be your chance to score a couple FC's for a good price.  Don't call
me about them, call Philip.
