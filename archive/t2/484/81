I will start by saying "You are SURE the ignition system is functioning?"
because that is where 85% of "FI" problems are finally solved.  Then I
will remind you that an additional 12% can be found by checking vacuum.
10-12"  during cranking is needed.  If you don't have that then look at
all the hoses and elbows.

Once you get that out of the way then I see your complaint of "buzzing"
and think that if the FI grounds located under the air distribution box
come adrift that all sorts od wiernesses occur.  Check also the ground
wire from the double relay plug to the body at the double relay.

Fuel pressure gauges for FI can be bought at any automotive supply house.
The will cost $50-60 and should register pressures to 60psi.

                             OOK!
