Hello Guys     I was told that 85% of  shop fires were caused by the old 
stlye drop lites. I changed to fluorescent a long time ago.  I get mine from matco 
or snap-on  I had one that had a hard case that would blow the bulb every 
time it dropped. Got rid of it was costing too much in bulbs. Later and have fun
