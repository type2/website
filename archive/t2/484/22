Hello Mick,

Is this what your seeing?

http://home.comcast.net/~awisniewski/vw/CVjoint-cap.jpg

I'm sorry I can't answer you question but it does appear that Bentley
VW manual made for this item saying "early models"  Maybe it was 
thought to be unnecessary on later models???  My 77 bus doesn't have
these caps. And a '78 I worked on didn't have these either.

Someone please verify this for me.
Also Mick said in an early post his bus is a '69.

Alex
