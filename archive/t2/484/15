As I recall, you're supposed leave the 2 connectors to the relay in place,
then sneak a probe up along the wire leading to the ground terminal (is that
terminal 85?) and leave it there while probing the rest of the terminals
with the other lead of the tester.  Further, if I'm thinking about this
correctly, the first few "probes" essentially are checking that power is
getting to the relay.  If I've got it right, then those first few tests
should work rather you're grounding to the body or grounding to the ground
terminal; after all, the wire from the grounding terminal is just leading to
the body.  So, it seems like either you weren't grounding to the right
terminal or the wire from that terminal to ground is bad.
