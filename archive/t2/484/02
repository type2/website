Hi Terry,
Yikes!  Good to hear all is well with you Terry!!

  Any spark will probably ignite gas vapors.  Anytime one has even the 
smallest amount of gas opened to the air there are vapors.  One of the early NEATO 
presidents was badly burnt and lost his garage with the split screen bus inside 
it due to working under the bus on the gas lines.  When he had gas dripping 
down suddenly he slid a steel pan to get it under the drip.  The steel of the 
pan against the concrete caused a spark.......

  Eric had a cousin in law burn himself badly when working the gas lines 
under a school bus he was converting into a RV.  Hospitalization and lots of pain 
killers got him readdicted to drugs....
