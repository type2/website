Subject: Re: fluorescent trouble light

""Terry- I've got a fluorescent trouble light in my
near future, as soon as I get to a FLAPS. Are we sure
they still couldn't be a firestarter too though?
Still electric after all?""""
--Any electrical device can be a fire starter. However
the light you want to look for will have a plastic
sleeve
around the bulb and the transformer will be remotely
located from the light down the cord a ways. It should
be
housed in a sealed rubber/plastic box. Plugging it in
could cause a spark so plug it in and capture it to
the
plug so that you dont cause a spark by inadvertantly
pulling it from the plug. Of course plug it in before
starting work that will release fumes.
  In short... look for a light that looks to be
completly
sealed up. On the good ones (expensive) there will be
some
words to the effect of being explosion resistant.. at
least that has been my experience with these. These
are the only kind of portable light allowed where I
work. (Large aircraft manufacturer)
