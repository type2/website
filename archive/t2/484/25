Hello all,
Im new to the group and new to volkswagens. I have a
74 standard beetle and a 68 bus that is in so so shape
but im GOING to restore it its one of those things
that I just have to..........anyhow does any one know
where i can get a fully rebuilt engine and
transmission that is complete.....my bus didnt come
with either. Thinking further into the future but i
need to start looking
Got alot of work to do on the floor panels and the
front under the windshield too...rusted out......but
all in all i think its in pretty decent shape.

Thanks
Rus
