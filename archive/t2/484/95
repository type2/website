Subject: RE: [T2] Solar panel and propane heater?

I have two of my VW's parked for the better part of the year--and swap
them around in the summer--using the 85 GL for the winter horse--

I have a few VW solar panels always plugged into the ones that are in
the storage mode--
The VW solar panels don't put out many amps--like miliamps--but is
enough to keep the batteries fresh and topped off--
When it's time to do the yearly switcharoo---they vehicles always fire
right up-

I don't think it's how much juice the battery gets--just as long as it's
getting something--

The only problem was to have a hole cut and sewn into the cover's in the
winsheild area, sothe panels would get some solar energy--whch worked
out pretty good--

Later,

Terry

Howdy,
I've been using a solar battery charger for a couple of years now, and
have been pleased with the results. I got a pretty cheap one, but
haven't had any problems with lack of charging ability or lack of power.
I would recommend using a deep-cycle battery in your Bus, but have used
the charger with a regular car battery. YMMV.
Good luck!
