Yo Paul,
Just for grins, dribble some gas on that plastic coated bulb---let me
know what happens--
No cheating now--make sure the bulb is lit and good and hot first--:>)

Later,

Terry

 
another way to prevent the same problem would be to get the rubber
coated bulbs from the home depot and such places. this is what we used
in the navy and the ones at the home depot seem quite similar. i've had
one on mine for years now and have never bustes it or blown it out even
though it has been droppes many, many times.
