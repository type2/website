I'm sorry I can't answer you question but it does appear that Bentley
VW manual made for this item saying "early models"  Maybe it was 
 thought to be unnecessary on later models???  My 77 bus doesn't have
 these caps. And a '78 I worked on didn't have these either.
 
 Someone please verify this for me.
Also Mick said in an early post his bus is a '69.

That cap does not show up at all in my 68-72 parts book. Neither pictured nor listed in the 
text. I looked at both the axle section and the differential section.
The 68-70 factory repair manual makes no mention of it either.
