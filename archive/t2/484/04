Subject: part Question CV joint/transaxle

Hello,
 
I've just installed a new transaxle.  At the end of the CV joint I mean at the very end where it meets the transaxle there is a thin metal sort of a dish or bowl that fits into the depression in the side of the transaxle where the CV bolts up.
When i dissasembled mine this piece was dented on one side and missing on the other.
George replied (thank you) to say that the dished washer between the CV and the Shaft can be left out according to bentley. But i'm not sure I explained it properly. This is not really a washer I don't think or is it??
 
By the way I should pack some grease in there too no?
 
Many thanks
Mick
