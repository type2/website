Hi Rus
Welcome to the list!

You'll find http://type2.com/ very interesting,, browse the library from
the links on the left side...

you might have to float between the type2 and vintage bus due to the year
of your bus.

One thing you should point out when you ask questions,,, where are you
located, it isn't impossible to ship an engine, but you might find someone
nearby is very helpful

Also, are you planning on going stock, or modified a bit...?

I was going to suggest you could install a late bay transmission, but I
think you still need the early bellhousing..

Are you looking for all the parts to go with the engine,, tin, hanger, etc?

Good luck!  be specific and I am sure you will have success!
