Subject: Bad CV Joint

I am suspecting that I have a bad CV joint - a couple days ago it started to
make some noise - rapid tapping /knocking sound that seems to be it concert
with the speed of the rear wheel - It comes and goes - I can hear a click
when I spin the rear wheel - It always goes a way - it did this for a few
mins last summer and when I took it apart it went away- didn't reappear for
4mos.
Does this sound like a likely candidate ? There does seem to be a bit of
play in the suspect wheel

Thanks
Eric
