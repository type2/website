Subject: EGR and Vented gas cap

Hello,

As usual I wanted an opinion from the group on two things. First the PO
of my '77 FI westy took off the EGR. Question is by not having an ERG on
the FI bus am I really doing harm to my bus? Or should I just use high
octane gas to avoid potential knocking? The head temp usually runs
around 350 and always has for me.

Second question is I had a problem recently with the fuel breather
system, but replaced all the connecters except behind the fire wall. I
will do them when I pull the engine and gas tank in the future. I did
get a vented gas cap to make sure I would not have a problem. Is a
vented gas cap wrong am I missing something? Do others use vented gas
caps too?

Thanks

Meg
