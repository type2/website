Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Evaporation line 

This question then arises.. what to do with the open T if you have no air cleaner but a simple filter on top of the carb? Is it OK to have tee into the canister but then have the canister open to atmosphere?
 
The first paragraph had it best IMHO. Librarian is correct in the 
sealing
of your vent lines as not a good idea. Leaving them vented to the
atmosphere is not a good idea either though. If you over fill your fuel
tank raw gas will come out of the T and drain where? Into your engine
compartment? Not so good. You should be able to get that charcoal 
canister
working easily enough. If you don't have one I am sure some kind listee 
or
Busted Bus could help. All of the recent talk of gas spills and fire 
should
have us all pondering our fuel lines and vent hoses... Just my $.02 as
always YMMV
