They're not black like the Brazil ones...I really don't know either as I'm
not the expert.

I saw a Sachs clutch kit in a bus at the junkyard today. The pressure plate
was rusty on one side, shiny on the flywheel side, the disk was new and both
stamped Made in Germany. There was an INA German pilot bearing, and a Made
In Germany throwout bearing in a separate box in the kit. Attached to the PP
and disc were bright orange made in Mexico stickers. Sure enough on closer
inspection of the disk, a la Dr. Tim, the rivets were horrible. At least the
alignment tool was nice.

I understand this reality but it doesn't mean there aren't a few truly
German parts still available in small quantities does it? I'd like to think
some still are.

Case in point: I've found Genuine VW German FI hoses (22 molded hose, decel
valve hose), rear side marker holders, Mera headlight switches, side
markers, shift rod bushings, etc. All of these items are "NLA" but some are
still out there: you just have to look really really really hard. That's the
unfortunate part.

Richard at OEVeedub doesn't have a huge catalog but it largely consists of
German made parts as the company namesake implies. If he discovers otherwise
he will discontinue stocking the item.
