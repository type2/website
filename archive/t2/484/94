I was wondering is there anything here I might try and salvage. I think I 
have made the decision of not keeping the engine. But it is like toilet 
paper I am not going to go without wiping if it is not Charmin. I am stuck 
now but rethinking what I am going to do, what to keep. In ref. to GEX do 
they build with VW cases or are they an aftermarket? Heads, crank, P/Cs, 
etc? Should I just be thinking about a long block from a rep. dealer that 
might take this core?
