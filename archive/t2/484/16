With that in mind....well, sort of.... the 2 backing plates I took off my 77 are in good shape. The leaf
springs are still on the adjuster bodies. The only wear on them are the round adjusting holes.... they are no
longer round from adjusting the brakes over the past 297,000 miles.
All I have in them are the $2 each core charge. If anyone wants them for $4 + postage, let me know. Otherwise
they go back to the yard with the drums and shoes.
