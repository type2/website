another way to prevent the same problem would be to
get the rubber coated bulbs from the home depot and
such places.  this is what we used in the navy and the
ones at the home depot seem quite similar.  i've had
one on mine for years now and have never bustes it or
blown it out even though it has been droppes many,
many times.
