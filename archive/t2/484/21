Did you do your 2,000 rpm break-in "first run" for 20 minutes, and then have
smoke after that?  I'd say there's only 2 logical sources then, either it's
running way too rich (black smoke, strong gas smell) or it's burning oil
somehow (blue smoke, oily smell.)   Absent that, I'd say a new engine
shouldn't smoke.
