Howdy all:

I am dealing with a highly irritating carb situation here.  It is causing me
to go into fits and generally affecting my mood.

I bought a new 34PICT-3 from Busdepot about 4 years ago, and it's been a
fine carb up until a few months back when it started to stall.  Blew out the
auxiliary air valve and all seemed to be well until the anti-diesel valve
rattled loose and caused the same symptom.  But now the thing is leaking
around the butterfly shaft just like my 30-year-old version of the same carb
was doing.  Which was a major reason that I replaced it.

My carb is leaking bad enough now that I am no longer driving the bus due to
fear of catastrophic explosion.  I come in search of info...Should I:

1.  Get carb re-bushed (any rec's on where to get that done?)

2.  Buy 30PICT-1 and adapter plate for dual port (pros, cons?)

3.  Buy another older 34 in good shape ( I gave away my spare)

4.  Get Weber, problem solved (or is it)

Please be aware that my budget (appprox $15) will not allow for many
options, and I am also an insanely cheap person.  I refuse to buy another
new Solex(Brosol) if it's going to do the same crap this one has.

Is there a perfect solution?
