Subject: Was Just "pondering" with neighbour

Had an "over the fence" with a new neighbour, who used to be a machinist at
VW, and we got to talking about...gaskets!  Was very interesting from my
point, because the 'gist of his 'sermon' was if the machined surfaces from the
factory were 'true'..why, with quality control. and 'micro processors" and
state of the art "everything', would we still need same!  I tried to explain
to him the "aspect' of thermal heat expansion between 'different' surface
materials, but he said..there are no two surfaces that cannot be machined  to
perfection, such as they need only a very 'thin' gasket to seal!  Which
brought me to think of 'thin'...compression.."thick'..torque..and if 'we' have
no 'gauge' to decipher thicknes of gasket needed,..we use 'crush"
gaskets...which makes me sad...because 'we' can fit 'anything to anything",
with a 'crush' gasket.
Cheers (and remember it is Friday)
