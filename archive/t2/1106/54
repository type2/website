  With a little luck, this could well be a trip you'll remember always, in a 
positive sense. My wife and I spent three months camping in rural Europe in 
a Westy, starting in early Spring when few others were out there, and it was 
a blast and inexpensive to boot. Hope you brought along a spare 
generator/fan belt, just in case, and be sure that No. 3 exhaust valve stays 
properly adjusted -- not too tight -- and you oughta be trouble-free. Seems 
that campgrounds, especially state parks, oughta be pretty empty and happy 
for some company. And by all means, post away. You should have a guaranteed 
interested readership here. Cheers...
