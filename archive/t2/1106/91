Correct.  That 2 is just to denote the second decade of this
numbering scheme.  For example, 114 123 456 would be the
123,456th Bug from '64, whereas 114 2 123 456 would be the
123,456th Bug from '74 (second decade).

This is the first sign against it being a factory Westy:
they usually (though not universially) had cloth interiors
in colours like "camping green yellow".

Suspiciously few options for a factory camper, IMHO.

The 3 61 denotes engine, transmission and related options.
Unfortunately, 3 61 does not feature in the list at type2.com;
however note that campmobiles had codes starting with 8 or
9 in that list, which is the third sign.

There's nothing definitive in Volkswagens, but from the canyon
brown leatherette, the few options, and the rather low last 
three digits of the type code I'll wager it started life as 
a Kombi.

AFAIK you can also tell by the colour of the inside sheetmetal
in the cargo area/"living room": body colour on factory Westies,
grey on factory Kombis.  But I'm not 100% sure on that one.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Ermel.
