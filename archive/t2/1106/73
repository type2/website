	Compared with the other methods using immaterial agents 
(heat) or volatile lubricants (petrol  -  gasoline will do if you 
can't get that <:-|), a persistent lubricant on a joint that you 
don't want to slide ever again would seem inherently inferior, no? 
It may slip on real nice, but would tend to slip off easier, compared 
with the methods that leave no persistent lubricant.
