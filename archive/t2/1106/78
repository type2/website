Subject: Cranking a cold, cold bus

The Bopmobile is extremely cold because it's been sitting for over a 
year while I cruised around the world.  I fired her up today.  Or 
tried.  I used a little starting fluid at first but quickly changed to 
pouring small cap-full of gas into the carb.  I had to do that several 
times as she wouldn't run past the cap-full of gas.  She finally started 
turning over without pouring the gas in.  Runs a bit and then dies.  
Seems to be a very regular cycle.  I don't necessarily have to restart.  
If I just pump the gas, she'll start running again but dies if I put any 
load on her.  I pumped out the old gas and put in new and the filter is 
new.  The pump seems to be working fine.  Since it runs, the points and 
other electrical should be good.  I figure the carb is gummed up with 
varnish.  I'm going to let her sit a while and try again.  I hope the 
clean gas will eat through the varnish in the carb.  She also was 
smoking some around the muffler but I hope that's just some old oil 
build-up.  Anything I'm missing?  I've been out of the bus business for 
a long time.  She really hasn't been run much in the last three years as 
I've been traveling.  But I did try to start her up periodically.  I've 
just never gone this long.  Oh yeah, the details:

76 Westy
1.7L
Single Weber (I don't know which one and don't know how to tell)
009 (I hear Karl von Salzen moaning in his grave but it always worked 
well for me)
Front-mounted spare - not C rated (OK, Karl, quieten down!)

I'm a saxophone player, not a mechanic.  But I'm learning.  Thanks to 
you guys and gals. 

Ciao....KR
