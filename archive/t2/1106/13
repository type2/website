Their H4's have been labeled that way for years. I gather that the housings
are made in Sweden and the lenses in Germany, and the whole thing is then
assembled in Germany.  (I don't know if your comment was tongue-in-cheek,
but it is not possible to trademark a phrase like "made in Germany." If a
Bosch product says "made in Germany" then this means they are indeed
claiming it to be made in Germany.)
