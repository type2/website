A thought just occured to me. I see no reason why you couldn't use 
submittals to this list as a maintenance and repair log, as well as a 
travel journal. When you do maintenance or repair, post the details. 
At any point in the future, you can search the archives for a 
complete report via past entries.

On a cross country trip, some days won't have much to report, but 
once or twice per week sould give some sights and occurances of interest.

I, myself, am on the way to going on the road permanently sometime 
this summer. No more rent/utilities. I haven't yet decided if it will 
be in the Bus, or on my BMW Airhead with trailer. I am leaning toward 
the bike. But in a lot ways the Bus makes more sense. I see distinct 
advantages and disadvatages for each when comparing the two. I don't 
really want to sell either of them, but one must go on the block. 
Either way, looks like a 4 corners tour of the USA in my future, and 
I am both excited and apprehensive about it. I know I will be staying 
in touch with this list via public library internet connections along 
the way, and looking to hook up face to face with T-2 and Vanagon 
owner's everywhere.

I have a big todo to do in mid July, then this adventure will 
commence in earnest.
