Subject: Traveling and living in my bus

A week ago I left central Florida, heading west on I-10 in a '70 Westy.

Now, 1800 miles later, I am in Van Horne, Texas, 120 miles  east of El Paso,
and heading for New Mexico in the morning.

So far there have been no problems, , some storiesand adjusting to eating,
sleeping and living in the bus has been easy and enjoyable.

I do not know how long this experiment will last, possibly a year. If anyone
wishes to follow the adventure please email off list and I will be happy to
keep you current with updates, reports, discoveries, photos, campsite and park
reviews, etc.

Happy Busing,

John
