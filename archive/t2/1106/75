I'm with Robt here, although I "doubt" that using a little silicone lube or
even oil would ever cause a problem, I never do it.  I've seen connections so
lubed (likely overlubed) by others spin freely, weeks later, then seep, and
the hose clamp get overtightened in an attempt to compensate. The only
lubricant I consider safe on gas hose is gas, petrol, whatever 8-)  For a
little more lubrication if I had to use something else it would be a smidge
film of diesel or kerosene, but even that will degrade some gas hose in a long
term sense unless rated for it (not from a quick wipe on a barb I figure
though.) Of course me, I'm chancing the heat gun and all, so YMMV.  Save the
silicone grease for O-rings where it belongs I feel.

on a joint that you don't want to slide ever again would seem inherently
