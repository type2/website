Subject: Re: [T2] Best SVDA dizzy.

I am using the Hot Spark SVDA. Works well except at max advance the
timing mark is not steady. Anyone familiar with this symptom and
whether or not it is acceptable? Or how to fix?

I would use the Continentals and be sensitive to how they feel. I had
a 10 year old set of brand new tires (forgot the brand - not well
known) that developed a bulge while I was out in the middle of nowhere
in the hills on Highway 36W.

On the other hand, I had an ancient set of Michelins that were
horribly cracked on the side walls, and I was sure they were
dangerous, but nevertheless not only ran safely at all speeds, but
also refused to wear out.
