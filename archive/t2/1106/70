You can also just roll the rubber stuff back and forth vigorously in your
hands for 30-60s and often soften it enough, also judicious gasoline as a lube
as Richard mentions a good thought.  Rolling cloth covered in your hands won't
do much though if you got that instead, as the cloth covering really prevents
the hose warming up.  VERY judicious application of a true heat gun (to new
hose, without gasoline on it obviously) and I mean VERY judicious use (dancing
in and out of heat gun for seconds only) with a light smear of gasoline on the
fitting for lube is a good trick as well but YMMV there, overheat the hose and
it degrades it, and BOOM, that ain't good on FI hose.
 
Again YMMV, most of the time, even on a 40-50F ambient, with a bit of gas on
the barb, and a good 60s rolling up some fricition heat they go pretty well.

Boil a pan of water. After removing the pan from the burner toss the
hose in it and carry it out to the bus. Take it straight from the pan
(after shaking the water off) and put it on the CSV. It'll pop right
on.
