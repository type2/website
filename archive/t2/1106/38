Subject: steering coupler/horn

Well thanks for all your help and suggestions on the horn issue.

I got a new steering coupler installed while dismantling everything. The
original was cracked. Does anyone know why this is plastic/rubber as opposed
to just a steel plate. I don't know why you would want a little play/give on
this part?

As for the horn, I couldn't really see any problems with the wiring, but
when trying to put the quick connector at the base of the column back on, it
broke. So I cut the wire back a bit, cleaned the end, and crimped on a new
connector, with a plastic cover built in. I hooked everything back up, and
the horn only beeps when I press the button, so I guess it is fixed. Not
sure exactly what I fixed here, but it works.

Anyway thanks for your help, I'd love to try this again with a steering
wheel puller, I'm sure it is easier to do that way. I tried some of the list
and samba forum suggestions on making my own steering whell puller, but just
seemed to be doing damage to the steering wheel, so I gave up on that.

Anyway thanks...
