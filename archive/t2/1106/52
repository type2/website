John,
Why wouldn't a daily report be appropriate for the list? I love trip
reports - probably because I never do road trips myself. Seems daily reports
could be even more interesting than a long one after the fact?

A week ago I left central Florida, heading west on I-10 in a '70 Westy.

 Now, 1800 miles later, I am in Van Horne, Texas, 120 miles  east of El 
Paso,
 and heading for New Mexico in the morning.

 So far there have been no problems, , some storiesand adjusting to eating,
 sleeping and living in the bus has been easy and enjoyable.

 I do not know how long this experiment will last, possibly a year. If 
anyone
 wishes to follow the adventure please email off list and I will be happy to
 keep you current with updates, reports, discoveries, photos, campsite and 
park
 reviews, etc.
