Subject: Is my bus a Westy or not?

Greetings! I am finding the m-code information at type2.com extremely useful,
but darn it, I can't unravel the whole thing. What I'm trying to figure out is
if the 1976 camper bus I bought from my neighbor is a Westy or a Kombi fitted
out to LOOK like a Westy after it got in the U.S. I am a new bus owner and not
an expert, but I don't think the cupboards and such inside look exactly right
to be a Westy judging from the photos I've seen on the Internet. Plus it has
sliding windows on the sides, and so far I think all the Westy's I've seen
have jalousies.

Here what I've figured out so far from the type2.com m-code tables:

My VIN:  23 6 2 076 843

23 = Kombi
6 = model year i.e. 1976 (The model year runs from August of
the previous year until July in the actual year. So Model year 1976 started
in
August 1975 and ended in July 1976.)
2 = you said this is always a 2, no idea why
076 843 = serial number

Option tag:
62  076  843
P4P477    D52   227
02   3  7429    UP  2313   61

P4P4 = exterior color: taigagr|n/sage green (which is still what it is)
77 = interior color: leatherette, canyon brown (which is still what's there,
mostly)
02   3  = production date
02 = second week of the year, so 2nd week of January 1976
3 = day of the week, Wednesday
So my bus was probably ordered on Wednesday, Jan. 7, 1976
D52 = Specifications for the USA, speedometer in miles, sealed beam headlamps,
rear window defroster, back-up lamps, side marker reflectors... (?)
(1974/1976)
227 = Detachable headrest in cab (F 213 2000 001 --)
UP = USA, port: ???
231 = Kombi, sliding door right, LHD

And what I'm stuck on is the 3  61. I can't figure out from the tables how to
decipher that part. Can anybody help?

Any suggestions on what those last three numbers mean? Or any of the other
numbers I haven't figured out? Can any of you folks tell me definitively if
this is or is not a Westy?

thanks so much,
  LJ in AK
