Subject: FI fuel hoses

can someone verify for me that the hose for the fuel rail in an FI bus should
be 7mm x 3mm?  It sure seems to be a tight fit.  I've been buying fuel hose
locally which may be 7.5mm which seems to be a little looser (but still very
secure)...I ask this because in trying to get the 7mm hose on the cold start
valve, it is extremely difficult and I'm afraid I'll break the plastic cold
start valve fitting.  thanks, greg t.
