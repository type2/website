Subject: Rear Main Seal

HEY Everyone,

I finally got a chance to "fix" that oil leak I had on my 69 Westy (type 1
engine).
I pulled the engine in record time, about 15 minutes with hand tools.  Pulled
clutch and flywheel off, replaced the rear main seal which looked really.

SO I think I got it, engine back in fired it up and the leak is worse!  I can
not imagine what I did wrong.  Any ideas?

Thanks

Brian
69 Westy
