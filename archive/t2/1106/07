Alan,
 
type2.com in the technical articles.
 
Adjusting hydraulic lifters, by me, 10+ years ago, quite a treatise on
potential solutions.  Testing is easy, which one or ones is/are soft during
adjustment.   In short though, if you didn't screw up during adjustment, who
really cares, let it tick away, forever.  But...  If you in trying to solve
the problem did overadjust one and it gets held open when it does pump up,
that is a problem.  Don't run Quaker State BTW if you are (I assume that still
holds true as it ever has though it's been so long since I have, who knows
maybe it is better now days.)

I have the hydraulic lifters sound on one side of my engine and once
hot, the others sound near silet.

Please look at Richards sound sites as I have no means for testing.

Need I worry?
