ok, I'll reply to this one because it's my favorite response (though all are
appreciated)...
 
I put a little oil on the fittings and it made it easier to put them on but
now the blue plastic part of the cold start valve seems to be a little loose
in its brass fitting...that's what has me concerned (that and being afraid to
break the blue fittings.)  greg

Use a Q-tip with a teeny bit of silicon grease (Sil-Glyde) to put a light film
inside the hose end. Slips right on, very much like K-Y Jelly when used for
it's stated purpose, very very nice, indeed.
