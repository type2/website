Subject: Branding and Bosch

I was installing the Bosch Halogen headlights today...

On the front at the bottom of the lens it says "BOSCH - made in Germany"

On the back it says "Made in Sweden"

I'm beginning to believe that "made in Germany" is part of Bosch's  
trademark, whether the item was actually made in Germany or not.
