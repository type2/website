Subject: Re: Traveling and living in my bus

If it were me, I'd put neither on the block, get a hitch and small trailer for
the bus, and pull the bike behind me...  best of both worlds, you can still
ride and have the comfort of a rood over your head.  (Plus if the trailer is
big enough you could use it to carry more stuff if needed...).  It's a doable
combo, and... well... see below.
 
Going full time on a bike, while romantic
and fun, is a pretty harsh lifestyle...  It can be done (actually, someone on
this list did just that for about 9 or 10 months buku years ago when she
worked the carnival as a dumb kid ) but when that first snowstorm or hailstorm
hits you're gonna be really glad for something solid over your head and a
stable 4 wheels under your butt.  Not to mention a dry place to fire up the
stove... and a way to carry the food you want to eat without relying on mickey
Dee's or Dennys (which gets real old real fast)...  or a secure place to sleep
and carry your tools and parts, which WILL get boosted occasionally off a
bike (ya gotta sleep or go pee or shower sometime, and thieves watch for those
opportunities)...  or a way to run for parts when one or the other vehicle
breaks down.  
 
Anyway, I also lived out of my 77 westy (and hauled my 450
Honda) when I was doing a looooong commute about 2 decades ago...  4-7 days a
week, depending on schedules, etc.  Got to be like home, I could take the bike
wherever I needed to, and even set up a rooftop "shower" out the back with a
curtain strung between the hatch lid and trailer top...  I'd talk about what I
used for a bench but some guy would think dirty thoughts )giggles(...  very
cheap, very do-able, and like I said above, the best of both worlds.

I, myself, am on the way to going on the road permanently sometime

be in
the Bus, or on my BMW Airhead with trailer. I am leaning toward 
the bike. But
in a lot ways the Bus makes more sense. I see distinct 
advantages and
disadvatages for each when comparing the two. I don't 
really want to sell
either of them, but one must go on the block.
