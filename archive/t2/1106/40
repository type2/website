Should grease the contact surface of the new seal, otherwise it can
burn up in the second it takes for oil to get there when you first
fire it up.

Also make sure the seal is good German Viton, and not old and stiff rubber.

Engine should be in good condition. If you have blowby, no seal will
keep oil in the engine.

Sure you don't have a transmission seal leak?
