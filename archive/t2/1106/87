Subject: Windshield deal in FL

FWIW as people may not be looking but perhaps needing (and I was for something
else.) If you are in FL, Edgewater that is there is someone on a certain
auction site selling new bay windshields for $115.  Which is IMHO a pretty
friggin fair deal considering what I'd have to pay ($257) in AK for one, and
from a quick look at current web prices.  Anyway, I have absolutely no
knowlege of the seller or interest in these, but if anyone is looking I think
the days of the $99 Safelite ones are long gone (last time I bought one new)
and I figured it is worth passing along.
