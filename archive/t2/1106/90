Two things come to my mind. First a gummed up idle jet. These are
accessible from the outside (Brass screw on either side). You could try
taking them out and spraying carb cleaner through. Be careful though it
can come flying back out into your face!

Second a stuck float/needle and seat. Sadly this involves undoing the
screws that hold down the top of the carb! Here are the float levels:

have a weber progressive DGEV. The needle and seat is a valve. You can
blow through it when the float is hanging down and not when it is up.

HTH,

Martin.
