I have the hydraulic lifters sound on one side of my engine and once
hot, the others sound near silet.

Original hydraulic valve lifter setting was, point of contact then 2 
turns in. Boston Bob did the work to determine that 1/2 turn in gave 
consistently better pump up and better compression balance. As I 
understand it, VWOA accepted this as a valid update to their 
procedures. Reset all the valves to this 1/2 turn spec. If you still 
have the issue, I would then try a proper motor crud flushing 
procedure. Get rid of the gummy varnish in those lifters, then 
recheck the adjustment. A good follow up would be checking and 
adjusting if necessary the base idle mixture. A very good chance of 
better balance, combustion, MPG, and quiet running.
