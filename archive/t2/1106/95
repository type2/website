Hi Guys,

Look here and try to use the right one:

You can also use one that is close in specs, but sometimes the vacuum
can is in the wrong position and interferes with moving the
distributor for timing.

This can be compensated for by changing what distributor tower you
start at for #1 cylinder. Just point your rotor at it at TDC on the
compression stroke and time from there.
