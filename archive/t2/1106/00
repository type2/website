Subject: Yet another electrical question for the list

Hi Folks,

Like many of you, I've had my share of electrical issues, and this newest one
has me perplexed and in need of some advice.  Here's the story:

On the last sunny day here, I took the cover off the bus and took it out for
its monthly exercise.  All was fine until I came to an intersecting road and
signaled for a turn.  When I flipped the turn signal, there was a sort of
zzztt electrical sound from under the dash, under the radio slot, and the
generator light came on.  I shut off the engine and checked around for obvious
smoke or whatever.  Then I started the car again and headed home.  On restart,
the generator light didn't come on, but by the time I got home it was on
again.  So, the way it stands now, when I turn the key to 'on', the dash
gauges don't work, but the engine starts, and then the generator light is on.
No other obvious symptoms.  Headlights work.  What would be the best way to
troubleshoot this (the next time we get a dry day here)?

Thanks!
Jerry
