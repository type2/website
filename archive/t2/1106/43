Subject: Main Seal

 Thanks Everyone for your help.

I will keep you posted on my problem with the main seal I installed yesterday.
It looks like I will have to pull the motor again, which wont be for another
few weeks or so.

I am reasonable certain that there are no cracks in the case, the last time I
had it out I stripped it down to replace a hole in one of the push tubes.  So,
I guess I installed the seal (or may be the flywheel) incorrectly.  Keep
everyone posted.

Thanks again,
