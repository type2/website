Sliders could mean Riviera or a number of other campers. If you could
upload the pictures somewhere and post a link we could have a look at
what's installed inside and take some guesses. Picture of the outside

 sliding windows on the sides, and so far I think all the Westy's I've seen
 have jalousies.
