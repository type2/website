Subject: Re: [T2] Rear Main Seal

Brian

the main seal on the vw aircooled isn't really a rear main seal.. as that is
the front of the engine [fif]

are you positive that it is the seal that is leaking.. I have seen engine
case cracks that will leak oil... there is a galley plug that can leak ,,,
but if it is the seal.. when I install them, I put a thin coat of RTV on the
outside of the seal so it doesn't leak on the outer ring,, and I make sure
there isn't a wear groove in the flywheel where it might leak..

you didn't finish the one comment,, "replaced the rear main seal which
looked really"   ??____??

there is a drain hole in the case ... is it plugged?
