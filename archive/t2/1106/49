Subject: battery floor corrosion

71 type 2.

Has anyone put in a new battery floor? Our battery floor is completely
corroded, a big  hole currently covered with wood.

Are new battery 'trays' metal or just  plastic liners?  If metal,  Does 
anyone know if this
tray gets welded in, or do I need some strong sheet-metal repairing the 
body
first?
btw does this list have discount codes for various suppliers?

appreciate quick reply as engine is out and a body-worker
quoting on it

thanks, John
