Subject: Seat covers

I know they are out there, I just haven't found them.  I have a '69 Single Cab
and I want to redo the seats and am looking for covers that are cloth on the
top and back and vinyl on the sides.  I saw them on a SC that was on e-bay and
they looked great.  I have looked at some of the places that sell VW stuff but
haven't seen anything other that vinyl.

Tks

Stan
