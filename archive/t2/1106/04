Subject: lifters

I have the hydraulic lifters sound on one side of my engine and once
hot, the others sound near silet.

Please look at Richards sound sites as I have no means for testing.

Need I worry?

Last, I tried adjust my way out of this to no avail.

For now, I am just driving the bus to enjoy it.
