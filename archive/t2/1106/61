You can weld them in or pop-rivet them in. You could also use auto body 
epoxy to GLUE them in believe it or not. I have glued floor patches in 
that are two years (?) old now with excellent results. Be sure to seal 
up the seam between the patch and body with body caulking or excess body 
epoxy. Brush on paint from above and below. I used Rustoleum brush on 
paint and it's still doing well. You could then top coat it with 
whatever color you are painting the bus.

Just make sure that you kill the old rust with sandblasting or wire 
brushing or naval jelly followed by a coating of brush on rust 
converter. I had no luck with the spray on type but did have great 
success with the $5 brush on rust converter from the auto parts store.  
The stuff I used was a water based "paint". Be sure to top coat it 
(paint over it) b/c the rust converter will wash away eventually if 
exposed to water. 

Hope this helps a little
