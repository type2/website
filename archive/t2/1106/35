Nobody seems to check this, and your life depends on it, but there is a rubber
and fabric square thing between your steering colum and steering box, called a
rag link.  Replace it.  It gets old and degrades, and most that I have removed
were brittle or cracked.  After that, ball joints and tie rod ends, then check
the piviot arm, in the center bottom of your beam, it forms a right angle and
your drag link (from your steering box) attaches to one end and your tie rods
(to your wheels) attach to the other.  With a helper turning the wheel watch
the the piviot arm.  If it stays flat and parralell to the ground with no up
and down play good.  If you can see it moving up and down then your beam
bushing will have to be replaced.
