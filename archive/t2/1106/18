Danger, safety issue.

That won't even come close to creating a proper alignment, unless both 
vehicles use the same lamps, and the lamps are at the same height off 
the ground.

Headlights are adjusted to an angle, so where they hit the ground 
depends greatly on their height above the ground. Even more so, if 
aligning against a wall. If you mark a car's pattern against your 
garage door, then align a bus's to that, you're likely to end up with 
the bus's headlamps pointing very, very low.

In Europe, the angle is based on the height of the headlamps, so all 
vehicles project about the same distance. In the US, the angle is the 
same for all vehicles, so those with higher headlamps get an advantage. 


Here's an article on how you can reasonably align against a wall:
