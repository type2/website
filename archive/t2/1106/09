If you have a really large compressor, remove the heater connections back at 
the engine and blow it out the back.

I was taking my wiper engine off my van and dropped my wrench down the
heat tube.

Then, I was trying to use a spring type magnetic grabber to get it out.

So, what to I open next to get at it?
