From what I've seen of the not-bosch-mexico SVDAs they're pretty much 
garbage.  Get the real thing.

I got mine from CIP a while back and they were great.  I tried to get it 
from Aircooled, but it turns out that they were closed the week I wanted 
to order it, and then when they got back it turned out it was 
backordered....CIP had it in stock (reflecting what their website said) 
and sent it out the same day....
