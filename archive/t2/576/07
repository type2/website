Subject: Re: Cylinder head probs

  So I'm on my way back from Busfusion (Ontario) this weekend and I lose #4.
Ran a compression tonight and the results are: 1-3 all 120 PSI #4 0 PSI. I was
hoping to pull the left head off without taking the motor out and see if I can
get away with just doing the valves or maybe change/rebuild the head.  Am I
crazy? Is it possible to pull the head without dropping the motor? If I end up
dropping the motor I might just swap it with my other bus (paint job).  One
thing is for sure.... got to have it up and running for the Jitterbug in two
weeks. Any Suggestions?
