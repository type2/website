Subject: roadtrip woes = stranded

Thanks to all those with suggestions for camping on
the Oregon Coast...problem is, we're stuck in Ukiah
(on our way to Seattle).

Problems began yesterday around Santa Rosa...high
engine temps (280f) forced us to take frequent breaks.
Then around Asti I thought I felt a drop in power. We
had Bulldog auto up here in Ukiah do a once over and
retard the timing a bit. Bad news is the van is still
heating up after 5 miles at 55mph. And, compression
dropped to 90 on two of the cyl's.

We've got two cars and need to be in Seattle by
Saturday. I'm about to start dialing AIRS members to
see if anyone could store the van for a time, or
perhaps consignment sale.

I know, I sound desperate. I am disappointed, and
beginning to feel a time crunch.

We'll be hanging around the Ukiah library for a few
hours...calling Uhaul and AIRS friends. If you've got
any suggestions email or call.

Thanks,
Mark D.
