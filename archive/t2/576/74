Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Fan Shroud and flaps & covers

Are there replacements available? Is it something I could make/fabricate to 
work? I have been playing hell looking through Vendors' sites to find the 
covers I never saw gaskets either. Any vendor/listee out there watching this 
thread and have them please chime in.

Thanks,

Michael Knight
