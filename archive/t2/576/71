Subject: Re: [T2] sparkplug washer removal

Don't know how buying a new plug solves the problem of getting the washer
off to accommodate the CHT installation but I have removed hundreds of spark
plug washers by applying a light pressure with a pair of standard pliers to
the circumference of the washer to coax it to follow the threads and unscrew
from the plug.
