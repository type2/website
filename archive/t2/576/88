Subject: Re: [T2] Best way to drop the tranny and engine as one

Hi Mark.

Last weekend while at BusFusion Ben Huot and I removed the westfakia's 
engine to replace a failed throwout bearing. We lowered the 
transmission about 5" or so, and supported the tranny with a dolly 
jack. It was a textbook job and took very little time.

Re-installing the engine was made much easier by the use of the second 
jack on the tranny. this allowed us to align the tranny and engine 
perfectly, getting the tranny mated up with the clutch in record time.

If you do remove them both at the same time, be sure to have a helper. 
The engine and tranny together are VERY heavy. If I was working alone I 
definitely would not remove both at once.

Happy trails,
