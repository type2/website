Subject: Best way to drop the tranny and engine as one

Hi list,

I was wondering if someone can point me to the best source for dropping
the engine and tranny as one unit in my 73 Bay? I have Muir's book,
Haynes, and Bentley, but none of them seem to offer a really clear
description for dropping the entire unit.

Thanks,

Mark
