Subject: RE: [T2] Best way to drop the tranny and engine as one

Whether you're dropping them alone or together, one device that has made
a big difference to me is an ATV / motorcycle jack.

You can get these at most Auto stores and places like Sears.

They're great. I bolted 2X4 extensions to mine. They're stable and allow
you to roll those heavy pieces with ease. Ten times better than a floor
jack.

 I really don't see an advantage of dropping the engine
and transmission together, too heavy for me to handle
together, VW dealers did it but they had a special
holder(dolly)for them, also you still have to take
them apart when you get it out, without the special
dolly to hold both of them it could be hard to do.
