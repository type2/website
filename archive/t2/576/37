we sell the wire terminals that require this type of crimper. once you use
them you will never want to use anything else.

i recommend the paladin #1635 tool/dieset for crimping these, it will do
most of what you need, except the very large gauge wires.

we also sell the terminals that fit inside the plastic injector and sensor
housings on the FI harness, but for some reason i did not find them on our
site. they use the same tooling.
