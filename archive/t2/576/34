Speaking of crimping pliers, locating the non-insulated variety that will do
the roll over crimps takes a bit of searching. If you are looking for them
consider:

There is also VW 000 097 003. Not the latest design (more like a pair of
vice grips) but makes the proper crimps for all sizes of terminals. I used
this one to redo my engine compartment wiring.
