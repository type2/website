I have not checked at the dealer but........ the VW part numbers for the gaskets are:
021 256 325 A  left
021 256 326 A  right

And the covers are:
021 256 321 D  left
021 256 322 B  right

I entered these part numbers at www.busdepot.com using Ron's search-by-part-number capability and came up with
these prices: [in the order I listed them above] 13.95, 17.21, 12.95, 12.95. Whether Ron has them or just
lists them and then drop ships them, I don't know.

Ron's search works IF YOU KNOW the part number.......  it does not work if you know the part name and search
for it.  As an example, I searched for part  # 021256321B and it came back with the description of 'Heater
Channel Cover Tin'. So I went back to the main page, picked 72-79 bus, and then typed Heater Channel Cover Tin
in the 'Search all of the above parts' box. The search came back: 'No items found. Please change your search
criteria'.........
