Subject: [T2]strange sensor

Pulled the motor from my 77 westy 2.0 with F.I. a few
days ago for a head replacement and ring job and 
noticed a sensor that had no wires going to it. The
sensor was on the cylinder 3 side and on the case. It
also was used like a cooling tin screw. I checked my 
78 westy and in the same place there was a fatter 
screw and not a sensor but the case was tapped the
same. The sensor looks like an oil pressure sensor 
except with 2 connection tabs. The part# is 039 919
389.
It has the vw audi emblem on it too.
thanks, wes
