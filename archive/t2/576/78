Are you getting these readings with the ignition on or off? Power coming 
through the ground does not sound right to me either. Are the grounds tied 
into a point with multiple grounds? and Are they tied into the same place? 
Sounds odd.

Good luck I hope that one of the List's Electrical Gurus will chime here.

    Okay I checked all wires for volts, I get 12
volts coming through the black w/white stripe power
wire. I also am getting 9 volts in the brown ground
wires, Is this normal? I didn't think you would have
any power coming through your ground. All other wires
doesn't have power coming through. I also found a used
relay, and it does the same thing, so it can't be the
relay.
