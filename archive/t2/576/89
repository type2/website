I have used this system before and it works well. Take a vice grip cut
some fuel hose to put over the sharp edges. then close it around the
push rod tube. not tight enough to actually close over it, but just
enough so when you move it toward one of the flaired ends it will
grab. then tap the grips w/ a mallet, while twisting. It seems to keep
from scarring up the tubes and bending them.
