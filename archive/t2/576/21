Subject: carbs vs injection

Hi there

does it possible to install a injection set in a 2.0
lt CU engine?

if yes what are the advantages in terms of consumption
and emissions, instead of to have a dual carb set-up?

what kind of injection does fit in? has any workshop
manual with that information?


thanks for your support
