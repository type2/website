Buyer beware. I bought a cheap disc sander from them and got one with gears that shoulded like they replaced the grease with gravel. I SERIOUSLY have to use ear protection just to run the tool no load. Doesn't matter - I've got 3 hours on the tool now and don' t expect to wear it out anytime soon. If I was planning to do some work with it, I would have sent it back and bought a "real" sander - Dewalt or Milwaukee or something I could expect to last.
