Subject: towing a standard tranny bus

Is it alright to tow a standard tranny bus in neutral?
Everything I know says yes but I wanted to make sure.

1978 2l fi bus

being towed about 100 miles or so.
I have a tow bar all ready for it.
Leaving tomorrow if it's good.

Another question.
Should I convert my auto tranny bus to a standard if I have all the parts?
aye's vs nay's please

Thanks guys

James
