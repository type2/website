I really don't see an advantage of dropping the engine
and transmission together, too heavy for me to handle
together, VW dealers did it but they had a special
holder(dolly)for them, also you still have to take
them apart when you get it out, without the special
dolly to hold both of them it could be hard to do.
IMHO, Later Phil
