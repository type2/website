Subject: Ball joint boots only?

Ok, one repair I need to make is ball joint boots. Is there a repair
split boot, or should I wrap the boots in rubber scraps until I need to
replace them? The buses front end in markedly good, but the rubber boots
are getting beat.
I could just leave them and redo the ball joints sooner then eventually,
but it seems more prudent to try and defend decent ones.
Thanks,
AL
