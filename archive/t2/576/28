Well if you guys and gals didn't hear - VW is NOT going to build a van based on the show vehicle they've been showing for the past few years. Guess they'll stick with the Eurovan vehicle. 

Had I the budget it would be a tight race between a Dodge Sprinter (+$150 kit fit to put all the Mercedes emblems back on) and the Eurovan. Airflow is building a hightop Sprinter camper that is $75K+. Doubt I WOULD if I COULD spend that much a ANY vehicle. Its transportation... If I've got $80K to spend, I'll buy a weekend house in the country... <grin!>
