I thought he was kind of braiding them together, soldering and then
shrinking.

The solder joint is stronger than the wire. The twisting is just extra
work for nothing. I would strip like 1/4 in off each, tin them with
solder, solder them side by side and then heat shrink them.

Clean and not lumpy.
