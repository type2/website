Subject: Nut size for 81' heaterboxes

Hallo volks!

If someone could be so kind as to share to size of the nuts that hold my
heaterboxes to my cylinder heads, that would be great. It could be a
long walk to the flaps so I'd like to get them before disassembly if ya
know what I mean.

I have an 81' 2.0L CV with the square ports. Thanks in advance...Craig.
