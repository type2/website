Subject: Turn Signal Switch...

Hi all,

Unfortunately I broke the turn signal switch of my '69 Bus (don't ask how) 
and since the price to replace it
is way out of my budget I decided to open it up to see if I could repair it 
somehow. Well, I managed to open it up
and here are the pictures of its inards

Basically the plastic part that holds the lever broke (and some of the 
plastic got lost) so I can't glue it back together.
I'm going to try to replicate the plastic part using AutoCad and a plastic 
3-D printer, but before I start drawing the part I wanted to ask the list 
if anybody has tried something like this before? Any other ideas? Also, 
does anybody knows where the metal cylinder and little ball go? they 
dropped when I opened the switch casing and couldn't see where they were.
I'll keep you guys posted.
Thanks,

Rogelio
'69 "La Vebe"
