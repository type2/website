I tried this after 30 years of pulling the engine to
remove the head, now I know why I pull the engine, I
could have had the engine out in 30 minutes, I wasted
eight hours trying to hurt myself, and ended giving up
and pulling the engine anyway. So to make a long story
short, PULL THE ENGINE.  Phil
