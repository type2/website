Subject: RE: [T2] Where to connect to 12V switched in Engine Compartment

That is a fine spot to use as a 12+v switched source, but - put a relay on it
first.  Chances are it can't supply sufficient current to any additional
sources, especially with the voltage drop from the ignition switch.  I did
this on my bus and it works great!
You can ground it anywhere on the body you like.  The tail light ground is a
good place to tap in.
