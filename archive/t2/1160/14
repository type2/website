Subject: Alternator for a 85 diesel Doka and bus update.

Hi all,

First, an update on my 1978 Westy. She's out of the paint booth and waiting
to be put back together. The welding on it is superb, I can't see any
indication any repairs were ever done. It looks fantastic. Now I just need
to start putting it back together. I purchased a clean engine hatch and rear
door from Chris at Busted Bus, and a number of body parts (doglegs, battery
area panels) from Ron at Bus Depot. Now is the long slog to get it
soundproofed, insulated and back together. I have a Bob Donalds engine with
about 10 k that I need to go through and make sure everything is good. I
have a new (used) tank I need to seal (I have the old one which is in pretty
good condition, could just use some brazing around the outlets if anyone
wants it). Hopefully I'll make good progress over the winter, but with a
baby coming in November (11.11.11) that may be a pipe dream.

I recently bought a 1985 VW Doka from the German army. 1.6 NA diesel. Slower
than my bus, but tons of fun. The only problem is the alternator case is
cracked (alternator works fine) and I can't seem to spec the right one as
they were never sold over here. I may try to tack weld a metal sleeve in
this one (the front hole is broken), but I was wondering if any of the parts
gurus on the site could give me any insight. The number on the alternator
is 068903031d and it is a 65 amp Bosch. Anyone know if other vw's used this
same one?

Thanks,

Ned
