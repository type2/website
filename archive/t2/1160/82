Different strokes for different volks. :)

In 50 years of wrenching on these beasts, plus a few 'murican and
japanese makes, I have never used gasket sealer on a carburetor base
and never a leak that I could remember.  Not a bad record, eh?
Manifold gaskete are are another story though.  Intake Gaskets I
usually use Gasgacinch(r) and exhaust gaskets I use a metallic copper
based high temp sealant usually made by Loctite/Permatex(r) - on
vehicles with a catalytic converter I use O2 sensor approved sealant
on the exhaust. My late father was an aircraft man and he first taught
me what to use, when to use it and when not to use it. I have followed
his instruction(s) since.

I suppose a REAL THIN film coat of Gasgacinch(r) could be used on a
carburetor base, but I would be highly reluctant to do so, given my
experience.

And as John said, YMMV :)
