Thank you all for the responses.

I believe I will go to my local auto store and pick up some gasket material.

Way back when I was a youngster in the Army and you had to take your  
vehicle to the motor pool for service, the crusty old motor sergeant had us  
tapping out gaskets using manila folders and a ball peen hammer. They  
always worked just fine. I appreciated the creative suggestions.
