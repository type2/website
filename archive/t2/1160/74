Subject: lost vw video FOUND _ THANKS

These Vw groups are amazing!  someone on Type2.com sent me the legal  
version.  Sadly has lots of ads now, but that's life today on  
internet, isn't it?

Thank You  Gerald!

Here's the legal copy on their Vevo youtube channel

Orienteering connection:

As a Westy owner and and orienteer I try for fun videos to link my 2  
passions. The sport is  big in Finland and through Scandinavian and  
Europe.   See the orange and white splittie? Those are the colors of  
Orienteering check-points. Later see the map and backplate compass -  
very orienteering,

  If anyone wants to learn more, try my site http://  
www.theThinkingSport.com/ and this coming weekend is National O Day  
in the USA, so local clubs will welcome you.  http://
