Subject: Re: Re: [T2] Carburetor Gasket

Thin, metal-clad gaskets are used on carbureted engines to help prevent  
icing of the carbs and intake manifolds by conducting heat from the heads  
to the manifolds. Think about the carbed type I engines with their  
always-on heat risers off the exhaust.

Icing happens even where it's hot, just not very noticeable in arid  
climates as there is no condensation/ice on the outside of the parts. The  
vaporization of gasoline consumes a great deal of heat energy, thereby  
cooling everything down.

Thick, insulating gaskets are used on FI engines because the fuel is not  
vaporized before passing through the intake manifolds, so there is no need  
to heat them. In fact, the insulation prevents overheating of the  
manifolds, which are not cooled by the vaporization that happens in carbed  
engines. If you are running a single carb on a type IV engine, you need all  
the extra heat you can get, and if you use the thick gaskets it will also  
screw up your throttle linkage geometry. Use the appropriate gasket; Both  
are available.

Food for thought: Considering the cooling effect on the intake air charge  
resulting from the gasoline vaporization, do you think you can get more HP  
from a carbed engine or a FI engine (all else being equal)? What if the  
fuel was something with a lower vaporization temp, such as alcohol, or  
nitro?
