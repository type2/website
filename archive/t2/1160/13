Subject: RE: [T2] Buses By The Depot & BusDepot Warehouse Sale - Sat Oct

Darn, Ron.  It sure sounds like a wonderful event!  I wish you might consider
honoring those prices during the sale for the faithful in here who cannot
attend :^(
I can think of a few things I would buy... :^D

 The Warehouse Sale (distressed goods -
