Subject: Can anyone read these corrupted DOC files for a battery charger

Well, due to a HD crash, I managed to lose the original writeup I did on a
battery charger installation on my 77 Westy. I was asked to share it with the
type2 list, but the Doc files (Word) won't read. Wondering if any gurus here
can open them up with some type of recovery software? I've had no luck with
Word's built in repair function etc. :-(
They are posted at Zshare with the following pointers -

If anyone could be of help, it would be most appreciated by us old loafers.
:-) , although it would apply to vanagons as well I'm sure.

Regards,
Courtney
