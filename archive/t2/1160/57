	For no apparent reason, air-cooled
classic sickles are assumed not to be much
affected by heat conduction from the cyl head
into the carb thru this gasket  -  people make
their own out of e.g manila folder thin
cardboard, with or without Hylomar. gasket goo.
	I strongly suspect a gasket less
conductive of heat (and perhaps of vibration) is
desirable and the official VW gasket reflects
good understanding of those needs.
	Neverthelss, the spirit of Munro prompts
me to urge that we keep on the look out for
material similar to the OEM gasket, and make our
own (if only because the actual VW gasket is hard
to find).
