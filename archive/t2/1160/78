You know that is another great point as well, which some may not recognize. 
Often you can do just that with a moderate thickness paper, tap them out with
a ball peen hammer and not screw with punches and x-acto blades or whatever. 
For anyone who doesn't know the technique, simply tap the paper at the sharp
edges of the part with a ball peen hammer lightly, it will at least transfer
the pattern, and may well cut enough to "punch" the gasket through, or to
require only a bit of cutting with your favorite implement.  Works best to tap
the interior holes first on a larger gasket so you have something to hold onto
if you do cut with the technique so you don't cut all the outside off.  I
often tap the inside patterns, then just cut the outside with scissors.

 the crusty old motor sergeant had us  
tapping out gaskets using manila
folders and a ball peen hammer. They  
always worked just fine. I appreciated
the creative suggestions.
