Subject: Dellorto Carb venturi question

I'm replacing the venturi's in my Dellorto DRLA's and I just want to
make sure I have the orientation correct. Is the bulge inside the
venturi supposed to be at the bottom, nearest the butterfly's, or is
the bulge inside the venturi supposed to be at the top?

Thanks,
