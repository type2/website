VW # 021 129 795  Gasket, 34PDSIT Carb Base to Manifold - superseded
to 071 129 795 in December 1992, then discontinued November 2000.
Yep, our Bays are becoming more and more obsolete :(

Use to sell dozens of these many, many years ago, only available from
the dealer at the time, no aftermarket place has had them to the best
of my knowledge.

What I usually do is get some manifold gasket material and fashion one
up with an x-acto knife or if rebuilding one, the base gasket does
come in the rebuild kit.
