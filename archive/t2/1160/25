Subject: Have to sell 81 vanagon

I apologize if this is inappropriate here, but I want my vanagon to go to a
nice home. New pistons rings and cylinders. clean as can be well loved for
so many years. Lost my house because of health and economics, and no place
to keep her..... Full set of curtains, rubber floor mats, cloth seats from a
newer Van. Also have set of tail lights. has a hitch. I bought a muffler and
cat, as well as  crossover pipe to help with emissions testing here in Utah.
Unable to install due to health issues

have lots of pics, and will happily tell her story to anyone who might be
able to save her from the scrap yard

Van is in salt lake city. If anyone is interested or knows someone who might
be, please email vanagonvw(-at-)gmail.com Its either sale or the crusher, and
that breaks my heart. Time is of the essence......

John
