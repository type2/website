Subject: Re: [T2] Camper sleeping...

Yeah, I think part of the problem here is that both of my campers have
homebrew interiors, and the support end of the bed isn't bomb-proof.  It's
enough to support two people but it wobbles enough to be
disconcerting/annoying.

I think it's also as Neal said: it's always felt a bit easier to climb in so
that your head faces the rear.

But this is good feedback: once I get the support more stable, I'll give the
feet facing rear (RIR) a go...

(still interested in hearing from other folks though)

westy brackets should be sufficient to hold ample sized people :)
