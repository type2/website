Subject: lost vw video

Not exactly lost, but no longer available  to view in USA or UK. (SME  
copyright)  Must have been the background song.

I think I got the  link originally from a vw group but it is not  
saved in my mail .  It was from Finland and featured a female pop  
group driving around in an orange and white westy.  They had a map  
and baseplate compass too, so I was cross-referencing it with  
orienteering sites.
