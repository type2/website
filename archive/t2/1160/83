Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Carburetor Gasket

I believe VW specs most applications to be installed dry, but I'm not
sure on the specifics without doing a research project. I remember
them calling for a sealant on case halves, but of course there's no
gasket sealer there. I remember using gaskacinch on valve covers to
hold them in place, but don't remember if that's called for by the
book or just a mechanic's advice.

Personally, I tend to stay dry unless I don't feel comfortable about
the mating surfaces or am re-using the old gasket.

It's great to have an experienced hand to learn under, especially an
aircraft man, or a father, as in Jim's case.
