making a gasket, buy gasket paper.  It is cheap.  Now I've used other things
in a pinch certainly, I agree with John here and prefer the thickness of a
morning cereal box myself, but gasket paper is not pricey, and in the US is
still at every chain auto parts store that sells Felpro although getting the
16 year old behind the counter to find it can be a task.  The major benefit to
real gasket paper, aside from it cutting better is that it is not porous.  I
believe Hoover once mentioned, and it very much holds, if using the paper
envelope, box top, whatever, one needs to saturate it well with a good non
hardening gasket cement, even more carefully than one might with a regular
gasket.  I have had my roll of gasket paper for 20 years at this point, and
still have more than half the roll left, did have to buy a Felpro sheet set on
moving to AK as I couldn't locate the roll for  about a year, but it turned
up.  At this point the roll and sheets will outlast me.

> Funny thing carb gaskets, everyone wants what they don't have it seems, cool
climes want to use steel to warm up the manifold, warm climes want to insulate
the manifold, no one is ever satisfied.  Which might represent the state of
tune, and condition of ones carbs as much as anything else.  I say this as
I've recently been fighting a set of well worn dual SUs on my Triumph to much
frustration.
