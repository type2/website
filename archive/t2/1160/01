Subject: Buses By The Depot & BusDepot Warehouse Sale - Sat Oct 1  (PA)

The website for 2011's Buses By The Depot is now up -
http://busdepot.com/BBD2011.htm

This has been a growing event every year, and one that I really look forward
to. It's in a wooded county park near our shop in eastern PA (about mid
point between Philly, Allentown, and Reading).  You can make it a day trip
(at no cost) if you live close by, or camp overnight for either one or two
nights. The park has playgounds, walking/hiking trails, and lakes, and we
have a potluck dinner Saturday evening. All of the details are at the above
link. I should mention that the park has eliminated a number of campsites,
so please reserve early as we expect a sellout.

As in years past, we will have our annual Bus Depot Warehouse Sale on that
Saturday, Oct. 1st from 2 to 4 pm.  That is the only day of the year that we
open up our warehouse to the general public, and also mark down all of our
discontinued and scratch-and-dent merchandise by up to 90%. This year we
have expanded the dates slightly. The Warehouse Sale (distressed goods -
best discounts) will still be on Saturday only. But we will be offering
discounts on regular-stock merchandise on Friday 9/30 (11 am to 7 pm) and
Sunday 10/2 (noon to 2 pm) as well. (See
http://busdepot.com/BBD2011.htm#Coupons for more info.) This experiment is
based on a suggestion by a couple of last year's attendees. It will
hopefully ease the Saturday crowds, and also allow overnight campers to
leave their paid-for orders at the Depot while they camp and pick them up
Sunday on their way out of town. 

I can't wait to see the usual familiar faces again this year, and hopely
plenty of new ones!
