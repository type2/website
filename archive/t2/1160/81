Boy I don't think I've ever really disagreed with Jim on something in my life,
but I never install ANY gasket dry, including a carb base gasket, with the
exception of graphoil coated gaskets (OEM FI intake runner gaskets and the
like.)  I agree with his point here, but I'd simply say that I install em with
a perfectly applied, ever so thin layer of sealent, brushed on if necessary. 
Not in the VW air cooled world but some carb base gaskets with multiple
drillings and ports are well served by a perfect layer of sealant for instance
to keep the ports from cross talking with each other, in the extreme case ones
where there are air passages and coolant passages in the carb flange adjacent
the actual intake port.
 
YMMV.  It often doesn.
