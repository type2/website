Subject: BNNTA has started!

We leave in the morning for Mark Twain Lake to host the BNNTA VW camping.
There are already at least eight Buses who arrived today from Nebraska,
Missouri, Illinois and Wisconsin in the campground tonight.  The bulk of the
attendees will cruise into the campground that I've leased on Friday.  The
weather forecast is good, hot on Friday, cooling down on Saturday and even
more on Sunday/Monday.  Night time temps should be in the low 70's Friday
night and down to the high 50s by Sunday night.  Great sleeping weather!  We
hope to see many of you over the long holiday weekend.  No reservations are
needed, I've booked the entire campground and only VWs (any year or any
model!) will be admitted, plenty of room for everyone.  Go to www.bnnta.com
for basic info and a map link to get you there.  Drive safely and have a great
holiday weekend wherever you are!
