That bit is funny, indeed I generally sleep head higher if not level as well,
but would prefer to sleep head forward.   Unfortunately my wife insists on
sleeping head rearward.  And as I generally get up once in the PM to hit the
porta-john, I invariably get reminded of the headbanger cabinet.

We don't
sleep up top as it doesn't really support me well as I've gotten too fat, and
as the 4yo insists on being up top in "her" bed.

I keep my feet above my
head.  When everything is level I sleep with my feet to the rear.  This avoids
encounters with the headbanger cabinet.  That may not work for a taller
person.  As for the support of the end of the bed the westy brackets should be
sufficient to hold ample sized people :)
