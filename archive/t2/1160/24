Subject: tie-rod ball joint misplaced ? help needed

Hello
I recently got a clicking noise from the inner ball joint of the right
tie rod. When i checked it - it moves in-out ward but it is still
working. Hope I still have some time to replace it ? !  Have to order
a ne w tie- rod, but when i checked on
http://der-shop.heiterweiter.com/products/en/T2-1968-1979/Lenkung-Aufhaengung/Lenkung-Spurstangen/Spurstange-links-festmontiert-T2-1967-05-79.html
it says that the left one is the "festmontierd" or fixed and mine is
the opposite - the right side is a fixed tipe bar and the left one is
with the adjustable threads/clamps. Maybe the previoous owner
misplaced them .
IS THIS CRITICAL ?
should I re-arrange them in the propper order the left goes right and v-v. ?

I will appreciate also any source for a better source/ price for
shipping in Europe.

Peace and Prosperity
