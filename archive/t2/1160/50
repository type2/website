It's amazingly easy to add a pull chain type of device to the latching
mechanism on the rear hatch which undoes the latch from the inside of
the vehicle. There's even holes in the activating arm to attach to.
It's great to be able to open the hatch and get out from the inside.

I usually sleep head toward the back, upstairs or down, because of the
aforementioned pillow loss issue. But when it's really hot out then
head to the front to take advantage of increased airflow through the
jalousies.
