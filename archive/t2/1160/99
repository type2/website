Subject: Bumper over riders

Hi all,

I received a rear bumper from a '79 bay window that had over riders on it.
They were in really tough shape. I could probably replace the rusted out
centers of them, but I'd like to buy a set of used/new non-chromed ones. I
can't seem to find them anywhere. Were these over riders available to the
'79? Or were they from another year. I like the looks of them.

Thanks in advance for the help/suggestions.
