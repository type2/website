Subject: Re: [T2] Carburettor Gasket

In my experience:

Heated manifold = good

Heated carburettor = bad

I have Weber icts and with a thin paper gasket between the carb and the
manifold the left carb would setup a syphon after the engine was shutdown and
merrily drip fuel into the cylinder and onwards into the oil! Installation of
thick gaskets remedied this problem.
