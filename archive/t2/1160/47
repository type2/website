Subject: Re: [T2] Camper sleeping...

To add up to this extensive survey,

Head always toward the back hatch.....to avoid losing  my pillow and I think it provide a very little better noice and heat isolation (its more confine). Also watching the stars trought the rear windows is not bad either !!
My kids start like me but always end up perpendicular of me if not on me during their sleep ! ;-)

Ps , to add more to the confusion , my wife prefere the other way around ! not sure about her reason but I would say that she wants to be closer to the coffee maker in the cold morning ! ;-)
