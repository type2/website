Subject: Re: [T2] Camper sleeping...

As a total aside on this extensive and informative survey.  As I've mentioned
I prefer head to front to avoid headbanging despite the wife's preference, but
I will admit you can lose pillows.  However something this brings to mind that
I've wondered if Vanagon's should have come with.  My EVC, now my dad's EVC as
the case is, has a rear interior hatch release pull, with a ridiculous safety
"emergency exit" sticker.  After all as an RV, just like RV's are required to
have escape windows from bedrooms, apparently Winnebago felt that the same
applied to the "bedroom" in the EVC.  Now certainly bays would have long
predated such nonsense, but Vanagons definitely overlapped years by which
bigger RV's came so equipped.  It actually isn't a stupid idea, not for the
chance that somehow I would be blocked exit through the slider by a fire
started on the stove, but because it was convenient.  In the EVC I did sleep
the other direction for reasons that now
 escape me, and I would often simply pop the hatch and exit that direction
first thing in the AM.  Wouldn't be hard to retrofit to a bus or Vanagon, but
the drop is a bit further and less convenient of course...
