Subject: Dometic CF series refrigerator

Hi All,

Reading/ digging about for a replacement for my original, but woeful,
Riviera DC cooler. Does anyone have any experience with the Dometic CF
series chest fridge/freezers*?  Pricey new, but I might have a line on a
couple different models used... while I like the look of an upright door,
the chests seem to be more efficient. I'm thinking I could build a slide out
platform that locks into place within the current cabinet.  Thanks for any
thoughts. Cheers, Mike
