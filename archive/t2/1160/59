Hi John
Only just caught up with this thread.  We normally sleep head to  
hatch unless
there is a slope involved.
Re the internal release I fitted a small metal thread with lock nuts  
attached to the
hatch release.  I sticks out by about 15mm (just over 1/2"), is easy  
to find and
grab without getting in the way and is not aesthetically displeasing  
because
most people don't even notice it.
My wife & I know where it is so it is not a problem.
