Robert, the original VW gasket for Type 4 carbureted engines is
cardboard stock on the mating surface with a metal ring around the
intake hole.

I have not been certain whether this was just an aid in sealing, but
others have suggested it was intended to pass heat to the carburetor.

The FI Type 4 engine has the bakelite block with cardboard sealing
faces, which appears to be done in a desire to insulate the induction
runners.

Who knows what VW engineers are thinking?

Type 1 engines have all-metal gaskets for both single port and dual
port don't they?
