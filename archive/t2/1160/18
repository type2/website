Ned,

Do you know your engine number or maybe the engine code.
Since it's an
'85 NA diesel, then I assume the engine code is "CS".

I've browsed some UK
sites to get you started...

Just Kampers lists a 65A NA/TD diesel alternator
for 128.00GBP which does not include a 65.00GBP refundable core deposit.
It's
listed as made by Hella so you get some sort of German quality.
http://www.justkampers.com/shop/t25/original-parts/engine-electrics/alternato
r-65amp-diesel-turbo-diesel-j10214.html

Not much info on part numbers, but if
you ask some questions, then they're pretty good at getting back to you.

GSF
lists a 65A NA/TD diesel alternator for 168.00GBP.  That price includes a
54.00GBP refundable core deposit.
The manufacturer is not listed, but they do
provide a part number of 903VG0131 if that is any help.
As for their quality
of parts, I've used GSF for aircooled service items and parts for other
vehicles and they deliver the same parts to auto shops.
I've never had a
problem.
I'd post a direct link, but you have to register and login to access
their online catalog.
If you're curious here's their link:
 http://www.gsfcarparts.com/  (go to Shop -> Online Shop -> New User/Register)
You can also try your luck on yabE:
http://motors.shop.ebay.com/i.html?_nkw=%28vw%2Cvolkswagen%29+alternator+dies
el&_sacat=&_dmpt=Motors_Car_Truck_Parts_Accessories&_odkw=alternator+vw+65+di
esel&_osacat=0&bkBtn=&_trksid=p4506.m270.l1313


They list a few 65A diesel
alternators from some private sellers and some vendors.  Most show
compatibility with the diesel rabbit, but some also mention the Vanagon.  I'd
ask some sellers to see if they can help you or provide part numbers

Lastly,
I'm not sure what Vanagon-specific forums are in the US, but on Ol' Blighty we
have Club 80-90 (http://www.club80-90.co.uk/) and The Brick-Yard
(http://www.brick-yard.co.uk/home/home.htm).  The informational and wiki pages
on either site are treasure troves of info.

And just to make sure you get
your jargon right -- and this was pointed out a few threads ago --.
Vanagon =
Type 2 T3 (in the US) = Type 2 T25 (in the UK).

However, if you say "Doka"
then most folks in the UK should know exactly what you're talking about (Type
2 T25 pickup / Transporter T25 Flatbed).

Hope this helps!

Josh

for a 85 diesel Doka and bus update.

Hi all,

First, an update on my 1978
Westy. She's out of the paint booth and waiting
to be put back together. The
welding on it is superb, I can't see any
indication any repairs were ever
done. It looks fantastic. Now I just need
to start putting it back together. I
purchased a clean engine hatch and rear
door from Chris at Busted Bus, and a
number of body parts (doglegs, battery
area panels) from Ron at Bus Depot. Now
is the long slog to get it
soundproofed, insulated and back together. I have a
Bob Donalds engine with
about 10 k that I need to go through and make sure
everything is good. I
have a new (used) tank I need to seal (I have the old
one which is in pretty
good condition, could just use some brazing around the
outlets if anyone
wants it). Hopefully I'll make good progress over the
winter, but with a
baby coming in November (11.11.11) that may be a pipe
dream.

I recently bought a 1985 VW Doka from the German army. 1.6 NA diesel.
Slower
than my bus, but tons of fun. The only problem is the alternator case
is
cracked (alternator works fine) and I can't seem to spec the right one as
they were never sold over here. I may try to tack weld a metal sleeve in
this
one (the front hole is broken), but I was wondering if any of the parts
gurus
on the site could give me any insight. The number on the alternator
is
068903031d and it is a 65 amp Bosch. Anyone know if other vw's used this
same
one?

Thanks,

Ned
