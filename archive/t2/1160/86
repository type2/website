Subject: Ethanol Fuel Study Posted

Hi Volks!

E85 has come to an area nearby, so I got motivated to do some research
and experiment with one of my personal vehicles. Bob Glicksman at
Liquid Sun Energy has graciously hosted the results here:

I'd like to give credit to the list and VW community at this time.

Thanks to our very own Mike Soultanian for pointing me to Jake Raby's
article on head temperatures and engine damage, and also to the GAMI
aviation article on exhaust temperatures and fuel mixtures. Both are
linked in the document above.

Thanks also to John Connolly at Aircooled.net for his explanation of
air/fuel ratios and engine damage.

Mandatory VW and bus content: Jake Raby's article, while published at
914 World, is in regards to the VW Type 4 engine which is also used in
our buses. I used the GAMI chart to link EGT to CHT and mentioned this
VW-related study in my document.

My study only briefly references carbureted engines, and I'm not sure
that bus FI systems can handle the range needed for E85, but those
with newer VWs might duplicate my results. I plan to run the test
again on one of my carbureted VWs when I get one running [and have a
carb rebuild kit on hand in case the ethanol dissolves it! :p ]

Thanks to all for the knowledge base we enjoy in this bus community.

John
