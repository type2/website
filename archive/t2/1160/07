Can I assume from this question that you don't like Webers?  I have a
personal affinity for the dual 40 IDF and dual 44 IDF setups (although the
44's are better suited for bigger motors than ANY stock VW configurations).
I ran dual Webers very successfully on my 73 Westy with a stock 1.7 and on
my 74 914 with a stock 2.0 as well as on my 58 single cab with a 1776 motor.
Webers are rock-solid workhorses as long as you set them up properly for
your displacement and if AND ONLY IF you use a quality linkage (like the
Weber x-bar and not that worthless chrome-plated bling setup from Bug-pac or
Empi or, god forbid, the monkey-action linkage that showed up on
carb-conversions back in the late 70's and early-mid 80's).
 
Just my 2 cents worth :)
