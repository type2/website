If the weather is nice, head to the hatch because I want the breeze thru the
bug screen.  If the hatch is closed I prefer head to the front to avoid the
head banger and get any breeze thru the jalousie windows.   Head is always
uphill if we cannot get the bus level and that means a little forethought
before we park:)  We have a 71 so there is no "upstairs" option for us, but
our daughter loves it up there.
