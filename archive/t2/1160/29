Subject: decel valve

Hi,
In a couple of weeks, I am going to be having a visit from the itinerant
air cooled guy Colin, and we are going to reinstall fuel injection on my 1978
bus.  I'm going through all my parts and I seem to be missing a decel valve,
it's bracket, and the curved hose that connects to it.
Does any one on the
list have any of these parts laying around?  If so, please contact me with
price.
Thanks a lot,
