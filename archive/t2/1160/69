This is an unorthodox usage of the term, "vapor lock". Vapor lock
describes the phenomenon where gasoline at the fuel pump changes from
the liquid form to its gaseous form, thus rendering the pump unable to
deliver fuel. This seems to vary according to the type of pump as some
pumps seem to be able to pump air, while others need to be primed when
air has been introduced into the system.

This would be the equivalent of the OEM bakelite blocks for fuel
injected Type 4 engines.

The thinner the material, the more perfection required on the mating
surfaces. You get more crush from thicker material like a shirt box or
shoe box.
