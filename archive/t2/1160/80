Always install dry.  Most, but not all carburetors have vacuum
ports/chambers in their bases to redirect vacuum singles to other
parts of the carburetor.  Any kind of sealant could potentially plug
these ports/chambers rendering the carburetor difficult to adjust or
at worst not run the engine at all.  It is for that very reason you
always use a new base gasket when removing and reinstalling the
carburetor.
