	Thinking more about the gasket first
mentioned, I've discussed it with a real old hand
who has made many gaskets in just this way; he
points out that in v hot climates it's desirable
to limit the heating of the carb by conduction
from the intake manifold.  Vapour lock, or the
eerily similar USA phenomenon vapor lock, can be
deterred at least somewhat this way, as the carb
runs somewhat cooler.  Therefore I'd suggest
watching out for the version of this gasket
typical on modern hi-performance motorsickles:
some type of plastic 5mm thick.  Youse Panamint
Valley denizens may find such an insulating
gasket some help against vapor-lock.
	But if thin cardboard will do, the
grocery brown bag is less rugged than the manila
folder which can be liberated from some
bureaucrat :-| to serve a higher purpose :-)
