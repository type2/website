Hi Richard,

Thank you so very much for all you work. Hands down, this site is the most
important VW bus based site on the net. If I could, I'd wait for a crowd to
appear and kiss you on the lips!! (You know what they say about sailor!!:)) 

Thanks again

Folks,

I'm sorry it has taken so long but the missing photos on my website have
finally been restored.
