Hi Angel,

The first thing you and your mechanic BOTH need to do is take a deep
breath, RELAX, and get out of panic mode.

Just because your mechanic couldn't quickly locate an engine through
his regular sources doesn't mean he can't get one. He probably just
called Napa and a wrecking yard, who both said no, and he said he
doesn't want to put that much effort into searching for one.

So, first, reassure him that you will find an engine, and that he will
get the work [$$$] for taking care of the installation for you.

Next, find an engine. Realize that if you can't find one locally, you
are going to pay a few hundred for freight. For an economy rebuilt,
get one from AVP in Sacramento for about $1200. For a better one, I
don't remember who took over from Boston Bob, but they are said to be
of equally high quality if you want to spend more. We will find this
resource for you if you want to go this route. If you want to go the
ultimate and spend $5000 or so, you can get a Jake Raby Camper
Special. This is the Cadillac of VW camper engines, and is the best
money can buy [well, in this price range, but Jake has plenty of
additional things he can do to your engine to suck up available money!

If these options are too expensive for you, I have two engines in
storage at Bus Boys in California. One is rebuilt for $600 and the
other is used for $300. The used engine is from a Porsche 914 [just
slightly different, but the same VW engine] was owned by a man who was
very meticulous about his maintenance. The Porsche is also a
rear-engine car, and the car was in a front end accident, so the
engine was saved.

Let us know your option, and we will hook you up with the right source.

John
