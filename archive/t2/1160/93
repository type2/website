Subject: Where to connect to 12V switched in Engine Compartment

I'm hooking up an Innovate LC-1 Air-Fuel Meter in my 74 Baywindow Bus
and am wondering where is a good point to connect to 12V switched in
the Engine Compartment.
I see that I could grab a spot on the coil at terminal #15, but maybe
that isn't be best place.

While I'm at it, wheres a good solid ground point?

Any advice?

Thanks,
Scott Busby
