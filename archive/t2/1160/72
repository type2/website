Aha! There's the answer we're looking for!

 resulting from the gasoline vaporization, do you think you can get more HP
 from a carbed engine or a FI engine (all else being equal)?

I don't know about the impact of this particular factor, but a former
VoA mechanic told me that they always found the vehicles with marginal
clutches when they converted from FI to carbs because the engine had
so much more power with the carbs and made the clutches slip if they
weren't good.

Of course, this could be a stock vs. performance issue, kind of like
stock cams are made for the average driver, stock FI might not be
optimized for HP, as manifest by the number of performance ECU chips
available for purchase. So in the end, you might get more power out of
an optimized FI system and invalidate my friend's experience.

I would think that the issue would be to optimize induction so that
proper air/fuel mixes are delivered to the combustion chamber rather
than try to compensate for weaknesses via fuel changes. That having
been said, methanol is popular on the racing circuit because of its
higher octane. Ethanol also has higher octane. Engines have to be
built to take advantage of this capability, otherwise ethanol in an
engine built for gasoline will have slightly less power.

I have recently published a study on ethanol fuel. I will be posting a
link to the list shortly.
