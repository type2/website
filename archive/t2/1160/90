Subject: Re: baby seat lower anchors

Kevin,

I installed the baby seat anchor into the deck behind the rear seat in my
kombi. The anchor uses a large washer to take the load. In Australia all baby
seats come with the anchor. Note that this anchor is in addition to the use of
a seat belt. I replaced the rear seat belts using new replacements into the
existing mounts. Adding a seatbelt where the mount does not exist is a
different proposition!
