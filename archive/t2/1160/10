Subject: restoration advice

We have had our 78 transporter for 10 years now with a half dozen trips to the bus camp in North Carolina but now it needs more then just a paint job.  Any advice on a reasonably priced vw restorer?  I am reposting because I made that stupid mistake I make fun of others for making, no location.  I live in Southern New Jersey though bus was originally from California.
