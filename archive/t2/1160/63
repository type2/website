When I had my transmission apart, I had my (very patient arts & crafty
daughter) cut the gaskets out of a paper grocery bag with an exacto knife.
Six years later in my daily driver and nary a leak. Don't discount every day
materials. You can use punches (leather punch for the smaller holes, larger
punches are available for bolt holes, etc.) to cut the holes.
