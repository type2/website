Subject: RE:Hard Shifting

Hey Guys,

 

I just wanted to update you on my progress on my truck with the hard
shifting, as I think I have it licked.

 

1st I checked the cable-and it seemed ok. 

2nd - I checked the fluid level  - first off I needed my impact driver to
remove the fill plug. The fludi was low, ie I couldn't feel any fluid in
there at all. Then I tried the drain plug, and I had to hit that with my
impact driver for over 30 seconds before it would budge. I drained it, some
oil came out, I didn't measure it. It was black. The plug had a tiny bit of
shavings on it. I guess that means not too much damage. I then refilled it.

3rd - I pulled the shifter and base plate inside the front cab. The base of
the shifter didn't really have any grease on it. I also looked at the
Bentley, and saw that this is supposed to be held down with spring washers.
The PO only used large fender washers. So I cleaned and greased this
section, and reinstalled with spring washers and the large fender washers. I
did a bit of adjusting-and it shifts WAY better. I had been getting some
grinding going into reverse, I no longer have that. I think what happened is
that this base plate shifted-as it didn't have any sort of locking washer or
spring washer on it. My rough shifting probably introduced more slop over
time-until it got to the point where I could barely shift it. 

 

I think I'm in the clear now, been driving it a couple weeks as is-and no
problems returning.

 

Thanks for all your help and suggestions..
