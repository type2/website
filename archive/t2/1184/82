Lots of other ones, mostly more expensive. They all break sooner or later.  I
have repaired and calibrated hundreds of them, most actually were turbine
outlet temp gauges (CHT  without pistons) but lots of these cross needle CHT
jobbers too. Good enought to fly with, means they are more than good enough to
drive with.  Can't pull over and cool down in the sky.

Of course you don't have to put the "thingy" under the plug to get a CHT
reading.  However 99.999% of the available data set was taken from that
location.  If you want help with your readings you have to put the "thingy"
under the plug.  VW has a perfectly good threaded location for a temp sensor
machined right into the head.  Works for them (and us too as it controls the
fuel injection) but they didn't give us their data.  You could start a new
data set using that location and move the whole science of VW CHT forward. 
The "under the plug" location is not very user friendly and it is easy to
gibble the wire every time you do something to the plug.  I would love to see
some new data sets. 

Personally I use a Dwyer 472-A1 temp meter.  Temperature compensated,
recording min/max and dual input/dual reading for less than $80.
