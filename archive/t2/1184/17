Subject: Re: [T2] Replacing Rear Shift Rod Coupler

Hi Jamie,
See
http://www.ratwell.com/technical/091Transmission.html
and
http://www.type2.com/rvanness/transmis.htm

I think you should be able to replace the coupler without pulling the
drivetrain.
(Replacing bushings is a different matter, though.)
