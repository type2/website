Using the same engine "tin" on both rebuilds? Sure you've got all the
cooling bits?

I was burning through heads on a 1600 engine until found out I was
missing a critical piece of the cooling system - the part under the
shroud with the flaps that's supposed to connect to the thermostat.
Put that in (wired open, never did get a thermostat on that engine)
and stopped the overheating issues. If your valve clearances keep
decreasing at every valve adjustment that's an immediate warning.
Eventually you'll get close to the point where you can no longer
adjust the valves, then expect a failure in the middle of no where
(ask me how I know).
