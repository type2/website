Subject: Herrell's Bug Parts Robbery

Group-

Over this past weekend, Herrell's Bug Parts (Carrollton, GA) was robbed.  As a
customer, I am directly affected because the engine in my project bus was
stolen.

If anyone in, or close to, the area hears of any engine "deals" in the near
future, beware!  There were several stolen.  (I can provide more information
later as needed -- just wanted to get the word out.)
