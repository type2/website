Subject: silicone valve cover gasket

Hi,

I installed silicone valve cover gaskets from Real Gaskets Tennessee.
(For Type 4 gaskets, look under Porsche 914.) Their instructions
suggested they be installed dry without grease or RTV. I tried my best
but both sides leaked, one side a lot, and I lost 1 quart of oil in 10
minutes. Since I'm headed back to SoCal tomorrow morning, I reverted
to (new) cork gaskets for now.

I found different installation instructions on aircooled.net, who also
sell them, although I'm not sure what brand. (Another manufacturer is
Gasket Innovations.) Aircooled.net suggests to RTV them to the valve
covers, attach the covers to the heads for 12 hours for the RTV to
cure, then remove the covers and apply a thin coat of oil on the head
side of the gasket for final installation. I'll try that next year,
when I return to the US.

Anybody else got experience with them?
