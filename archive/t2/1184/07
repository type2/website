Subject: What paint is a reasonable likeness to Pastel White

I need to do some touch ups on my 74 bus, which has the following
colors from the M-Plate:
Color upper part :	L90D	 -  	Pastel White
Color lower part :	L30B	 -  	Kasan Red

The Kasan Red (L30B) mixes I have found online are pretty good match,
but every time I have tried to order Pastel White (L90D) the color I
get is way too creamy yellowish. I suppose my bus may have bleached
out some over 20 years, but I have also heard that the mix for L90D
are not the same as they were in Germany 32 years ago.

Anybody have any success with matching Pastel White that may be
bleached some by the years?

Thanks,
Scott Busby
