Hey Scott,

I assume you are looking for pre-mixed rattle cans for spot repairs?

If so, every time I have ordered Pastel White (or any other color) from
PaintWorld they have been spot on. Well, that being said, they are spot-on
if you compare them to an area with little UV exposure. Excellent luck so
far.

If you are looking for a quart or gallon, I have been using my local PPG
supplier in single stage DDC. Their mixes have been nearly exact.

The way I blend "bleached" areas...

You can either use a "blending spray" that goes on after the top-coat
(PaintWorld sells some) or blend/ taper off the spray into the OG finish as
you are painting.

After the top-coat sets, wet sanding with a very high grit like 1200-3000
or above followed by some high-cut polish seems to work pretty well for me.

To prep the area for top-coat and blending, be sure to wet sand your new
primered area with 600 grit. Blend/sand the primer layer into the OG paint
finish by at least 2 inches. Then set your top-coat spray 4-6 inches beyond
that transition to get the blend you are looking for.

It takes some experimentation, but working slowly you can get some pretty
cool results.

BTW, my first bus was a '77 Sunroof, Kasan Red...still miss it and still my
favorite bus color!
