I have such a policy on mine and it is way higher value than I thought 
when evaluated, ($12,500 for 78 auto, mechanically sound, body needs work) 
only costs an extra $100 a year so after almost losing it in a few hundred 
dollar fender bender some years ago I consider it peace of mind.
still no way I could replace it for double that amount.
