While this may be new for GoWesty, it is not actually new.  I've dealt with
Classic Parts for a number of years, both as a supplier to them and a
customer. So if you buy from the Bus Depot you very possibly already have
Classic Parts items on your Bus.

The division has been active for a several years now, but it did not turn
out to be the Bus owner's windfall that I had originally hoped for, nor is
it likely to be. In fact I met with Classic Parts in Germany just last
month, and they were (and always have been) quite forthcoming about the fact
that their primary interest is in early water cooled parts (including
Vanagons) rather than air cooled.  What they do have for air cooled tends to
be a mixed bag. Some of it is indeed original production and well worth
stocking. But other items are current production that I can buy elsewhere at
a lower cost anyway.  So I pick and choose.
