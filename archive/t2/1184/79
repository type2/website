I think in TX, in a Westy, you are about where you will be (you don't
mention how ambient has been.)  I'd say it is as expected particularly if
you stay more often toward the bottom of that range.  Occasional (hopefully
very
occasional) forays to the upper end of that range are likely to be expected
under high load conditions, let it cool correctly after same.  Make sure
your cooling system is intact and leak free and that timing is correct (not
too advanced at revs, not too retarded at idle and off power) and that your
mixture is spot on and live happily.
