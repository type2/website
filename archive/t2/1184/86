Subject: Re: [T2] Dakota Digital CHT Gauge in a 1600DP readings?

I have gone through 2 rebuilt engines in the past couple of years. Both
overheated. On my next engine, I am considering installing a water misting
system hooked to a thermostat. The plan is to use a 2 nozzle misting system
with the misters mounted inside the fan shroud , one over each head. It would
be relatively inexpensive and would only turn on when the heads start to reach
a critical temp.

I want to be able to climb grandfather mountain, NC without cooking my engine
again. You can't exactly stop half way up to let the engine cool. It is so
steep, you would burn your clutch up trying to get it going. I also want to be
able to take long trips without stopping every hour or two to let it cool off
for 45 min. In the summer.

I don't have to go fast, I just want my engine to last.
