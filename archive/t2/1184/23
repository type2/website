Subject: retrofitting BA-6 heater to '75 California Westy

Hi,
So I have this BA-6 heater I bought 15 years ago in Canada and never
installed. Thought I would do that now.
Not planning on running it until it's bench-tested, so fuel lines and
wiring will be added next time I'm back in the US. So for now, it's
just a matter of making it fit.
My bus is missing the support brackets, so I will have to bolt some on.
BTW, some material available here:

Has anyone done this before?
TIA,

Sami ('75 Westy)
