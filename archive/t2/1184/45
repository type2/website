Subject: Transmission question

Swing axel transmission question.. beetle pan but transmission should be
applicable to a T-2

I bought a complete pan and towed it home.. It seems there is some leakage in
the bell housing for the tranny...inside the housing, not outside.

Is there a seal behind the throw-out bearing or does anyone have any idea what
may be the issue??

Thanks in advance for any insight...
