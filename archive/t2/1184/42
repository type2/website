It looked like a Danbury Conversion at first glance.

If that is the case then it would be a
late Brazilian bay.
Watercooled but very appropriate given the next games are
in Rio.

I,ll have to hop back on the BBC site to check it out again. 

By the
way me and the family went to see some rowing and field hockey.  We also got
some awesome coverage from the BBC as well. I'm not sure what coverage you got
back home but the London Games were truly awesome. You can feel it in the air
and nobody wants to let go...
