If you're going off the beaten path solo, file a travel plan (float
plan, flight plan, funkengruven plan, whatever) with someone who will
follow up if you haven't reached a certain checkpoint by a
prespecified time. Give them the AIRS link so they can contact locals
in the event a search party is called for.
