Actually, it's not about the trend.  If you're hitting over 400, you 
want to know ASAP otherwise you're killing your heads.

I completely agree with Jake that the stock engine is misconfigured.  I 
can very easily hit over 400 on a hill going 20 at 3500RPM!  That's 
absolutely ridiculous.  And my engine is stock and I've rebuilt it a few 
times and I've been soooo meticulous to make sure everything is within 
spec.  So many people I know end up bringing their broken bus to the 
mechanic because of head problems and the heads get replaced without 
ever fixing the actual problem.  Then, out of frustration, they get rid 
of the bus and the next owner goes through the same cycle.

Btw, you might want to contact DD and ask them if they make, or are 
willing to make, an analog gauge.  There would probably be a good crowd 
of people that would be interested in that.
