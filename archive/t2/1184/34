I'd suggest Muir's book, "How to keep your Volkswagon alive for the 
compleat idiot", the list of people who can help you IF you need help 
on the way & Hwy 1 (in Calif) between heading up to Monterey. Across 
the road from Plaskett creek campground is Jade Cove, we used to find 
jade in the gravel.

I'd like to offer this camping web site... http://www.ultimatecampgrounds.com/
