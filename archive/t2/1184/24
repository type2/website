I have done this before.  And currently need another rattle can of L20B.
If they can't mix it from the paint code, they can attempt to scan a
good part and match it that way.  Campers have an easily removed painted
part of the fresh air duct.  When behind the wheel it is in front of
your left kneecap.  Antother easily detached painted piece is the fuel
door.
