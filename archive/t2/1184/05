Subject: Re: [T2] GoWesty Officially Partners with Volkswagen

This has been mentioned recently on the WetWesties List and the
Vanagon List in just the past several days about GoWesty.  But this is
really nothing new.  Vendors such as Bus Depot (as Ron has mentioned
on these lists), Airhead/VWG and several others have been dealing with
VW-Audi Classic Parts Division for quite some time, it just hasn't
been flashed about like GoWesty did.

As Ron posted, many of the items offered by the Classic Div. are
available elsewhere at much better pricing and not all are actual OE
manufactured parts.  In fact, Airhead/VWG only buys one part from them
and Airhead/VWG supplies many of the items that Airhead/VWG
manufactures/reproduces.  I'm sure that items that GoWesty
produces/reproduces will eventually make it into Classic's product
line as well.

Porsche has had a Classic Parts Division for many, many years.
Hopefully some of their experience will rub off on their VW partners
to make sure quality items are offered through their supply chain.
