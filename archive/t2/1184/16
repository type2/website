Subject: Replacing Rear Shift Rod Coupler

Hi Volks,
I have been having issues with getting my '68 Panel in gear. I found out
tonight that my rear shift rod coupler is shot. Is it possible to replace this
with out removing the transnission and engine?  I have all the bushings and
boots to replace next time I have to drop the engine. Please let me know.
