Subject: RE:  Herrell's Bug Parts Robbery

-- Over this past weekend, Herrell's Bug Parts (Carrollton, GA) was robbed.
As a customer, 
-- I am directly affected because the engine in my project bus was stolen.
If anyone in, 
-- or close to, the area hears of any engine "deals" in the near future,
beware! There were 
-- several stolen.

     or translate to:
"The ability to rob a VW shop is insignificant next to the power of the
List"
 
Sorry - been drinking this afternoon and thought the comparison was funny :)
 
Anyway, I hope the guys are caught and I hope they're caught because of
someone in the VW community ratting them out.
