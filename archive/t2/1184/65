Subject: Re: [T2] Dakota Digital CHT Gauge in a 1600DP readings?

I think in TX, in a Westy, you are about where you will be (you don't mention
how ambient has been.)  I'd say it is as expected particularly if you stay
more often toward the bottom of that range.  Occasional (hopefully very
occasional) forays to the upper end of that range are likely to be expected
under high load conditions, let it cool correctly after same.  Make sure your
cooling system is intact and leak free and that timing is correct (not too
advanced at revs, not too retarded at idle and off power) and that your
mixture is spot on and live happily.

If you start regularly seeing 400-425,
that is an absolute problem IMHO.

Just to wonder BTW, what ranges were the
VDO showing, just how inaccurate was it in comparison?

YMMV.

Replaced the VDO analog CHT gauge with a DD in my 71 Westy
(1600 DP Stock
motor) - trying to find the consensus of what CHT temp is
within a safe
range. Is 400 too high? Seems the readings are running 350 to
400 here in
Texas driving 55 and slower.
