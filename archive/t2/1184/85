I use the Rabbit relay in my '75 bus which has been fitted with
center-mount webber. added it as a safety precaution in case of an
accident to shut off the fuel pump if the engine stops running.

There's a link in the type2 library detailing this installation:

"Electric Fuel Pump Wiring by Scott Fraser "

Unfortunately the addresses this article points to
http://www.ratwell.com/mirror/sfraser/relay.html and
http://www.dolphinsci.com/relay.html both appear to no longer be
valid.

I was however able to find it in the internet archive/wayback machine
and here's a URL:

http://web.archive.org/web/20040216062748/http://www.dolphinsci.com/relay.html

might want to copy this down to your local machine, especially the
well done schematic, I think I'll print it out and stick a copy in the
back of my bentley right now!!
