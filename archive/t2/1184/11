well,, in Ontario, we have an optional 19A insurance policy that an agreed 
value is placed on the vehicle.. other wise the insurance company picks the 
value of the old clunker, and writes it off...
I got lucky recently,, my 74 Westfalia [cali no rust very good condition 
camper]  was considered a write off ..due to a bent bumper and body corner.. 
but they were forced to fix it.. I didn't accept the write off offer,,
My dad had a couple small creases in the passenger side doors of his daily 
driver. cough ford cough ,they told him it was a write off.. he settled for 
$2500 ....  and best he could replace it with was $7500... so.. for a couple 
hundred dollars for repairs outside the insurance deal,,he could have used 
his car for another 5 yrs. but the guy who hit him wouldn't work outside the 
ins deal...   leaving my dad to decide to pay to fix his own car,, or accept 
the write off deal.... or argue with the insurance co..... next time he will 
fight tooth and nail, no cooperation,, and only accept what he wants!!!! ... 
next time..
that can happen to any of us with a regular ins policy.
