11. I'm partial to Silverton Colo but take it easy on US 550 and red 
mountain pass.

12. take some time to drive route 66 at least somewhere although the 
Mojave desert is beautiful.

13. route 40 thru the rockies west of Denver is awesome, follow the Colo 
river thru "Dotsero cutoff" and Glenwood Canyon.


agree get off the highway and have fun
