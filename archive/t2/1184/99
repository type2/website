Subject: Mid-August road trip in central CA

Aug 20 - 6:30am depart Carmel, CA via G16 South.  54*F  Odo 319,035mi.
Two
lane road w/dips and bumps and sometimes a yellow center stripe.
Follows
Carmel valley floor.  Live oaks and manzanita trimmed in spanish
moss.  Poison
oak and a misty fog complete the scene.  Waved with an aswan
brown Vanagon
headed the opposite direction, towards Carmel.  Saw a live
young fawn on the
shoulder. At the end of this valley there are vineyards
and cattle.  Listening
to Van Morrison, Charlie Musslewhite, Henry Nilsson
et.al. and now I've  lost
KPIG 107.5 on the FM dial.  Radio station out of
Santa Cruz area.  Nearly
missed the jcn of G16 and G17 near the end of the
valley.    Turn around and
take the one-lane bridge for G16 toward
Greenfield, CA and hwy 101 South.
Southbound on the Camino Real, I am in King City before long.  I recall it
was
pretty hot here in past journeys, but at 8am today nice, foggy and in
the
60s.  Boring 4-lane interstate type hwy with a center median and 
shoulders. 
Making pretty decent time with light traffic and 62 mph.  I
put the speedo
needle through the 0 in the number 60 to maintain a 
constant speed.  The
miles tick along, Camp Roberts looks like an
abandoned army post.  The
barracks and church are pretty beaten with
paint peeling, boarded up and chain
link fence surrounding all.  And at
Paso Robles I find the Firestone-Walker
Brewery closed at 9. Opens
at 10 and unwilling to wait an hour for fresh beer,
I refuel and move
along.  Odo 319,150mi.

Traffic is reasonably light heading
South 101.  There are the obligatory
'left lane blockers' who appear to pass
trucks with their cruise control
set at 64mph.  It takes them 10 minutes to
pass a big rig.  And when the
Sheriff or CHP pull onto the freeway everybody
slows down from 70 to 
60mph.  Noone dares pass.  I did pass a sheriff. 
Showed them how to do 
it, just act cool and don't go over 70.  When the
black&white car pulls
off, it's green flag again and they all go like hell
past my bus.

Steep decent from Buellton to Gaviota.  Passed a silver over
violet splitty in the Ventura area. And watched a white bay hardtop camper
pull
off 101 in downtown Santa Barbara.  No other bus sightings today.  A
steep
incline into the San Fernando Valley.  And one more hill to climb out of
the valley and down into L.A. beneath the new bridge at the scene of last
year's 'carmageddon' fwy closure of 405 near Mullholland/Moraga Dr.

I
stretched my fuel a bit too far.  Pulled off the 405 at LA's Wilshire
Blvd,
found a station in nearby Brentwood.  Filled 14.19 gallons into my tank.
(My
record is 14.6 gallons.)  Back onto the slug-slab to find a traffic jam
near
LAX airport.  Looks like the Goodyear blimp was coming home to nest at
the
airship base in Carson.  2:30 back home in Costa Mesa, CA with 319,420
miles
on the clock and 85*F.  Now wash the bus, unpack and decide which of
770+
photos to post up on Flickr.  Thanks for reading and post your road
trip logs.
