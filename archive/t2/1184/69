Subject: Fuel pump relay question

Hi, I have installed a rotary electric fuel pump on my '74 1.8 Westy, with
twin Big Dels etc., and I have lost the wiring diagram for the relay I bought,
which I think was from a Rabbit, so..the #s are as follows on the relay:
SHO
$ 89 6321 000
12V max 10A ind
.PA6 - GF 30<
Made in Hungary
and then on the bottom edge a shematic I don't know how to read with..trminals
# 30  87  15  31  31b and these correspond to the trminals on the bottom.
There is also a 16 amp fuse of the stock type VW in my van across the top
I had a set of instructions from what goes where from a list member many moons
ago, and hope some one on the list can help me get this wired up so I can
finally bring new motor etc ..to life.
Thanks
Cheers
Scoggy
