Subject: Re: [T2] Propoane regulator pressure

Passing through is best for couple reasons in my thought process.   


I am
allowed to fill in Germany and Switzerland, but not allowed to have system
pressurized in France; I live 10 minutes from all 3.  Modifying original 78
Westphalia that is immaculate does not sit to well with me, especially since
you have to have a certified specialist sign off the work when you get into
the gas gas system.  Not disrupting anything is best option if i can just use
the tank and pass through original regulator.   


Pressure changes concerns
me only in as much as if the pressure is similar after it comes out of the
original regulator, i got to believe all is good.  The initial drop in
pressure in the tank I am a bit leary it will drop below the original
regulator pressure though.  My thought is if regulator at top of portable tank
is equal or greater, it will work no?   


It may fill the tank partially if i
was coming direct from portable tank, i do not suspect that will occur since
the portable bottle has a regulator right on top of it that i can n
ot get
away from.  That regulator will not allow liquid to escape but only in gaseous
form.


Propane is available readily in exchange tank  fashion and it is not
butane or other type gas they also use here.

Propane
tanks are filled liquid propane gas and it stays as a liquid under pressure. 
The pickup is actually near the top of the tank and as you relieve the
pressure, the liquid evaporates and off to your burner it goes.  I'd venture
to guess that you'd have to flip the source tank, but I wonder if you'd run
into any pressure/capacity issues.  I am by no means an expert, but it might
be something to be cautious of...
