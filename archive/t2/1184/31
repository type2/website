Subject: Re: Type 2 advice for road trip

I wanted to first say hello to you all (Hello!) and then to ask if you
would have any advice in regards
A: driving recommendations/advice on this roadtrip and
B: any places you would recommend we should see/not miss!

You should consider replacing any critical rubber items before the trip. The
ones that spring to mind are the brake hoses, fuel hoses and the steering
coupler at the base of the steering column. I had the "trifecta" with my bus:
brakes hoses were original, fuel hoses and steering coupler were cracked! All
of these are relatively easy to do, though you may be cursing me when doing
the steering coupler!
