Subject: Dakota Digital CHT Gauge in a 1600DP readings?

Replaced the VDO analog CHT gauge with a DD in my 71 Westy (1600 DP Stock
motor) - trying to find the consensus of what CHT temp is within a safe
range. Is 400 too high? Seems the readings are running 350 to 400 here in
Texas driving 55 and slower.

 

Thanks.
