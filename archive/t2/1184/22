Subject: make your own wrench to tighten oil pressure sender relocation

Hi,
Just wanted to share this in case somebody else can use it.

I'm installing a VDO dual oil pressure gauge (one terminal goes to the
dash light, the other to the gauge). It's too big for the hole in the
tin,

therefore needs a relocation hose.

But how do you tighten the latter? A crow foot might work, but I
didn't have one handy. But I did have a piece of 1/2" aluminum tubing,
I suspect for electrical conduits. Pinched one end with a bench vise:

et voil`:

So start the hose by hand, then slip the wrench over it and tighten
(but don't go crazy, it's a tapered fitting).

Here is the photo of the relocation hose. Note also the
Autozone-sourced thread sealant in lieu of teflon tape:
