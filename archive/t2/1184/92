Subject: 77 Westy - Double checking I did this right, replaced heater

I took off my 2.0L  77 swisscheese heater boxes and replaced them with headers
as others have done on the list. What I would like to make sure I've done
right is block off any  ductwork that will no longer be needed. I blocked off
the ducts coming out of the fan housing to the heater boxes themselves. Is
there anywhere else I should be blocking off to prevent cooling not happening
properly? I think those are the only two places, correct? If I could remember
who coached me through this before because they've done it, I wouldn't ask the
list. :-) I think it was a fellow Canuck.
Thanks,
Courtney
