 Very sage advice here folks. Obviously Doyt has been around the block
 before. I've travelled the southwest desert in August in an air conditioned
 car, and even then it's a bit of a shocker when you step out of your cocoon
 of cool air and the heat smacks you upside the head. This is the land that
 invented swamp-coolers for a very good reason, and as Doyt says, this is an
 historic year for heat. Having said that, I'd do it again in a heartbeat. I
 cut my teeth on that desert back in 74 with a 67 VW bug. No bottled water 
in
 those days, we used canvas bags that cooled down with evaporation cause you
 parked them on your front bumper. Of course, we had plenty of bottled beer
 though, cause we were in our early 20's and immortal. ;-)
 Regards,
 Courtney
