Propane tanks are filled liquid propane gas and it stays as a liquid 
under pressure.  The pickup is actually near the top of the tank and as 
you relieve the pressure, the liquid evaporates and off to your burner 
it goes.  I'd venture to guess that you'd have to flip the source tank, 
but I wonder if you'd run into any pressure/capacity issues.  I am by no 
means an expert, but it might be something to be cautious of...
