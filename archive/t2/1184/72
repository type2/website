I meant that it's worth having even an inaccurate CHT gauge to get  
qualitative data: if you usually run 350degF indicated and all of the  
sudden you're running 380...you know there may be a problem.

This saved me on a cold day on the NJ Turnpike when a paper towel got  
sucked into my fan...

Regarding contacting DD...I might do just that.  Great idea.

Cheers,
