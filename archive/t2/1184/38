Subject: Propoane regulator pressure

who knows what the regulator pressure is on my factory installed propane
system?   Have my US bus in France and want to use portable tank with
regulator to just pass through the tank (cannot be filled in france).   Just
need to ensure the original regulator is less pressure than the one on the
portable bottle and I should be good right?    


I have bought the filler
port nozzle and have a stainless hose fabricator who can make the metric
thread end for european regulator connection and the NPT thread connection on
the filler nozzle nipple.
