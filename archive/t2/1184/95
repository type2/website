there are actually 4 places that need blocking.
everyone sees the larger blower ducts but up underneath there are two 
rectangular outlets about 1inX2in that need to be blocked.

also as someone else mentioned the holes in the tin neeed to be blocked.
and don't forget that small piece of tin above the pushrodtubes that must 
remain it is critical piece of the cooling system.

good luck
