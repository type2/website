That's the funny thing - so much is wrapped up in the vehicle's 
appearance (how good is the shiny paint) when it's rust free condition 
or parts underneath are as important or more important than the parts a 
bystander can see. Nothing I've done to my bus recently helps it's 
appearance.

I'll use my bus often and in all weather (except salted roads) when it 
is finished but I'll treat it like a the "new car" it is b/c of the time 
I will have spent on bodywork and interior. Watched a bunch of videos 
last night of folks jumping and four-wheeling their buses. Let me tell 
you, I have not enjoyed rebuilding the suspension. ;) Won't be doing 
anything rough with the bus that breaks torsion bars or bends suspension 
components.

I want a lift next time I rebuild a bus suspension. Am getting to a 
point where laying in odd positions under my vehicles trying to tighten 
or loosen fasteners doesn't have the appeal it did 25 years ago. Wait - 
that makes me sound like a decrepit old man which I'm not. I'd just 
rather take the rear hubs off standing up than laying down.
