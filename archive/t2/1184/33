Here are some afterthoughts for Steve and Rose, beyond just survival.

I'd suggest Colorado national Monument as a very special 
destination  during your adventure. Nothing like it.

Also, try this web site / blog.

Maybe read this book or few like it:

And, consider joining the YMCA and taking advantage of reciprocity by 
planning stop-overs of a day or two near YMCAs that have heated pools, hot 
tubs, saunas and steam rooms. Traveling in a VW bus does require 
rehabilitation now and then, and YMCA's exist almost everywhere and offer 
lots of resources.
