Subject: Accurate Analog CHT Gauge? (was Re: [T2] Dakota Digital CHT

Out of curiosity...has anyone found a fairly accurate *analog* CHT gauge?

I don't run a CHT gauge anymore after my last VDO under-the-sparkplug sender
died, and I figured "Well if it's not that accurate, why bother?"

(I know, it's the trend, not the reading, but still...)

I'd install a different brand gauge, but I just can't stand the  
ambiance of the digital dakotas...I want analog, dammit.

Anyone have another analog CHT gauge that they feel good about?

Cheers,
    Tom
