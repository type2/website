Funny you mention that Bob, I commented on it (I presume it was only in the
one split second shot behind the MG, just about left 1/4 of the front for 4-5
frames) and my wife was like, "how the hell did you see that?" when I made her
rewind the DVR for a look.   Looked to be a high roof.  Maybe it showed again
but I didn't really watch, just looked up from the computer for a second and
there it was.

Any known factoids on the bus that was in the
Olympiad closing ceremony?
