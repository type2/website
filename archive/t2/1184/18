Who restores early Rabbits and Scirrocos? Seriously. Nothing against 
those cars, I've very happily owned an '84 Rabbit convertible when I was 
stationed in Italy and would gladly own it again.

Seems like much of VW's history came with cars lacking a radiator. Why 
would you ignore 50 years of aircooled vehicles? Because the aftermarket 
options are plentiful?

Everything after was bread and butter to most folks after the aircooled 
vehicles were obsoleted. The Vanagon was a standout b/c it was unique 
during it's era.

Project update: rear hubs removed! Am not getting under the bus again 
until the bigger jackstands arrive - maybe today. Was under it briefly 
last night and it's scary to me.
