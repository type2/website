Subject: Re: [T2] What paint is a reasonable likeness to Pastel White

Obvious answer Scott, Pastel White, and I do hear what you are saying (and
agree with the formulations being often yellow compared to OEM) and of course
if yours is a repaint, the last match may have been bad.

But seriously, call
around, find a PPG or other dealer with a computer (PPG calls theirs Prophet)
match who fills spray cans.  Usual cost is about $10-15 a can, which ain't
that much all in all in todays world with a good unmatched auto paint going
$5-7 a can.  They will shoot the match for free, just polish a small area out
before you go to speed stuff up and the shoot and mix will take about 15-20
minutes if they aren't busy.  Some places do demand you buy 2 cans but will
usually count 2 colors, so shoot the red if you have to as well, or if you
need 2 cans of white there you go.

Not all places have the computer, not all
places fill spray cans, but even in BFN towns of 20000 in WV, I could get it
done at either the PPG or Dupont dealers, here in BGN Alaska I can get cans
but not from a place with a computer, or a computer match from someone who
doesn't do cans, it is either/or unless I drive to Anchorage.
