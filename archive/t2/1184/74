Subject: Re: [T2] Accurate Analog CHT Gauge? (was Re: [T2] Dakota

My analog VDO was so worthless that I did not even hook it up on my last
engine build.

I am probably going to go digital with the "meter" mounted in the 3 bay dash
pod where I read oil temp and oil pressure with analog.

Do we really have to put that thingy under the spark plug !?!?

My newly installed 1600dp runs sweet, but I still have low speed and idle
issues with the 34pict3. Will take it apart and clean it 'mo 'betta this
weekend!
