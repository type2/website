Congratulations on your purchase and welcome to the list.  Your first order
of business should be to go to the AIRS (Air-cooled Interstate Rescue
Squad) site and get a list of potential helpers along your route should you
encounter a mechanical problem or you are unable to decide which local brew
is the best.

Since my long distance travels occur with a modern Eurovan based RV, I'll
leave the more VW bus related questions for the other listees.
