 In other words, our vans are becoming "classic cars", to be coseted and
treated a bit like china. Not how they were intended but then that's not how
 most cars considered "classic" were designed either.

 Presumably the scene will split into two - people who want transport and
those who want concours perfect cars. Just like every other marque, some
people will do it all themselves and others will buy in the services to a
greater or lesser extent. No one is stopping you shade tree mechanicing and
until the numbers of buses in existance drops considerably, they won't.

That's the thing. For those of us who valued the VW philosophy as an
inexpensive, practical vehicle, those days are fading fast.
