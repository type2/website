I bought late-bay stuff from Wolfsburg West and Bus Depot this week. 
Both were quite professional, both have excellent parts selection. Bus 
Depot even supplied stuff for my watercooled VW Cabrio.

I know what you mean by dealing with garage outfits but there is a core 
group of quality suppliers here and on the other antique VW forum that 
are very, very good and I try to support them all. While they have some 
overlap, each also brings some unique services and parts to the hobby.

I've dealt with a few local places where shiny and flashy parts were the 
priority and durability and quality were near last. Felt like they were 
selling parts to 16 year olds who didn't know any better or guys who 
build cars and keep them for six months tops before they zip off to the 
next toy purchase.

I don't buy from those guys anymore and haven't for over two decades 
(where did the time go?) once I found myself replacing parts that should 
have lasted at least 60% as long as the ancient original parts on my 
antique cars. If the replacement can't last over a year, then I have 
zero interest in spending my money on it. I'm pointing directly at JC 
Whitney circa 1992 (among others) here and that's about the last time I 
used JC Whitney. Hopefully they're better than they used to be.

Glad that VW is recognizing finally that there are alot of American 
watercooled VW drivers who cut their teeth on the aircooled products or 
who appreciate both eras. Not sure I can afford to do business with 
GoWesty though. I'd like to see more than GoWesty alone be an official 
VW factory supplier. Competition is good for the consumer.

Westy update: rear hubs disassembled - almost. Ordered this and that for 
the rear suspension and brakes. Working on putting the cabrio interior 
back together. Waiting for two new heavy duty jackstands from an online 
retailer b/c I realized my little Craftman jackstands are pretty dinky 
under there and fully extended - at their max tippiness and weakest 
setting. Scared to get under the rear of the bus without 
tires/suspension on it and those dinky jackstands. Enroute are a pair of 
6 ton Torin jackstands that match my front jackstands. Mostly need the 
larger footprint and higher lift - they don't need to be fully extended 
to lift the bus as high as I have it now (with the rear tires about 2" 
above the concrete).
