Mid-August road trip to central CA

Aug16 - Depart Costa Mesa, CA 4:30am  318,483mi.
Easy going through the LA and Santa Barbara areas before the commuter
traffic begins.  405 to 101 North.  Stop to walk and watch the sea
at Gaviota St Beach. old steel train trestle and wooden pier.

Proceed North via Hwy 1 to Lompoc.  Stop at the cemetary to walk and
take a rest.  Chat with caretaker and ask directions to Surf.  Lompoc
was providing 90% of the world mustard crop 100 years ago.  And also at
that time became the flower and flower seed capitol.  Lots of history.
Proceed West via Ocean Ave.  The snowy plover is nesting and the auth.
close the beach after 50 citations are issued for harassing birds/nests.
Beach reopens Sep 30.  I was under surveillance at the Surf Amtrak stn.

Further travel via Hwy 1 to Orcutt, Guadelupe, Oceano.  Stopped to take
photos near flower fields.  Quick stop at Pismo Beach as I decided not
to take the bus onto the sand.  Need to go further North, not get stuck.

Morro Bay 318,787mi.  Stopped at Montana de Oro for a rest and walk on
the beach.  Campgrounds are full.  Proceed North and around the bay to
the rock.  The core of an ancient volcano w/peregrine falcons nesting.
Spend the afternoon goofing around on the beach. Camp north of Morro Rock
near Atascadero road.  Nice tent camp 20' from the sand.  Upwind of
what appears to be a sewage treatment plant. ?!  Notice huge RV park
downwind.

Aug17 - Depart Morro Bay
Hwy 41 to Atascadero and 101 to Paso Robles.  Destination, Firestone
Walker Brewing Co.  Purchase a case of "805" light ale availalable
only in the local area at this time.  Bottling date: 08/10/12 11:46!
Proceed Northbound via 101 to Bradley.  Take state road G18 to G14
through Ft.Hunter-Liggett.  Taking the road to Lucia on Hwy 1.  Very
narrow, windy and steep the last 12 mi.  Take it slow at 15-25mph
2nd gear to keep from burning the brakes.  Much cooler on the coast.

Enjoying the driving too much to stop for photos, BTDT.  I've sway bars,
Konis and LT tires on my bus.  Checked-out on a rental(?) new-Mustang.
Saw a pod of Type2s on PCH and a handful of solos heading Southbound.
At Carmel Valley for the night.  Saddle Mt Camping off Schulte Rd.
New to me insect activity beneath a tree in camp.  1/2" long capterpillars
rappel in on silk threads, and on the way down crap little green turds.
I am not tripping.  Locals say it's seasonal.   318,966mi.
