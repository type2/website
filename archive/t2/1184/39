Subject: Re: [T2] Propoane regulator pressure

Hi,
Why pass through and not bypass the original tank?  This being said, if you
connect the two tanks, would the pressure not equalize, in effect, you
partially refilling your original tank?

Anyway, go to Castorama, Bricorama or Bricolex and look for the various
propane valves. They come in different "debits" i.e. flow rates. Also note
that Butane and "gaz naturel" or "gaz de ville" valves and fittings are not
interchangeable with propane fittings.  I'm just surprised you found a
fabricator willing to make the hose. Good for you.
