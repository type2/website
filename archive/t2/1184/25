Subject: Type 2 advice for road trip

Hello Type2ers!

My name is Steve Mac Devitt, an Irishman who's just realised one of his
life dreams by becoming the proud owner of a 76 Westie. My good friend Dave
Bolan is giving me a hand tuning up and preparing my van for it's
forthcoming road trip and highly recommended signing up and introducing
myself to the Type2 list.

Myself and my partner (Rose, an OregonianArkansan) are planning on
undertaking a road trip from Arkansas (where we are now) west across New
Mexico and Arizona into California and then north up the coast to Portland.
If all goes to plan we hope to leave in the next 10 days or so.

I wanted to first say hello to you all (Hello!) and then to ask if you
would have any advice in regards
A: driving recommendations/advice on this roadtrip and
B: any places you would recommend we should see/not miss!

Bit of background - I'm a photographer/filmmaker and will be shooting while
we're on the road. I would class my auto skills 'inexperienced' but I'm
getting VW 101's off my mechanic as we speak. Our van is a 1976 Pop-top
westie is good condition with dual battery, 2000 fuel injection engine and
running great. If there's any other info you need let me know.

Thanks again - here's to the start of a beautiful relationship!

Steve & Rose
