Subject: Mid-August road trip in central CA

Aug 17 - Lodged at Saddle Mt Camping  27625 Schulte Rd.  Carmel, CA
Tent spaces & full-hookup RV sites.  Hot water/showers, flush toilets,
Swimming pool, wireless internet service.  Grocery store 1.5 mi away.
Why spend $300 for Motel6 when you can Type2 camp for 1/6 that rate?

G16 Carmel Valley Rd to G20 at 6:30am.  Spirited 5mi drive up
and over the Laureles Grade to the entrance of Laguna Seca Raceway.
Where we wait 'till 7 when the gates open.  Steward, Lee, asked me to
pull fwd 50' and hold 5 min because the box office is not open yet.  
"If cars try to pass, shoot their tires out."  Joke.  On me it seems.
I stop and every car blows past me.  They must think I broke down.  No
After 10 cars, I join in the procession toward purple parking.

Saw many historic race cars in pits/on track.  Alva, Alfa-Romeo,
MG, Cooper, Jaguar, Lister, Pooper, Porsche, MBZ, Chevy, BMW, Ferrari,
Bizarinni, Aston-Martin, Chevron, Mazda LeMans car, Renault, Datsun, Morgan,
Bugatti, Sciata, Abarth, Lancia, blah blah etc.  Heavy Ford influence
due to Shelby as the featured marque this year.  50th anniversary of
the Cobra, and they are out in force.  Mustangs, Daytonas, Cobras abound.
Saw Jay Leno, clad in denim, near the start/finish part of the grounds.

Some of the early cars in the Pre-1940 Sports Racing and Touring cars
group have a 2-man crew.  One to drive the car and one to manage the
onboard systems and navigate.  Wooden spoke wheels.  There is a yellow
Ferrari LM250 model that I have seen here before in the 1955-1962 GT
cars group.  Adam Carolla (Man Show) drove a vintage Datsun in the
'73-82 IMS GT, GTX AAGT, GTU/GTO car group.

For those of you have read this far, some relevant information follows.
FINALLY, some air-cooled content.  Of course there were many Porsches.
A Cooper w/Porsche engine known as a Pooper.  I saw a small 2dr BMW 700
of ~1965 vintage.  1958 Denzel made in Austria.   Wooden framed Morgan
3-wheelers with two cylinder JAP engines and chain driven rear wheel.

Looking forward to tomorrow and the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance.
