Steve & Rose,

Sounds like you're in for a grand adventure.

I have lots of thoughts, but not much time, so here are a couple of  
quick bullets...

1. Take your time and be patient: both on your trip and with your VW.

2. Have fun.

3. Install and oil temperature gauge and keep your oil temps under 230  
or 240degF.  Some would say keep it under 220degF.

4. If either of the idiot lights come on on the dash while driving -  
especially at speed - shut off the vehicle and pull over immediately.   
If it's the oil light, check the oil level.  If it's the alternator  
light, check the belt - this belt also cools your engine.  Note: carry  
a spare belt and the tools you'll need to change it.

5. Carry a second spare tire if you have room.

6. Carry 5 gallons of gas in case you get stuck out in the middle of nowhere.

7. A wet towel draped over you cooler can help your ice last longer  
(as the water evaporates and keeps it cool) - especially while you're  
parked in the sun and off hiking or some such.

8. Your VW can go a lot of places - such as dirt roads - if you want  
to take it there.  Don't be afraid to drive it.  :-)

9. Take lots of pictures and note where you take them...

Locations to check out/things to do:

1. Telluride, CO (cute little mountain town, worth grabbing a coffee  
in) or any small mountain towns in Colorado (Leadville also comes to  
mind).  I'm also partial to Boulder and Denver, CO if you're farther  
north.

2. Mesa Verde (ancient Indian Cliff Dwellings)

3. Santa Fe or Taos, NM

4. Stay in an "Earthship" for a night or two in NM:

5. Go online and buy a book of off-road adventures in NM or AZ, there  
are a number of such books available on amazon and they describe trips  
of varying difficulty that take you places like ghost towns, etc.

6. Prescott, AZ (cute town)

7. Anza-Borrego Desert Wilderness in CA, then grab apple pie in Julian, CA

8. The Superstition Wilderness.

9. Monterey Aquarium in Monterey, CA.

10. Get off the highway in West Texas and take some rural  
routes...it's fascinating.

Hope this helps...

Cheers,
    Avocado Tom Tarka
