Subject: RE: [T2] the craziest bus mod I've ever seen

I guess the person couldn't find a gas heater to install or got tired of
the tepid factory heating system :)

What sort of person did this? Hard core Deadhead? Hard core semi-extreme
camper? Was it someone's permanent residence? Did the shag carpeting,
mirrored ceiling, and waterbed get pulled back out sometime in the past?

Those things can be pretty messy.

Wow!

Installed a wood burning fireplace stove complete with a stone
hearth into their running bus! Check out the pix, and
sorry for the *bay ad, but I repeat, I AM NOT
PROMOTING THIS AD IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER!!
