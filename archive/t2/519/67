Subject: Re: [T2] Bay motor in a Vanagon?

You could do it but it is not that simple (as changing the flywheel) You
have a completely different alternator/  heat set up on the bay window bus,
and you will never have heat in the vanagon because of this.  That motor has
round exhaust ports, so it even is not as simple as swapping heat
exchangers.......The ducting simply does not work out.  The oil fillerand
dipstick would be in wierd locations as well, making you open the top of the
engine cover for access......(allthough that is minor)

I once worked on a vanagon where someone put round port 2 liter heads on it
and wantedme to rig heat...............could not be done. I suggested them
to add a gas heater.
