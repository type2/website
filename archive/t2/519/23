Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel control valve idea

Airod, an Austrailian company, makes solenoid valves and will ship you
one for ~$US30. For another $US30, they'll send you a controller that
monitors the engine pulse and the current to the ignition. When the
pulse stops, the valve closes. When the ignition is first turned to
run, a 3 second burst of fuel is allowed to pass through the valve (so
you can start you motor).
I haven't done the install yet. A little VR / ALT problem took up all
my available time since I received the goods. I'll be doing an install
in a few weeks, while replacing all of the fuel and vent lines. Seemed
like a good time to improve the fire safety. If I can get my hands on a
digital camera, I'll document it. The instructions that came with the
valve and controller look very simple.
Hope that helps. I know others have tried non-gasoline specific valves
and have had varying results. I looked into vacuum ones, but getting a
used one on <auction site name here> was close to $50, and didn't seem
as reliable and secure a solution. good luck--
