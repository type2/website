Hi Folks,

My first vote would be for the 2.0 FI engine and 091 transmission.  Great 
power and good highway speed are key for me.

My second vote would be for the '78-style exhaust flanges complete with 
72-74-style muffler.  Again, good power plus simplicity plus availability of 
replacements.

My third vote is for a custom interior incorporating a poptop, a middle 
seat, and a late-70s Westy bed.  I like the idea of cabinets along the 
driver's side, but I'd look for something other than the full-height cabinet 
that blocks the window.

My fourth vote is for an interior fabric that's ANYTHING other than the 
nasty '70s plaid.  Black cloth, color-keyed cloth, or smooth vinyl would be 
fine.  I guess the West German ganja was pretty good back then, and the 
designers took advantage of it!

Of course, you could really get crazy and put in a V-8 engine; put in a 
5-speed trans; lower the suspension 3"; upgrade the shocks, brakes, 
swaybars; put on 17" wheels with Z-rated tires; black out all the windows; 
install a 7,000 watt stereo; pimp out the interior with purple shag carpet.  
Be sure to get a radar detector, since you would have to drive it at 
insanely fast speeds....

Seriously, though, to echo another opinion, my ideal Bus is a slightly more 
mechanically sound version of my daily driver.  I could drive across the 
country at the drop of a hat, and I'd only need to plan for a day or two of 
adjustments or repairs.  Not too bad for a 25-year-old vehicle!
