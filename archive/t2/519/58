I probably wouldn't run a return line either but keep your testing time to a minimum: the pump is very strong and you'll drain your gas can and fill up the tank faster than you realize (perhaps at a rate of a gal every 4 minutes).

7mm (multiply by 1.071428571428571 if you live in Fresno ;-)

Experience teaches the VW owner to replace everything possible on a 25 yr old vehicle at every engine removal opportunity. Unfortunately you'd spend no time enjoying your bus and all of it reading type2.com archives to be the wiser.

Bird beak is my guess also. Give me a call if you need any assistance.
