let me put this disclaimer out first: I do not own a dual carb bus. 

Moving to a single carb in that environment is not a good idea. carb
icing is the problem. There are no hear risers to keep the manifold at
a temp to help keep condensation from happening. This causes a bit of
idle problems. Do some searching in the archives for more information
on this. 

One other alternative is to go w/ a system such as here:

I have not seen or heard from anyone who is running this setup on the
t-4 engine, but have talked w/ one who was very happy with the results
on his t-1 engine. They have chokes too!
