They always faced forward (factory passenger buses) in all years. Other variations involve busdriver feng shui.

Depends on the condition you get it in. I bought a $150 '79 sunroof (complete) and it works like a champ.

The cables are very expensive if you have to replace them, and rust can be an issue if the 4 drain tubes were not maintenances. 

Upside, the sunroof is huge! I can't wait to get the '79 on the road and head up to Sequoia Nat'l Forest, look at the big trees thru the big window.

Or my kids can anyway :(
