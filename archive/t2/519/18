Subject: cooling tin

Hi chaps

Finally I have put together the 1800 engine on Polly.  After 2 years.  The
seems a bit ragged here and there and I seem to remember that the tin had
some sticky stuff  (not just old oil) at the joints.

So how airtight does the tin have to be?  Do I need to seal it all together?
and if so what with?

Thanks

John
