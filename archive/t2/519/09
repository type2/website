Which we all now know is not true thanks to Mr. Atwell's post, if we didn't know it already.

This is why it pains me to death to hand over my bus to mechanics now.

The last "good" one I had was taking my '65 to a VW bodyshop place for an estimate on replacing the torsion leaves they took out when they lowered the front to match the sagging back (DPO).

The shop manager drives a slammed to the ground panelvan that rides like ass, which is exactly the look I'm NOT striving for.

He tells me, "I can do it, but it won't make it ride any better."

Hey, did I ask your opinion? No. I asked for an estimate.

Gonna do it myself.

Billy
