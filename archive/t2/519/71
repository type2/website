according to the wd-40 website they specifically say it's not.

from the FAQ:

What does WD-40 contain?
While the ingredients in WD-40 are secret, we can tell you what WD-40
does NOT contain. WD-40 does not contain silicone, kerosene, water,
wax, graphite, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), or any known cancer-causing
agents
