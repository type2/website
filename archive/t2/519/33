Subject: the craziest bus mod I've ever seen

First of all, this is NOT my auction, nor am I
promoting this auction for anyone else, I have NO
CONNECTION with the seller, but you have to go to this
ad and check out what this person has done: Installed
a wood burning fireplace stove complete with a stone
hearth into their running bus! Check out the pix, and
sorry for the *bay ad, but I repeat, I AM NOT
PROMOTING THIS AD IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER!!
Anyway, her's the link, cut and paste if it doesn't
work:
