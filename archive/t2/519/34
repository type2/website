just don't think of it as lubricant in the sense of grease or 3-in-1 oil or the 
like. What you want on those door parts is grease or oil at worst.

Doesn't WD-40 have components that evaporate quickly?
Kerosene or some such?

I personally find PB-Blaster or Kroil a better product for unstickin'
stuff, but WD-40 has a better ad agency and probably a better
arrangement with the big auto parts/products chains...Notice how
WD-40 is placed in the aisles...Usually it's hard to miss it and there's
almost always a "special" that gets it positioned at the end of an
aisle or at the register for better impulse buying...It's not snake
oil, but it's not quite as good as the hype...
Armor All is another product that tends to get over used; mostly be-
cause of its ads...
