I haven't measured how much fluid it takes to crest the top of the pan but
the gas doesn't have to be above the level of the pan to reach the fuel
outlet. There are a couple of little holes in the side otherwise you'd run
out of gas with only a few gallons in the tank unless you rocked the bus as
you drove down the highway. It's possible to run the tank dry and get
stranded.
