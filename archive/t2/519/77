While the ingredients in WD-40 are secret, we can tell you what WD-40
does NOT contain. WD-40 does not contain silicone, kerosene, water,
wax, graphite, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), or any known cancer-causing
agents

Naphtha...With trace amounts of petroleum based oil for very little
lubrication after the naphtha evaporates...And perfume of some
