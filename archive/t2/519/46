Subject: FI pressure gauge

 I had to return the FI pressure tester I borrowed a while back and I didn't like the one I bought (I eBay'd it for a 50% profit, shhh ;-) so I thought I'd just make my own (actually Scott Lyons convinced me it was all I needed). I wasted a lot of time researching the 1318/17 adapter for the "official" VW pressure gauge hoping it would screw into the 4mm hole on the fuel rail only to discover you basically get a piece of hose for $57.

Uber accurate test gauges were over $100 so for much less I bought a nice 1% accurate all stainless industrial gauge with a safety glass window (I read acrylic and polycarbonate windows weren't gasoline resistant). Anyway, it's got a 1/4" NPT fitting and I need to seal it to my hose adapter which is 1/4" NPT to a barbed fitting.

What's an appropriate gas-proof sealant to apply to the threads?
