Casting Fool, Joel,

Yes, this is basically what I meant.  I use WD-40 for the same things, I just don't think of it as lubricant in the sense of grease or 3-in-1 oil or the like. What you want on those door parts is grease or oil at worst.

Doesn't WD-40 have components that evaporate quickly?
Kerosene or some such?

Billy
