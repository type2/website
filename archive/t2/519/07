No you didn't. 

You probably know this, but it's important for new volk. WD-40 is a solvent, not a lubricant. 

I learned this when I soaked my roller blade bearings in it when I was in high school (DOH!) The bearings spun extremely fast, but I had a roostertail of welding sparks behind me 20' long.

Lubed it? Or WD-40'd it?
