Under the torsion bar housing is good. The engine carrier is pretty flimsy for lifting 3500 lbs. 

I lifted mine on 1" square tubing (previous hitch arrangement) and though it didn't bend, it really bowed alot. 

I only mention this because I consider the strength of the materials to be similar. So i guess you could, but why take the chance? 

I lift under the front tranny mount myself on a late baywindow. On an early baywindow I'd lift under the torsion bar using a 4x4 beam running side to side.
