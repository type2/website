Not hated, just aesthetically not as nice.  My personal preference is for
the earlier signals that flowed with the shape of the body.  Also, the
higher signals heralded the smaller emblem.

I can't argue with you there.  I've pondered creating an auxilary signal
with LEDs inside the vent grill.  Keeps the lines, but makes the signal
more visible.

Actually, the third brake light is a federal requirement.  I think tha the
higher signals are more a styling point of the manufaturers than anything
else.

It would have required a much more complex stamping for the "scoop", and
would have been really outlandish in 1973.  They did improve the signals
(functionally) that year in the rear.
