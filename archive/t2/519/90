Is the Champagne bumper different or will they work on any '72 - '79?

Nice and shiny for those that want that. I'm debating because when I reach
that point on the '74 I'll probably have the bumpers powdercoated. If I go
that route and decide I want overriders I'd rather find a used set to
powdercoat than destroy these. Chrome may look good though...
