Ok, I guess I'll make doubly-sure it's the tank outlet that's clogged 
by clamping off the tank->filter line, and running a new line from a 5 
gallon can into the filter.  I don't think I'll bother running the 
return line back to the can.

7.5mm ID from tank to filter?

Anyway, if that causes the pump noise to go away, I guess I get to pull 
the engine again (oh the irony; the tank came out to replace the sender 
when I had my rebuilt engine installed ... why wouldn't the tank have 
plugged up way back then?)

My best guess is that a bit of the "bird beak" from the filler elbow 
broke off.  Grumble.  I know that elbow is cracked, and I'd like to 
replace it, but isn't the NLA "bird beak" elbow required to pass smog?
