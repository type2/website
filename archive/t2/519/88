I have no idea -- mine are NOS kit # ZVW 151 870 distributed by VWOA
according to the included instruction sheet. I just noticed the discrepancy
between the part number on the box and the one on the instructions. The
shhet says the kit contains:

LF - ZVW 151 871
RF - ZVW 151 872
LR - ZVW 151 873
RR - ZVW 151 874
4 plastic spacer bushings
4 large flat washers
4 lock washers
4 nuts
8 vinyl strips

They mount by drilling 3/8" holes in the bumper. 1 hole per overrider. No
straps.
