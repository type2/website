What a spectacular mod! So cool--it's not the wood stove so much as the huge
basalt rocks. You won't even notice the impact of the cast iron Chinese wood
stove when you have a front end collision, because the quarter-ton lava
rocks have torn your nervous system out midway up your spine & propelled it
along with your decapitated cranium 100 yards forward to cartwheel along.

Hey, some of your tool boxes could do just as much damage in just the same
way. At least this provides ambiince. =^ )
