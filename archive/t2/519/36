That's the cheap valve that I was looking at so closely... Thanks for the reminder.

Airod, an Austrailian company, makes solenoid valves and will ship you
one for ~$US30. For another $US30, they'll send you a controller that
monitors the engine pulse and the current to the ignition. When the
pulse stops, the valve closes.
