Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel control valve idea

Airod, an Austrailian company, makes solenoid valves and will ship you
one for ~$US30. For another $US30, they'll send you a controller that
monitors the engine pulse and the current to the ignition. When the
pulse stops, the valve closes. When the ignition is first turned to
run, a 3 second burst of fuel is allowed to pass through the valve (so
you can start you motor).


So were you able to order via credit card and their website? Might still go this route. My bus is geeting SOMETHING be it "your" valve or "my" valve. <grin!>

Thanks! 

Chris
