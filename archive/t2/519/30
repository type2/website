Thanks Tim. I called him and told him what you said. He said, "Wow, you
found that out on the internet?" Randy isn't always the brightest bulb but
he's never screwed me. I've known him for 20 years and take jobs to him
that I don't want to mess with or don't have the time to deal with. I
usually know what the solution is myself and give him as much info as I
can. And he's usually available on short notice. For the real challenges I
have to get an appointment 30 days in advance at another shop. Anyhow, I
directed him to deal with the alternator and wiring issues before doing
anything to the ignition.
