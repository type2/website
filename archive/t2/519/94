Geralds overriders are cut to fit bumpers with the rubber impact strip 
on it. I have a set that are made to go on the later style bumpers 
without the rubber strip. Most of these overriders are US made.
Mine also have the brackets like Collies so no drilling the bumper. I 
might be able to get a pic if anyone wants.
