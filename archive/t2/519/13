I think Marco must have been thinking of the non-FI tank.

Eh, I'm not going to hold a tank outlet description mistake against 
these guys (it certainly did me no harm, other than getting my hopes up 
for an easier repair).  All they work on are Busses and Vanagons (well, 
ok, I've seen a couple of really nice old Beetles in there before, and 
Marco does have a couple of early 911s in there, too...)

Every experience I've had with Buslab has been positive, and I would 
recommend them to anyone in a heartbeat.
