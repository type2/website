you don't mention the year, but if you can reach the carrier with a jack:

NO!

68-71 the carrier sits on rubber mounts on the left and right side.
(hard-mount to the engine in the middle, but above the oil pump, and
between the exhaust and case...hard to reach!)

72+ the carrier has hard-mounts on the left and the right, with the engine
sitting on rubber mounts....but I still can't picture getting a jack on
it.


The best place, IMHO, to jack the rear of the bus is from the center of
the torsion tube, just front of the front transaxle mount.  Be sure you
don't lift by the transaxle mount itself, of course.

Front:  Center of the front beam.
	Left and right of center if you need to lift only one side (and
        much as this works. It's generally much easier to lift the entire
        end of a bus then to try to lift a corner..

Rear:   Center of the torsion tube.
	Left and right of the torsion beam, where the spring-plates
        attach.  It's generally fine to lift right at the spring-plate
        cover.



Stock jack points don't work for anything except the stock jack.  And
obviously a stock jack will only work in the stock jack points.

A scissor jack or a floor (trolley) jack will lift at any of these other
locations, though.

I'd never suggest using a bottle jack, unless you have one similar to the
one sold by Griots...
