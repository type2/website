Hello,

Where was the rubber made? Germany? Brazil? Make sure
that the seal is seated on the glass really well. It
helps to use a lulubricant such as liquid soap to do
this. Installing glass is a 2 person job. You need one
person to hold the window in place and press on the
glass while you slowly pull the cord from the inside
and get the lip of the seal around the metal "lip".
What ever you do DON'T trim the rubber. If it is the
correct rubber for that window, it is suppose to be
very tight as to keep water out.

Good Luck!

Regards,
David Kelly
