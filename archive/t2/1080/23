Subject: Re: Replacing Rubber Scrapers and Metal Trim on Front Doors

Don't know about rivet. Here is what I have in my files. It was written 22 
May 2003 by Chris Mills in TN:
"If you replace the window scrapers (outside) that come with the aluminum
trim be sure to save your OEM trim and reuse it. The replacement trim is
poor aluminum and very fragile. The OEM stuff was stronger in my opinion.
The replacement clips are a joke being aluminum vs. spring steel which I
think the OEM versions were. I used some generic GM nylon trim clips with
the head cut down as a replacement. Much better than even the OEM clips. I
can provide more detail if necessary."
