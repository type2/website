Subject: Re: [T2] alternator wiring

Answers to Question 1:  Yes, it includes BOTH connectors which are identical
- one fits on the alternator and one fits on the voltage regulator.  In
addition and on the voltage regulator side there is the Blue Pigtail Wire
that branches off to an insulated connector that connects to the Alternator
Light Wire to the Front and to Terminal A on the Heater Blower Fan Relay
(Refer to any 72 thru 79 Wiagram in Bentley or on Thom Fitzpatrick's
Vintagenus.com wiring diagrams on file).    Further, there are the two
grommets, one for the engine tin and one for the tin in back of the
alternator.

Answer to Question 2:  Yes this is for the boot under the cover for the B+
Terminal for the Red Wire and Black Wire with correct crimped Ring
Terminals.  As I said before, the 113 971 901 A Boot is originally for the
12V Generator Posts, but they (a repro) are a tad bit smaller than the
original style boot and with a bit of patience you can insert the wires
through the boot's straight end.  The round end will stretch over where it's
supposed to, just a little tighter.  It's unfortunate VW no longer makes
this boot or something closer.  I don't include the boot, but I will toss
one in the bag for $2 ($2.19 w/Sales Tax for Calif) extra.  I probably would
have included/installed one but my finger's aren't near as nimble as they
used to be 25-40 years ago.

Technically, I finished production the bare harness (100 Pieces) almost a
year ago, but was reluctant to offer/sell it unless it was properly
completed with the 3 pole connectors.  Bosch use to make these a very, very
long time ago.  But with dogged persistence over the months, I finally
located a stash in Europe (they were probably laying on some dusty shelf for
all I know) a couple of months ago and bought all I could, just enough for
this run.

Another hard-to-find item was the CORRECT grommet.  VW never offered these
separately at the time.  So with a VW list of grommets with closely listed
sizes I bought one of each to compare to the original.  Took awhile, but I
finally narrows down down to one that perfectly matched.  According to
ETKA's "Where Used" function I found they're used on Vanagon Syncros in
Europe - exactly for what I don't know, didn't care, just knew they were the
one to use.
