Subject: Re: [T2] Replacing Rubber Scrapers and Metal Trim on Front

This isn't a project I'm doing right now, but I read the article anyway,
since I've been intimate with bay doors, window regulators, etc. before. I
have to say this is a FANTASTIC writeup - clear, concise directions, with
plenty of pictures of every little detail...if every procedure were
documented this way, new tasks would be a breeze...I'm sure it will answer
many questions out there for folks...
