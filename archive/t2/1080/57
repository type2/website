Brad,
Being Colorado (Estes Park) Guy myself, I know of two places that might have
what looking for or tell you here to go:

Vee-W-Unlimited in Loveland #970-667-3682
Vrba's parts in Ft Collins #970-484-2011
 
They both have yards out back, Tell them Jed send you.
 
I have only got parts from these guy, never had them work on my VW. So, I will
say that all parts I have got work great! 
 
Jed
