"is also the same reason why you have little flaps inside the electric fan
to keep the cooling fan from forcing HOT air into the engine when the
electric fan is off.  If you don't have flaps in the electric fan housing,
then you are just feeding hot air back into the engine bay which is very
bad."


Flaps inside the electric fan... Really? Is this year specific, or on all
buses? How much would this possible affect head temps?
