Subject: Re: [T2] cleaning fuel line

Cleaning the gas line and can't seem to get rid of an obstruction? Could it be
that the gas line is separated inside and has formed a flap of sorts (very
common, BTW!) and it is the gas line itself that is the obstruction? Are you
able to blow back the other way? (Don't blow a bunch of pressure into the gas
tank!!) Another common one is something in the gas tank that seals the outlet
only when there's a draw but floats away when there is no draw. OR - the gas
line actually compresses and flattens out when there is a draw, due to bad gas
line or faulty tank venting.

What's the secret?
