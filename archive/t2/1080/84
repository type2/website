Hi Mike,

I have been doing my valves with that method for many years now. It 
works great. You don't need to remove the plugs if you use a wrench on 
the alternator to turn the engine over. Most often when I spin the 
engine to the notch on the crank I can tell from the valve tension 
whether the distributor is pointed at #1 or #3; but it certainly doesn't 
help to verify this; esp. if the exhaust valves are getting tighter.

Happy Trails,
