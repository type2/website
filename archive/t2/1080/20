Subject: Replacing Rubber Scrapers and Metal Trim on Front Doors

I'm going to replace the inside and outside rubber scrapers and metal trim on
the driver and passenger doors of my 71 bus.  I bought the outside
scraper-trim assembly and the inside scraper from Busdepot.  Do I need to
remove the rivet in the vent window in order to do the replacement?  Any tips
on things to pay attention to would be appreciated.  I have a copy of the
green Bentley but it doesn't cover this procedure and I didn't see anything in
the type2 library.
