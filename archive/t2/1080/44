Subject: Engine hoist used instead of c-clamp for welding

Having run out of "correct" tools I needed something to hold down the  
floor pan while plug welding it in.

Take 1 engine hoist, remove the chain and hook.

Extend the boom to an appropriate length.

Position the lift so that the tip of the boom touches the part of the  
panel you need to hold down.

Loop a ratchet strap over the boom and under both legs and attach the  
2 strap hooks to each other.  Take up the slack.

Raise the boom (using the built in jack) until one leg lifts off the  
floor - just an inch or so.

Stand on that leg. This should pull down on the boom, exerting  
pressure on the panel.  The "clamping force" should be greater than  
your weight and, hopefully, sufficient.

Weld.

Move the boom to the next location but don't bother with the jack or  
ratchet strap.  Of course you can adjust them if necessary but it may  
not be necessary.


Here are two other images.
