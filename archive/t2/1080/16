Subject: York to Sanden SD 508 air conditioning compressor mount advice

I'm in the process of replacing the York a/c compressor on my '75 FI bay
with a more efficient Sanden SD 508 compressor.
The compressor adaptor mount that I purchased from the Bus Depot is designed
to bolt to the original York compressor mount.

My question is has anyone mounted the compressor adaptor mount directly to
the fan housing and eliminated the heavy York compressor mount altogether.
It looks like all I would have to do is drill 2 holes in the adapter plate.

My other concern is that 4 rubber grommets were sandwiched between the
orginal York compressor mounting bracket and the fan housing. I was thinking
that they may not be necessary because the Sanden compressor and mount is a
lot lighter than the York compressor - but then I wouldn't want to have a
crack develop in the fan housing due to vibration.
