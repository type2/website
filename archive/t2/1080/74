Steve,

Sorry to be slow on the answer, but it's been wedding weekend here.

Yes, the original idler pulley.  The Sanden came to me with the wrong 
"head" on it to fit where I wanted it, so I had to order a new one and 
gasket from a rebuild place in Dallas.

The "gooves" in the clutch pulley were ?wrong? so I had to get it pulled 
off and a friend cleaned them up a little on his lathe.

It's all in the archives...probably with better detail than I remember it 
now.

I used "remote" fill fittings just next to the driver's side wheel well 
and the dryer went in the standard place on the framer rail closer to the 
driver.

Note: some A/C manufacturers mounted the dryer in the wheel well.

Cheers ,dave
