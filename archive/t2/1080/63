Hi Eric,

The whole Alt harness is toast. Do you have the boot and the rubber grommets
too? Also, Could you send a photo of the FI harnesses? That one is pretty
much toast too. When you say "rebuildable" just what is involved in that?
Instead of splicing, is it possible just to replace the power wires going to
the starter with longer ones? My old Alt harness has been spliced several
times including the ground wire!!
Is there a place to buy the boot in the back of the Alt? The PO must have
tried to replace it at one time and mashed it into unusability. (my word)

Thanks for all your help!!

Bob

$25 shipped, I can get it out priotiy mail today, see attached.paypal to 
airic1(-at-)comcast.net  you will need to splice the power wires to the starter 
on this harness, but the alt connector and voltage regulator connector are 
in good shape

I got a rebuildable fuel injection harness for $50, and a great one for 
$100.  Let me know which part of the harness is toasted, and I'll see what I

got to assist

Eric
