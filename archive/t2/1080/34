Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Replacing Rubber Scrapers and Metal Trim on Front

Hey - I'm the Chris Mills that wrote that short blurb. 

The rubber is holding up okay. The GM style plastic clips I modified are 
working well too. This is 7 years later. 

The aluminum trim is still there but never was as shiny as the stock OEM trim. 
Perhaps someone could polish it but the metal is pretty fragile - OEM or 
aftermarket. 

I would still reuse the OEM aluminum, new scrapers, and the modified GM style 
nylon clips. 

I think the rubber did shrink a little in length. Understand that these 
rubbers got NO maintenance. They were installed and the bus parked. Yeah - 
life got busy. It's garaged now. Overall the bus isn't much worse for the 
wear top to bottom though.
