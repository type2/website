Subject: 79 Westy in Southern Oregon

Anyone interested in my Wunderbrot?  This time, she's going for real.

Some dated pics can be seen at:

The good:

basically a well cared for stock unmolested bus.

The bad:

I parked her in the winter of '06 after diddling around with the valve 
train to the point where I couldn't start her.  I suspect the 1-2 head 
(had that replaced in '05, I think...  Confidence in that garage not 
high, and I picked it up from the shop and headed to Burning Man), was 
having some clatter that seemed a bit different from the hydraulics and 
didn't want to chance serious damage if there was a head prob.  I DO 
have a spreadsheet with what I did when somewhere...

She's suffered some cosmetically in the damp here in Oregon - the 
bumpers have surface rust, and some rust around the windshield has 
become more apparent.  I've run the dehumidifier in her regularly and 
kept her clean, so she's a bit musty, nothing a bit of housekeeping 
won't cure.

Look at the pics carefully and you can see that I dinged the passenger 
rear light, and the pass side has a scrape to the lower rear.  Doesn't 
affect the slider.

Anyway...  If you're interested drop me a line.  I'll update pics if I 
get any bites...

Title is clear, CA non-op.

Thanks,

Teri
