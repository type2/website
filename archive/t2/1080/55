Didn't we just cover this the other day?

New factory replacement cases, as well as new factory replacement motors, 
don't have case numbers.   All year, including the current mexican motors.

Use one that matches your carb.  If your carb is a 34-pict3/4/5 (less 
likely since you said it's a SP motor) you'll want one thing.  If it's a 
30pict3, or a 28pict, or a H30/31, you want something else. ;)

Using the google cache, because Jim's site seems down at the moment 
(jim?).  Original like would be http://www.oldvolkshome.com/ovhignbo.htm
