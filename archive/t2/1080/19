Tanks get swapped.  FI gets swapped for carbs.  You can't always go by 
year.  Any bay tank with a supply and return will work.  Having said 
that the bus got FI in '76 I believe.  Could be '75 perhaps.

Lastly try not to start a new email topic by replying to an existing 
message.  Even though you remove the subject and the body it still gets 
associated with the old email thread.
