Subject: alternator wiring

Good morning all,

 

A lot of the wiring on my engine was cooked in a small fire that started
while trying to "fire up" the engine. As I'm in the middle of a rebuild, I
find that the wiring harness to the alternator is not good. I know I can
build another one, but I don't know where I can find the un-insulated female
brass plugs. As everyone knows, this is also a problem when replacing old
broken terminal ends on any VW. Any suggestions?

 

Thanks in advance and have a great weekend!

 

Bob
