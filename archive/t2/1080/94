Subject: Worm clamps on A/C hoses

Dave,

Did you have any problems using worm clamps on your a/c hoses?

IIRC, worm clamps where used in an a/c aftermarket kit I installed on my
Ford Bronco back in 1968.

I would like to make my own a/c hose connections - but the cheapest crimping
tool I could find was around $200. I know I can have a shop make them for me
but I would like to do it myself.
