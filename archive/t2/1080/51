One note - the outer window scrapers are available in genuine and
aftermarket. The aftermarket one fits poorly.  We sell the genuine one, but
the aftermarket one is widely distributed by a major wholesaler and
therefore much more common at retail. If purchasing elsewhere, it is
probably safe to assume the scraper is aftermarket if not specified
otherwise.
