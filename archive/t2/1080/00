Are you needing to constantly adjust your valves?  If so, I wouldn't be 
surprised if these heads are on their way out :(

I think you said you've seen the thread on thesamba with all the info on 
adjusting your mixture?  If not, check this out:

The key thing is lean out your mixture.  I dropped mine to almost 18:1 
and the temperature runs around 360 while driving 70.  Granted, it 
doesn't run well, but it does run.  I still need to tweak with timing 
and see where that gets me.

However, I just got my EGR in the mail and I'm going to install that and 
see what effect it has.  My first goal is to get the bus as close to 
stock and see how that affects CHTs.  Then I'll move from there to start 
tweaking things around.

Like others have said, the late-bay exhaust (except 79) causing high 
temps and so does the stock cam.  I am seriously debating changing out 
my cam, but I still have to deal with smog...
