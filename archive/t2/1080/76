They are indeed one of the hardest things to ship, since they are very
fragile when not yet installed. Even glass is easier to ship. We learned
early on not to send them via UPS, who seemingly backs over them with a
truck several times for good measure. We now use specially sized boxes from
England that seem to do the trick most of the time, and send them via Mail.
That combination has not reduced the damage claims considerably.
