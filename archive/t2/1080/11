Subject: cleaning fuel line

Hi,

Is there a trick to cleaning out the fuel line from the gas tank to the 
carb in a beetle?  I've been working all afternoon with a wire and a 
compressor and still have something blocking it.  What's the secret?

Let's see, bus content.  My 12 year old and 15 year old sons and I had 
a great four day trip to the Washington coast in our '70 SO 69 camper 
with adventurewagen hightop.  Our newest sticker has a VW symbol and 
reads, "It is floored!".  I saw some smiles.
