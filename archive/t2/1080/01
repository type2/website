The engine will cool just fine - its the blower fan that won't work when 
you have the car off.  Remember, the main cooling fan provides the bulk 
air flow up front - the fan just helps out.  When the engine is running, 
the fan and then blower together push air through the heat exchangers. 
When you turn the air off, the blower will try and force hot air back 
into the cooling shroud instead of up-front where it should go.

This is also the same reason why you have little flaps inside the 
electric fan to keep the cooling fan from forcing HOT air into the 
engine when the electric fan is off.  If you don't have flaps in the 
electric fan housing, then you are just feeding hot air back into the 
engine bay which is very bad.  (Feeding hot air into the cooling fan 
shroud when the engine is off isn't that big of a deal).

I definitely would not block off those vents as that would cause 
back-pressure and turbulence and hinder your cooling fans effectiveness 
(because it's trying to move dirty air).  Either make some flaps out of 
some light-weight aluminum (what I did), block of the *inside* of the 
cooling fan shroud with a contoured plug, or just leave them open and 
don't use your cooling fan when the engine is off (which is pretty much 
useless anyways...
