Steve,

Wups...that's what I get for staying up waaay to late at the reception and 
coming to work waaaay too early.

No idler pulley on this particular setup.  It is adjusted by rotating the
compressor.  It is not the best method, but I  still owe a report to 
everyone on the other compressor mount method from a different 
manufacturer.

I tried 3 different belts before getting the correct one..also in the 
archives I think.

Cheers, dave
