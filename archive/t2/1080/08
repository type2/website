Subject: Voltage drop when starting engine?

I bought a new plug-in digital battery voltmeter that plugs nito your dash
lighter plug. I noticed when I hit the starter, it dropped to 9 volts while
cranking for a brief second or so that it took the engine to fire up, then
went immediately up to 14. 2 to 14.6 volts. Is it normal for the big voltage
drop when the starter is cranking?
Thanks,
Courtney
