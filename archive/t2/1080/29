Subject: engine lid removal

Gotta remove the engine lid on a '79...the bent rod seems to be welded
to the lid and the half hinge seems to be welded to the body...Right?

Am I gonna hafta grind or chisel either one of them to get the lid off ?

And will I hafta weld one of 'em back on with the replacement lid...?

Anybody replaced a lid with any tips... ?-(
