Is it even possible to remove the old without damaging the trim pieces?  My
bus has bad rubber and nice metal trim, and my parts bus has nice rubber &
crappy looking banged up metal trim.  I only ask since I am on a
non-existent budget moneywise....

Hey - I'm the Chris Mills that wrote that short blurb. 

The rubber is holding up okay. The GM style plastic clips I modified are 
working well too. This is 7 years later. 

The aluminum trim is still there but never was as shiny as the stock OEM
trim. 
Perhaps someone could polish it but the metal is pretty fragile - OEM or 
aftermarket. 

I would still reuse the OEM aluminum, new scrapers, and the modified GM
style 
nylon clips. 

I think the rubber did shrink a little in length. Understand that these 
rubbers got NO maintenance. They were installed and the bus parked. Yeah - 
life got busy. It's garaged now. Overall the bus isn't much worse for the 
wear top to bottom though.
