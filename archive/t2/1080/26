Subject: Re: Replacing Rubber Scrapers and Metal Trim on Front Doors

Hello,

 

I need to do this too.  Are you happy with the quality of the scrapers?  It
seems like all rubber seals are questionable these days.  I hate to spend
the money and them not work out.   Anyway there is a good write up on the
Samba about doing this.  The link is
