Bob & The List -

I suppose this is just as good a time as any to announce that my buddy Cliff
Crate and I have undertaken manufacturing the 55 Amp Alternator Harness for
the 72-79 Bus.  Complete with the correct 3 pole plugs (took me 5 months to
find these), correct engine tin grommets and correct color coded wiring and
making sure the wiring was all the correct gauge.  The harness is the
correct length - in fact I made it to work on both the Bus & the 411/412
Sedan/Wagens, which was why Cliff (a 411/412 nut) and I initiated the
project.

The original boot for the B+ terminal is no longer available, but with a
little bit of effort the Bug 12V Generator Post Boot (113 971 901/A) will
work in it's place.  It's just a tad smaller than the original boot.

Price is $48.75 +$9 Priority Mail in the US.  Canadian and overseas, ask for
exact shipping total.  For Calif customers add 9.25% Sales tax on $48.75
(yeah, I know, but California's broke and I was audited last year)

This harness will work on 70amp models, except only 1 grommet for the tin is
needed and the 3 pole plug for the alternator is not weather sealed in
rubber like the original.  That harness is $46.25 + $9 Priority Mail in the
US.  Again, Calif customers add 9.25% Sales tax.

I take Paypal ( jim96003(-at-)earthlink.net )

Please feel free to ask any questions if you want to pay by mail (money
orders only please).
