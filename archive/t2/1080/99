I would suspect a plugged breather.  My FI engine would quit if I took the
breather off while the engine was idling.  Try taking the hose from the
breather to the "S" boot off at the boot while it's idling and see what
happens.  The engine should quit.  If the breather is plugged, the pressure
will escape somewhere, usually taking a seal and a bunch of oil with it.
There's not really anything to go wrong with the breather, besides the
plastic cracking, but I could see how it could get plugged.  It's easy to
clean if you take it apart.
