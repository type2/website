I'm in Fort Collins, but I know there's a bus graveyard out on the 34 bypass, I
believe after you get out past 59th, but it's been a while since I've been out
there.  In Fort Collins, I usually just head down to Lincoln and Link Ln and
find plenty of knowledgable people.  Next to A&B Import Auto (a great mechanic,
by the way) there is a shop with a few buses and beetles out front, but I
haven't stopped by there just yet.  They might be helpful too.

Cheers,
Paul
