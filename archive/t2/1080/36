Guess that would be five years later.

Sure you can remove it in one piece and get the trim to survive. Been a long 
time but I rescued my original trim and installed the after-market stuff. Still 
have the OEM trim around - somewhere. Planning to repaint the bus and perhaps 
will make some scrapers from some stiff rubber. Not knocking the parts I got 
from one of the bus suppliers - can't remember which though. 

Side window rubber is cracking (rear side windows). Jalouise rubber is fine. 
Door rubber parts are fine but the vent window rubber and scrapers show a 
little big of shrinkage. 

Imagine what could happen with some TLC along the way!!! VBG!
