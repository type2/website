I'm referring to the blower fan that sits just above the 
engine and blows air down through the ducts into the heat 
exchangers - maybe 72-79?  This is what it looks like:

On each duct there should be a little flap that opens when 
the fan is blowing and closes to stop any reverse flow 
(propelled by the cooling fan).  If you don't have those 
flaps, you're essentially allowing hot air to flow up into 
your engine bay.  Judging by how much effort VW put in to 
keep hot air out, I'd say it could definitely have an 
effect on your temps...
