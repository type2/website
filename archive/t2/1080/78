Subject: valve adjustment

i am looking for a write up on valve adjustments on a type 2 engine.
karl's in the archive is good, but i don't have a remote starter and i
am working by myself.  my wife is just not as interested in the bus as
i am.  the rotor lines up with the slot in the distributor when the
timing mark lines up with zero, so, i assume everything is properly in
place.  i'm running a single vacuum distributor and have the timing
gauge in place.  any help would be appreciated and flames accepted.


thanks,

jeremiah
