Subject: No engine code?

Hello all,

I found a Type 1 engine with no engine code - is this possible?  I thought at
first someone had JB Welded the code and number - but after scratching and
brushing it I don't think so.

I'm reasonably familiar with the 1600 in my '71 Westy - and other than this
engine being a single port it looks the same.  It has a 009 distributor on it
that I want to get rid of and am trying to figure out which distributor to
use.

Any help is appreciated greatly, thanks.

Blake
