Maybe I missed the important part of this string, but 
what year is this Bus?  If it is a later model with hydraulic
lifters, then the procedure will be a little different.  Adjusting
a hydraulic bus should ONLY be necessary when the engine is 
assembled or repairs such as pushrod tube seals are necessary.
I still would suggest that each cylinder be adjusted at 
TDC, one at a time, rather than the catch-all two spin method.
With the critical adjustments necessary to keep these vehicles
running properly, taking short cuts are probably a quick 
way to finish them off.  Turn the engine by hand (pull the plugs
if necessary) and just line the rotor up with #1 (mark on
distributor edge) then turn the engine 1/4 turn to adjust each
cylinder in time.  This means all cylinders are adjusted in ONE turn
of the crank (distributor turns at 1/2 the speed of the engine).

We can choose to pick them up or expect that someone else will.
I choose the first.
