Givin the tendency of our engines to overheat and drop seats, have 
stretched valves, etc, I'd recommend doing it more often than none. 
While harder to detect with hydraulic valves, it's better to get in 
there at least every 20k miles (I think that's the recommended interval) 
  to make sure they're all in check and make sure they're not falling 
out of spec.

More turns, more chance to make a mistake.  Also, if you adjust your 
valves in the order of 1-2-3-4 (which keeps things easy to remember), 
you need to make sure you spin the crank COUNTER-clockwise.  Spin it the 
other direction and you'll be really messed up.  If you spin it 
clockwise, you'll need to adjust them 1-4-3-2.. Either way will work, 
one just takes more thought and has more opportunity for error.

That is incorrect - the crank needs to be rotated 180 degrees for every 
90 degrees of distributor rotation.  The crank turns 720 degrees for a 
complete engine cycle, and therefore all cylinders/valves are adjusted 
in TWO complete rotations of the crank.
