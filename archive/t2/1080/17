Subject: engine sounds

So the last couple times I've started my bus (1977 kombi w/original engine)
I've heard some clatter/rattling that seems to be coming out the cooling fan.
If I let it idle it goes away after the CHT gauge gets to around 150 or so. It
wasn't that long ago that I adjusted the valves. Like I said it goes away in a
minute or two but its scaring the crap out of me and I was just about to take
it out for a camping trip. Anyone have any words of advice?
