Subject: Different FIRE hazard

I'm posting this to both lists, since it's a universal problem. I've been
helping a friend get a 77 bus back on the road. As with many air-cooleds,
it has some profuse oil leaks in it. Well, after a brief shakedown drive
around the block, I pulled back into my driveway, got out, and noticed
more smoke than usual coming from under the passenger side of the engine.
A quick look revealed orange flames on top of the heater box, and growing
larger. Fortunately, I had a garden hose right beside the driveway, and
was able to spray the flames out, and cool down the exhaust. After an
inspection, the only thing I can find wrong is a LOT of oil all over the
exhaust system and everything else. I'm figuring that the hot exhaust
caused that to ignite. Had I been out on the road, or anywhere else where
I hadn't noticed so soon, that could have been disastrous.
I just thought I'd pass that along as a warning.
