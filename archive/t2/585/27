Subject: 82 Westy compression results, need help...

Listees,

I got around to doing a compression test yesterday on my 82 Westy. #3 is at 
90 and the rest are between 128 and 130. Ack!!! However I didn't adjust the 
valves before hand (I have the self adjusting valves hydro lifter thingys).

Would adjusting the valves make a difference? Could that be the cause of the 
low compression in #3?

Is there an article out there for adjusting the valves on the Type 4 engine 
especially with lifters? I still don't have a Bentley, the cheapest Bentley 
I can find costs 70.00. I'm only familiar with Type 1 engine valve 
adjustment.

Also assuming the worst that this cylinder is getting ready to drop a valve 
and I need the heads rebuilt....how can I test the bottom end of the engine? 
I'm wondering if I could just get away with rings, a valve job/rebuilt 
heads, seals and such and leave the bottom end alone. I don't have the cash 
to do a full engine rebuild.

Thanks in advance,

Daniel
