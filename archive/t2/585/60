found its part# on ATE web catalog.  It is "ATE Brake Cylinder Paste"
180 gram tube   03.9902-0501.2.    Maybe a local [USA] Mercedes
dealership can order that.   . . .don't know.  The original thread pertained
more to general [non-brake] rubber seal lubrication for those "no grease
means *no* grease" applications.  I just happen to be on a quest for
brake cylinder paste.  [and ATE seal # 3.3302-0032.1 among others]
