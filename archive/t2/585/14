Subject: parting out 69 Westfalia

I have a 69 Westfalia without engine or trans. The body is pretty well shot, but it still has a few good pieces. The interior is still mostly intact. The dash and instruments are all there and in good shape. If anyone in the western NC area needs something, I'll be as fair as I can be. I'm still going to pull a few parts for my 71, but not much. I'm just trying to recoup my investment in this parts bus. It is a rolling shell and has a title if you want to buy the whole thing. E-mail me if you are interested.
