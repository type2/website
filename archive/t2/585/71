My local membership warehouse stores (costco, sam's) have queen and king
'mattress toppers' made of the 'thermal tempur-pedic foam' for sale cheap,
way cheaper than anything else I have found, and I live in a major
metropolitan area. This foam is very comfortable, but is slow to recover
(holds butt dents longer). The available two inch thicknesses can be built
up with spray adhesives, and cuts are best made with an electric carving
knife (garage sale item).

When I restored my '72 Westy, I bought a new piece of foam at a local yard
goods store. I ended up turning over the old foam and using it, as the new
foam was inferior to my twenty-something year-old foam. If  you plan on
sleeping on it, get the densest foam you can find. Natural latex is best,
but expensive.

Look up 'futon' and 'foam rubber' in your yeller pages for local retailers.
Let me know if you need more info.
