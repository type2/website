Subject: metal fuel line

"I noticed my engine does not have a metal tube that passes through the 
front engine tin.  The fuel line just passes through the tin.  

What solutions are available to build/aquire the tube that goes throught 
the tine.

Thanks
Steve"

Steve; 

I don't know what year/model of bus you have, but AFAIK, they don't ALL
have metal line that passes through the tin. My 71 had metal line through
the rear tin, and even if you have metal line, you still MUST have a
rubber grommet in the tin to prevent scoring and eventual breakage of the
metal line from the sharp tin edge. 

My current 74 has no metal line on it whatsoever, and the grommet in the
rear engine tin is the perfect size for the regular 5.5mm fuel hose.
Ensure that all the fuel line passes through grommets. as most of those
grommets are still available. This applies to both metal line and , of
course, regular fuel hose.
