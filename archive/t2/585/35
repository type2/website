Subject: mattress

I am trying to figure out a way to make a custom size mattress for a non VW
vehicle and thought that the list might be able to give me some ideas on what
to use. I am trying to find out what materials I can use to make a mattress.
If someone was replacing the cushions in the bus and wanted to make them more
comfortable for sleeping, what would they use? This is going to be a custom
size and shape, so it will need to be something that I can cut and shape.
Anyone have any ideas? What are the stock cushions in a bus made from? Some
kind of foam, but what thickness would be comfortable?

Thanks,
Corbett
