Bob said: -

adjusting a type 4 fan belt is described in the Bentley but the condensed
version is

. remove the small cover above the alternator pulley. inside is a hex bolt,
. use a hex wrench to loosen the bolt.
. push alternator to the right and down
. adjust so pushing on fan belt would cause a slight give (maybe 1/2 inch)
. tighten hex bolt


I say: -

How many of you drivers KNOW where your extra fan belt is??  OK, now HOW 
MANY that responded 'ME!!'  know where your HEX WRENCH is ?!?!?!?!  (Good 
lord, you mean that you don't even know WHAT SIZE hex wrench fits!!!)

BTW, 'in my garage' is NOT an acceptable answer..
