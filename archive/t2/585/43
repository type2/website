so far one of em has never caught me in a #(-at-)*($& for a buck I'd sell the
*(-at-)#&%)L thing mood

as for the ones that ask if it's for sale I tell em, "everythings for
sale, start putting $100 bills in my hand and I'll tell you when to stop"

yeah mine as a daily driver and I love coming out to the parking lot and
have someone tell me "I used to have one"  sometimes I reply "I still do"
sometimes I think, sucker! for selling it... or some other less than kind
thing, but not out loud to them...
