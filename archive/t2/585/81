adjusting a type 4 fan belt is described in the Bentley but the condensed
version is

. remove the small cover above the alternator pully. inside is a hex bolt,
. use a hex wrench to loosen the bolt.
. push alternator to the right and down
. adjust so pushing on fan belt would cause a slight give (maybe 1/2 inch)
. tighten hex bolt
