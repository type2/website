When I removed/repaired/reinstalled the heads on my 914 last fall the
decision was made for me when I broke a ring.  Personallly, I'm happy this
happened because the Deves rings (thanks www.aircooled.net !) that I
installed have made a noticeable difference in power for this motor with 40k
miles on the rebuild.
