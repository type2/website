Subject: junkyard closure in W WA

went to a junkyard to get some stuff, and the guy says it's all being crushed 
at the end of the month.  There must be 100 cars out there, 98% ACVWs, loads 
of bugs, bays, only half dozen splits.  jungly.   lots of nettles.  shorts not 
a good idea.  Not for the wimpy. lots of nettles.  South Sound area.  yes 
mostly picked over but still stuff left. Lots of bay window stuff. and nettles.  
I took a machete with me.  to clear stuff away.  Don't wear jeans with holes 
in the knees.  Me knees are all itchy tingly.
He has a red 64 SC for sale $400.  Real nice guy, I bought my 65 westy from 
him some years ago.
