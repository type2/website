Subject: RE: [T2] Can't get it off!

The only way that I have been able to get it off was to use the solvent that
POR 15 sells. The stuff they sell is pretty good at removing it. I am not sure
what it is though. Other than that, nothing I have at the house can remove it.
Maybe someone in the pain industry can tell you more.
