there is no such thing as the perfect bus,...except the one you have
worked on for years, like the one you have.  I think everyone here could
match you sob story, it isn't perfect like a woman they have their good

men)

you won't live that long,  LOL


your choice you call your life
but wait at least a week, month might be better see if you still feel that
