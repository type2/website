i went on a driving quest for brake cylinder paste today.  after my
research yesterday.  i stopped by the local and very good volvo shop
swedish engineering and talked with their tech about the situation and it
was the likely story.  we used to have the stuff but when haven't serviced
any hydraulic components in years we just get rebuilds.  they were very
friendly none the less and pointed me in a couple of useful directions.
the short of the story is that i ended up and the local european parts
place and after telling the guy behind the counter what i wanted i watched
him comb through the catalogs for about 10 minutes.  first we tired the
ate catalog and he says its not in there, then we tried the crc catalog,
no go there either.

so while he is fishing in the catalogs i start looking on the shelf when i
spy the lube that was in the pelican parts write up, sil-glide.  i read
the label and i didn't see silicone in the list of ingredients and the
tube stated that it was for the back of brake pads and for where pads fit
on the carriers.  its manufactured by a company called ags out of michigan
now.  so after that i told the guy behind the counter that i knew that 3M
made the stuff so thats where we looked next.  we found it in the catalog
and i ordered it.  the cost was around $19 for a can including taxes.  it
was kind of funny it was listed in the brake section of the catalog but
the catalog entry said nothing about its use for brakes :).  basically
they are touting it as di-electric grease.

if any one has a vanagon brake master cylinder kit laying around i'll
trade you half a can of brake paste for it :).
