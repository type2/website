Subject: RE: [T2] mattress

It will be in an RV. The mattress will not be folded, but it will have to be a
custom size and a good fit. I am not sure that futon will work for this
situation . I am either going to have one really big one or three smaller
ones. The smallest being a filler between to twin beds. It would be about 24
inches wide. I am thinking some kind of solid lightweight foam used for
houses. They make it in 2 inch size. Then cover this with some form of soft
foam as the actual mattress covering.

What kind of vehicle?  And are you looking to have it work in conjunction
with a fold-down bench seat or something similar?  Futon mattresses may work
well in that they tend to be light, comfortable, pliable  and not overly
thick...
