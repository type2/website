Subject: bus happiness

Im still new to the whole phenomenon really.

Got my first bus late last summer.. made a bad choice rust wise
and blew my money. Bought a rust free bus this summer but ran into
some motor issues lol.

But all in all it's made me a happy person.
Who would have thought I could rip out a motor and strip it down.
Dressing up the bus has been soo cool too. Check out the new webpage
I did. www.groovysigns.com
The girlfriend loves the bus..

Just a little happiness I want to share.
And the summer seems to be zipping by.
