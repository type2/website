Our Corvair club does the same thing about once a month each warm month. 

The newbies learn something, the veterans get to show off, alot of cooperation, and at the end of the day friendships are strengthened, and everybody is a bit smarter. 

Sometimes the veterans sit back and talk me through a task, sometimes they hold the other wrench, and sometimes they tell me to watch carefully while they do it.
