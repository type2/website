Subject: RE: [T2] squeeky fan belt 

Theirs a loosening bolt at about 1 to 3 0'clock on the alternator. Just
on the outside of the belt. It's the only one their, can't go wrong.
Loosen up that bolt, and shove something like a wrench in the slot
(you'll see it) and pry the alternator down. Theirs a pivot in the
bottom of it. Their should be less than half of an inch movement when
you press down on the middle of the belt (between the alternator and the
fan). Make sure theirs SOME give, or it's too tight. I personaly shoot
for about 1/4 inch give and have never had trouble. 

Cheers
Chris
