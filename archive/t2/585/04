dont sell the bus!!!! trust me you will regret it!! i
know exactly how you feel as far as the bus goes, i
felt the same way with rita, my 67, but the day i
finnally got her to run i was VERY glad i didnt sell
her like i was planning. now i have a beutiful (in my
eyes), running, 67 "hippie" bus. i have learned so
much since i first got her in october of last year,
and now if something messes up, i can try to fix it.
having a bus is like having a child, its hard to
maintain, and keep up with, but when it gets fixed and
made well, it'll make you the happiest person alive
because you realize that YOU got it fixed and well,
YOU did the work, and now YOU get to enjoy it. if
money and time really is the problem, just work on it
when you can, but dont take away from the families
time and stuff. just work on it whenever you get more
time and money, and eventually you will be cruising
down the road in something you built and fixed. just
my 2 cents.
