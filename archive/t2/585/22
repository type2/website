""Ok. I'm done now."""

LOL! how many times has that thought flitted across
my mind!

---keep at it.. you wont regret it. The time I spent
on
my bus with my son running around when he was little
may have seemed like time away.. but now as we work on
his 83 rabbit conversion to 92 Passat 16v 2L... he
tells me he used to wonder how he would learn "all
that stuff" Now he can drop a bunny tranny and
reinstall it in under 2 hours. The friends he has made
in the watercooled tribe are great "kids" who are
always trying to talk me into "slamming" my bus...
hhhmmm maybe a splitty!

long story short... in hindsight... it's all good!

Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me;
Other times I can barely see.
Lately it occurs to me What a long, strange trip it's been.
