Subject: ac compressor (sanyo?)

hey volks:

getting ready to throw in the re-built engine into the 72.

It has, what I have been told, is "factory" AC.   The main blower unit is 
not under the dash or in the roof, it is located behind the drivers seat.  
The ducts kinda stick up out of the jump seat in the camper, and the "guts" 
of the system are under the jump seat in the camper.

The compressor is in need of replacement.  It sits upright on the left side 
of the engine.

Someone at a campout mentioned I needed to replace it with the "sanyo 
scroll" compressor. they said it would cost more, but is more efficent, 
draws less power, lasts longer, ect.

Does anyone have a part number for this Sanyo compressor?  vendor that 
sells?    anything I  should know so I dont order a compressor that is not 
compatible with my system.

thanks for any advise,
buddah
