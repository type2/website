Subject: 1978 Westy

There is a person getting rid of a 1978 westy here in Austin Texas.  I called him, he said used to be a member of the list and got this bus through the list, bust hasn't been on in a while.  So  I'm posting on his behalf.  I know nothing about this person other than the breif phone call  I had with him.  He said the engine was in the back seat, it does have fuel injection and the rest of the parts are in a bag, and he wants the thing out of his yard.  No parting.  
 
I don't need another bus in my yard, so I'm passing it along.  He said you could email him at:
 
jackson(-at-)grandecom.net
 
I hope it works out for someone.
