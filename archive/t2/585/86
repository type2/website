Subject: RE: [T2] Can't get it off!

I have just decided to live with it. Thinking of changing my wardrobe so my 
t shirts match the silver. Maybe I could just paint myself all over with 
this stuff. Get out the turle wax a few nice buffs and go out wearing 
nothing but a smile =0! Talk about polished drefinment.
