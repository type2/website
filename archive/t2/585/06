Subject: RE: [T2] Mild Backfires. 

On decleration=mild to moderate exhaust leaks, and the conditions of
gasketlessness you describe indicate that.
You also run the risk of burning exhuast valves.

I rev the engine and on the way back down in RPM's it kinda
sputter/backfires. Also kinda does it on too fast of revving. I don't
have tabs on it yet, so I don't dare drive it around here. But what I
found in the archives implies it's either too lean at the carb(s) <<but
I have fuel injection>>or an exhaust leak. Witch I can buy since, A: The
muffler is missing the output tip, and B: I didn't use the copper
seals/gaskets when I put on the muffler, and C: It's MY car!
 
Could someone tell me if this actually IS probably the reason, or if
it's more likely to be Vacuum Hoses (witch I can also buy as being the
culprit) or some other thing. But more importantly, can someone tell me
the mechanics of how a exhaust leak would cause backfires? I would think
that the faster the gassess can excape the happier the whole thing would
be. I'm obviously wrong, but why?
