That would be what I am looking for. I was hoping that someone would have some
experience with this type of mattress. Did you cover the firm foam with
anything a little softer, like a egg crate foam or anything like that?

Corbett,

Did this on a 67 split years ago.  Had a roomate at the time that promised
to sew covers for whatever I needed.  I bought 5" or 6" foam at an
upholstery store.  Thicker is better, but it needs to be *firm*.

Basically I covered the floor and part of the split between the seats with
three separate squares(rectangles) to make up the bed.  Contoured pieces
are horrible to try and make covers for.

I never slept better in my life!!...of course I always sleep better at the
beach<grin>.

Cheers, dave
