Subject: Swap T1 94s for 90.5s?

Greetings List -

I bought a set of "short-stroke" 94mm P&Cs from aircooled.net a while ago, 
hoping to put them in my 94mm case. These:

(cut/paste as necessary) They are Mahles - not Cimas, brand new in box.

Turns out my case was cracked and ready for the bon fire. I have a 
1776-ready case, though. So I'm looking for anyone in/near Los Angeles that 
has 90'5s to swap.

Thanks -

Mike
