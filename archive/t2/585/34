Subject: AC kit for a Bus

If anyone is interested, this company makes a complete A/C kit for a bus. I
emailed them about them last year. They were supposed to be done last August,
but I have not contacted them lately. This is supposed to a complete kit from
compressor to blower for buses that never even had a/c. I think the price I
was quoted last year was $1350 for the entire kit. The website still does not
show a kit for a bay window bus, but they say that they have them.
