Subject: RE: [T2] Can't get it off!

Yeah maybe I will try for an 80,000 RPM DA Sander with 40grit. These can be 
found at the locall mechanics day spa. They keep the case sealent in the 
waxing room, anybody care for a Brazilian?

This is the silver stuff so it kind of has a nice sheen to it. I am starting 
to like it.
