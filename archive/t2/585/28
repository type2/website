it could. also did you try and put some oil in #3 to see if the
compression improved. (was this with a hot engine)

that will be a big question mark. If you end up pulling the motor, an
endplay measurement will give you a good indicator of the condition of
the bottom end. Only teardown and measure will actually give you a
definate answer. do you have any data on how many miles are on the
engine, this can help decide as well.
