Subject: RE: [T2] Auto Paint at G.I.Joes. How bad is it? 

>>>>I suggest to you to lead your efforts in the preparation, ask around
how to, talk with friends and go to shops and see then working.  I am
sure if you do that way you gonna let your first paint job more that a
year, well if you finally like the color scheme.<<<

I know all about prep work. I've spent the last six months restoring
(dude asked if I wanted to help, and I ended up doing 98% of the work) a
Ford (anybody know the BAD meaning of Ford? NOT First On Race Day!!)
F250 pickup. It turned out SWEET. I'm gonna do a killer job on my bus,
but I got like 10 themes I wanna try out, and I gotta learn how to
airbrush really good too, so I'm gonna be doing more and more intricate
airbrushing on each paint job. I don't mind hard long work, it's just
shelling out money I don't like. :) 

So the super cheap paint worked out good for  you? Whoots! This is gonna
be fun. :)
