Subject: RE: [T2] Sugar in gas tank

Couldn't you just remove the hose at the bottom of the tank and drain it from
there? If you removed the entire assembly at the bottom of the tank, you
should be pretty close to level with the bottom of the tank. You have to
remove the assembly because it is designed to not pick up off the bottom of
the tank, but picks up about an inch higher.

If you did this several times and sloshed the sugar/gas solution around a lot,
I would think that you could get it all out.
