Maybe that's the right decision for you after all, Don.

It has seemed to me, from time to time, that you might be 
temperamentally unsuited to the care and feeding of a bus. So much of 
what you've done has been motivated by a need for lightning-fast 
resolution -- by an insistence that problems be resolved 
right-freaking-now, or by noon tomorrow at the latest. Bus ownership 
requires a more deliberative demeanor.

I hope that doesn't sound insulting; it's meant only to speak the truth.

If, over the next few hours or days, you decide to hang on to your bus 
-- and if you make the decision as impetuously as you have decided to 
dump it -- I hope that you also come to terms with your zest for haste.

And if you cannot come to terms, then by all means sell the project to 
someone whose heart ticks over at bus speed.
