Driving to Savannah in a 75 bus, a big rig slowly passed us- and I
noticed the large inner rear wheel next to us had its tread bobbling up
and down at least 5 inches!  We tried to pass it and warn him but he
took off fast than I'd want to go on a 70 mph speed limit road.  Keep in
mind George's physics lesson- the radial speed of a wheel is a lot
faster than the vehicle mph and a tread flying off can do serious
damage.  I saw what it did to the wheel well of someones's Westy a few
years ago- don't drive old tires!
