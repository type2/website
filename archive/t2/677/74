Subject: Train car with 2 Buses

Regarding the post I left about the freight car with
the two Buses:

 Man-o-man there was a lot of interest in the Single
Cab and the VW Freight Car.

Here is a link to the company site regarding the car
with the VW's and it shows all of the specs. If you go
to the home page and do a search by description using
just 'VW' you should come up with five or six VW
related Rail Cars.

Regarding the Single Cab Rail Maintenance Car, I will
try to get into town this weekend to get a couple of
pics and more info. The Single Cab fits the same track
as the VW Frieght Car.
I would go today, but, I am soo snowed in with another
serious storm (three feet of snow and counting at my
house which is about ten miles north of Reno). I went
to work today (I am a School Bus driver) and was sent
home again today. All Schools in the county are closed
for the third time this week due to HEAVY snow fall.
On my way home going down the road to my house in my
67 Sundial Camper,while using industrial strength tire
chains with welded lugs on every cross link I got
stuck again! I've been pulled out three times this
week. Gotta love our 4X4. I have had to keep my chains
on for a week now. But, I still drive my 67Bus every
day to work!
