I use an inch pound 3/8 drive pointer torque wrench.  Just convert the
ft lbs to inch pounds.  As to the 9 ft pound sump plate nut- I use my
hand all the way down the handle on my flex handle.  Go out only 1/3 the
foot distance on your ratchet, and it is 4"- or 27 lbs of hand
pressure.  Try to see how much ummmph this is with your hand down there
on your click wrench.

 The other is overtorquing that 9 ft/lb nut in the sump plate. There's
no way that I can read 9 ft/lb accurately enough with a pointer style
torque wrench. Maybe it's my eyesight.
