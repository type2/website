Subject: Bench Testing

Hello Boys and Girls,
I have a question that I probably could research in the archives, but hey,
it;s a whole lot more fun to read and hear from each of you.  To the
purists..I apologize in advance for being too lazy too look it up.
 Whew I feel better getting that off my chest.

Here's the question.  I need to bench test a 1600DP.  I have a 78 tranny and
an unknown early split tranny.  As long as the flywheel fits, no problem,
correct??

I have a starter, I have maybe a 200 mm(?) flywheel, the clutch mechanism is
out of a 71.

Will someone assist me in the connections?

Is it basic,connect to allowable tranny, battery, and a hot and negative cable
to starter?

Thank you for your help.
