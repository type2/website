Very cool - I assume this is large scale?  I got ya beat -- found this  
N-scale car on eb*y a while back:

Type 2s on top, Type 1s on bottom - and yes, it came that way.  It's  
euro-style rolling stock & so doesn't completely match my Florida-based  
layout (http://www.supernet.net/~jclark/trains/index.html) but sometimes  
ya gotta make sacrifices. :-)
