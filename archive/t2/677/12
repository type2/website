George,

Probably.  I bought my '82 Subaru at 181K, just after the PO had blown a head
gasket by overheating it (broken fan switch).  That's the only major engine
repair it's ever had.  This original engine now has more than 270K miles,
still runs just about perfectly as long as it gets high-octane non-ARCO gas,
always passes emissions with flying colors, and it doesn't leak a drop of
anything.  Seems to me that it's a world apart from the average wasserboxer,
or really any VW engine of a similar vintage.

On the other hand, I did buy a VW engine for my '71 Bus, even after someone
offered to put a Subaru in it.  Despite all the TLC it needs, I kind of like
the aircooled VW engine.

I don't think I would like a wasserboxer.
