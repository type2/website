Hello,

 

New to the list with my newly acquired '73 Westy. One of the cheapest

accurate "standards" for checking the accuracy of a 0-1.00" Micrometer is a

Hardened Dowel Pin. A Dowel Pin is held to within about .0005" in Diameter

(Note: lengths are not tightly held) and should be available at most

hardware stores. Using a combination of Dowel Pins and Feeler Gauges allows

you to verify the accuracy of a micrometer over it's full measurement range.
