Frank, you need to make sure that the starter is
compatible with the bell housing on the later tranny.
An early starter will NOT work with that later tranny,
I tried it once, and the starter armature was not long
enough to engage the flywheel.
But connections are:  One jumper wire from positive
battery term to big post on starter, clip another
jumper wire from the positive battery term and connect
it to the positive term on the coil, run a jumper
cable from negative battery term and clip it on the
trans to ground the tranny. Then attach a small wire
to the small push-on term on the starter (the one that
the wire from the ignition switch would normally go)
Now,m touch the other end of this wire to the positive
battery term to engage the starter and the engine
should start to crank over, when it fires, take the
wire off the battery term to disengage the starter.
Later, JB
