I've done two N-Scale buses in tinted clear resin.  I was making earrings,
of all things.  I did the two you see on the top of the train car in Joe's
picture, a split cab and a two-side door (what are those things called?)
bus.  You can see a sample at http://www.cfnson.com/graphics/danglies.jpg .

I'm afraid that the pic really isn't good.  I need to replace my 35mm
Olympus Stylus with a digital camera.  I'd planned on doing them in matched
sets in different colors.  Then I got worried about the VWoA thing.  Turned
out pretty cool though.

There are a couple of resins out there that allow you to shrink or enlarge
castings.  It might be possible to shrink them down to Z-scale size.  Anyone
know how many times smaller than N-scale that is?

I need to get my casting business out of the hole first, though.  That's why
the water thing in my sig.  Trying to get some $ flowing in.
