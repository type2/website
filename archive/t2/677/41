Check out the WetWesties. http://wetwesties.type2.com/ I've been a member 
for about two years and it's a great group if you enjoy camping in your bus, 
rain or shine. I also belong to Good Ole Volks west. It's a sub chapter of 
an east coast club. We usually get together every Monday to chat and hang 
out. Neither of these have any kind of dues or set regulations. More of a 
social kind of thing. http://autos.groups.yahoo.com/group/GoodOleVolksWest/

Who is your mechanic? I have a good guy if you need one.
