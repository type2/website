Chad,

As I read your post I see two possible areas of concern, one inexpensive
and one expensive.

The inexpensive potential problem is that the arch of the bowden tube may
be incorrect.  There is a specification in Bentley for how much it should
arch and incorrect arch, too much or too little, can cause very odd clutch
"feel" problems.  Adjustment of the arch is accomplished via the insertion
of washers where the tube goes thru the stand on the transmission.  If you
have no arch and no washers try VW as they may yet stock them.  Otherwise
you need to look around for correct ID washers or go to a junkyard.

The expensive problem is that you do not mention replacing the pressure
plate.  If the springs have weakend then you can get clutch slippage even
with a slack cable.  Put the bus in 1st gear (engine off), remove the
adjustment wingnut (or loosen it until the cable is sensibly slack), and
start the bus in gear.  Try revving the engine to get the clutch to slip.
If it will, then suspect the pressure plate.

Lastly, when you replaced the clutch, you did check the flywheel surface?
It was flat?

OOK!
