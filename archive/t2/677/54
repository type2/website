Subject: Duhem-Quine and engine building

A little philosophy of science this morning, since it's Friday and I'm 
not feeling funny.

Around the time of the First World War, a French physicist named Pierre 
Duhem started pontificating on the nature of science, and devised a 
thesis which said that when a scientist does an experiment and gets a 
surprising result -- the kind of result that seems like an important 
discovery -- he can never know for sure whether he has made a 
breakthrough, or he's just done the experiment wrong. About fifty years 
later, a philosopher at Harvard named Quine took up Duhem's thesis and 
tweaked it a bit (because Anglo-American philosophers are not much more 
thrilled about French anything than is the American mainstream).

Anyway, the result is the Duhem-Quine thesis, and it pertains to 
rebuilding bus engines. An example: you put together an engine and it 
only lasts a few thousand miles. Why? Is it because of substandard 
parts? Or is it because you did something wrong?

Sometimes the answer is obvious. Sometimes it's not.

Anyway, Duhem-Quine is the reason that I've been so keen on getting a 
measuring standard for my caliper. It's partly to check the accuracy of 
my caliper, but at the same time it's to see if I have the slightest 
idea how to use and read a caliper.

And, in the end, it's always possible that I got a bad standard. Not 
very likely, but possible. Duhem-Quine always applies.

The point of it all is to get to where you're worrying about the 
difference between a 120,000 mile engine and a 140,000 mile engine 
instead of the difference between a 20,000 mile engine and a 140,000 
mile engine.

Or, to put it another way, we all want to be better than GEX, don't we?
