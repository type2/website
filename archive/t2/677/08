My '65 Econoline gives me some good white knucklers in high wind but 
its definitely less than my '73 Safare Top. I did suspension, tires, 
swaybars etc in the '73 and the squatter Econoline with mushie 
everything is still a bit better in heavy wind. I put it down to it 
being lower to the ground and less height (SAIL) to catch the wind.
