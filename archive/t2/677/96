How long do you have off from work? BBB IX
(http://www.busesbythebridge.com)  is the following weekend and
only about 12 hours (bus time) in the direction opposite to which you have
to go home (SouthEast of ABQ).

If you can hang out for a week you should hook up with the Albuquerque Air
Alliance (http://www.aaavwclub.com/) and travel with them to Havasu. I
think they're leaving ABQ early Thursday and crashing for the night in
Flagstaff then contimuing on to Havasu Friday shooting for a "near noon"
arrival.
