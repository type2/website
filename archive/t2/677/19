Subject: Re: [T2] Wind Sheer

I have the C load Vredenstein snow tires all the way around, and I've had
nary an issue with the wind. The Goethels bridge and the Verrazzano gave me
some scares, but the best advice I have regarding the wind is to slow down.

P.S. Thanks to Seann Stafford, whose 'Friedrich' has inspired the new name
for my Westy -- 'Karla'!
