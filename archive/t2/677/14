Chad,

What about the pressure plate. Did you replace it? As a kit? I sounds to me 
like the clutch disc is bad or the pressure plate is flat i.e. no more 
spring. The disc could be bad from oil (rear main leak)but you said it's 
new.. oh another thing the bracket that holds the boden tube on the trans 
these always wear and brake. Check that out. Also the clutch lever thing, 
that the cleavis clip goes into that is bolted to the pedal. These wear and 
the hole gets all oblonged. Sorry about the bad luck that sound a lot of 
work pulling the engine and putting it back in, pulling puting ect.
