In all honesty mark, anything that low of torque, I just use an educated
wrist. :-) Snug with a short wrench is tight enough at that level of torque.
Of course I've wrenched for years, and I am def. NOT Arnold Swcharzeger .

I have two recurring nightmares about engine-building. One is that I

somehow install the distributor pinion wrong, discover my mistake when

the engine is back in the base, pull the pinion and the washer drops

into the case.

 

The other is overtorquing that 9 ft/lb nut in the sump plate. There's

no way that I can read 9 ft/lb accurately enough with a pointer style

torque wrench. Maybe it's my eyesight.
