Subject: RE: oil gallery plugs

Just thought I'd share my experiences and what I have heard from others.
Rather than just replacing non leaking plugs in my 2L (type 4) re-build, I 
made a plate to cover the plugs held in by two tiny screw (M4) and sealed 
with silicone. This way the original plug is still there, the plate will 
stop it ever popping out and if it comes loose the silicone will stop the 
oil poring out.
There was one plug too close to the flywheel to do this, so I replaced it 
with a new plug machined up like the originals. It was pressed in with a 
little loctite just to be sure. No problems with it to date.
Regards,
Richard
