In my opinion:
- buses with white roofs (68-70) are body colour inside;
- buses with white upper halves (71-79) are white inside;
- single colour buses are that colour inside; and
- transporters are body colour in the cab, and grey in the 
  cargo area.

Remaining question: what about two-tone Westies?  They started
life as transporters with body colour inside (an option for
other transporters as well); would a two-colour Westy with a
white upper half be white inside like a bus would, or would it
be the lower half's colour?

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
