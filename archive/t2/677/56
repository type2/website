Mark,

I understand.  Used to have the same nightmares when I was much younger 
and starting to rebuild VW engines.

My nightmares were after I rebuilt it and started it and it ran good....I
would start to wonder whether I really did torque the rod caps on #x rod 
down all the way...did I peen lock it also?  Is it gonna come loose and go 
thru the case next week on the way to work at 70 mph?

My cure was to look...no, I mean *really* *look* at every single part 
inside the case before I put it together....touch each piece and remember, 
yes, I did that, yes, I did that...and so on.  If that's not enough, then 
take close up digital pics before you seal the case.  An even better way 
is to ask for indulgence from you SO or a friend and hand them a soothing 
drink while you explain to them every part that you checked and what 
the check revealed while you point to it.  They will be totally bored, but 
*you* will know what you did....they don't really even have to 
listen...just so that you think they are!

I still look at the pics in Bentley when I do the oil slinger ring on T1 
engines...cause I *always* want to put it on backwards.

After 30+ years of rebuilding and almost 100 engines, I got over it.
I never missed one, so all the nightmares and worrying were for 
nothing....except to shorten my life<grin>.

A story then is in order....I spent 6 months(money was slow) rebuilding a 
HP T1 engine in 1972...it ran great!  So great that a friend and customer 
wanted one just like it.  The next one I built exactly the same....same QC work, 
same checks, same cc'ing the heads, same blueprinting of parts, same 
carefull geometry checking of the rocker arms...etc..

His ran better than mine....what could I say?...he loved it!

You'll do fine...

Cheers, dave
