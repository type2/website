Hmm..  (no I still have not left for harpers Ferry and it is getting
closer and closer to rush hour... can you say "internet addict"?)

Well, I went out and looked at the Bridgestone tires I have on my Vanagon.
In big letters they say "RD-603 Steel," in small letters, near the rim is
says "603VZ" as what I presume is the model.  The problem is that these
are two years old, and Bridgestone has probably been thru 6 more models
since then.  What you have, David, what I have, and what they are selling
Doyt have a fair chance of being completely different tires :-(  I'd
rather compare matresses!!!!

I like my RD-603 Steel tires fine.  They are not XZXs, but I have found
nothing that is.  I would gladly go back to XZXs tomorrow if Michelin
would start up making them again.  If the tires you are looking at are the
RD-603, I would say "yes, Doyt, go for it" but mine were not advertised as
"highway rib" and that is a term of art in tires that scares me.
