evening everyone. So one of our buspilots is making it across the
country from NC to CA. He is now just about in Denver, CO. His engine
temps have gone from ~200 to ~220 & his vacuum has dropped. Can anyone
comment on whether this would be due to the increased elevation? Also
any tips I can pass along to him for helping to get his family & bus
acoss the rockys would be quite nice.
