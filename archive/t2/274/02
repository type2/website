Subject: Re: [T2] Help with final decision on tires for Westy

You responders have been enormously helpful, Steve and David.  Thank you. 
I'm going to avoid the Yoko's. And I see no reason to go with the 
Bridgestones, over the Continentals, and some reasons to probably avoid them.

It looks like I will be going with the Continentals......lowest price, no 
negative replies, pretty similar to what I am already using.

I'll wait 'til Monday to make the final decision, and hope that maybe 
someone else will post their experience about this.
