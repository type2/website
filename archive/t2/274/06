My tires were also so old that they transferred every bump in the road to my rear.  I had no idea until I put on soft new tires.

I bought the Continentals after the original post from Nemo the Bus Captain and this recommendation:

I've been using them for 5 months now and I just drove halfway across country on them for 1800 miles.  All I can say is that they're quiet, handle nicely and work perfectly in the rain. In other words they look and act stock.

I'll need a couple of years to provide an truly informed opinion but I can't say you'll be initially disappointed.  I did a lot of research before I bought tires and the one question still left in my mind is why VW says a 185R14R tire is best for a 1972 Camper and later and why a commerical tire is best for 1973 and later Station Wagon and Delivery van.
