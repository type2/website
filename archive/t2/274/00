Definitely not a better choice.  Too small in diameter and the 75 series
tires have lower load capacities for a given load rating.  You need "D"
rated tires in 195/75-14 where you only need "C" in 185R14.  Stick with
the straight 185-14

I'd tend to agree.  The spec for a bus is 1520 pounds max load, more than
that is nice, but not required.

Tire widths do vary within sizes.  Not really significant.

True.

Some may be more reinforced than others

True.

Availability.  I bought the bridestones because they were available at a
good price locally.  Next time I'll check the Continental dealer

> Are the Yokohama's a slightly better choice than the Continentals?...

I doubt that I could tell the difference.  Frankly, bus tires serve to
hold the rims off of the ground.  There is some handling considerations in
sidewall stiffness, but if they are reinforced they should all do fine.
Buses aren't exactly "driver's cars", so the Nth degree in performance is
not required.
