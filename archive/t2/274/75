Subject: Re: weird shifting

>>So, I was driving down the freeway just cruising along and then I had to
slow down and downshift.  I pushed the shifter into third and it was spongy
going into third.  It went in, but I had to push it a bit...like, I'd push
it, it'd click a little, then I still had to push it a little more to get it
in gear, then it would spring back a little.  Here's the wierd part.  It
does this in 1st and 3rd, not in second and 4th.  It also did this once to
me before after I drove on the freeway and then disappeared the next time I
drove the car. unfortunately, now it's back.. anyone have any ideas what
this could be?<<

Sounds similar to some of the shifter feelings I was getting when my front
shift rod bushing was all mangled and falling apart.  You might want to drop
the front pan and take a look up where the bottom of the shifter intersects
with the front shift rod -- that rubber-like bushing might be getting ready
to go.  Just an idea.
