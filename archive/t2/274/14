******************************
Because Volkswagen and all aftermarket concerns sell the Mexican B switch
as an E switch.  They have never supreseded it (or retro-superseded it).
In Mexico it is sold as a B.

VW all over the world will sell certain parts under various designations
and *sometimes* be the same identical part.
