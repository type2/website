Re-install shag carpet.  I'd suggest rootbeer brown.  However,
I'd be sure to follow the PPO's installation, and leave the engine
compartment bare.........um..........yah........and the windows.
3M makes a great spray on carpet glue--Super 77 Spray Adhesive(tm).
I use it for all kinds of things--works great!

With this great retro look, you won't even be tempted to buy one
of those "New Microbuses(tm)" to relive the exciting '60s-'70s
that you missed.
