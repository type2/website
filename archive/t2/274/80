Subject: timing and pinging question 

Hello all,

   Sorry to keep bringing this topic up, but I just 

like to keep asking. 71 Dormobile with stock 

everything. 050 distib, breaker type points, oil 

bath air cleaner, you name it all original to this

 motor. My question and problem is. Timing set 

to 7 ATDC points at .016 dwell at 24 on the 4 

cyl scale and idle set at 950. Timed with 

vacuum hook up all like the old volks page 

said to do. Any way when I have it timed 

to this it idles great. Well as good as a 

 34pic t-3 will let it but at power it pings 

like mad. I turned the distrib counter 

clock wise and the ping goes away, but 

idles like crap. I just can't seem to find 

the happy medium. I've looked at the 

carb- and readjusted it over and over 

again (black soot on bumper) and down 

to no soot at all. Running rich is better 

right??? But it still is haunting me. New 

condenser, new points. My next step is

 plugs and wires. Heck that could be the 

problem from day one I guess. Anyone

 have any other ideas???? Vacuum all 

seems good. Maybe distributor worn 

out>???? All comments  would be great!!!

Thanks,

Paul Saulsbury
