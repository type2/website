VDO usually stampred (in ink) a month and year on their instruments.  I
don't believe the VW number was ever imprinted or stamped on these
particular gauges.

If you look closely (I have in the past) and compare the "font" style of
the numbers and the background paint, there are slight differences in the
grey color.  It takes a trained eye to see this, not for novice I'm afraid.
