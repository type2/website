Not a good idea.  All that warm air coming out from under the engine
recirulates through the opening.  There was a good reason that VW put a
seal on that door!

My buddy and I wired a plumber's smoke bomb to my bus to "really"
see the air currents...At speed, the smoke from under the bus
went straight up the back and dispersed at the roofline. If your
engine leaks oil, you already know this from the droplet pattern
on the rear of your bus. Good enough proof to keep both the en-
gine and rear window hatches sealed.
