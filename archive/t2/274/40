Subject: Re: [T2] AridZona Full Length Bus Rack

I dont think anyone mentioned weight limits to Clara. I recall her and her 
ex comming back with the full roof rack on a splitty LOADED with VW parts  
from her trips searching out vw stuff. I mean LOADED, engines, tin, wheels, 
and hey that metal weight adds up!
