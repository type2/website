Subject: my engine goes *POP*, help please

ok, as the diehard list members know i replaced the heads in my bus (71 
Westy 1600 Single Port)(first engine removal, first big job etc)and it's 
gone very well until today.

Hooked acelerator cable up and it wouldn't start, the starter motor tries to 
get it to start and it sounds like there's no fuel in the carb.  So i add a 
little gas into the carb and try again.

And it makes this rather loud POP sound but doesn't turn over.

I have no idea where to go from here.

I labeled all my wiring thingys well and I'm pretty cetain that I have the 
wiring correct, but maybe I messed up.

Please give me some hints on what to look for and where to go from here.

As always, thanks in advance and have an awesome weekend!!
