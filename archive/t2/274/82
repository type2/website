Guys,

It's just like about everything else...look for the obvious first and
the hard stuff second!<grin>...unless you really like to work hard at it.

The coupler is the "cage" type assembly just in front of the transmission.

It helps if you have a helper and can watch it while shifting 
gently...engine not running....helper calling out the gears as they
shift...don't force if it won't go into the next gear!

Once you watch how it works, it becomes pretty obvious if you have linkage 
problems....go back and watch the front thru the same set of gear changes.

Cheers, dave
