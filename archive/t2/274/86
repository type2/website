Paul,

As Jamie said, the 050 mechanical advance distributor is not original to
any VW.  At the same time, Other things you have said lead me to suspect
that this is not the correct number for your distributor.  Many
distributors used on VWs had "050" somewhere in the numbers stamped on the
distributor.  Not all of them are 050 distributors.  It would really help
if you could remove your distributor, take some steel wool, clean the
outide of it and report all the numbers stamped into the case to the list.

First, as Jamie said (again :-), the correct dwell for all VW engines on a
dwell meter set to the 4-cylinder scale is 50 plus or minus 1-2 (49-51 or
48-52).  If you have a dwell meter that only has 6 and 8 cylinder scales,
then you can set the dwell at 25 on the 8 cylinder scale but on a
4-cylinder scale, it ought to be set at 50 degrees of dwell.

Second, the .016 is the thickness of the feeler gauge that you should be
using for an initial setting.  You rotate the shaft until the points rider
is on top of a lobe and set the gap between the fixed and movable contacts
on the points a .016".  On a new distributor, with no wear on the cam
lobes, this will give you 50 degrees of dwell.  After you install your
distributor, you measure and reset the points to an actual 50 degrees of
dwell because there are no distributors left with no wear on the cam
lobes.  OK?

Third, 7 degrees *after* TDC (top dead center)???  this can't be right!
with dwell at 24 and timing at 7 ATDC, the engine should not run or run
very badly.  Are you sure you do not mean 7 *before* TDC?

> Timed with vacuum hook up all like the old volks page said to do.

This statement is what makes me suspect that your "050" distributor is
*not* an "050" distributor.  If you have a place to hook a vacuum hose to
on your distributor, it is *not* an 050!  050 and 009 distributors have
only mechanical advance mechanisms, no vacuum advance at all and do not
have a "vacuum biscuit" hanging off the side of the distributor.  If you
have a vacuum biscuit, you *don't* have an 050 or 009.

I think this is a product of your dwell setting.  Timed properly with the
dwell set at 24 degrees, I am frankly amazed it idles at all!

I just can't seem to find the happy medium. I've looked at the

True, to an extent, but if you run it too rich for a while, you can cause
problems from carbon build-up.

Why does the vacuum *seem* good?  have you measured it with a vacuum
gauge?  If you have, what is the reading at idle?
