Mike,

1st and 3rd, you are "pushing" the shifter into the nose cone in the
back.  2nd and 4th, you are pulling the whole shifter toward the front of 
the bus.

My bet is that you have a loose(or failing) coupler bushing or a loose
set screw somewhere along the linkage.

Check your trans fluid too!!!

Cheers ,dave
