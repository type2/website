i'm new to this group so tell me if this is not an appropriate post, but i 
thought i'd share my website with all of those who would like some tips on 
replacing their canvas or painting their poptop on their westy. the address 
is http://princessann1.home.mindspring.com 
i hope some of you find this useful/helpful.
