Subject: Heater Controls

Have been looking for the heater control cable for a 1974 Westy. The
cable measures 16 inches. It attaches to the slider nearest the steering
wheel. It has a connector at both ends. Typical looking VW cable.
Anybody know where these are available new? Would anyone have a good
used that they would part with? Thanks.

Tom
