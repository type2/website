Ok,
That had to be the easiest fix EVER.  I went under the bus and stared at
the joint between the tranny and the shift linkage.  I then noticed that
the set screw was pressing up against the rubber cover.  I pulled the
shifter out of first gear, went back under the car, and rotated the
rubber cover so it fit over the set screw like it's supposed to.

Shifts perfectly now :)

I'll still check the tranny fluid soon.

Thanks,
Mike
