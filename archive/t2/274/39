What about a gauge that only uses the top half of the gauge. Full is full
but half is empty

Be thankful.......Much better than no gauge at all. I'd rather have that 
condition than the one I have, which is a complete disconnect from any data 
at all.

Paste a piece of masking tape over the lower half of the gauge, to remind 
everyone that it is empty at the margin of the tape.
