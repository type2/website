Subject: [T2] Head interchangeability-(carb to FI) 74-75

Hey Dave et al, I never had a satisfactory answer to this:  I got a 74
engine (disassembled by PO who was misled that his 115-125 compression
was too low) with a free 74 Westy; only 160K mi on bottom end; as the
heads have a 91 date stamped on them, I assume they were replaced.  How
can I tell if they are still the stock (1800?) size? How much of this is
compatible to a stock 75 engine, should I save it as a spare for my
daughter's 75 bus?  Is the case is the same?  I'd use the fuel I., not
the carbs.
What of the heads- other than needing a hole for the temp sensor, will
the other FI stuff bolt right up, including the case?  One head looks
fine; the other has a small crack running to the base of a seat (intake,
the large valve)- is this of concern?
