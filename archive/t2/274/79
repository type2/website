Subject: Re: [T2] Injector rebuilding experence

I think I'm having a similar problem.... what were the symptoms of the FI 
clog(s) and/or the dropped valve seat? I'm getting a hesitation and often 
times bucking behavior, mostly at steady speeds but sometimes during 
acceleration also. Idles fine. Usually does ok at high rpms. No backfiring 
upon downshifting. Any clues anybody? I've replaced the distributor cap and 
rotor, and the distributor has been changed to an electronic one (Crane) but 
worked ok for awhile after the points were replaced. Mechanic at local shop 
says he put the points back in and it still did it, but when I get time I am 
going to do this myself just so I know for sure. Fuel pump seems ok, don't 
know much about the "fuel pressure regulator", but I'm thinking this problem 
is definately either a fuel delivery or electrical problem (I know, I know, 
that really narrows it down, right?). In any case, all advice is appreciated.
