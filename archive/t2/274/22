One solution is to run a late Pinto breather (or
sprint car breather - see 'Sprint DFV' at 
http://www.piercemanifolds.com/overstock.htm) if you
can find it -and source the heated air from the
original preheat output on the 72-74 busses that
should be mounted to the front (FIF) valence - i call
it a 'troll toilet'.

Another solution, which I hope to do someday, is to
manufacture a single-runner intake manifold with a
heat riser pipe. It can be done.

The problem is not with the carb, its with Weber's
half-assed approach to the R&D of the intake manifold.
 I think of it as another situation where the type4
engine didn't get the attention it deserved...
