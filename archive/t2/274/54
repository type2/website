Subject: Re: [T2] Help with final decision on tires for Westy

Doyt --

The 94 load rating may officially translate into 1,477 lbs of load on some
table, but my Conti CR12's have "Max. Load 1540 lbs." molded right on their
sidewalls. My '67 is not a camper, and I didn't want "small truck" tires on
it. (The max. pressure molded on the tire is indeed 40 psi.) When Nemo
mentioned the Conti's I was glad to find appropriately spec'ed and proper
looking tires for a Deluxe.

Related question to the list: Is there any appropriately spec'ed tire that
has whitewalls? Are all those guys featured in the magazines doing the wrong
thing, with wobbly "P" passenger tires?
