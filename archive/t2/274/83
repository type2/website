Paul

maybe you should read http://www.type2.com/library/electrip/050rev.htm
That page tells you a few things you should know,
 this is not a stock distributor for any VW. Most Bosch books don't even list
it.
This is strictly a mechanical advance distributor.

points should be set at 50 deg on the dwell meter,, not 24,, 
and as you have a dwell meter,, don't bother confoosing yourself with a feeler
gauge setting,

set the valves, 
adjust the dwell to 50 deg, 
set the timing to 7.5 
adjust the carb to 900 rpm,,

take it for a drive,, and then adjust the timing to 5 deg 

swing the timing adv and retarded for a few degrees and see what happens

The books say numbers for NEW engine, NEW dist., etc.   
You have to play around a bit to find the timing that your engine will run nice
at.
