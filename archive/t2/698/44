Subject: sliding door hinge

I'm trying to troubleshoot a sliding door that won't close.  I removed 
it to paint the bus, and ever since, I haven't been able to get it to 
close.  I suspect it's probably related to the latches, but I've 
noticed something odd about my hinge.  In comparing my hinge to the 
photos in Bentley, I noticed that the two "locking levers" are in 
different positions.  It appears that mine have been switched top to 
bottom.  See figure 5-57 in Bentley... it seems that the upper and 
lower locking levers were switched.  I can't see where it would make a 
difference, but I'd like to know if others have it this way, or was 
mine disassembled by a P.O. and reassembled wrong?

Also, is there a source for the spring (figure 5-56, "A") that goes on 
the retainer?
