Subject: Re: [T2] RE locking gas cap for 71  Zanderbus

Sounds a bit high tech for me, but a latching lock is def. the answer for
gas door.

Always remove rotor and have a club so bus isn't going anywhere unless
towed.   Wouldn't mind finding one of those Brit (with one t)  clamps like
they use in UK for overdue parking.
More thanks are due for more replies.
