Subject: [T2]toggle radio question

ok i have my radio wired like this.
i have the radio so that when i cut the switch on  to crank the bus the radio comes on...
thing is this....
 
how can i put a toggle in there so that it still operates like this but yet i can flip a toggle when the bus ignition is off and just listen to the radio without turning the key,...
 
i was thinking that the toggle would need to be connected to one or both somehow of the always hot wire and the ignition wire?
 
someone make sense of this...
sometimes i like to listen to the radio when the bus isnt on but i cant do that the way i have it hooked up which i like... i could however leave the switch turned to on without cranking and then listen butttttttt  i have a electric fuel pump the ticking kind and also i dont want to take a chance and burn the switch out possibly sitting there to long turned on..as well as the fuel pump....
 
just to wash the bus sometimes its good to have the music on inside or if doing something a project inside or just sitting there mellowing out a little bit...(smiles)...
thanks
peace
chris
