Subject: Re: [T2] Oil cooler question

The type of spacer referred to here is not a washer. It is a sleeve
that goes inside the rubber seals that serves as a stop to limit the
travel of the oil cooler down the studs to prevent the cooler from
smashing the seals. I find no precedent for this in Bentley. The large
paperback Chilton specializing in air-cooled VW has no picture of
this, but my large generic Chilton covering all import cars from
1979-1986 does have an illustration showing these spacers at the
crankcase on the studs. I would think if there was a tech bulletin on
this, it would be on my Bentley CD, but there is not.

 Thanks Scott. I guess that's why Bentley makes no mention of them as
 spacers. I can't believe that the chilton manual says they are spacers and
 are required to keep from squashing the seals too much. Ouch. I don't know
 if I'll ever open that chilton again!
