Subject: RE locking gas cap for 71  Zanderbus

Thankee Thankee, those who replied.

 So, I have to look for a Thing locking cap.  hmm..  Good to know.  Hate the
thought of drilling a hole in my gas door to install a lock.  Anybody with a
picture of a neat installation they have done?  Am NOT going to have more
gravel in my tank this year!!!
