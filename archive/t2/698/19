If you are describing the hole in the case where you can see the back of the
flywheel the answer is yes it should have a plug in it but there are lots of
type 2 engines running around with no plug there, with no ill effects.

That's right!

End play, loose belt, warped pulley, missing spacer between crankshaft
pulley and crankshaft, pulley not centered on fan, excess crankshaft bearing
clearance. These things come to mind when you say damaged timing scale.
