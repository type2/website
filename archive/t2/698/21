Subject: Pop-top hinge cleaning

Would someone tell me the best way to re-store a pop-top hinge?  This one is 
the one for the lil' pop-top.  I"I'm going to replace all of the screws 
etc.. but the hinge itself looks a bit worn. Guess you can't really paint it 
as the paint would just wear off when rubbing against other parts.

TIA
