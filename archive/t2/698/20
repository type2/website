Subject: Propex/Carver LP Heaters

Have reviewed the 105 T2 Archive entries concerning
"Propex" heaters.  My 78 already has an original
equipment Eberspacher BA6, but it has never run. 
Besides, when I'm moving down the highway, the cabin
does heat-up (at about milepost 50).  I'd prefer a
more central, thermostatically controlled heating
system.  Something I could forget about while I sleep.
 T2 archives seem to like Propex/Carver Heaters.
   
In 96, T2 members did a group purchase of some 20
Propex Heaters, directly from the manufacturer.  I'm
aware the heaters are from the UK, the parent company
is now Carver, and the model purchased was the 1600
for about $440 (in 1996 dollars) each plus shipping.
     
?  8-9 years later, how happy are some of those T2
Propex heater purchasers?
    
?  New Propex/Carver Heater users... Are you happy
with your purchase?
