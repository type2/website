Subject: ANOTHER Rebuild

hey,

Returning home from my father, my 71 engine decides to explode!  At least it 
decided not to do on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.  The crankshaft will only turn 
180 degrees in either direction.

I took three out of four plugs out, now it turns 270 degrees.  The plug in 
Number one piston is just plane stuck.  And it looks like a push-rod splitted 
off the one the rockers.

Before I start tearing the engine apart is there anything else I should look 
for.  I never replaced a connecting rod before any suggesstions?  I am on kind 
of a budget, and start a new job next week so I need away to get to work.

Any ideas what cause this to happen in the first place?
