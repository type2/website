Troy,

BTDT, (not twice, though.) The diodes in the alternator are fried -- there are 
three, IIRC. I wound up buying a rebuilt from BD, but a local shop can probably 
replace the diodes for you, or sell you the diodes. Probably some blown fuses, 
too. Replace the alternator and try everything again.

 On my '77, it is a major pain to get the nut off and on of the one bolt that 
the alternator swings on. It can be done with the engine in, though. It is 
important to get the rubber cooling duct hooked back up. The generic rebuild I 
got had several posts that were too long and had to be cut off to clear the 
cover. Also, I had to make a gasket for the cover. Price was about half of Bosch 
rebuild, though, and no core required. Been running OK for several years since.

Tom
