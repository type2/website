LOL!

Yes, and I can remember when I actually *repaired* 180k capacity 
floppy disk drives cause they cost $200/each.  Now you buy 1.2mb drives 
for $20 each and thow them away when they get bad...*if* you even get one 
with your new computer  these days.

The wonders of modern robotic/factory production.

Anyone know what a standard new Brazillian bus cost in equivalent dollars 
these days?

Cheers, dave
