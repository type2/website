Hello all,

My engine is removed and I'm taking a close look at some problems I noticed and
hopefully some of the fellow listmembers can help me out.

I have an 81 Vanagon 2.0 Liter FI with a CV series case, manual transmission.

      The  ATF dipstick/checker hole in my case, top upper left, next to the
      trans to case retaining bolt shall be plugged.  YES?

      With the rocker assemblies removed from an AVP rebuilt head, all the
      valves shall be closed and a straight edge will be able to rest on
      all 4 of the valve tips.  YES?

And finally something that  or has happened twice in the engines' three year
history. I've lost two of the plastic timing gauges to the belt jumping up and
sawing thru it like a bandsaw. I've never seen it happen but I suspect it
occurs upon start-up as she hiccups/stutters to bring herself to life.
    I can't think of any cause for this except for the alignment of the timing
marks on the gears or some serious endplay.  Any ideas someone can share?

Thanks in advance, Craig
