from what I can tell, the locking diff's are NLA.  Apparently, you can 
get a Quaife limited slip differential for your bus transmission, 
though.

Long Enterprises specifically mentions that they install them in VW 
transmissions, although they run ~$900 just for the part.

Do a search on "Quaife" and "vw" or "002".
