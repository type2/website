Hi Don,

Those carbs have a master mixture adjustment at the top of the left
carb near the master idle speed adjuster. You set it with an exhaust
gas analyzer. I wouldn't worry about it until you get to Colorado, and
make yourself a note of how much it had to be adjusted from sea level
so you know where to set it when you go back.

 I hear re-jetting, but that's not really a side of the road thing. What else?
