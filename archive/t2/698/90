My '73 has it's check valve along the aft large rubber vacuum
line.  The valve is found up above the accordion tube from the
left side heater box.  In the middle of the bus is a hard vacuum
tube and finally, up front, is another rubber vacuum line to the
booster.

So would a rotton vacuum line, or disconnected vacuum line
(use hose clamps) or ruptured diaphram inside the brake
booster, IIRC.
