Subject: [T2] FI Temp 2 Stand-off, "S" Hose fab update

I'm attempting to fabricate both the Fuel-injection
Temperature #2 sensor STAND-OFF, as well as the FI "S"
hose.
   
(1)  Bosch FI T2 sensor Stand-Off for T2 75-83.  Have
received a used but original and in good condition, T2
Sensor and Stand-off from Scott Lyons of
www.germansupply.com.  Thanks Scott.  Have installed
(only the stand-off) onto my bus, and then rocket-ed
around the countryside to test it's viability.  For
these Portugese heads I've got, this stand-off seems
to be perfect at various speeds, various engine
temperatures, and various levels of steepness-in-grade
(or various power demands).  Looks to be a "Go."  Will
drive about a week with this stand-off, in heavy
traffic, freeway, and hilly terrain until next
weekend, before going into production cloning of this
part.
    
(2)  We are having a he** of a time getting the "S"
hose mold built.  This "S" hose cloning project may be
for naught.  And the A-B Butylene material is way too
soft & flimsy after curing.  i.e. haven't found
correct fab material yet.  But I will keep after it
part-time, and keep you all informed.
