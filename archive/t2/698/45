Subject: Re: [T2] Altitude adjustments?

I was given an offer in Arizona to use a list member's analyzer. But
when I woke up this morning I was VERY ill. Not only did I skip the
Grand Canyon (even though I was less than an hour away) but I passed
on stopping by Flagstaff to take advantage of the offer.

I've been using the Bentley method to adjust my carbs (after balancing
with the "cheap chinese unisync copy" that works just fine, thank
goodness..heh) and even with the massive vacuum leaks caused by the
booster "L" shaped boots had the engine running sweet and getting fair
mileage.

My mileage on this trip was 17mpg yesterday and 19mpg today. So far so
good! It will probably drop back to 17-ish tomorrow because that's a
harder drive, going north on the 25.

I've been checking for obvious leaks at each fuel stop. But it appears
to be purely altitude related. I'm in Albuquerque right now, at around
6k feet and it's idling fine. At a 7k foot stop earlier I couldn't
make it idle for love or money. And I *did* offer it both!!!

These carbs are old, the shaft bushings are worn (no visible fuel
leaks, but I can get a noticable wiggle out of them), so I'm just
writing it off to tired carbs. At speed they're fine, so I'm not going
to struggle too much. I'll tackle a rebuild this summer. I'll just
keep massaging them at fuel stops.
