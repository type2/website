How about flooding? Keeping the pedal to the floor adds extra air to
compensate. Flooding can also make it so you have to give lots of
pedal to keep it going.

Conversely, how about starved? Ruptured accelerator pump diaphram can do this.

 Doesn't just start anymore like it used to. I have to floor the pedal
 while cranking. I verified it's not another vacuum leak with copious

 Seems to take forever to rev up when in neutral or when the clutch
 pedal is down. Non-issue on the highway, but a deal killer on surface
 streets. To get it to rev up I have to floor it.

 Also still won't idle consistently. It seems to decide on its own
 whether it will idle or not. Needs lots of pedal to say alive.
