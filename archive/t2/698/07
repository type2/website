Subject: Oil cooler question

My previous post explains my oil cooler problem. After posting it I went out
and did more inspection. It is definatly the cooler seal or seals. when lookin
in from the drivers side I can see the oil dripping off the cooler flange onto
the top of the oil filter. :~( As best I can see both seals look square in
their seats. I see that I installed the spacer rings between the case and the
cooler. They were there when I removed the cooler but I am puzzled about them.
The Bentley for this 80 Vanagon makes no mention of these spacers, nor does
the Bentley for my 75. But my Chiltons manual does indicate that they are
needed,"Types 3 and 4, 2/1700, 2/1800 and 2/2000 have a spacer ring between
the crankcase and the coolerat each securing screw. If these rings are omited
the seals may be squeezed too tightly, resulting in oil stoppage and result in
engine damage."

My question is, could these spacers be keeping the seals from being compressed
enough to do their job? Does any one know what the thickness of these spacers
is supposed to be? I would like to know for sure that this is not going to
leak again and want to check every thing I can.

Thanks,
Tom
