Yes, but I don't have it running yet!  Seems like a nice unit. Just after
Christmas I bought a Propex 1800EX from Karl Mullandore of Westy Ventures
301-432-4645, $595 plus shipping, he says the price will be going up due to
exchange rates, this has been on my wish list for years.  Seems like a nice
unit.  I still need to retrofit a Westy propane tank to my non-equipped '70.

On the subject, not quite sure how to mount this tank (thanks tedebare for
sending it to me).  It appears that I would have to cut off my underbody
panel (ar at least a lot of it) in order to get the tank installed.  Can
anyone pmail me a pic of their stock westy propane tank installation?

If I had a stock BA6 already installed I would try to get it working
though!!
