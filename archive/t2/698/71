Subject: Re: [T2]toggle radio question

In our camper I put in a center off double throw switch- up, it works in 
classic fashion, always power to the radio.  Down, it works like other 
cars- goes off with the ignition.  Mostly we drive it down so it kills 
the radio (an old one) when you turn off the bus and go away.  Camp and 
it is up.  I suppose modern radios with an accessory switch wire could 
have that wired in to a switch you throw so power is still to the radio 
for clocks and memory.
