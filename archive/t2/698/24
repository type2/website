Subject: Re: [T2] Pop-top hinge cleaning

dont know anything about reconditiong the hinge but you can check with busted bus or the busco either one and see if they have some hinges if you cant get those to work...?
hope that helps..?
have you tried soaking it in anything like pb blaster or something that wont eat it away but help loosen it up from rust and make it bend a little better?
peace

Would someone tell me the best way to re-store a pop-top hinge? This one is 
the one for the lil' pop-top. I"I'm going to replace all of the screws 
etc.. but the hinge itself looks a bit worn. Guess you can't really paint it 
as the paint would just wear off when rubbing against other parts.

TIA
