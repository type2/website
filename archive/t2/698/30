(1) BA6 heater already.  Oh, I will get the BA6 heater
running.  Probably just the spark/glow plug & fuel
filter which need service.  BA6 Exhaust pipe is rusted
out, so I have made no attempt to `deploy` it.  
Safety first.  But even if it did run, it is only
useful when the engine is running.  I want a heater
which will maintain a comfortable temperature while
I'm asleep.  Hence the search which currently is
looking at the Propex/Carver 1800.  (Engine
dependability, brakes & steering safety issues have
been prioritized above creature comfort issues.  But
give me time.  :D) 
  
(2) Westy Propane Tank Positioning.  No clue about the
Propane tank positioning on a Westy, and the
under-belly tin on a Westy.  I can only speak of what
my 1978 ASI/Riviera is configured as.  My 78 has
underbelly tin which protects the BA6.  But it doesn't
extend to the outer body perimeter seam.  My
underbelly tin fits from frame beam to frame beam. 
That is, 10" or so short of the body perimeter.  If
your`s does not extend to the exterior body edge seam,
then the propane tank bolts to your VW Flooring in
4-places inside or within that 10" space underneath
the drivers/left side, behind the left front wheel.  I
currently have my propane tank out, so it can be
retrofitted with an OPD (aka Overfill Protection
Device).  (I hope.)  And, I have seen propane tanks
mounted below the sliding door (on the passengers /
right side).  But they too, based upon a quick visual
inspection, have been mounted to the flooring into
that 10" space between the outer body perimeter seam
and the frame beam.
   
(3)  Propex 1800xx to be installed.  When you do get
your Propex 1800ex running, I'd be most interested in
how happy you are with the device.  I've researched
other makes including Norcold, Dometic and the
plethora of Suburban heaters.  But most of them are
way too hot or big for our relatively small VW T2
space.  Currently, old Propex 1600xx and new 1800xx
heaters are at the top of my selection list.  :-)
