Subject: brake servo, carb idle

Hello List,
I am new to the list and have been learning alot from it, thanks.  My '73
westy is in storage and does not come out until the snow pack here in Central
New York goes away (Syracuse area)  Unfortunately I replaced the engine 2
years ago with one from GEX.  If I  knew now what you guys (non gender
specific) thought of them I certainly would have went with another company,
damage is done and I have to deal with it now.
My question:
The brake servo thread that has been going on, can someone give me a basic 101
on the servo.  I have trouble with idle on my dual carbs, have pulled the
engine twice, and recall no such beast, she seems to brake fine too.  Also,
anyone know of any type 2 mechanics near Syracuse, NY.
Thanks,  Tom
