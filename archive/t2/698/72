Subject: erratic clock

The clock in my 74 single cab has an annoying problem.
 When the truck is parked for any appreciable length
of time, the clock stops.  You can see the second hand
ticking and trying to move but it won't advance. I can
set the time a little with the set knob and it will
run correctly for a while before stalling again.  When
I crank the truck up, the clock starts running fine
and the second hand moves as it's supposed to.  It's
as if it's not getting enough voltage without the
alternator turning.

On another note, I took my Sapphire XXV stereo radio
to my local stereo sales store at lunch to get
serviced and the gentlemen working there looked at it
as if had just fallen from Mars.  They all laughed at
the fact that it surely was made before they were
born.  Little did they know it's a step up for me from
my blaupunkt am/fm mono $10 junkyard radio.  Greg
