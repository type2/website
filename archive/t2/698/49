Oh Don! Please tell me you didn't say that! You can't run with leaking
booster boots! That's a sure way to lean out and burn a motor! Plus,
no vacuum leaks is a prerequisite to carb mixture adjustments. If you
adjust with leaks, your adjustment is invalid. I bought replacement
boots from Bus Boys. Even before I found out they had them, I repaired
them with black silicon RTV wrapped with electrical tape to hold them
together while the RTV dried and give strength to the repair.
