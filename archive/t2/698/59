Hey Brian, 
            At least your timing of the engine destruction was lucky!  I am 
told they charge you a couple of hundred bucks if you break down on the Ches. 
Bay Bridge.  Those cops never had a sense of humor, and have become even more 
paranoid since 9/11... maybe rightly so.

You'll have plenty of opportunity to perform a post-mortem after you get your 
engine out.  I would conjecture that you lost a valve in the #1 cylinder; it 
has peened-over the sparkplug... but that is just a guess based on my 
experience tearing-down a coupla dozen engines years ago.  Right now you need 
to find a replacement and get your Bus running again.  I hope others on this 
List can help you in that.

You did not say where you are working, or whether you need your Bus for daily 
transport to/from the job.  If you're talking about a well-paying job, then you 
may be able to afford a rental car for a couple of weeks... not a happy thought 
but maybe necessary, AMHIK.

Otherwise if you can lay-up your Bus until springtime, things get a lot easier 
to manage.... like maybe a trip up to Mass. to have Boston Bob rebuild your 
engine.  Whatever the case, I wish you the best of luck.  Glenn

Returning home from my father, my 71 engine decides to explode!  At least it 
decided not to do on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.  The crankshaft will only turn 
180 degrees in either direction.

I took three out of four plugs out, now it turns 270 degrees.  The plug in 
Number one piston is just plane stuck.  And it looks like a push-rod splitted 
off the one the rockers.

Before I start tearing the engine apart is there anything else I should look 
for.  I never replaced a connecting rod before any suggesstions?  I am on kind 
of a budget, and start a new job next week so I need away to get to work.

Any ideas what cause this to happen in the first place?
