IMHO, most tricks to avoid pulling the engine involve far more time and hassle
than just pulling the engine, which, in a VW Bus, isn't really that big a
deal.

Besides, pulling the engine gives you a chance to inspect the clutch, clean up
parts of the engine compartment that are hard to get to when there's an engine
there, etc.  You might find a worn part that you'll be glad to have had a
chance to fix.

Have fun!
