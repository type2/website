Salutations List!
     All right, I'm new. New to the list, new to volkswagens. Here goes.
I just bought a 73 type 2 transporter. The Man that I bought it from told me it had carb trouble, wouldn't idle and died at every stop light. I drove it for fifteen minutes and realized what anyone with more I.Q. points than a galapogos tortoise would have noticed right away. It was stalling because of the brakes. Long story short, I think my servo's shot. My question is if I disconnect the vaccum hose, will my brake system be the same as a stock system without a booster? I drove it home from San Diego on the freeway in traffic, and the brakes didn't feel too bad. Is there a danger of failure without the servo? 
     Thank you for your time, and I'd like to add that this list is the coolest hipcat thang since bon jovi.
