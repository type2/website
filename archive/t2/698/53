Hi Skyler,

Running with your servo disconnected is possible, but braking will be
compromised to the extent of a possible safety hazard. Earlier models
without the servo were drum brakes, and did not require the foot
pressure that disc brakes require.

Before deciding your booster is shot, check for vacuum leaks along the
hose from the booster to the carburetors. Typically the L boots are
shot where the crossover tube hooks onto the manifolds. If you should
choose to disconnect the vacuum hoses from the booster, be sure to cap
the tubes at the manifolds so you do not lean out your mixture and
burn out your motor.

 I think my servo's shot. My question is if I disconnect the vaccum
hose, will my brake system be the same as a stock system without a
booster? I drove it home from San Diego on the freeway in traffic, and
the brakes didn't feel too bad. Is there a danger of failure without
the servo?
