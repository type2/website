I had a brain fart the other day when trying to jump start my bus. I ended
up reversing the polarity. I checked it twice before connecting the cables
and was wrong both times. UGH.

So it went like this for about 30 seconds until I noticed smoke coming from
the jumper cables and the engine compartment of my bus. I pulled off the
jumper cables as fast as I could (very hot). 

Fixing the polarity, I was able to get the bus started, but it died almost
immediately. The battery had nothing left and was on its last leg anyway. 

So, I bought a new battery, put it in and the bus fired up and ran like a
champ. BUT. the battery and ERG lights are on. This tells me that I likely
fried the alternator. After a little more investigation, I also noticed
neither headlight works (but parking lights & Hazards do) and the radio
doesn't work. The wipers also only move very slowly.

Troy, 
       I can't imagine why your wipers would not work under reversed polarity 
unless maybe a capacitor fried...??  Are you certain they worked well before 
all this happened?

If (as you say) you have an alternator, then almost surely you've blown the 
diode bridge.  You should not operate the vehicle unless you are willing to 
shorten the life of your new battery -- dramatically.  At present you are 
alternately charging then discharging the battery.  In an extreme case it may 
boil the electrolyte.

In your shoes, I would take the alternator out and have it tested.  Replacing 
the diode bridge is no big deal, or picking up a usable alt from a junker is 
quite possible.  Guys on the list, including me, may have a Bosch Vanagon 
alternator to sell you [OK, it is a Saturday].

Are you certain the battery cable terminals did not melt away, if only 
partially?  They are only lead, and you may find there isn't much left.  New 
cable for the + and a new ground strap for the - would be a smart purchase.

Flatulence of the brain happens to everyone, at some time or another.  Just be 
glad you didn't explode a battery, or (far worse) get acid in your eyes.  Buy a 
good pair of goggles when you are buying the new cables!
