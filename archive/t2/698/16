Subject: Re: Altitude adjustments?

Thanks for the responses guys... 

Soo... I know how to adjust the idle mixture per the Bentley. Is that
method not valid at altitude? Do I really need a gas analyzer for
this?

I'm now at a good altitude (6k feet? Something like that...) here in
Williams, AZ. I'm going to make a Grand Canyon run in the morning then
head for New Mexico.

Ever since I got above 3k feet I can't get the bus to idle. I'll set
it and get it good then drive a while and when I pull off no idle. :-(

Running at speed is great. No problems at all. So I'm wondering what I
can do to get an idle...

(I'll be updating my denvertrip site in a few minutes...)
