Subject: Spring Cleaning

After seeing some pictures of the "crud" and stuff that can get lodged in
the cylinder fins and the oil cooler and with my own experiences with mice
and their nests with my other old cars I'm thinking that I need a plan of
action when spring arrives.  

So can one get to the fins and oil cooler to clean them out without pulling
the motor?  If so, which pieces of tin should/can I remove?  In what order?
What's the best way to clean them?

TIA
