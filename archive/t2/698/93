 The heads were effectively loose. I torqued only the 4 nuts on each side

 is going to hit me on the head for not doing it properly). I understand that
 this isn't the most pure way of doing it, but I want to wait a bit before I
 drop the engine. I'm still afraid of doing it and whenever I will I want to
 do as many things as possible while it is out. Anyway : does this kind of
 half torquing increase the chances of craking the head ?

If it's any consolation, my local VW shop recommends this procedure.
He said the lower ones are the ones that get loose anyway.
