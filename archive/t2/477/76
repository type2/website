Subject: [T2] Re: Captain's Chair

Hi Adrian.  I bought a chair swivel base from a westy for my bus.  Found it
sitting in a guy's parts bus and bought it along with a bunch of other
parts.  I haven't installed it yet but this base is a Westfalia factory item
which welds in place on the passenger side (it was cut out of another bus,
and it appears to fit a standard bus seat).  I noticed these Vanagon trays
on ebay
http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=2442663899&category=33701
I'm not sure if they would fit or not but maybe someone on the list could.
Good luck,
