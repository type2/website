Folks,

Can we get over this one?

Think about it....the seat mounts are there to hold the seat down...not 
you *and* the seat down.

If you modify the seats and believe that they would *not* fly out the 
windshield in 100mph crash with no one was sitting in them , then they are 
probably gonna be fine.

It is the *seat belts* and their mountings that are going to keep you 
in the car.

The only exception to this is if you get hit from behind...and I'm betting 
that the parts that hold the back of the seat upright are going to
go long before the stuff that holds the seat tracks in.

Look at the belt mounts and duplicate the size and mounting of those for 
your seats if you must...then you know that you have done *at least* as 
good a job as the safety guys at vw.

Cheers, dave
