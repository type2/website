Subject: Bus Heater For Sale

I have a Stewart Warner Model 8332-12 Bus heater for sale.
It has been totally refurbished with new fuel line, rewiring and rebuilt fuel 
pump and burner.  It includes the heater, installation/owners manual and the 
ductwork.  I am awaiting a cable switch for the heater and then it will be 
complete.
Asking price with everything is $350 plus $25 shipping.
If you only want the heater or various parts let me know and we can decide on 
a price.
I can email photos if interested.
Get this heater while it lasts and keep your bus warm for the fall/winter 
months.
If there is no interest, I will have to put it on eBarf.
Regards,
Al
