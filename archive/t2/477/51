With everything in the case halves and the case
together(rods attached,distrubtor drive shaft
installed)torqued, the crankshaft should move back and
fourth for the total end play, the crankshaft should
turn easely by hand, install and torque the timing
pully, should still have all the movement, install the
flywheel(no shims) should still have the movement,
remove the flywheel, install two shims, reinstall the
flywheel torque and check the end play for final shim
thickness, remove flywheel install(correct thickness)
shim, all should be well, if not, bearing or case is
wrong.
