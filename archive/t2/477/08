You're about to answer your own question:

Bingo! Terminal 50 is battery power no matter where you are in the bus. Any circuit that connects directly to the battery will do so via a Terminal labeled "50".  Your cable from the battery connects to the solenoid directly, not the starter. Look at your wiring diagram, is the hot side of the battery labeled "50"?

Ever notice the "15" on your coil?  Isn't there a "30" on the solenoid?  Hmmmm.

Go to the type2 library and print out the list of bosch electrical terminal designations.  I keep one in a sheet saver in my binder.
