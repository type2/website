putting yourself and your "loved ones" in a significantly risky

There's that, but also if there is a accident the insurance com-
pany is going to try not to pay any claims unless they hafta...
If you modify the vehicle in a substantial way such that the
vehicles original safety features are compromised (in the 
view of the insurance expert or a safety inspection) the
person who's injured may not be able to collect medical costs
from the insurance company...Nuthin' personal (as they say in
Texas)...Just bidness... ;-(
