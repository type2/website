Two, just for the initial measurement.  then you calculate the thickness
of the third shim from that data.

No number of shims is magic.  Porsche uses one, but that means tha they
have to stock a lot more thicknesses of shim.

Avoid using thin shims if you can.  If you cannot, put the thin shim in
the middle of the stack.
