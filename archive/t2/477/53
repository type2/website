Subject: Re: [T2] zero endplay

hello All  The way I set the end play is to mount the flywheel without any 
shims or o ring set the motor on TDC and get a reading  fresh motors will 
normally be about .033  in. if it is lower then you might have to use the metal or 
paper crank shim. Then mike three shims to get within .002 to .006 in . set it 
up and check the endplay with the shims in place check for turning also at 
this time . On old motors if the end play is above .055 in then it is time to 
rebuild and line bore and the motor will lock up if you try to get it within the 
limits. After setting the endplay install the o ring and seat the main seal 
all the way in the case. I use a little permatex super 300 on the crank end and 
the part of the flywheel that mates to the crank. Grease the pilot bearing . 
put a small drop of red locktite on the gland nut and torgue it down.  Later 
and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service  Salem Va
