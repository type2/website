Thanks for all the info. Assuming I need to, what specifically did you 
replace the rubber (breather?) connectors with? Is it fuel line, breather 
line, rubber line...how many inches/feet total? When you pop them off, I 
assume fuel is going to come out, so I'd better be prepared to clamp or plug 
the lines while I put new connectors in, correct? I'm trying to get my 
mental picture as complete as possible.
