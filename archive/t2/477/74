Subject: westy outdoor car cover/winter storage? 

Hello list; 

Been a while since I've been on the list, as I've been bus-less for over a
year. I am now the happy owner of a white 74 Westy as of last week. 

But with winter upcoming here in Canada, I won't be driving it until
spring. It has to sit outside in my driveway through the cold and snow, so
I'm thinking I should probably cover it. 

I've seen the covers that CIP sells (Evolution 4 fabric), as well as Bus
Depot (the more expensive "StormShield"), and a few others. Anyone have a
good experience with a cover that will protect my bus from sitting outside
through a long winter, or is it just as good to grease it up and let it
sit uncovered? The covers get pricey and I am wondering how worthwhile
they really are (the StormShield is almost $300 US). Winter storage
suggestions are much appreciated. 

Thanks
