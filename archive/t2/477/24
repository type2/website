Subject: no end play :(

I'm confused.  Well, not really... I guess more annoyed.  Anyways, I
have zero endplay.

I just had my crank and case and other various parts balanced and
machined.  I put everything together paying very close attention to all
the tolerances and specs (I triple checked everything).  Today I put the
case halves together and torqed all the bolts and the crank turns
smoothly.  I then thought I'd check the endplay.

I put the flywheel on the crank and tightened it... wouldn't turn.  So I
took off all the shims and tried it again, still no spin - turns out the
flywheel is rubbing on my No. 1 bearing... what's up with that?  Can I
put shims on the end of the crank?

And I don't think my new No. 1 bearing is fatter than my old No. 1
bearing.  When I held up my old No.1 bearing next to my new No. 1
bearing, they looked the same width.

Any suggestions would be very nice!!

thanks,
Mike
