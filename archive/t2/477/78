Subject: RE: [Type 2] westy outdoor car cover/winter storage?

I have the Bus Depot Stormshield cover - worth every penny (CDN or US) IMHO.
It fits my 71 poptop Westy perfectly.  My "new" paint job looks great even
after 4 or 5 Pennsylvania winters.

I previously had the Wolfsburg West Evolution 4 cover - also a nice cover
but it did not fit my Westy (left the lower 6 inches of the body and the
bumpers uncovered) due to the added height of the poptop. Would have been
fine for a non-poptop bus and in fact I sold it to a friend to use on his
non-poptop Westy.

Use of a cover makes a major difference in keeping the bus clean and greatly
increases the longevity of the paint job.  I use mine all the time when I am
not driving the bus - winter and summer.

I'm not sure what you mean by "grease it up" in lieu of using a cover, but I
have to think that any method of keeping the elments away from your bus will
help to preserve it.

Hello list;

Been a while since I've been on the list, as I've been bus-less for over a
year. I am now the happy owner of a white 74 Westy as of last week.

But with winter upcoming here in Canada, I won't be driving it until
spring. It has to sit outside in my driveway through the cold and snow, so
I'm thinking I should probably cover it.

I've seen the covers that CIP sells (Evolution 4 fabric), as well as Bus
Depot (the more expensive "StormShield"), and a few others. Anyone have a
good experience with a cover that will protect my bus from sitting outside
through a long winter, or is it just as good to grease it up and let it
sit uncovered? The covers get pricey and I am wondering how worthwhile
they really are (the StormShield is almost $300 US). Winter storage
suggestions are much appreciated.

Thanks
Dan Curran
