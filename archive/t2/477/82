Subject: RE: [T2] I've had it up to my fuel filler neck with gas 

I had a nasty fuel smell every time I filled up. I even had it overflow
through the fuel vapor tubes and splash all over the aux battery (I learned
not to try to get to a whole dollar amount anymore). This was because of the
rubber connector between the tubes. If you remove the firewall, you can get to
all the rubber connectors on the top of the tank. The other one is behind the
spare tire. You cannot see it, but you can feel it. Replace all of these and
then look into replacing the charcoal filter and the rubber connecters
associated with it. I replaced all of these and the smell is completely gone.

To remove the firewall I had to remove my carb and the aux fan for the heater.
Once those were gone, I could get the firewall completely out and see the
connections that I had to replace. My firewall had three screws on each side
and two underneath. Once they are loose, it is just a matter of moving it
around at odd angles to get it out. Not bad at all, just took a little
patience.

As for gas smells from 5 feet away, I am not sure if these tubes are your
problems, but you can see the entire tank with the firewall out and get a good
look at the filler tube for a leak.
