Subject: Re: [T2] zero endplay

See, I was trying to rule out that the bearing was getting twisted
(which obviously wasn't the case, nor is it particulary possible). 
However, when you see that there's a high point, it means that the
bearing is getting distorted (which it wasn't), or something else is
goofy.  So what I did was put a bunch of shims so I *knew* that the
bearing was perfectly perpendicular to the flywheel.  Then I put it in
the case with the other half and tightened everything up.  Then after
the case was tightened, I pulled all the shims out and it still was
rubbing (which turned out to be the engine mount washer rubbing on the
flywheel).  Anyways, it was kinda a process of elimination - nothing
particularly fancy.

hehehe, I even tried mounting my dial indicator on the crank, spinning
the crank, and have it measure the bearing surface which turned out to
be true.  

Ultimately, I will install the crank, then both halves, and set end-play
correctly.  I was just trying to figure out what the heck was rubbing. 
Don't worry, I don't just haphazardly put things together.  I definately
go by the book and triple check all specs.  I even read up the night
before in the bentley and muir manuals on the stuff I'm going to do the
next day ;)

I think I have a Wilson manual, too.  I'll check that out.
