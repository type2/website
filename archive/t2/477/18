Err, of course the fuse doesn't matter ... since the ignition switch is 
tapped on the upstream side of the fuse.

In any case... I went out and checked both sides of S8 and S9 with the 
VOM ... no voltage.

Now I'm beginning to wonder if something truly scary like "nut came 
loose and fell off leaving + from battery dangling around underneath 
the bus" has happened.  Or maybe something equally annoying, but a lot 
less scary, like "wire that connects ignition switch to terminal 30 on 
solenoid is dangling around underneath the bus".  (Either way I'm going 
to have to push the damned thing away from the curb to look, grumble.)

Geez, and the loose wire theory might explain the initial "when revved" 
behavior, too.
