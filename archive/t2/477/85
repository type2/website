Subject: re: westy outdoor car cover/winter storage? 

I've used the car covers sold by Rocky Mtn Motorworks (which I believe are
made by Coverking) and I'm not too impressed. I've had several (not on my bus
though) and after about 2 years they start to disintigrate leaving a coat of
fine dust all over everything. They will work for a year or 2 after that but
the dust will get worse and worse until rips in the fabric finally start to
occur.

My personal opinion is that, given the choice, it would be better to cover it
than not cover it. The problem with the bus would be that it would be a 2
person (at least) job to get the cover on and off, especially if there is any
kind of wind.

If you are going to store it, you probably want to consider adding a fuel
preservative to the tank.

Both of my old cars don't get used much in the winter but I try to drive them
around every 2 to 4 weeks just to keep the vital fluids moving and to keep
things from siezing up. I wait for a sunny day when the roads are dry.

Good luck,
Bill Moon
