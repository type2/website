Subject: Captain's Chair

Has anyone modified their front passenger chair to swivel around?  Sure 
would be nice if it could face the rear compartment - I've thought about 
using heavy-duty lazy susan hardware with 1/2 inch safety bolts (when in 
the forward-facing position) - wondering if anyone else has tried it.
