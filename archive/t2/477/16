Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel pump trouble?

I haven't had any more fuel pump trouble since I went through all of my
wiring and inspected all electrical/harness connections (knock on wood)
unplugging and reconnecting all connectors which had been disconnected
during my overhaul.  The fuel filter was clear and everything else has
checked out ok.  Thanks to all who posted assistance and suggestions.  I
will be adding an idiot light low fuel pressure sensor, as well as a fuel
pump power indicator/test button later on when I wire in my oil temp gauge
and properly rout the CHT gauge.  I'll post when done to give an update how
it works out.  Now my rebuilt tranny is acting up...sigh :(

Thanks again,
