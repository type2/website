Mike,

How many shims did you have installed when you checked end float? You should
have had TWO. Then you do the math and find what shim you need to give the
right amount of end float. It is completely possible to have zero end play
with three shims, depending on variables like what size the shims are, what
was done to the engine internals etc.

As an aside, you have to be philosophical about taking the crankcase apart
once it is together. These things happen when building engines. Sometimes it
takes a few tries to get it all perfect. It will probably happen a few more
times before you are done. Once a guy in our local club told me he usually
rebuilds an engine in a weekend. "A weekend?", I said?! I was in disbelief -
"it takes me months", I said. Turns out he wasn't really rebuilding, just
taking off the heads and putting on new rings. You get what you pay for, in
terms of time invested, so don't worry if you have a few false starts, it is
all part of the process.
