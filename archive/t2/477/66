Subject: Distributor Part Number

Hi ALL,

I have a '77 Camper Deluxe, Automatic previously FI and someone threw a 
Progressive Carb on it(really).
My question is "Does anyone out there know the Part # for the original stock 
distributor I want to switch back to FI and I am running on a 009. I would 
like to put it back to original.

Thanks,

Knight Rider
