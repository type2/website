Subject: Berg linkage on Kadrons

Is anyone running the Berg linkage with a pair of Kadrons?  I have 
these pieces but have not run the engine with them.

I just bolted them onto my 1776 on a test stand and I have been 
staring at the assembly for a while. I finally figured out the 
function of the little black "ears" that Berg supplies with the 
linkage. Here are my concerns:

1.  On the right carb, the linkage mounts in such a way that the 
offset rod is nearly vertical when the throttle is closed. On the 
left carb, this is not the case. The rod is maybe twenty degrees off 
the vertical under the same conditions.  Should this be the case?

2. The ball and sockets are very loose. On the single bar linkage 
that I had been using on the Kadrons, the ball snapped into a 
spring-metal socket and this arrangement had no play. The Berg 
ball-in-sockets have lots of play. So much so that I am sure that the 
translation of accelerator cable pull into rotation of the carb 
shafts will not be repeatable.

3.  I would like to mount the ears on the Kadron throttle shafts 
without removing the existing Kadron ears. There is just enough of 
the threaded rod sticking out to allow me to do this. The problem is 
that I can't identify the thread on this shaft.  I tried M8, 1/4-20, 
1/4-28 (No snickers, please. Believe it or not the threads on the 
Berg linkage are 1/4-28).

If anyone is running this combination and can comment on these 
questions, I would much appreciate it.  This linkage was very 
expensive. I hate the thought of reverting to the conventional Kadron 
rod-linkage.
