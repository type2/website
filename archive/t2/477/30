Subject: Re: [T2] no end play :(

So, I (reluctantly) pulled the nicely glued case apart, and with half
the case open, attached the flywheel and had endplay!?!?!  I don't get
it.

I'm wondering if somehow the no. 1 bearing got offset because there was
definately a high point where it was hitting the flywheel.

I dunno.. I guess I'll be doing a trial fitting WITHOUT glue. 
plastigauge would have been handy..

Besides this bearing thingie, this engine is going together
beautifully.  Rimco did a very nice job on the machining.  All the rods
and pistons were balanced to the tenth of an ounce.. not bad!  Tomorrow
I'm bringing my fan and clutch disk to be balanced (forgot to bring 'em
earlier) along with having them rethread my oil cover plate thread..
stripped the little sucker!
