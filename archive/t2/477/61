Well, the seatbelt mounts wouldn't be affected at all, since it's just 
the seat itself that would turn and it is mounted on the metal platform.

You're probably right about the insurance thing - but more accurately 
your insurance company doesn't want you to drive a Type 2 altogether - 
given the front passenger position and the extreme lack of crash 
protection.  Lets face it - getting into a bus in the first place you're 
putting yourself and your "loved ones" in a significantly risky 
environment compared to modern safety standards.
