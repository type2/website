Subject: Drilled for full flow-How to tell??

71 Westy. 1600 DP.  I have records from a P.O. of my
bus showing that there was a complete engine re-build
at one time, including a replacement case (an "AK"
code I believe).  I am really wanting to install an
oil filter on this bus, but I see that the aftermarket
set ups require that the case be "drilled for full
flow".  So, how do I tell is my case has been "drilled
for full flow"??
