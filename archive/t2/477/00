If this was a good quality fire extinguisher, one with
a steel canister or body or whatever you call the main
part of it, it can be checked and recharged by
companies that maintain fire extinguishers.  Costs me
$10 to $20 depending on the kind, and whether it needs
to be pressure checked also.  If it is one of the
cheapy aluminum and plastic ones, then it is
disposable, and you should get a good one next time.

I keep one on the floor between the seats on the 75
bus, and behind the front seat by the spare tire in
the 65 double cab.

Absolutely!! a good CO2 extinguisher. And maybe a
second one, too.
