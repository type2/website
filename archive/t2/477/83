Subject: Installing a swivel Seat (was Re: Captain's Chair)

Hi Adrian,

It seems sometimes that on this list there's a rule: if you can imagine 
it, someone has probably done it.

I wouldn't trust my heinie to a lazy susan. Or the heinie of a loved 
on, either.

During my Westfakia project I installed a swivel base on the passenger 
side of a 79 bus body. You need the swivel base from a 76-or later 
westy, I got mine from a Vanagon westy. This is an easy project, the 
only downside is that the swivel seat pedestal raises the seat by about 
an inch. If you have a tall copilot that might be a problem, but they 
can easily deal with it by tilting the seat back a bit.


Removal:
Slide the seat off the rails, then unbolt the swivel mechanism from the 
pedestal. Mind the grease on the bottom of the swivel base, it will 
leave a mess if  you put that thing down on the carpet. Now use a 
chisel or angle-grinder to carefully trim the swivel base-plate from 
the top of the fenderwell. Make a note of the clean long bead weld used 
to hold this in place. You want yours to look just like it.

Assembly:
Assembly is reverse of removal. Be very careful to make sure you remove 
everything from under the seat pedestal before you start welding, or 
you might start a fire with the welding slag. AMHIK. Take time to make 
sure the swivel base plate is level before you start welding it into 
place. Some trimming and aligning will be required to ensure the base 
plate fits properly between the original rails.  If you weld it in like 
the factory did you will still have the option of removing the swivel 
and re-attaching the seat to the original slider tracks.
