Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Where do you keep your fire extinguisher?

I keep a fat one behind my driver seat by the brake
fluiod reservoir and a skinny one in the the little
"map compartment" on top of the jump seat.  Every 6
months, the YMCA where I work has a company come in
and inspect all the fire extinguishers in our
building. On the day they come, I pull mine out of the
bus and put them on a shelf in my office. The company
inspects them, tags them as good, and then I slip them
back in my bus!
