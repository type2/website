Subject: RE: [T2] I've had it up to my fuel filler neck with gas 

I bought about 2 feet of fuel line. The stuff that needs to be replaced
is part of the fuel vapor recovery system. So no fuel will come out of
the lines when you remove them. They are all on the top side of the gas
tank. Each piece will be about an inch and a half long. I cannot
remember the exact size of the line, but I am sure someone on the list
probably knows.

Once you get the firewall off, you will see everything you need. Richard
Atwell has a nice pic on his website.

Just remember the two screws on the bottom of the firewall.

The charcoal canister also should be replaced or opened and refilled. I
opted to refill it since they are about $50 at the Bud Depot.

If everything is connected and sealed up, you should have no fumes.
Unless the filler tube is bad, but mine was not.
