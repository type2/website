Subject: Re: [T2] I've had it up to my fuel filler neck with gas

That's interesting though. If the inner portion of the neck is ripped, but 
the outer part isn't, then there may not be a lot to be gained in replacing 
it. I looked at mine, saw the torn neck, and figured that was a large 
portion of my fuel smell problem. But - without knowing if the outer neck is 
torn, I don't know if it's contributing to the problem or not. And since I 
don't leak gas when I fill up, there's a chance that it's ok. Interesting. 
I'll have to look more closely at the whole thing.

How far down does the filler pipe go? Could gas in the tank flow out of it 
when I disconnect it? Unlikely, but I thought I'd ask. I've never removed 
the firewall - this is just getting more fun by the minute.

Thanks for the info.
Mat

The bird beak version is NLA. It's only required if your state has a vehicle
inspection system that knows it's supposed to be there. Despite the fact
that unleaded gasoline is no longer available stupid states like CA insist
you have the vehicle in original condition and restrict the entry of
unleaded nozzles in some way.

The hypocrisy is that if you have the bird beak but it's ripped at all you
fail as well.

To replace it you need to pull out the pipe. This means, removing the paint
can lid, the ECU and the firewall to upcouple the pipe from the gas tank and
pull it through the body from the outside.  Learn the orientation of the
filler neck to the pipe and replace it will the new one and feed the pipe
back in.

It's a pain to do it. I'm not sure there's another way because the opening
is so small.

Stickers:

- sticker in the doorjam that says catalyst despite missing a cat on the
exhaust system.

- sticker on the engine lid will say if it's a CA model also.

- remains of catalyst sticker on sun visor

Parts:

- If you have an automatic you'll have a CA ECU and it will be 022 906 021AE
