not turning qualified as zero ;)

Anyways, I think the bearing somehow got set at an angle.  When I put
the case halves together tomorrow or thursday, I'm going to attach the
flywheel w/ extra spacers before tightening the case halves.  that way
the no. 1 bearing will be held at the correct angle.  Then I'll pull off
the extra spacers and set the endplay.
