It would be nice if that was true, but alas I don't beleive so. Considering
the age of our vehicles, VW is exempt from legal requirements to supply
parts, and as far as I know there is no law which compels them to allow
others to do so. It can be argued that this is a stupid business decision,
and unfair, and unreasonable, etc, etc. But not illegal.

I don't know about Andy Warhol but I do know that filmmakers are constantly
having to get permission to use certain products in their movies. remember
the movie 'Christine"? The car was a Plymouth Fury, but the front end loader
that destroyed it was an 'ATERPILLAR'. Sometimes companies don't want their
product associated with the theme of the movie.

Anyhow, since this no longer even resembles bus content, I'll shut up.
