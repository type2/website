I agree with everything John had to say on this topic.  If I decide to sell 
a drawing or painting of my VW, do I need to remove the logo?  At what point 
are we just corporate stooges?  These vehicles, and their corresponding 
logos are part of our everyday lives.  When did we agree to sell a piece of 
those lives to VWoA?
