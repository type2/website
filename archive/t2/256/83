Subject: VW Bus - Karma

(I had to look up the word 'karma' - Informal. A distinctive aura, 
atmosphere, or feeling: There's bad karma around the house today.)

Did I pick the right word??

Last night I replaced the ignition switch (electrical section) for the 
second time since I've partnered with the '78 Westy.  It wasn't as bad as I 
feared.  In fact, I really took my time and went through all the steps.

I pulled the horn button off with my finger nails.  I did not want to chip 
it with some careless use of a metal straight edge.

The nut and wheel came off without a snag.  I will use the whiteout marks I 
previously made on the steering wheel and the steering column shaft to align 
things up later.

After I took the four long shaft screws out of the lever assembly, I put 
them in the up turned horn button on the passenger seat.  They seemed to 
like that.

The 10mm bolt was not happy to be bothered.  I used a box end wrench to 
twist it out a 1/4 turn at a time.  Later in the process, I sprayed the 
threads with Kroil, and wire brushed it, gently of course, while I held the 
10mm bolt with my 7" needle nose vice grips. (Now, little needle nose vice 
grips, aren't you glad that I found where you were hiding for the past 
week...  You are appreciated, and you have value beyond your imagination.)

When it was time for the 10mm bolt to go back in its hole, it went happily 
and smoothly and comfortably.  Perhaps it felt more comfortable in its place 
than out in the light.  (What!! No 'thank you' for cleaning your threads so 
nicely.  The wire brush and the 7" needle nose pliers and the Kroil would be 
slighted if they had any idea that you were ungrateful.)

Windshield wiper hoses.  You really DO exist!!  OK, some day I will 
pressurize the H2O bottle and let some liquid flow thru you and you can say 
that you also contributed.

Almost done. There will be celebration tonight, with cake and candles and 
song, but not for you all, the little pieces that make up the whole of the 
'78 Westy.

This celebration will be in honor of a birthday, just recently passed by and 
neglected because of an immediate need of attention and love for another 
family, another friend.

Perhaps I did pick the wrong word...

How about 'psychosis' (n : any severe mental disorder in which contact with 
reality is lost or highly distorted)
