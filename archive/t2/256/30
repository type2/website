Subject: RE: VWoA ans Trademark Troubles

I want to say thanks to Dave for stating some common sense in regards to 
this topic.  

I have a friend in the surf industry here on Maui that have suffered 
financially because copy right violations.  I feel what is right for the 
little guy, the surf shop on Maui, is good for the big guy, VWoA.

If you don't like a company's business practices or actions than you 
don't have to support them.  Canceling you car/van order is a tad 
extreme to me but I do respect your right to spend your money as you see 
fit.
