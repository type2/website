Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Dummy light acting up

This happened once on a Vanagon I used to own. It seems that the wire coming
from the oil pressure sender had fallen across an exhaust pipe and started to
melt the sheath cover on the wire, when I hit a bump, or big turn, the wire
moved enough so that the wire was moved into contact with the metal pipe,
causing it to ground and making the dash light come on.  I hope yours is this
simple.
Peace, John Baker
