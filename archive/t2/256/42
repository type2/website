I'm the '71 camper back with another question or two.  How can I tell if =
my calipers are stock '71 or upgraded to the '73-'79 size?  I also have =
a '73 Transporter part/possible project sitting at Dad's.  The easy =
answer would be to compare the two.  Problem is that this '73 is 2 hours =
away and I barely have enough time to spit when I visit.  Could someone =
tell me how to check my '71 and give me a quick breakdown... err, =
uhhh... HOW-TO (no breakdowns, please!  We all have enough of these =
already!) on how to do the switch.  I can't afford any manuals right now =
and the library only has two copies.  One was stolen and I've had the =
other on hold for weeks.

Have a good one,
Eric=20
