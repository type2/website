OK. I see where you're going...

Let's say I buy a used VW at a swap (complete with VW logo on the hood). I 
put KYB (tm) shocks, a Porsche (tm) Flat-6, a CB Performance (tm) FI Turbo, 
BYF (tm) front disks, WCM (tm) "California" rubber, and a Gene Berg (tm) 
shifter on it. Am I allowed to sell this car?

A reasonable person would expect for a clock to be installed in it.
