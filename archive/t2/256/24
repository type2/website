Subject: <sigh> Gas cap needed

Well, Lisa successfully got Bleu, the '77 Riviera, from N.E. Oregon to 
Borrego Springs, California avoiding disaster until her last stop. 
Disaster struck home then when she found that she'd lost the perfect 
stock, non-locking gas cap. So... knowing how rare they are, I turn, 
once again, to my friends for help.

Anybody got a spare, stock, non-locking gas cap to fit a '77? part

I got Paypal, need gas cap. (Sniff... I was really proud of that gas cap...)
