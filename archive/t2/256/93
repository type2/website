The older style backing plate is much larger, almost 13".  The '73+ are
about 2" smaller diameter.

Piston diameters are identical.  It is difficult to identify comparing the
calipers, even if side by side.

The piston lengths are different.  The older are 29mm and the newer are 33mm

Spindles are the same for each.

Rotors differ and can be difficult to differentiate, especially worn rotors.

The steering knuckles are different and are difficult to differentiate.

Let me know if you have more questions.
