[...]

the difference to me is:

the used VW was designed (possibly) to have a clock installed in it and VW 
expected a clock to possibly be installed in it at some point.  A 
reasonable person would expect for a clock to be installed in it.

The hubcap, however, was designed to cover up a wheel and not contain a 
clock.  By placing a clock in the hubcap, you have captured potential 
creativity and profitablity that VW failed to foresee or to capture.  greg
