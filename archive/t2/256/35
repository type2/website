Subject: Exterior door mirror question

Has anyone ever replaced the mirror in the door mirror of a late baywindow? 
I'm not talking about the chrome mirrors but the black plastic mirror.

I broke mine a day or two ago. I'm wondering if there is a method to remove 
the old glass and install a new one or if at the factory the edge was 
molded to hold the mirror AFTER the glass was inserted.

Any list expertise here?
