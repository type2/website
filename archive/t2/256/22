thanks, i was thinking the same thing. i never intend to make money on
it, although i had hoped to make kids' shirts a few years ago cuz there
just arent enough available... but that was when i first started hearing
about this whole mess and decided against it. the tire cover, however, i
am making for my own personal use, so i dont see a problem with it.

thanks again, and i agree with reasonable actions, but they do seem a bit
overboard at times,
