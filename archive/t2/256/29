This is a classic symptom of a plugged idle cutoff solenoid/jet.  Pull the one out of the right carb and see if there is debris clogging up the little holes in the end.

If not reinstall, start the engine and pull the wire off of the solenoid - does the idle drop? (My guess - no)  Slowly begin to unscrew the solenoid with the engine running - does the idle pick up for an instant?  If so, the solenoid is not functioning and it is either a clog or an electrical problem.
