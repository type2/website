OK, OK... I think I have it..
How about, "Volks-Motorwerks"?
Picture a circle, transected from top to bottom with a long "V", then the
outer "legs" of a letter "M" coming straight down from the top, but maybe a
little bit to the inside, so that it doesn't just look like a big letter
"M"? Can we do something with this one? It would look enough like the VW
logo to p!$$ them off, but not enough legally for them to do anything about.
I'm afraid that just by flipping the logo, they can still say it is their
logo, just upside down.
