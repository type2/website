Subject: VW Trademarks

I am just a lurker on this list, but I really have to ask myself, what have 
you people been smoking?  Do you really think VW ought to let you have their 
stuff for free?  What is this thing with going on about VW not supporting 
these vehicles?  They are darn old and 90-some percent of them that were 
made are gone. Get real!  This is the best supported old vehicle around.  
And back to the trademarks, anybody with half a lick of sense knows that you 
don't get to use some trademark without consent.  Whether you are a little 
guy or another big corporation doesn't matter.  There has been a flood of 
junky items from China and elsewhere bearing logos of carmakers.  They don't 
want their logos on this stuff and I don't blame them.  The day you adopted 
a big corporation's products as something more (spiritual or something) than 
just a big corporation's products was the day you set yourself up for this 
disappointment.  It isn't VW's fault.  FLOYD
