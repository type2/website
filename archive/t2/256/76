Back when I had a commute I drove my bus every day, 70 miles total.
Nothing special about maintainance except that those 2000 miles oil
changes came along very often!  If you have to drive on very fast freeways
or hilly routes you might not be happy with a bus for commuting.

Bring along six friends and you will have the coolest vanpool at your job!
