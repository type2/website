None, and you are completely in the right in both cases.

However, VW has lawyers whose job it is to ruin you financially if you
don't do what they want you to do, right or wrong.  They know that the
typical individual doesn't have the wherewithal to fight them in court, so
they don't pay much attention to the ethics of the situation.  The one
with the most money wins.

As in a collision between a Beetle and a semi, you can be completely in
the right and still end up dead.
