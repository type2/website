LOL!!! Thanks I needed a good laugh after my crappy day,,,, =)

But seriously, That kind of mileage a day is no problem. I am a
subcontractor and usually put a minimum of 100 miles a day on my 65
singlecab. I have put up to 250 a day before.

Just make sure all the mechanical maintenance is done and is in proper
working order before you attempt such a feat.
