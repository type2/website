Subject: VW parts yard in Petersburg, VA???

a friend told me he heard a rumor about a VW parts/salvage yard
in Petersburg, VA with over 250 buses, bugs, etc.

however, he did not catch the name of the place.

can anyone confirm its existence & might happen to know the
name/phone # of the place?

TIA,

Joel
