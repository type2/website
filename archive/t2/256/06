Subject: re: Seats

I'm hearing a lot of different seats mentioned as possible substitutes for
original. I have a '70 westy - I need new ones but don't want to spend a lot
of time modifying, cutting, shaping, anything the seats to fit. Are there
any recommended easy fits other than the stock ones? Is there some sort of
"standard" rail size that works for my bus?
