Subject: Electrical checks

In the Bently for an air cooled Cal. Edition (Hall sender) it boldy
states (Pg 28.8) Do not connect any test instrument on terminal 15 (+) of
igniton coil, this could damage electronic parts."

Then 28.10 has resistance checks between terminals 1 + 15 (+ & - ) on the
coil.  OK, well it says to disconnect all wires so it makes sense that
you would not damage any "eceltronic" items.  BUT then on page28.14, it
instructs yu to take a volt reading to terminal 15 with everthing hooked
up to the coil - what gives??  

Will I damage the said "Electronic parts" if I take the volt reading per
the hall control check on page 28.14 - is it OK since the idle stabilizer
is disconnected?

Please p-mail, I in lurking mode.
