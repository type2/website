Subject: VW for daily commute

Kelly,
	I have owned my bus since early '98.  Since then, it has been my
only car, first car, and thus...my daily driver. Yes I have had issues
with mine but none of them were from the commute that I had, just the
way that I drove the commute  :)  I used to drive from my house (Nebo,
NC) to Asheville, NC everyday to go to work.  That's a commute of about
100 miles per day which included going over Black Mt. (A pass that takes
15-20 minutes in 3 gear).  I did this right after I drove cross country
from California.  And I did all this before I ever even opened my engine
bay to look at the motor.  So with that in mind, if you keep an eye on
the engine and show her some love, you will be fine with a 25 mile
commute.  Good luck on getting your bus this weekend.

I am nervous because I have a pretty long commute (25 miles each way).
Is it obnoxiously stupid for me to consider using a bus in this way?
Does anyone do this?  Is there any special maintenance considerations?

Thanks!

Kelly
