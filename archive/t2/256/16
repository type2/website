Subject: Horn

According to the Sermons of Bob Hoover, I should be able to run a new ground
wire through the steering column in less than 15 minutes.
I can't.
Has anyone been successful in this?  I do not find where the wire exits from
the column around the steering box.

I did run a ground to the horn button and "Beep-Beep"  Anyone suggest how to
by-pass the column?

This is a 71 if it matters.

TIA
