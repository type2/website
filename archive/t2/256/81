You bus will love a 25 mile commute. Just watch your speed. You can't go 80 
mph everywhere but you can go about 60 mph forever!!!

Keep on top of and in front of the maintenance. Your bus probably had a 
crummy PO that neglected 92 different things. With the right care an old VW 
can go anywhere.

You might consider a scooter or small moto-bike for a fall back vehicle.
