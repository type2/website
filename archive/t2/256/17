Subject: VANFEST - a small gathering of VW Transporters

Hi all,

VANFEST the show put on by the VW Type 2 Owners Club was on last weekend,
and I've now got the event website updated, so if you want to know what a VW
Transporter Show looks like in the UK then point your browser at
www.vanfest.org

Simply VANTASTIC!

Best wishes
