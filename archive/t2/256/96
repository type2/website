I do a daily commute of 10 miles each way in my bus.....on a normal day. On
other days, or weeks, I commute 50 miles each way to our other plant. No
troubles at all. Just keep in mind that putting 50 miles a day on your bus
will accelerate the maintenance schedule and, if anything, make regular
maintenance even more important.

Go for it.
