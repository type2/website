Be sure to call Allstate back and share the good news with them. Might 
ought to get in touch with the complaint department too so the info gets to 
the top.

Let my Nationwide expire in 1996 to switch agents from SE TN to Mid-TN per 
agent's instructions.

24 hours later tried to open my account with a new agent here and was told 
that b/c I did not have any insurance I would have to be in the high risk 
group for a period of time. I explained that I was a 10 year customer with 
no speeding tickets, no accidents, no hits on my record at all. She 
wouldn't change her mind.

Told her to keep her stinking policy and went with State Farm who my then 
new bride's family had been using for years. Got the married discount, her 
discount as a long time customer, other discounts, etc.

Made the price quite nice compared to the Nationwide policy. There may be 
cheaper policies out there - I have not looked - but I have not shopped for 
one.

I think our success and failure with an insurance company has alot to do 
with the competence of the agent.
