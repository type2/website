It comes out the bottom of the steering column, through the coupling disk,
and grounds under one of the bolt heads of the coupling flange.  Now, I
just don't know WHY Bentley couldn't include this in the steering column
assembly diagram.  8o|

The wire that would lead to the horn connects to a male connector on the
end of the column tube.

I just did this to get mine on the road.  You need to attach a momentary switch
somewhere--mine is clamped to the column tube.  One side goes to ground, the
other to the non-hot side of the horn.
