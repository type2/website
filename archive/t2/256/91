Subject: Tune Up Time:   Plug for Cylinder #2  (Arrrgh!)

Hi Folks:

This morning I took a 1/2 vacation day to tune up the 78 Westy in 
preparation for getting it smogged and registered.   Plugs one and 3 
went in like a charm.   THEN CAME #2!   Apparently the little round 
hole in the engine compartment floor does not line up with the plug.

Laying on the open Z-Bed my head stuck in the open engine hatch 
(thank G-D my Westy had one!)  I painfully removed the oily plug 
which looked like it had been in there 10 years or more.  (It was an 
old clogged Bosch, the others were newish NGK's).  It took 1/2 an 
hour reaching around the FI unit and dislodging vacuum hoses, an old 
squirrel's nest and some other creatures.

Anybody have any tricks for getting the plug back in in a case like 
this?  My thought tonight after work was to try to go in underneath 
after removing the right rear tire and jacking the car.   Muir had no 
wisdom in the book, nor did Mr. Bentley.

All ideas greatly appreciated!

BEN  (knuckles scraped  but still game!)
