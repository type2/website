Good day gentlemen's

Thanks to Steve Dolan, i think i have fix my timing. (Not perfect but
fine)

I still have a problem at idle when cold, the van starts fine but I have
to keep my feet on the gas pedal to maintain idle, other wise it stall.
I also have a strong fuel smell (exhaust) until the van gets warm.
Chokes are working!!!!!

If you could please take a look at the following URL, there is a few
shots of my setting (carbs, timing, vacuum..), if you see something
wrong of you have suggestion I would appreciate a lot.
