Subject: '79 Vs. '81

I'm interested in finding out what are the differences between a stock '79
FI engine and a stock '81 FI engine.  I own a '79 bus and know of an '81
engine for sale, but upon inspection the '81 "just looks different".  I
know the '79 has the one year only square exhaust ports but what else is
different?

TIA,
Bill
