Subject: firing order

firing order is 1-4-3-2 right (it says right on the gen. stand)
so the spark plug wires go on the dizzy in this order? if i put mine 1-2-3-4 
it starts and runs but no power(see previous post) if i leave the timing the 
same (5 1/2 deg. btdc) and move the wires to the correct 1-4-3-2 order it 
wont start and backfires thru carb. i know these are stupid ?'s but i have 
been fooling with this new motor for a week and i am becoming a little 
frustrated. any hints?
