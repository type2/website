Subject: Need a couple of part #'s, please.

Hi:

I wonder if anybody knows the part numbers and/or availability of the
following parts for an air-cooled transmission:

1)The boot or bellows that covers the guide pin/rear shift rod junction

 2)The boot or bellows that goes between the relay lever and selector
     shaft.

TIA.
