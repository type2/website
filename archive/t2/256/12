I like this one best of all! The "Whatwagen"! It sort of resembles the
symbol that Prince used before he coined the name "The Artist Formerly Known
As Prince". (Yes, we are back to that again, and I think it was the
"artist", rather than the "entertainer").
It does imply that we are having an identity crisis, and that pretty well
sums it up. It's almost like we're being disowned by the VW family..
Disinherited by their lawyers.
