yes but you have to start in the right place.

then when it is running hook up a timing light and set it correctly, you
really can not get it set statically I don't care what Muir says.

find top dead center of cyl #1 manually.  (take out spark plug and remove
valve cover, get the TDC by feeling into the spark plug hole with a small
piece of wood dowel while turning the crank by hand until you feel it at
the top, check the valves and see that both are closed. if one or both are 
open then you are 360 degrees out.)   

when you are at top dead center on #1, rotate the dist until the rotor
lines up with the #1 plug wire.  then put the rest on clockwise 4-3-2 and
you should have em right.  put valve cover back on, and spark plug back in
and try starting it.

if you still have no power I would look elsewhere for the problem

good luck
