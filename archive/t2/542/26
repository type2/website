I just got back from Kelley Park and did take a set of pictures of all the type2's in the line-up.
It did sprinkle a little but seenmed fine, ebven though it was chilly for Northern California at this time of year.
Everythijng seemed to be much smoother this year.

Yesterday I went to BYOB at the red barn just south of Gilroy and habve a neat video of the rain coming back following Roger Nang's singlecab. It did not rain during the event.

I will practice a bit more on my local site before I post videos, but here are the pics of KP.
