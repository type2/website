Subject: Size and pitch of shifter threads for '76 Bus

Hi folks...

I picked up a 2-bend shifter extension at the Kelly Park swap meet 
today.  The fellow said it was for a late model Bus, and it looks like 
it should fit my shifter, but there are a few threads at the bottom 
that are kind of chewed up (it's an aluminum piece) and so it won't 
quite thread on.

I'd like put a tap in there to clean the threads up, but I'm not sure 
of the size.  Anybody know?

Thanks!
