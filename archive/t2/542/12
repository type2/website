Subject: RE: [T2] new van

1974 westie with pop top
double bed up top
deluxe interior with dual fridge (and orginal icecube trays)
stove, sink etc etc.
Cool extenda table, matching stool, jump seat in between
2 front seats (no seatbelt.. a holder and garbage can ;)
It has a extendable power cable out.. propane tank built
on for fridge and stove.. not sure about heat. Bike rack
on the back which also serves to easily lock the engine
compartment and comes off in 10 secs or so.

It looks like someone took the heater boxes out. silly person.
It's orange.. really orange.
Im not sure what the original motor was but someone put a
2liter fuel injected motor into it. Runs good.
Comes with mosquito netting for back, kids cot in front, side tent
all canvas is mint and I believe 28,000 original miles on the van
itself. Hardly any rust (I did find some since I was looking so darn
hard).
Compression test was 120 120 125 and 115. Vacumn readings
were 15 and over. Followed the muir's guide for prebuyer inspection
to a T and it doesn't overheat etc etc. The front end is SOOOO
Tight its a joy. Bad points, the mirrors need to be replaced (drivers)
and the sliding door latch doesn't release easily if you don't have the
door pulled in 100% before hand. Just need to grease the slider up
a bit so it clicks in. I need to check the heat available.

I feel a little attached to my yellow one for cool factor but .. hmm
no, I can't keep both lol. I will take some of the goodies off the duck
and put them on the new one. Maybe the heater too.

Year?
