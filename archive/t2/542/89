Subject: Re: [T2] timing the SVDA

Hmm... I'd still be very interested in hearing the reasoning behind 
this.  If an engine is not meant to advance too far due to mechanical 
limits, timing according to a distributor model could be catastrophic to 
that engine.

Now, timing an engine according to the distributor that was used for 
that model year makes total sense... but again, you're still timing 
according to the engine, not the distributor.
