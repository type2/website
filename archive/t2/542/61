Subject: '68 parts bus

I'm in the process of parting out a 1968 Westy.  I've 
noticed several one year only things on this bus.  If 
anyone need anything drop me a line.  The front glass, 
drivers seat, westy kit and front dash (all gauges and 
electric stuff), have been sold or spoken for.

Thanks,
mjr
