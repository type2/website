Subject: Re: [T2] new van

Rather than screwing around with the current gear box--if it is cooked--

This is the way to fly--with a later model automatic--which are almost
bullet proof--

Good advise Bob--

If this was me however--goofy as I am--and a stickler for stock--

I , myself, me-- would rebuild the original unit--

Don't go asking why--

It's just because---:>)


Take Care--
