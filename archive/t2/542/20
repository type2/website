Go down in front on the right hand side of the engine--
Groap around a bit, and you'll find a 1"--3/4" hose that hooks the
vacuum to the trans.
If this one is at all shaky, loose or leaking--the trans won't shift
properly.

No reverse?

The trans is cooked.

The vacuum hose is for the shift points only---not actuation.

The vacuum does not control selection, just when it is supposed to
shift,
