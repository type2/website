Subject: electrical soution?

Thanks for the tips, i know you are right... Now that i think about it, when 
i put everything back together, i forgot to hook up that wire all together, 
and i noticed it later so i hooked it up...To the wrong side of course:) and 
that is when the reverse problem started. I am sooo smart...lol Thanks again 
for the support. I love VW owners.

Thanks a million,
Alex
