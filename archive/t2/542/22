Subject: Re: [T2] Stripped Spark Plug Hole on 1.8

I too have stripped one of my spark plug holes in the past. To say the 
least I was a bit upset at myself for removing the plug while the engine 
was still somewhat warm. I was going to preform a compression test.

The good news is you can rent a repair tool from www.aircooled.net

I can't praise this tool enough, its the cats pajamas. The repair is 
very professional. I'd suggest if you have a junk cylinder head to try
this tool out on that before you give it a go on your good one. It helps 
to understand how it works by doing a trail run and your only out a buck 
or two for the extra insert. I took my engine out to do the repair. Once 
the engine is removed take off any items that obstruct removal of the 
tin above over cylinders #3 & #4. Removing the cylinder head would be 
the safest route then but I did not do that. I asked John at 
aircooled.net if their was another route and he suggested that I might 
get by with hooking a vacuum up in reverse and placing the blow tube 
into the exhaust outlet. Be sure to turn the engine over so the exhaust 
valve is open and air is blowing out of the #3 spark plug whole. Then 
with the vacuum in reverse follow the instructions that came with the 
tool. When I was finish I checked the inside of the cylinder i'd 
repaired for any metal files. Using a magnet I was able to remove the 
few that didn't get blow out. It has been 14,000 miles since i did the 
repair and the insert is holding just fine, knock on wood.
