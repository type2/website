Subject: Gauge Cluster- Swap 73' for 74' need diagram

Hey Everyone,

I am trying to swap a nice '73 gauge cluster for my poor '74 original unit.
After removing my '74 pod and placing the nice '73 up to the dash, I noticed
the back was completely different... I'm sure it will work, however it's going
to be a nightmare trying to find which wires go where.  I need a detailed
diagram of my '74 wires and a diagram of the '73 gauge cluster. Anyone know
where I could find these on the internet?

Thanks,

Tom
