Subject: Last chance for VW Buses Bands Brews Tshirt pre-order

Hey Y'all,
This is your LAST CHANCE to pre-order your official
BBB04 Event t-shirt. I will take pre-orders until
Wednesday April 21 at 4:00 pm. Remember I will only
have a few extras at the show, plus pre-order price is
CHEAPER than day of the show price. Heres a link with
a picture of the graphic and ordering instructions:
