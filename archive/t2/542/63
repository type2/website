Subject: accessory plug

A local man (John Levin) purchased Bruce Braun's Kubel a 
couple years ago.  He stopped by the house yesterday 
looking for an accessory plug in which to plug in some 
Germany military accessory.  Mike Larson at Vee Village in 
Kansas City, Missouri, told him that an accessory plug out 
of a late bay window westy would work.  Sure enough the 
accessory plug under the glove box of the 1979 foster Westy 
had the plug and it fit.  As the '79 is a foster bus and 
will be returned to its righful owner, upon his return from 
the Peace Corp, John is still looking for a plug.

I told him I would snoop around and see what I could come 
up with.  If you have one and would consider the notion of 
sale, drop me a line.  I'm authorized so spend $25 plus 
shipping.  Anything over that price, I'll need to check 
with John first.

Thanks,
