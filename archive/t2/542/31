Bob,

Yea---it's a shot in the dark alright---

I'd venture to say that 10 times outa 10, if the trans isn't operating
--or moving the 73 to 75 Bus at all in any given gear--I'd totally
discount the chances of the vacuum line leaking--

That line only puts vacuum to the vacuum unit to tell the trans when to
shift.

I would suspect suspect either the reverse / 1st gear band is either
outa adjustment, burnt--or shot.

I'd be more apt to start there rather than screwing around with the
shift vacuum actuator--or the lines to it--

Just putting you nose to the fluid would be the best starting point--

Take Care,

            ______________
