Oops had a memory hick-up, I'd remembered using a magnet but i forgot 
that it didn't work :) doh. What I did use was the vacuum again. Here is 
what I did. First I attached a bendable drinking straw to the vacuum 
tube using duct tape to seal the tube to the straw. With the vacuum tube 
stuck into the vacuum "suck" port :) i stuck the straw down into the 
spark plug hole and vacuumed away till it was all clean. I also vaguely 
remember using the eraser on the end of pencil too, that and a flexible 
metal rod with some tape to help clean anything the vacuum missed.
Hope that helps

Alex
