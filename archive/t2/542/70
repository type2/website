Subject: Re: [T2] total mechanical advance question

Interesting.  Jake Raby recommends no more than 28 mech and hitting 40 
then backing off with vaccuum.  Yesterday I was testing mech advance and 
with my idle set at 8btdc, I was getting over 32 (mech)!  I had to drop 
my idle advance to 2btdc to keep it at 28 (mech).  It would seem that my 
springs are a bit loose!

I might throw in another distribor and see what kinda results that yields.
