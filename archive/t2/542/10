Subject: Recovered van

To everyone on this list:

Two weeks ago, I reported that my 72 Campmobile had been stolen from my
driveway in Milwaukie, Oregon.  The expressions of concern and offers of
assistance were immediate and overwhelming.  I am more than pleased to report
that local law enforcement recovered my van today, intact, with the exception
of the contents.  My sincerest thanks to everyone who contacted me directly -
it definitely lends credibility to what is already known all over the world:
VW people are special in all the right ways.

Thank you again.
