Subject: Re: [T2] timing the SVDA

Hey Paul,
I believe the only difference between your 009 and your new distributor 
is the vacuum advance and mech timing curve (aircooled specs a different 
curve).  Having said that, it still shouldn't affect your idle because 
neither advance is being used.  You might want to try it without the 
vacuum line because that will make it run like an 009.

I would also check to make sure that all of your spark plug cables are 
hooked up correctly.  Sounds stupid, but who knows.  You might also want 
to compare the new distributor to your old one and make sure that when 
the rotors are facing the same direction, the drive cogs are in the same 
orientation.

How much stuff did you change out?  Is it a new carb, too?  Try putting 
the 009 back in and tune the carbs so it runs fine.  Then drop the new 
distributor in and give it a try again.  It sounds like you're changing 
alot of different things...
