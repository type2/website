An insert is certainly a good idea (a solid insert, not a helicoil!).  A
pro might be able to install one without dropping the engine, but I doubt
that us mere mortals could do so.

I think that the danger of shavings is overemphasized.  They're made of
aluminum and aren't likely to score the cylinder.  If you really want to
make sure that shavings come out, what you do is feed a few feet of
lightly greased cloth strip into the cylinder through the spark plug hole
before you create the shavings.  After the insert is in, you reach through
the spark plug hole with needle-nose pliers and pull the strip out.  All
the shavings should come out with it
