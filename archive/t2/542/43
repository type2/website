Subject: Re burnt auto trans and new bus

I have it at the shop.
They have a lot of auto tranny parts and such for this bus
so it should get started monday and be done shortly after he said.

He's going to call and tell me whats wrong first. He said worst case
scenario $1000 canadian but shouldn't be over since he's got a lot
of the stuff around.

(I did check the autotranny fluid.. clean and not burnt smelling (I know
someone asked how it was earlier) And the last owner didn't have it
changed.. it's been sitting for a while.)

I'm ok with that. Hopefully it's something simple but it's going
to get done regardless.

I spent the day making fixtures for the yellow bus of mine. A nice
cabinent and a rear unit. I will take some pictures of it.  Kinda had
a lot of good moments in it.. hard to see it go.  Maybe I should start
a stable? (not a realistic thought)

Thanks for the input and I will keep you updated on it's status.

At one time, I had a 69 VW Fastback with auto trans. Third and reverse were
slipping and it was fried. I think there's a clutch pack for those 2 speeds,
and they do burn out.
