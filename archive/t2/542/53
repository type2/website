Subject: electrical update

This is alex again...
I have the 1970 Campmobile, and i have a electrical update.  She starts up 
now with no problem, but when i put her into reverse, she dies instantly.  
Then won't restart, (dead battery) for about an hour afterward. I think i 
have a short in the circuit that includes the reverse lights?? I am going to 
try troubleshooting the electrical system today after work.

Thank you

Alex
