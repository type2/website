How about the entire exterior of my 1971 Westy.  :)

I will say that a spray or roller job does much better than a brush but the
way this stuff levels out and sets up super hard, it really just depends on
what you want your finish to be like.

With that last link, it shows some work that was done with MasterSeries on a
VW chassis and such.  I saw on the discussion boards on
TheSamba.com<http://www.thesamba.com/> that the retailer of from this website,
Chuck Pisconski, is really into VWs.  Of course, with his email address being
vwsplitman(-at-)sbcglobal.net<mailto:vwsplitman(-at-)sbcglobal.net> that isn't
surprising.

Actually, I got into using it about 15 years ago when I was really into
Chevy's.  A local classic Cheverolet parts dealer and street rodder in the
area got me hooked when he "took me under his wing" and was teaching me a good
bit while I hung out and helped out in his shop while he was doing many of his
restoration jobs.  I have seen it do wonders.  But, with all things, it is
what you get use to and you like.

I think this is actually the "official" MasterSeries web site.  At that site
is more info, pictures, etc... about the product including their High Heat
Ceramic Coating which I have used, in the past, on my Chevy exhaust manifolds.
I haven't tried on my VW stuff yet.

If you need any more info just let me know.
