Subject: Rivets holding inner panel of rear air intakes

Has anyone removed the rivets holding the panel on the inside to fix 
rust and paint inside the intakes?

I have some rust on the outside of the panel as well as the inside of 
the intake I'd like to take care of.

What is the best way to drill out the rivets and then replace them with 
something that looks good?

Thanks,

Stephen
