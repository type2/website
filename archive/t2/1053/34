Subject: Engine Compartment Seal

In preparation for winter, I am trying to get a few nickle and dime things
done with The Hornet. When I repaired exhaust system, I had to remove the
engine compartment seal foam to get the tins out. It was greasy and nasty
anyway, so I was happy to see it go. Now that I am looking to "replace" the
crappy stuff I discarded several months ago, I wanted to find out what
options I have for a DIY fix? My wonderful wife of 3 years and I are in the
process of getting divorced (her decision not mine), so money is my main
concern. I know that BD has the OEM German stuff for $50, but I guess I am
just not sure what makes the OEM stuff different and what others have done
on the cheap that have netted them similar results. If I have to get the BD
stuff, I will. I just want to know what my options are?

TIA,
