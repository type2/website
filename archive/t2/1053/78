Subject: Turnkey engines

Ok,  Here's another question for the experts!?  I'm putting my 68 double cab
back together from a complete disassembly (the way I bought it) and the engine
was in pieces, with no heads and missing some other items.  The cases are shot
so I decided to purchase a stock 1600 DP turnkey engine.

My question is what company would you suggest?  I have heard some and read
about some crap being sold out there.  What company is the best?  Any help
would be appreciated.  Thanks
