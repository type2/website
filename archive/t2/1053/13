Subject: por-15 "feedback" - anyone?

Hello to you all,

It took me a lot of time and effort to sand blast my 68 bus "chassis":

(part of the process -

Now it's clean and ready to be painted and I was planning to use Metal Ready
and Por-15.
Is there anyone in this list, with a real feedback on these products?

Thank you,
Joao.
