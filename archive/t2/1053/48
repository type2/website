Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Compartment Seal

And if you can't wait for NuVintage or don't care for the hot-water pipe
insulation (I've gotta try that myself someday), I have a few in my personal
stash for $40 (Priority Mail included).  German OEM/Genuine just like BD's.
I keep a few spares around for my 411/412 projects (yeah, I know, "lost
causes") - they take the same seal.

Paypal accepted. (ID jim96003(-at-)earthlink.net )

Lemme know if I can help :-)
