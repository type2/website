Hiya  Mark,

Oh yeah!  I went with Mark's procedure for drilling and  tappig the hub of 
the steering wheel.  I have a Harbor Freight  puller.  I merely thread a couple 
of bolts throgh the puller and into the  hub.  Snug everything up and apply 
some tension to the puller.  That  wheel comes off very nicely, thank you.  None 
of that grunting,  hammering, breaking, and swearing.  The only way to  go!

Mike
