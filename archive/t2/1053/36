Subject: Diaper Commercial

I'm really sorry if this has come up several times before, but I was wondering if anyone happened to notice the diaper commerical (Huggies I think?) that's been on some channels the past couple of weeks. It's all cartoon, but it shows a bunch of babies cruising around in a Volkswagen Bust driving through rainbows and daisy's and it's playing that song that Nirvana remade (Come on people now, smile on your brother, everybody get together right now...). Sorry, I was born in 78, so I grew up in the late 80s / 90s so... hah... I dunno... Simon and Garfunkle ?

Anyway, don't know if anyone here has seen it, but it's pretty cool. Definitely makes me want to buy their diapers (even if I can't remember the brand). Although, my wife is pregnant and we were thinking of going with a diaper service... (so I don't add to the land fill...)
