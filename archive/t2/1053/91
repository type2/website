	This would be for sure, Stranders.
	However, in judging whether an alien alternator will do for 
your bus, remember that your VW motor peaks around 4 - 5000 rpm, 
whereas many modern motors rev to 6000 rpm or more.
	Then one has to factor in the step-up ratio, crank 
pulley/alternator pulley.  I believe that ratio has typically been 
2:1 in Pommie vehicles; I don't know the range of step-up ratios 
emanating from the mystic Orient & copyists.  But my guess is that 
most AC-Delco alternators made this past couple decades have been 
spec'd for >9000 rpm.
	The electrical output will be more affected at low revs than 
high  -  ability/failure to charge at fast idle is, I suppose, more 
likely to be affected by running an AC-Delco or other foreign 
alternator than any tendency to burst, or to develop more current, at 
your reak pevs which I assume won't exceed 5,500 rpm.
	If you're lucky, 'alternative alternators tend to come with 
smaller pulleys' will approx compensate for the lower crankshaft rpm 
from your good old low-revving VW motor.
