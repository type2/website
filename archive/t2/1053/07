You know, it's not that hard to fix that.  Pull the distributor out, 
poke a magnet stick (or chopstick in there), lift the gear, push it back 
down, use screwdriver to push down on the gear while you pull the 
magnet/chopstick off.  Quick and simple and then you (or your mechanic) 
are never left guessing why things aren't setup right.
