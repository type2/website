I had this issue with my '74 Deluxe recently when replacing the  
ignition ( http://calivw78.com/2008/07/05/vw-bus-ignition-switch )  I  
left the nut loose, near the top threads and put an 18mm nut on top.   
18mm is just small enough to sit on top of the nut.  I used a flat  
metal bar about 8" long (this could be supplemented with a wrench of  
some sort) and laid it on top of the nut.  The I used two large C  
clamps to reach around the bottom of the steering wheel and the top of  
the metal bar.  Took only a few turns on the C clamps for it to come  
off.  Thinking about it now, you could probably thread the nut to  
where its flush with the top of the shaft, and not have to use the  
18mm socket.

Good luck
