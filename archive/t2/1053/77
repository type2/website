Subject: Re: [T2] Internal handle for the back hatch ?

Hi Phil,

I have never seen a factory-installed inside handle on the rear door. 
But it certainly isn't difficult to fabricate your own. Mike Benthin's 
instructions make it pretty easy to do.

I find the rear hatch to be a quiet means to escape the bus in the 
middle of the night when nature calls. Much better than waking the bus 
(and campground) with the sound of the sliding door.

Here is a pic of the latch and grab handle I installed on a bus in 2005:

Happy Trails,

This weekend I found myself with the "opportunity" to remove and
lubricate the catch on Ashley's rear hatch. While it was out I noticed
that the operating lever has holes in it to allow it to be connected to
a handle inside the hatch to pop it open in the same way as the cab doors.

Was this an option on some buses ? If so, what did the operating handle
look like and where was it mounted. If not, why include the facility in
the part - VW could have saved some cash by not including the extra
metal on millions of mechanisms.
