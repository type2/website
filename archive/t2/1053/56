Subject: mahle vs bosch oil filters

Hey Everyone,
I ordered a bunch of oil filters from my mechanic normally he gets the 
Mahle fileters but this time he bought me Bosch ones.  I usually use the 
Mahle 0C28.  Does anyone know how the Bosch ones are in comparison?  Is 
there any difference?  Should I return these and ask for Mahle filters 
(I'm tempted to)?

Thanks!
Mike
