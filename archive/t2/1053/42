	which I take to mean the flexible seal around the approx. 
horizontal gap in the engine-compartment platform.


	This important part facilitates max cooling by maximising the 
pressure surplus in the engine compartment as against the outside 
air, thus maximising (all else being equal) the flow of air down past 
the engine.
	The 'official' foam gasket is needlessly expensive compared 
with Armathane (Armstrong corp of Canada - there are also other 
brands which look similar and are I suppose OK) closed-cell foam 
crammed in all around the gap.  This material is sold as exterior 
thermal insulation for hot-water pipes.  The size I've used is to fit 
on 3/4" (20mm) pipes.  Sometimes you can get it free from 
demolitions.  The smaller size for 1/2" pipes is not as suitable but 
far from useless  -  and if that's all you can get in the first 
instance, it's better than no gasket.
	You will need a couple yards of Armathane.  You slit the foam 
tube radially half-way, which allows one side of the tin to fit onto 
the foam tube.  The other side of the foam tube can then move as the 
engine rocks (but, we hope, does not roll).
