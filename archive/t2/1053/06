Subject: Re: [T2] Steering wheel question

I have found that you don't even need the BFH and it is easy to miss and
damage the wheel.  Just pull up at 3, push down at 9 then reverse, back and
forth, then same at 12 and 6. Repeat as necessary until it loosens on the
spline.  Steering wheels are remarkably strong with regard to those forces,
it's what they were designed for.  Think 350lb driver getting into the seat. 
However, they don't like errant hammer blows.   This was shown to me by a
pick-and-pull "master".  He had a wheel of in seconds that I hadn't budged in
an hour.  A "grasshopper" moment. jon

This works the best. Avoid doing any clamping, since the bakelite 
encasing the steering wheel is extremely brittle (he sheepishly admits 
3 wheels later).

The shaft will move down off of the steering wheel enough to allow the 
wheel to pop free. Also turn the key so the ignition lock isn't 
keeping the shaft locked in place. Also use a nylon or rubber mallet. 
If none is available, a solid piece of hardwood between the shaft and 
the hammer.
