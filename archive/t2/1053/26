Subject: Re: [T2] fuel pump noise

Have you:

1. Replaced the hoses between the tank and the pump?
2. Checked for pinhole leaks in the hoses and the steel tube between
the tank and the pump?
3. Checked the steel tube for blockages?

I found a pinhole leak at the joint between a hose and the steel tube.
I could hear hissing with a straw stuck in my ear when pointed at the
joint. It's easier to hear with the engine off. The joint was just
damp. There wasn't enough of a leak to flow a lot of fuel, but I bet
it was sucking air too.

Seeing that I cleaned up any rust on the tube and replaced all the
hoses. The tube got a couple coats of paint for good measure, and a
pressure "test". Plug one end and suck on the other. If it holds
vacuum, no pinhole leaks. I then blew through it. Air passed fine.

This was all during the troubleshooting nightmare of the last 8
months. After the above, the pump was slightly quieter. I suspect that
small leak I found was letting enough air in to rattle the vanes on
the pump. Right next to the pump, I heard a whirr with a gravel noise.
After the cleanup no gravel noises.
