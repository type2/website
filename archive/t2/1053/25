  Hello,
 
 I have used a few of POR 15's products and have been
 very pleased. I stripped my engine compartment to bare metal
 and replaced the battery trays in my old bus. I used the
 gloss white POR 15 and it turned out great! I had to put on
 a couple of coats, but when I was through, the engine
 compartment looked better than new. Follow their directions
 carefully. The stuff is too expensive to have to redo. I
 recomended it and plan to use it myself in the future.
 
 I have also used POR 15's gas tank refinishing kit. It
 took some time and some effort, but when I was through, the
 inside of my gas tank was as good as new.
 
 Regards,
