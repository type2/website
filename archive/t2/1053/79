Subject: AC Delco alternator

Hi everyone.  I've posted something about this once before but I thought I
would ask to see if anyone has done this since.  I would love to retrofit an
AC Delco alternator into my 2.0L 76 Devon Bus.  I think this would be a
great conversion for anyone with a bus if we could get a smooth process
down.  A delco alternator is much cheaper than our current options.  A junk
yard $50 alternator can through out as much as 100 AMPs 9great for
multi-battery charging.  Has anyone converted the charging system on their
bus?
