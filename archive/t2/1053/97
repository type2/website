Subject: Re: [T2] Internal handle for the back hatch ?

This was indeed an option (albeit RARE) on early model bay window  
buses (on all models) and looks simple to retrofit to a standard bus  
hatch. I helped Chris at BustedBus pull one off of a parts bus a few  
months back. He may have another one or busboys or wayoutsalvage or  
one of his contacts may have one.

A very cool option.
