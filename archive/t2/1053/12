Hi All, 

I jumped it that way on purpose, because I'm using an SVDA, and the
ground wire for the coil is too short, and the vacuum can interferes
with the engine tin about the time I get the timing right.  I had the
choice of jumping the dizzy drive gear, or jumping the wires one place.
I chose to jump the wires, an note it in the Bentley.  I could have
extended the wire, but that wouldn't have fixed the issue with the
vacuum can being right on the tin when timed, and to me that just
"looked" wrong.  

Still waiting on a Round Tuit so I can tear into the bus and find that
damn rattle.  :(
