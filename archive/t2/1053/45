Take two pieces of that pipe insulation and glue to together length 
wise. Use upholstery glue or better yet black 3M weatherstripping glue.

Viewing it from the end would create an "8".

Now slit the foam lengthwise along the top of the eight and bottom of 
the eight. One slit fits over the engine tin and the other over the lip 
on the vehicle.

I've got a Bus Depot seal on my bus but this ought to work. Don't know 
what the cost differential is.
