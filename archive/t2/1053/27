Subject: RE: [T2] por-15 "feedback" - anyone?

There are a handful of products that I've gone out of my way to start
carrying specifically beause my experience with them as a VW enthusiast made
me a believer.  Hankook RA08 tires are one example.  POR-15 is another.  I
had tried various rust-extender type products over the years on my VW's and
other cars, and at best they held the rust at bay for a short time. Then I
applied POR-15 to a Fiat 124 Spider, primered over it while still tacky, and
repainted over that.  When I sold the car several years later, not a single
rust bubble existed on those areas. (Alas, every other part of the car had
rusted to shit; it was, after all, a Fiat.)  I then tried it on a '68 crew
cab and had equally good results.  My '78 crew cab is in the body shop now,
and while my bodyman will be cutting/welding new metal, I have already given
him a quart of POR-15 to use on any remaining bits. In my experience, as
long as you carefully follow the instructions, it does work as claimed.
