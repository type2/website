I'll hop in here too.

I repaired my battery trays which we badly pitted and pinholed about 9 
years ago. The van has been outside since and they remain rust free.

I started by wire brushing the loose rust off of both trays. Vacuumed 
the debris out. Went back with sandpaper and wire brushes to get any 
rust I missed.

Engine was out so it was easy to reach.

Painted both trays top and bottom with the $4 bottle of rust-converter 
from the FLAPS. Dried and recoated. Dried.

Then coated both trays in aluminum body filler (epoxy filler mixed with 
ground aluminum - locally it is called Metal to Metal).

Sanded it a little to shape it.

Top coated it with single stage acrylic paint with hardener added.

It's still there and rust free.

FWIW I have not tried any of the other brands of rust sealants. Just 
wanted to mention my method in case it is useful.
