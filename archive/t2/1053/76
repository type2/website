Subject: Re: [T2] Internal handle for the back hatch ?

Drill a hole in the panel wall in front of the arm you pull to release 
the latch and tie a heavy nylon string to it.  Run the string up to a 
small eyebolt or eyescrew you place within reach from the inside if a 
mattress is there.  Provide enough slack so the string will NOT hang 
outside if the hatch is closed but you can reach it from the inside so 
you can pull down the hatch to close it.   Thus you can easily find it 
when sleeoing and be able to open it and seak out without all that 
sliding door noise!
