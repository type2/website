Subject: Re: [T2] Steering wheel question

I have had luck loosening the wheel nut and smacking the bottom of the 
wheel at 9 o'clock and 3 o'clock in an upward direction. Rotate the 
steering wheel and repeat.

I have gotten many off using my hands only.

Using tools has the potential to deform the metal around the splines.

I also would be worried about using a hammer on the shaft. Worried that 
the metal to metal hammering would damage any steering column bearings. 
I don't think the steering box would be damaged b/c of the rag joint. 
Just depends on how enthusiastic the banging was. The suggestion to use 
a wooden block or large diameter dowel is a good one (broom handle cut 
off). You could remove the shaft nut, the rag joint, and then tap on the 
steering shaft with a hammer and wooden dowel as suggested above.
