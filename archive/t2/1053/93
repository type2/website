Subject: Re: [T2] End of Fuel Tank Story and Couple of Questions

Hello all,

since the original filler hose is NLA, I searched for other sources of a
similar hose, with no succeess. But just today I went to a Mercedes-Benz
repair shop and they use a very similar hose on their "Sprinter" buses.
In the US this buses are sold by Dodge, so you can get that part
probably there. It is also used for the filler, so it has to be fuel
resistant, part number is 9014760026.
If anyone could help me with my clutch/pressure plate/oil leaks
questions posted earlier, I would be very thankful!
Cheers,
Timo
