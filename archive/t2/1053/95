Subject: Re: [T2] Cleaning with TSP or Muriatic Acid

HYey, I have used TSP several times and never had any problems with it 
attacking any of the metals.

I just mixed it according to the info on the box. Wished I had a big 
kettle where I could have boiled the water + parts.

I saw mention of using TSP on aluminum siding for cleaning. Don't know 
about soaking. Check parts often?
