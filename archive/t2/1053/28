Subject: RE: [T2] Alternator Ground

Mine does have that screw. I ran a 7 ga (two 10 ga) wire from that screw to
a stud on the stand and now charging battery voltage is within 100mV of my
alternator output (was more like 1V). I just find a little hard to believe
that either through the stand or through the fan housing that a better
ground was not to be had. Apparently the additional corrosion of living near
the ocean is worse than I would have expected.

I don't believe this alternator setup was ever stock on a bus (in the US).
And probably the bugs with this alternator setup have the ground wire and so
really it's only an issue with these conversions.
