I need to clean my storage area up a little and have an excess amount
of  Bus and Vanagon Rims I don't need.  Sorry I can't and won't ship
these.  You will need to pick up.  Also have a few Rabbit rims to be
given away.  Available from either my Centerlessville or SLC East Bench
homes.  Email me which is most convenient.

Tnx
