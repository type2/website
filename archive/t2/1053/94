Subject: Cleaning with TSP or Muriatic Acid

Hey, I'm in Springfield Virginia, working to resurect a '78 VW

OK, I guess I don't put my aluminum fan shroud in a bath of diluted muriatic
acid.  But can I use TSP (trisodium phosphate) in which to soak my '78 bus
aluminum fan shroud?  I have four+ pounds of the pure TSP powder, so how
many gallons of H2O should I use per pound of TSP powder to get a good
cleaning (soak a few days) of the fan shroud?

Could I put the 2.0 liter heads in TSP?  This is the VW bus that caught on
fire two years back at WAWA in Fredericksburg Virginia, and WAWA had some
kind of powder, like baking soda that they used to extinguish the carb
fire.  The crap got in everything, and I am almost ready to pull the
encrusted heads to see what the P&C look like.  This was a recentlly rebuilt
engine by SIR in California, so it may be saveable.

I plan to use the two gallons of muriatic acid to try to clean some rusted
items.  I used the muriatic acid in cleaning out a fuel tank on the '78, and
it did such a great job, I want to see what it can do on some of my other
rusty items I have in my stash.

Now, on some extra rusty heat exchangers I have, should I try TSP or the
muriatic acid?
