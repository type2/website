Subject: Alternator Ground

I have what seems like a weird problem to me. It appears my alternator body
is not well grounded through the alternator stand. Lately I have been having
starting problems (low cranking voltage and crank time). The battery was
replaced less then a year ago. Today I checked the charging voltage and at
the alternator (both meter leads on the alternator) the voltage reads about
14V but at the battery (both leads at the battery) the voltage is only about
13V. Using the meter I have found the 1V drop to be between the alternator
body and the stand. Checked the clamp and it's tight.

I do live on the coast so I see a lot of corrosion but I have not see this
before. The generator was replaced several years ago with the alternator so
I'm not sure if there is suppose to be a ground wire from the alternator
body. I'm planning on running a large gauge ground wire from the alternator
body to a good ground somewhere (TBD) to solve this problem. Anyone seen
this before?
