Subject: fuel pump noise

I have a 78 westy and my fuel pump has always made a good amount of 
noise - almost like a buzzing/vibrating noise - kinda like there are air 
bubbles in it.  I changed it out with other ones a few times but the 
noise has persisted.  I'm now wondering if there are air bubbles in it 
or if it's cavitating and forming air bubbles (if that's possible?).  
Has anyone else had a noisy pump?  I figure it should run pretty quiet 
but it doesn't... any ideas?

thanks,
Mike
