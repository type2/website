Subject: End of Fuel Tank Story and Couple of Questions

Hello all,

about 2 month ago, I posted my Sweden trip report which was mostly about
plastic parts inside the tank that blocked the fuel outlet or plugged
the filter. So last weekend I dropped the engine and tranny (again) to
get to the fuel tank. Optimistically, I'm getting really good in
dropping the engine, since I have done just this in March this year,
too. The album of the process can be found here:
http://tinyurl.com/3f6n73. Anyway, the problem was the hose from the
fuel filler neck to the fuel tank. It is made of silicone and the dealer
told me, that it is definitely fuel resistent. Well, it is not
(http://tinyurl.com/45e6k8). Inside, the tank looked like this :
http://tinyurl.com/4s4njb. Now I got all the blue stuff out of the tank
and repainted the ouside, since there was some minor surface rust.
Having removed the enigne, I noticed some oil in the area where the
engine meets the tranny. So I took apart the clutch and flywheel. On the
flywheel I saw some oil stains from the center to the outside
(http://tinyurl.com/3h92vr). The main seal looks like
http://tinyurl.com/4d4xu6 and the bellhousing like this
http://tinyurl.com/4rr3q2. So I guess the main seal is leaking. A
close-up of the flywheel shows some scorch marks of the seal
(http://tinyurl.com/4ecwyq). Is this okay? What do you think? I even put
on some special main seal lube during installation... I have another
question about the clutch (http://tinyurl.com/3rk3kg). Is this normal
wear after 6 month (10.000 miles so far)? Why are there marks on the
clutch only at certain spots? Should I put in a new one? Is this a sign
of a warped pressure plate? I really don't want to get any more practice
in dropping the engine, so I want to do this right. Any help is greatly
appreciated!
Cheers,
Timo
