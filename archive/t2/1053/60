I don't know which rivets you are referring to but drilling standard pop
rivets out is easy. The trick is to use the drill to break the head off the
rivet rather than drill right through. Use a larger drill bit than the size of
the rivet hole and carefully drill the head. The head will usually twist off
very quickly.
