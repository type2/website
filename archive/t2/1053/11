Subject: Fwd: [T2] Alternator Ground

Interesting question. I just replaced a generator with an alternator 
on my '71. I notice that the alternator, like the old generator,  has 
a screw in its case that could be wired as a separate ground. Does 
yours?
I chose not to put in this extra wire. Do those of you whose stock 
engine has an alternator connect this terminal to ground?
