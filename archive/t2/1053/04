This works the best. Avoid doing any clamping, since the bakelite  
encasing the steering wheel is extremely brittle (he sheepishly admits  
3 wheels later).

The shaft will move down off of the steering wheel enough to allow the  
wheel to pop free. Also turn the key so the ignition lock isn't  
keeping the shaft locked in place. Also use a nylon or rubber mallet.  
If none is available, a solid piece of hardwood between the shaft and  
the hammer.
