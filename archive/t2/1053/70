Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon Rear brakes on a Bay Bus ?

Please note guys, from working on vanagons off and on for years. The vanagon 
brakes are aqn improvement over the old adjusting wheels, BUT do not think 
they never need a manual adjustment.  They do.  VW still did not have it 
100% self adjusting but thought they did.  :))
