Subject: Re: [T2] por-15 "feedback" - anyone?

I used POR15 on my front suspension. It goes on easy with a brush and flows 
out to a very nice smooth surface. I used Picklex www.picklex.com for most 
of the metal processing rather than the metal ready, however POR15 is a 
system and the metal ready does a good job of preparing the surface. Careful 
about which POR15 product you use. You might want to use one that is UV 
resistant if you are not going to paint over the POR15.

 Now it's clean and ready to be painted and I was planning to use Metal 
Ready
 and Por-15.
 Is there anyone in this list, with a real feedback on these products?

 Thank you,
 Joao.
