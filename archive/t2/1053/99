FWIW warm (hot) TSP will attack aluminum, leaves a surface corroded/grey, not
sure if that actually damages it or not.  Is great for steel, takes off rust. 
On aluminum I tend to use fume free (blue) Easy Off but it will do the same,
and quickly.  Keep it moist in the spray leave it on for only a minute or two
and it will do wonders, takes off damn near anything, hard old carbon deposits
in a case or rocker box melt off.  Leave it on much longer or if it dries on
aluminum and it etches/dulls/corrodes the surface.  Actually paint then
adheres better, perhaps even better than alodining before paint.  YMMV Volks.

I just mixed it according to the info on the box. Wished I had a big
kettle where I could have boiled the water + parts.
