Hello,
I inherited a pair of new e-brake cables for a bay window bus.
A friend had a 74 camper and bought these new but never used them.
The bus was sold and he gave them to me.
I have been sitting on them for a couples years and tired of looking at
them, especially since I don't even have a bay bus.
The casing says:  "GEMO Germany", PN# 432740.

I'm not trying to profit from this, just a little $$ for packing materials,
driving to post office, etc.
I think the lowest price I have seen is $10 each.
I will do $15 for the pair shipped (US only).
I am not on the type2 list, could somebody please forward?
Thanks
