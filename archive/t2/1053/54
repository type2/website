Subject: Re: [T2] Rivets holding inner panel of rear air intakes

No I didn't grow up around there.  Mostly grew up in NC.

On my 69 westy I have metal panels with rivets holding them on in the 
back.  It looks like I can just drill them out and clean it up then 
rivet them back in. 

I just haven't ever drilled out rivets or put them back in so wasn't 
sure how hard to make it look good was.
