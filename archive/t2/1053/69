Hi Michael...  just so you don't have to read Everyones email... you can get
a copy of the instructions from the Library.

of course you start at http://www.type2.com/
click on library..
if you click on BRAKES .. it takes you to Convert to Self-Adjusting Brakes
by Karl von Salzen

http://www.type2.com/library/brakes/selfadjust.htm

just that easy!

Hope that helps
