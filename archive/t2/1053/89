Subject: Re: [T2] mahle vs bosch oil filters

Sorry I'm a bit late into this thread - had to swap my subscription to a
different address.

I always used to get Mann filters, but the last few times I've been supplied
with Bosch from Just Kampers here in the UK.  They are IDENTICAL to the Mann
ones, which leads me to believe they are just rebranded Mann and not copies.
Do Bosch even make filters?

The Bosch branded filters have been perfectly fine for me, so I would say to
anyone else - don't dismiss them straight away but give them a try.

My 2 of whatever is your chosen denomination.
