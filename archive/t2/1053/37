So what's the story behind this video?

How fast were they going and how heavy was the cargo?

Anyone know?

A person has to recognize that any truck is dangerous with a load in the 
back in a crash.

Also FWIW there is a baywindow Westy for sale here in town. Looks like 
it needs paint but not too bad. Has been siting at a body shop for sale 
for some time. A guy could prob buy it for $750 or so. Not too rusty I 
don't think.
