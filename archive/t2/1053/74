Subject: Internal handle for the back hatch ?

This weekend I found myself with the "opportunity" to remove and lubricate 
the catch on Ashley's rear hatch. While it was out I noticed that the 
operating lever has holes in it to allow it to be connected to a handle 
inside the hatch to pop it open in the same way as the cab doors.

Was this an option on some buses ? If so, what did the operating handle look 
like and where was it mounted. If not, why include the facility in the 
part - VW could have saved some cash by not including the extra metal on 
millions of mechanisms.

Just curious - Thanks
