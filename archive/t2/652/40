Subject: Refurbished Bus

A place that is near to where I live does just that. They have almost rust 
free Buses to start with and you tell them to what extent and how far you 
want them to take it. They have a wonderfull reputation for service and 
price. Joe is the man ,he is pretty much a pureist and wants everything to 
look original. I saw him bitting his lip when looking at my 79 with a 70 
bumper. I know he was wanting to scream inside. Anyway here is the link:

Cree 79 BlueBlob.  Ps: He has rescued many a stranded Bus owner and gotten 
them back on the road . If you were broke , no worries. He is in Boulder 
Colorado at 1-877-897-3211.
