You're right. You were thinking on a WAY larger scale than I was. I
was thinking of local shops, you were thinking of a major assembly
line. =D

I love the idea, but you'd not only have to protect the business from
liability suits, but I believe at that scale you'd have to meet modern
safety standards too.

Airbags anyone?
