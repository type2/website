Subject: Re: [T2] Crap. Bus finally broke down.

Very true, very true. My clutch cable popped on me on a beer run right after
the last hurricane. It was my first broken clutch cable, so I didn't know
exactly what to do. I had tried to jerry-rig the broken fork in the cable
with another screw......futile. No extra cable. Stranded, I remembered Greg
Potts describing a drive without a clutch, and through trial and error (no
traffic lights,  but crazy drivers, plenty of power lines and tree parts on
the road) I learned to do the same. I drove the Bus around for two days
without a clutch, and was glad to realize that it can be done. I listened to
the normal rpms of when I'd normally shift, and smoothly (not forcefully)
move it into gear.
It was a weird habit to stomp my left foot and get nothing!
