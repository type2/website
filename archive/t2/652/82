Subject: Brake booster gradually engages brakes

Hey all,

I've noticed a problem with my breaks, now that the break booster is hooked up 
again. As I'm driving, very gradually the breaks begin to apply. At first 
it's not too noticeable. Then eventually the bus begins to slow down too much 
when I shift (it doesn't coast anymore). Soon the engine becomes noticeably 
labored.

The work around is to pull over and shut off the engine to release the vacuum 
from the booster (I suppose I could do that while driving but haven't tried 
it yet). Any ideas why this might be happening or how to fix it? Thanks.
