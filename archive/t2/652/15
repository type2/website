I guess that refurbished means that the whole bus would be redone to 
the standard of, say, an AVP engine rebuild.

Here's the hypothetical business plan: you'd want to buy up buses at 
$500 or less, then do the work in batches. Strip to bare bodies, 
sandblast and prime 10 or 20 at a time. Paint some of them one color 
(regardless of year), leave some of them in primer for optional paint 
jobs. No concern about "correct" trim, etc., per year. Purchase vinyl, 
cloth, headliner in bulk.

The idea would be to price it so that people could pay off in two years.

It would be an interesting project to assign to an MBA student: devise 
a business plan to make this profitable.
