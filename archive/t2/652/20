Drive it without the clutch!  I had mine go 20 mi from home-if your
battery is good, and you are stopped, put it in first and turn her over
and lurch off.  Rev it up to max rpms, pop it to neutral, and then "feel
your way into second as the rpms drop to match what they will be on the
upshift.
  Downshifting is harder but follows same idea, with 2nd to first being
very hard.  After you slip into neutral, step on the gas to icrease the
rpms and allow the shift. If you see you are going to stop, slip it into
neutral, come to stop, turn off engine.
