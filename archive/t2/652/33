Subject: Heating the Bus

Hey,

I have been interested in installing "additional" heat in my 71 Camper.  I 
know in 71 VW offered an auxiliary heater.  I know about the BN4, BN2 and BA6 
heater and a few others.  Anyone know which was available in 71?

I like try to keep my Bus looking as close to stock as possible.  Is easier 
to install one than another?
