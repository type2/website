Note from the snippets below that the switch can be located a LOT of
different places. You pretty much need to know what model vehicle you're
going to be checking and look in the manual for that vehicle (or use Google
and compile a list of locations to carry with you to the junkyards).

I did a google search for "GM fuel pump cutoff switch"

http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=GM+fuel+pump+collision+cutoff+switch



This is discussing the fuel pump in a "classic" Range Rover. Note the last
sentence.

http://www.rangerovers.net/repairdetails/fuelpump.htm

Relay, Fuse or Inertia Switch  Failure: You can check to see if power is
getting to the readily accessible fuel pump connector which sits on the
frame rail behind the left rear tire. If not, the fuse, relay or inertia
switch (which shuts off the fuel pump in case of a collision) is probably
to blame. The fuel pump relay, located under the rear of the front
passenger seat on North American models, was observed by Kevin to be the
same as the power seat relay, so if it fails you can "borrow" the latter
for a temporary fix. If you do need a new fuel pump relay you can get one
from Bosch (on the web at boschservice.com, with a complete listing by
state of Bosch service centers).  The Bosch relay number is 0332014112.
*The Inertia Switch is located under the back of the drivers seat and looks
like a push switch, down on, up off. If you cannot get it to reconnect you
can jumper it to get you home.*

So, I switched to a google search for "fuel pump inertia switch".

This discusses a Ford Mustang:

So I ran down to my local library and looked through a Mitchell's manual.
It described exactly where it was. In my trunk behind the trim wall up
against the back of my tail lights on the driver's side. It even told me
how to test it. Check for 5 ohms or less resistance across the contacts.
Any more and they said to reset it or replace it.

This is a good page about one in a Ford Bronco. The guy was curious after
replacing his and decided to find out how it worked:

That just left the FPIS (fuel pressure inertia switch), which is located
under the dash in the passenger foot area, just at the front edge of the
carpet.
