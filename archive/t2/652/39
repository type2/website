The valves do not need to be adjusted at piston TDC. They can be adjusted on
the base circle of the cam. The two points are close together, but do not
precisely coincide. As well, the base circle of the cam is in a different
place for the intake and exhaust valve.

I adjust valves by the base circle method. When one valve is fully open, its
opposite on the other side of the engine is on the base circle of the cam.
That is optimum point at which to set the valve clearance. So if you set #3
exhaust to be fully open (valve spring fully compressed), then #1 exhaust is
ready to be adjusted. Similar all the way around the engine.

If you adjust valves this way there is never any confusion as to whether you
have found TDC or whether the distributor drive pinion is indexed correctly.
You look only at the valve train itself.

I do not agree with this statement:

The "loosest point" of the valve train is on the base circle. That is where
the clearance is best set. Using the distributor rotor position to find TDC
for a given cylinder and setting both valves at this point is more likely to
result in low compression, as there is plenty of room for error is setting
the engine to the correct point. If you have a funky camshaft with a lots of
overlap and/or duration, both valves can end up being too tight if you use
piston TDC as the adjusting point. The base circle method is foolproof for
finding the optimum point for setting the valve.
