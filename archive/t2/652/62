I decided a shorter features list means less things to break.

 For that reason I keep my mind OFF new cars and their trendy styles
and gadgets. Honestly a VW bus will get you across the state just a
easily as a new mini-van. Yeah the "features" list is shorter on the
VW bus but stick with one car and you will save between $300K and
$500K over a couple decades. I'd rather have money in the bank to
spend... Of course I also lust after the audi A4 Avant 1.8T... It's
tough...
