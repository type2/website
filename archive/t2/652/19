Subject: Re: [T2] Crap. Bus finally broke down.

I have to agree, it sucks,  from experience.
You would be surprised how far you can really go without a clutch.
The standing starts ARE a bit upsetting but once you are underway you 
just have to try and avoid stop signs and lights.
The upside is that clutch cables are one of the easiest things to 
replace. But really, why wasn't your spare under the bench Don ! <grin>
Experience has shown me the value in having a spare throttle and clutch 
cable onboard, quick fix if you got'em.
