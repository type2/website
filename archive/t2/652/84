Yes I think so. My official Volkswagen repair manual
from 1973 tries to ignore that the 1968 wiper assembly
ever existed...but we know better ;-)
So I guess this is a signal that you can replace it.
But then you also need to replace the arms I am
afraid.

And don't throw the old stuff away, may be someone
with a 1968 bus can use it again. I like those
one-year-only parts. Too bad I haven't got a 1968...I
could downgrade my 1971 and....oh well let's
concentrate on other things.


yours,


Vincent
