Subject: [T2] Bad a/c compressor

OK, so the compressor is seized-up now.  How do you know it was not free to 
rotate, clutch engaged, when the Tappet Brothers offered their diagnosis?  In 
1984 R-12 was freely available.  They could have offered to put some dye in the 
system... OTOH, possibly they looked at the complexity of the installation and 
set a profitability threshold.  You can't set the clock back to 1984 (assuming 
you cannot get the info from the then-owner).  You now have the alternatives of 
(a) learning about A/C systems and the conversion to R-134a, or (b) paying 
someone reputable to undertake this for you.  In either case, you might look 
around (maybe on eBay) for a good R-134a compressor.  They do show up.  Lots of 
time until the temperatures climb -- summer 2005 ;-))

On my friend's 72 bus, the receipts show that the a/c compressor wasn't
working as far back as 1984. The repair shop wrote that they couldn't
pinpoint the problem and recommended replacement which the PO must have
decided was too expensive to fix.
  
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's see....... so I go thru these steps:

1) have engine idling
2) turn on A/C
3) engage A/C compressor
4) engine dies
5) tell customer "we couldn't pinpoint the problem and recommended 
replacement"!!!!
