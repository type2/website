sandblast and prime 10 or 20 at a time. Paint some of them one color 
(regardless of year), leave some of them in primer for optional paint 
jobs. No concern about "correct" trim, etc., per year. Purchase vinyl, 
cloth, headliner in bulk.

The idea would be to price it so that people could pay off in two years.

It would be an interesting project to assign to an MBA student: devise 
a business plan to make this profitable. >>

Skip the interior...Set it up like a GM/Ford cargo van - just seats up
front, but concentrate on the mechanicals and rust removal and
proofing...Skip color choices...Sell 'em all in white water-proof 
primer...If there's a way to eliminate one year anomalies, do it
so all of 'em take the same parts...Homogenization sucks but
it keeps your inventory costs low...Can you rebuild a bus thusly
and turn a profit?
You'd think so, but the answer is no...?-(

Why not ?-(

"Cause now you're a small manufacturer, and if you offer a 
warranty on the vehicle you're accepting liability and if any-
thing fails on the vehicle while under warranty, you're res-
ponsible...The owner's insurance will pay the costs of an
accident, but if there's injuries with huge settlements, the
insurance company will be looking to recoup from you. When
tort lawyers file, they file against everybody involved in the
case, just on the off chance that some/any/one of the charges
will stick... Your insurance premiums to protect yourself against
this would be astronomical... ;-(
