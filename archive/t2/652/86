I don't think it matter what grease is used.

That's how mine broke.

The cables corrode at the crimped end and snap. Keeping water and air out of
there in the first place is probably a better use of the grease. Even better
dip the end, minus the threads of course, in some plastic dip that used for
coating the handles of tools.

Grease it up in the bag it comes in and feed it from the bag so it doesn't
pick up dirt during the install.

As the clutch wears the fingers on the pressure plate move toward the
driver. This means less pedal effort is required over time but I doubt you'd
notice it especially as the cable stretches.

Beware the reproduction boots wherever you buy them. They do not last more
than a few months.
