I  think you misunderstand the distinction I'm trying to make, Tim. 
There's no "candidate" and whoever would do this would have to create 
the market for it, not "find" a ready-made market. Moreover, the 
business plan I'm suggesting would not apply to refurbishing "several" 
of anything but perhaps a hundred, two hundred buses a year.

Tony probably identified the fatal flaw in the concept: manufacturer's 
liability.
