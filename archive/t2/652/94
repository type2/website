Subject: Re: [T2] '68 wiper motor

yup, 68 only on these. There's a used one currently on the Samba:

going for a buck and a quarter which seems a bit steep to me since it's 
not NOS and later models should work with minimal mods such as using 
later model arms...
  Just got done cleaning, lubing, and tightening up my whole unit. New 
blades yesterday too. Ready for the rain again. :)
