Subject: Fuel Pump Inertia Switch

Thnx Gerald, for the sites.  The site describing the f*rd bronco fuel 
pump inertia switch is complete with pics on how it works.  It would 
seem that this type of switch would be the ultimate solution for 
electric fuel pumps in retrofitted busses.  I know there must be a lot 
of these out there because f*rd bronco's rust out badly up here.
