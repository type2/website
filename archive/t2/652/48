Subject: Which year bus for resto.

Happy Weekend!

I've read others postings on this but still cannot decide.  I used to have a
68 westy that i loved, and partially restored.  When I got married I sold it.
Now, i'm looking for a project to restore - problem - can't decide what year
to look for.  For looks and pure "neat" factor I love the splitties.  I feel
comfortable with the upright motor; yet i have concerns about 6v, reduction
boxes, and parts costs; are these feelings warranted.  So that brings me to
the 68-71 baywindows.  Upright engines, 12v, IRS.  Yet I look at later buses,
see less rust, more power, and nicer westy interiors; yet I have this
apprehension towards the pancake motor/FI.  So I'm looking for opinions,
experiences, horror stories.  Thanks in advance!

Matt
