  Well, I couldn't tell ya even though I'm only the third owner, and 
it's a SF Bay area California native rig. The ONLY rust on the vehicle 
was around the rear popouts (which were shot). They seemed to be 
original but I can't be sure. The center glass HAS been replaced at 
some point however, and those were probably jalousies originally...
