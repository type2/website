Yes I think this is going to be the way to go. Looks like I am getting the 
'26 footer to move the contents of my house, the shop(less the parts cache), 
lawn & garden, and the bus. I might trow a couple of straps over the top as 
well for safe keeping. I don't need any accidental popups on this trip and 
no seal around the top makes it seem more possible, yikes!

Thanks,
