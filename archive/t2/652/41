Hmmm. Not exactly what I had in mind. There's nothing wrong with being 
a "purist" and wanting "everything to look original" but I'm thinking a 
little differently.

Maybe the fasteners example isn't the best example. So here's a better 
one, and it comes out of another major thread from the past week.

Suppose you are refurbishing or remanufacturing a hundred buses a year 
and providing a limited two-year guarantee (the reason for stipulating 
the guarantee is that there's no use going through this exercise unless 
reliability is the first principle). So you sit down and look at the 
options for ignition, and decide that while the Mallory distributor and 
ignition is more expensive than rebuilding the stock Bosch 
distributors, the increase in hp (if it's real) makes the bus more 
reliable and reduces the chances that people will burn up engines just 
because they can't get used to driving an underpowered vehicle. So you 
go with the Mallory, which increases the upfront costs but reduces the 
cost of upkeep over the aggregate of the fleet.

That kind of calculation is useful to think about, even if you're a 
home duffer and not going into batch production.
