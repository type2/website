Not much, you did pay yourself in 1978 dollars, didn't you...?-)
I'm on a few other antique car lists, and as far as I can tell, the
only ones who make money on a restoration are the guys who
get paid up front to restore other peoples cars...If you figure
your time like an attorney, and tally up "all" the time spent on 
the project...Even the hours spent writing up an order for parts,
for example... and put a $ value on it, any restoration will quickly
outrun the value of the restored car. There are even "restoration
specialists" who've gone as far as to sub work out to those oft-
mentioned third world countries for lower labor costs (and higher
profits to the restorer...;-)
