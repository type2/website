Subject: Crap. Bus finally broke down.

I can finally say my bus stranded me. 

I should have known he would do something to me when he took a bite
out of my favorite hawaiian shirt while I was moving through the
walkthrough at a Mc Donalds. I was just going back to grab a book to
read while eating and RRRIIIIIIIP! Took off the shirt, put on a
sweatshirt I keep in the bus, and went to eat.

Then, on the way home and looking for a flower shop (15th anniversary)
and of course there are no more to be found, push on the clutch pedal
and hear a "TTTWANGGGG" and the pedal goes to the floor.

Slam the bus into second so I can get it into a parking lot (sorry
about that gear bus!!) and start calling the wife. Of course, she let
the bill go on her cell so she's been without for a while now, so I
call the house, her parents, etc. Nothing. Sigh. I'm only a couple
miles from home in Anaheim, so I grab the laptop bag out of the bus,
cover anything that might make the bus a target for a breakdown, and
start walking.

I pass some "wonderful" neighborhoods. You know the kind, ones with 15
year old kids outside playing with switchblades and butterfly knives.
Ahhh. Home. I'm glad I'm not a skinny longhair anymore! While I bitch
about putting on weight, this is one of the few times when I LIKE
having some bulk. Especially I'm carrying a laptop bag with IBM
emblazoned on the side.

I'm home now, on the laptop, and the bus is all alone in a parking lot
in front of a Smart & Final. After a few minutes to relax I'll start
seeing if any of the FLAPS around here have a clutch cable (and hope
that's it). With any luck the wife will show up with the Volvo to go
get said cable and see if I can install it in the dark.

Good times.
