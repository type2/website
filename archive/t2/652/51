I would say, off the top of my head, whatever you want. =D

Really!

Have you driven both types? How much do you want to spend to get a
powerful and reliable engine? The handling difference between a split
and bay is huge. Early bay / late bay, less so. Power? Well, if you're
dropping a few grand into an engine you can pretty much have good
reliable power for either type of engine. I'm partial to the Type 4
because it's a more robust design from the factory. But a well built
1776 or even 2.1 type 1 engine would be quite nice. Possibly earlier
R&R, but not bad.

If you just want stock, then the late bays with the Type 4 engines are
the way to go. The HP numbers are really close to the later dual port
Type 1's, but the torque numbers on the Type 4 are more impressive (85
for the 1700 IIRC?)

71 and later bays had front disk brakes. If at all possible, I'd get
them. More forgiving, no adjustments, and "kiss the windshield"
stopping power. No VW experience on the all drum setups, but my
father-in-law has an old Ford truck with all drums and even after we
completely refurb'd the brakes there was no stopping on a dime. Maybe
stopping on a roll of them...

I guess your goal for the bus will really determine what candidate you
choose to start with.
