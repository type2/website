Subject: Re: Which year bus for resto.

Hi, if I understand your intentions correctly, you want a Bus that you can
drive around, have fun in, and not worry about the originality, right? Since
numbers matching and stuff like that doesn't matter, I would consider getting
a Bus that has the later upgrades. I'm not very knowledgable about Buses, with
the specifics on years and such.

But if you want something that's going to be more streetable, I'd suggest
getting a Bus that comes with disc brakes in the front (1972 and newer????).

I do know that they also sell type-2 motors with hydraulic lifters now... as
in, you can have them rebuilt with hydraulic lifters.

I'd also suggest a mechanical distributor, an electric fuel pump, and a webber
progressive with a single 2-bbl carburetor.

Of course, I just explained the entire set-up on my 1973. :)
