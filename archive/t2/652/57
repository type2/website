Subject: Another electric fuel pump question

My "new" (read expertly rebuilt) 2 L is on the way!!!!    I've searched 
the archives for a foolproof way to hook up the electric fuel pump 
safely and found lots on using different energy sources, relays etc and 
those methods sound OK but kind of complicated.  I have heard that later 
model G (ahhem) M vehicles have a "crash switch" which shuts down the 
fuel pump when any significant crunch or tilt occurs.  I went to our 
local vehicle graveyard and outlined my question to them and got a lot 
of blank stares.  "What year and model do you want this part pulled 
from?" was the only response I could get.  Does anyone out there know of 
this type of switch and what make year and model it might occur in?  Is 
it a simple switch that is hooked in series with the pump supply?
