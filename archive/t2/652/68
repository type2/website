Subject: Re: [T2] Which year bus for resto.

Which year???
Depends, how much of a project are you looking for?
Where are your strengths...Mechanical...Welding...
Painting...Interior...?
Where are you restoring it...A nice small warehouse
with heat and power...Or in front of an alternate
side of the street sublet apartment...?
What's your bankroll? 

Unless you're doing it just to be doing it...The stan-
dard caveat for buying anything applies...Buy the
best condition you can afford and go from there.
Usually bodywork - especially rust repair - is the
hardest/most expensive part of a real restoration.
Unless you're already proficient at it, extensive
bodywork requires the bus to go to a shop and
be worked on...Usually at the leisure of the shop
who may have real jobs that will bump yours...

Personally, after I hit the lottery and restored that
1936 Squire, I'd like a Splittie with a 911 dual turbo
and adapted Porsche suspension, thank you very much... ;-)
