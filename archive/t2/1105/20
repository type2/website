It's not the parts that's expensive, it's the labor.  If it were a Raby 
engine, I wouldn't be surprised to pay that much as I spent 1600 on 
heads alone from him when I could have gotten the pair for 800.  Some 
would say that's excessive, but after going through two other sets of 
heads, I'm confident that their experience will help these ones last 
longer (along with a few other tweaks here and there).  All the balance 
work can be extremely time-consuming as well.  Many shops just slap the 
parts together and use the stock tolerances.  That's ok for some, not 
for others - to each his own :)
