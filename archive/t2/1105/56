Those crows feet at the front of the 73 (?) and up bus would spread
and absorb some impact.

If the welds are strong enough to hold it together and prevent the
spreading, the force will transmit directly to the rails, which are
strong enough to result in the bus simply being pushed back.

The final outcome of this may be preventing the cab from being crushed.
