Many clients who did not take my advise, failed. None who did take my 
advise failed. No risk of being towed to the shop from hell by taking 
a hint from those with VASTLY more experience. Keeping one Bus going 
through the years via juris rigus is one thing. Keeping a fleet of 
clients who want no problems fouling up there day is a whole 
different world. You may apply as much or as little compromise in 
servicing your van, and more power to you. Do as you will, as will I.
