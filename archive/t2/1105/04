	This rubbish deserves the strong criticism already stated. 
It is par for the Stossel i.e  misleading slick junk.

	One old taxi proprietor's trick is to buy tyres a couple y 
ahead, store them in a cool basement, and only then slap them onto 
the road.  The rubber hardens during this storage, which then 
considerably lengthens their life.   Stossel's idea that these harder 
tyres are also more likely to transform into road alligators is not 
at all proven.  Presumably that longer-wearing rubber will skid more 
readily; I suppose you can't have it both ways.
