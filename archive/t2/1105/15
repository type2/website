Because despite all the pansy little list whiners over the last 15 internet
years, probably 85-90 out of 100 people get a reasonable service life out of
their GEX engines.  And those are enough people for them to stay in business
(for what 20-30 YEARS!!!)  AVP (who I don't like BTW, 10 years ago, long
before "common list knowledge" accepted it, I warned was going downhill)
probably does the same.  For the 85 people, it is fine, for the 15 it isn't. 
And a lot of people sell the bus long before it accumulates any real miles to
know.
 
Don't discount, or count on anyone on "common list knowledge."  The only work
you know is done right or wrong is your own, and I don't care who you talk
about, Jake, FAT, Rimco, AVP, Mark in the day, whoever, some work though
anyone can do, some you can't.  Everything is a trade, got to decide how much
is enough four you

If this is true, then someone needs to explain how GEX is still in business.
