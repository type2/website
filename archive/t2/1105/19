the local aircooled shop around here called Oval's quoted me 3200-3600 for 
the engine build on my van, which I decided to get rid of the van instead 
because that was out of my reach. These guys build really reliable engines 
and I know of a few that have been going for years with no issues. 5k seems 
ridiculous to me, even with all new parts.
