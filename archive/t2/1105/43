Subject: welded structure on front end

I had a friend "help me" by putting a bike adapter on the front of my
bus so a standard trailer hitch can be installed. There is a bicycle
rack that can go there.

I expect this structure that is welded to the angular portions of the
frame will make my "crumple zone" not function.

Also, if I have the thick (2 or 4 inch) tubing cut off close to the
structure, would that hamper the safety zone?

My friend is a shipwright and man can that man create strong structures.

He made a brace for my ham radio tower and it is not going anywhere.

Cheers,

Alan
