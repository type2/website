Thanks for all the replies!

We used a micrometer tonight to measure the tolerance in the bearing
journals (I believe that is the correct term) and they checked out according
to the Bentley.  Just getting started on this project with a good local
mechanic who has done many succesful Beetle rebuilds.  I just wanted to make
sure the block could be used before I asked a bus brother to haul it over so
we could check it out, so I appreciate the posts to settle my mind on the
matter today.

So, the crank is getting reground and will be balanced here once I get new
pistons/cylinders.  Current 2.0 heads check out OK and ready to roll on
everything else.  I have decided to install Dakota Digital gauges (CHT and
Oil Temp) after burning up the #3 in the old motor after a previous
rebuild.  My old block was outside Bentley tolerance on the bearings, but
was rebuilt anyway by another mechanic.

I do envy all you listmembers with the skills to do this stuff yourself.  I
am learning, but man, you have to do this stuf right the first time, or pay
the price later by the side of the road.
