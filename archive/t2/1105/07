I disagree.  I have had older tires blow out on me while driving and it is not an experience I care to repeat.  Rubber does not last forever yet it is subject to a lot of abuse and is largely responsible for the integrity of the tire.  I did not even watch the above video - don't need to.  If a tire is more than 5 years old (I'm in Texas, might go a year or two longer in cooler areas of the world) it gets recycled regardless of tread depth.  Not worth it to compromise safety.  

As for the cost, it is part of owning/operating a vehicle.  Tires are consumables just like windshield wipers and brake pads.  I have three cars also and yes they all have newer tires (and wipers, and brake pads).

As for buying tires that are already 2-3 years old, that should not be acceptable to anyone.  Make sure they are fresh before you buy and if you can't be sure, buy somewhere else.
