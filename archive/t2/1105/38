Subject: Front mounted spare

Just a thought, but 'most' Domestic SUVs et al, used a nice 'swing away' spare
tire mount on the back, so why would that be so difficult to do same with VW?
Swing it away, open rear hatch...work...nothing on the front, and if a lot of
vehicles of this 'mode' seem to have it, rather than in front...in spite of
the fact they have an engine et al "up front", would seem a logical choice,
since IIRC, the spare was not mounted at the front from the factory...and
those 'design people' , knew what they were working with..therefore lets
'stuff'" it inside..and the 'owners' can figure out what they want..when they
purchase the bus.  Hence you have roof, rear, front, inside..mounts, decided
by safety and space!
Cheers
