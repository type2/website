Subject: Removing the front floor

Hi all,

It was a nice day for March in New England, so I went out to cut the front
floor out of the donor bus. I have the cut all the way around, but it is
still welded to the frame. Is it just tacked welded from above or do I need
to crawl under with a hammer and cold chisel?

Thanks,

Bob
