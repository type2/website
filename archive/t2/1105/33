	I like John Anderson's comments on this issue.  Let's not 
forget that lack of frontal protection was one of the faults for 
which the dreaded R Nader tried to get our ancestor the Splittie 
banned from USA roads.
	My spare wheel is on the front, but on a 'bull bar' which is 
attached to the 'chassis' below the bumper.
