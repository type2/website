I replaced the flasher relay and my turn signals and hazard lights work
correctly now.

I used relay from
airheadparts.com<http://www.airheadparts.com/viewDetail.asp?strMasterCat=&idproduct=2935>
.
 Only, the relay was not the same as pictured.  It was 4 prong (49, 49a, 31,
P).  I contacted airheadparts over the last 2 days and left the suggested
email with their bus guy, Jim, but no reply.  I ended up figuring it out
with the wiring diagram...

-So the turn signals and hazards work
-The wipers no longer longer blow fuse when switch is activated.
-The oil light now functions correctly after checking wiring and replacing
oil pressure sensor
-as well as various cosmetic improvements.
For giggles Im chronicling the process on facebook here:

Next I think I want to try and tackle the excess play in the steering.  My
sources to learn where to begin are the Muir book, Bentley manual, random
Google searches and type2.com archives.  If any expertice is willing to be
offered on attacking this, Id eat it up.  Thanks,
