I had an electric from Auto Zone that was brand new the day before I 
bought the my stock '78 fuel injected van from a friend years ago. It 
was noisy for a year before quieting down. Wasn't touching anything and 
never a problem. Sloppy manufacturing? I kept the old (but good) pump in 
the van in case.

Friend had purchased the van only a week before and when it did not run 
well he began throwing parts at it without much idea of the real 
problem. Idled poorly or stalled. Simply needed injector seals and the 
EGR valve blocked off (valve leaked, none of the pipes were in place).
