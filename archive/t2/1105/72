Subject: Re: welded structure on front end

I'm no car designer but I had an accident in '73 in a nearly new '73 type 2
panel van.   A pick up going the other way skidded and his rear end impacted
directly in front of me whilst driving.   The rear end almost certainly hit
the bumper.   It's possible that the crumple zone behind the front bumper (and
the empty pick up bed) saved me from serious injury but to my knowledge there
is no crumple zone anywhere above the bumper.   However, the pick up bed did
completely total the front panel and windscreen and I received a shin bruise,
plus had to have an eye wash at a nearby hospital.   IMHO anything extra on
the front panel could absorb at least a little of such an impact, even a spare
wheel - so long as the front panel is not weakened by any addition.
