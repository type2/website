Subject: Roo Bar

I am pretty good at not thinking about the strength of the nose of my bus, I
rode motorcycles for years so what is the difference, but occasionally it
creeps into my mind.

I love the movie Welcome To Woop Woop and have wanted a roo bar like the one
in the movie as long as I have had my bus.

I have an aquaintance in Newberg that builds wonderful roll cages for my
friends and for many off-road competition customers.

I am going to ask him to build me a "exo" style front cage for mounting
lights and my spare tire.  If others think they may be interested I could
talk to him about designing it to fit many different years and making it
easy to install so that he could build them to ship.  What would people pay
for something like this?  What sort of features would it need to include?  I
am sure that the end user would be responsible for finishing such as paint
or powder-coating.

I am thinking of 2 hoops, one  up and around the spare, the other going from
the lower corners and over the headlights and across.
