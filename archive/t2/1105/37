Subject: Re: [T2] tire on front

My '74 Westy has no damage other than the holes for the tire mount.

The tire was there when I bought it.  There is no room inside for a  
full sized spare, so the nose is the best place for one.

With a white vinyl tire cover, it looks good.

A couple of years back I was entering an intersection when the light  
turned yellow.  I stepped on the gas to get through, when a jeep  
coming down the hill from my left thought he had timed the light to  
be green when he reached the bottom.  He stepped on his gas as well  
and ran the red light.

There was a blur in front of me as I hit the brakes.  The jeep  
glanced the spare tire on front, and his black fender flares left  
black makes on my tire cover.  The spare tire twanged as it was  
vibrating from the glance by the jeep.  I could find no damage other  
than the black marks.  The jeep kept going and never stopped.

I was pretty lucky I think.  Another few inches would have been a  
disaster.
