Subject: Rusty Exhaust

A couple 3/4 (how long has it been?) years ago when I got the Guac
from Troy, he had replaced all of the exhaust bits. Some new, some
clean used. Being a 78, it's pretty darn complex and not all the parts
are available new.

Monday I was leaving Del Taco after some yummy shredded beef burrito
goodness, and heard scraping. The muffler was dragging on the ground.
Ack!

I have a spool of single strand aluminum wire in the back, so I tied
it up to the bumper and aside from being a bit noisier, it's ok for
the moment.

The strap holding the muffler to the cross pipe is missing, the bolt
sheared off. I was trying to inspect the pipe from the muffler to the
elbow but it's all so rusty I can't see jack. I'm going to have to
scrape the rust off so I can just see if/where there's a break from
the muffler hanging and dragging.

Is this miserable rust resistance common to new exhaust parts? I know
that driving it year round in Colorado isn't helping, but the old
stuff (elbow, afterburners U connectors) has surface rust, but not
bad.
