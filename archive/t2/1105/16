Same thought came to me. Gex stays in business with 4 page 5 color 
ads (or is that 5 page 4 color, I fergit) in the hot rod VW 
magazines, and $0.50 less in price compared to any other lowballer. 
$300 per motor goes to advertising and $50 goes in the motor, leaving 
a profit of $148.50 per motor. They are the cheapest so, they have 
the lions share of the market.  Their clients are buying a motor a 
year to burn up on the sand dunes, or just get it running to sell. 
You've seen the ads, "NEW MOTOR!!".
