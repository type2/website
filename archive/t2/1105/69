	For all I know it's defunct.  It used to be very popular with 
police forces 4 decades ago.  The Calif Highway Patrol in that 
period, featuring 7-litre Dodges with special suspension etc (roughly 
as depicted in the 'pickup from Joliet Jail' sequence in 'The Blues 
Brothers'), used to slap 2 or sometimes 3 Bruce's recaps on them 
before selling the whole car at 70,000 mi.  A senior patrolman told 
me they'd never thrown one tread in millions of mi.  I assumed it 
must be a good carcass.  I assume also that it must be expensive. 
Difficult to believe it's discontinued; probably just rebranded 
'Exterminator' or similar.
