Subject: Re: [T2] Rebuild

Just to chime in on this thread, I bought a rebuild 1600 about 6 or 7 years 
ago from one of the well known suppliers.  I won't say which because I 
believe the problem could have happened with any of them.  Mine failed 
almost immediately.  The cause was a bad cam gear that shook the crank and 
bearings and saddles into quick oblivion.  Had this not been happened the 
engine might have lasted, but no more than 10,000 or 15,000 miles, if that 
long.  And never have run well. Here's why.

Taking the engine apart was instructive.  The rebuilder had used new 
cylinders and pistons, and presumably bearings, but little else.  The heads 
were trash.  One of the spark plug holes was helicoiled. The case was beat 
up.  The cam gear, as mentioned, was burred and failing. The cam had many 
miles on it, as did almost everything else.

I did the math.  I realized that using mostly junk parts was the only way 
the builder could an engine, stay in businss and sell it for $600 (what I 
paid).

That was a lesson learned.

If you are not going to build the engine yourself, then be prepared to pay 
the money to have someone who really knows and cares what they are doing to 
do it right.  There are no rebuilt air-cooled bargains out there.  There 
can't be.  The basic economics do not allow it.

$5000 may or may not be too much, depending.  But getting anything less than 
quality is short-changing yourself.

Cheers,

John
