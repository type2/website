Well I do understand David, but I am cheap after all, I'll keep running my old
tires. FWIW of course, you always can be sure how old they are (in the USA at
least), just ask to look at the DOT date code (probably a good idea before
they install the set.)   If you got to have new tires and they aren't, shop
on.  Or I guess try to bargain em down to whatever you think the usefull life
is if you want to try, but they will sell em to the next guy...  Since Y2K now
days, it is easy enough to make sure they are new.  Prior to that, you always
had the vague unlikely chance that they could be an extra 10 years old if the
line had been made for 10 years.

As for buying tires that are already 2-3 years old, that should not be
acceptable to anyone.  Make sure they are fresh before you buy and if you
can't be sure, buy somewhere else.
