	I've obviously missed the defn of 'block' in our context. 
Strictly, the VW airhowler has cylinder barrels like those of an 
air-cooled motorbike, instead of a block with holes in it; alloy 
heads; and an alloy (usu mag) crankcase.
	I can see the loose term 'long block'; but what is the 
meaning of just 'block'?
