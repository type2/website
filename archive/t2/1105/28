Thanks John, I have read some Hoover before - I believe he is on the Type2
site.

The heads are fairly new - only 6,000 miles from the last rebuild.
Injectors have been shipped to Cruizin Performance (
http://www.cruzinperformance.com/) to be rebuilt/checked out. Yes, the crank
will be newly ground.  I'll definitely discuss the plastigage. with Mike and
see what he thinks.

Got a new Cam on order, so that's cool.

Who is the Scott that does align bores you mentioned in your post?
