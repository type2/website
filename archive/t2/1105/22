Eh, was already done to my bus when I bought it so no big deal.  In 21 
years, I have never touched another vehicle with the front of my bus, so 
the dent under the spare remains the same - my little secret.  Maybe I 
am just lucky.

Oh it will absolutely crumple!  It is just steel and rubber.  Maybe not 
flat, but very little bit that it deforms in an accident absorbs energy 
and lessens the impact.

I would argue that it is in fact your crumple zone in some cases, 
certainly the case we both care most about.  A crumple zone is anything 
inbetween you and an invading object.  As soon as said object contacts 
the front of your bus (be it nose skin or tire/wheel assembly), the 
relative velocity of the two objects will begin to decrease.  I'd rather 
the decrease begin earlier and last longer (by hitting the wheel/tire 
assembly) rather than later (by hitting the unprotected nose of the bus).

I don't understand your arguments.  If another vehicle hits your bumper, 
then the bumper is the crumple zone. and the wheel/tire on the front is 
irrelevent.  If, as you said, you are hit by a large SUV, one that is 
tall enough to hit the spare, then the spare and nose of the bus are 
your crumple zone.  Or perhaps the spare, nose of the bus AND the bumper 
and frame.  Either way, the tire/wheel combo adds to the crumple zone in 
those cases.  The larger the crumple zone, the safer you are - it's as 
simple as that.
