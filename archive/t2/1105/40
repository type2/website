Subject: I'm outa touch too (Was AATransaxle Out Of Touch For A While)

In addition to Daryl, I will be outa touch for an undetermined amount of
time.  Less than 8 hours from now I go into Ventura Community Memorial
Hospital for a "routine" Angiogram.  The last "routine" Angiogram turned
into an Open Heart 4 way bypass session.  Hope it doesn't turn into that
again, keeping the fingers crossed.  Heart's skipping beats and the
cardiologist wants a "better view" than the stress-echo (dreadmill) a couple
of weeks ago.

So I celebrated this event by purchasing a new toy today - a 75 914 1.8.
Damn, they're fun to drive.

Vanagon Content:  I did attend the annual VW/Porsche Toy & Literature show
yeaterday and purchased 3 tiny Vanagon toys just under 2" long from Rich
Kimball.  An Orange Doka with a Tilt Cover and Emergency Light on top of the
cab, a Tornado Red Vanagon Syncro and a Beige Vanagon Taxi.  Made by Rocco.
All come with teensy black outside mirrors on a parts tree that will take a
jeweler's magnifier and tweezers to install.  They'll stay in the box, I'm
not brave enough nor are my eyes that good to do that ;)
Keep The Faith.....
