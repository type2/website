Ridiculous, any solid reground T4 crank done by anyone reputeable, or even
most local shops that still grind if they will do it, will go yet another
regrind and 300k more miles in ANY stock T4 engine.  Maybe it will only last
"1/3 of new" in the fact that I bet there are T4 cranks out there with 400k or
more on them.  I wouldn't even pay to Magnaflux a T4 crank if it looks good
and rings nicely (and I would with most other engine.)   Shit if the engine
wasn't abused, I might just polish it myself and not even risk grinding it if
it measures and plastigages in spec.
