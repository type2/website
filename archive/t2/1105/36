not sure what the $5K is supposed to include, but i have an idea.

when we do bus engines - and late fuel injected bus engines are what  
we specialize in when we do engines - there are almost always a lot  
of expensive ancillary items needed to complete the project. for  
instance new fuel injectors, new airflow meter, almost always new  
exhaust, sandblast and refinish sheet metal (and replace some of the  
metal). these items are all pretty costly, especially the injection  
parts and the exhaust. then there is re/re the engine and tuning  
time. new cylinder heads for a type 4 engine start (yes, start) at  
about $600.00 each. new exhaust can be $1,200.00. so now we have  
totaled $2,400.00 and all we have are good heads and exhaust. so this  
is why $5K figure is not ridiculous at all.
