Subject: Best carb/dizzy for 1600 DP

Well I know this has been dealt with 4,252 times here and all but I'm not too
proud to ask....  I'm real friggin lazy and who knows if the archives are
about now anyway.  I am of course strictly not an upright engine guy, at least
not stockers.  Now I could delve and delve, but...  The '69 SC has come to me
with a 1600 DP, engine has good compression, good oil pressure, good endplay. 
It also has the dread 009.  What dizzy/carb combination am I looking for here
volks to buy of samba or the bay, or that I might even have.  I have a box of
10-15 old Solex carbs, and my box of dizzies probably has some old upright
ones in it.  I have let this knowlege leave me long, long ago.  I also have a
set of the old baby Dells (34 FRDs?) somewhere but that is likely overkill of
course and chokeless in AK doesn't seem a good idea either 8-)  Anyway
somebody tell me what combo I'm looking for here for nice stock performance. 
This is a very transitional
 runner engine only, I've been looking at the oxyboxer route as I have 4
waterboxers sitting about, and the Bridgeport has been lonely, I haven't made
many chips since I've gotten to AK so 1600 for now, 2.? for later.
 
TIA
John
