The theory is sound. Sounds good = marketable. Ergo, marketed with 
claims and testimonials. Actual Results=mixed. Conclusion=WIZBANG

If you buy WIZBANG, your are duty bound to EGO to convince someone 
else to buy. When they follow suit, you are JUSTIFIED in your 
smartness, and your EGO pushes up your nose another notch. I'm right, 
I convinced someone else I'm right, now they think I am right, ergo, 
all is right with the world.............NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!

Proper static balancing done right is more than good enough for a Bus 
99% of the time. If that doesn't work, you have an issue no wizbang 
will fix. Bent wheel, loose ball joints, bad bearings, worn 
suspension bushings, worn out shocks, etc.

Pay $10 for $0.10 worth of plastic?? Same as paying $50/gal for 
keroseen in a 4oz bottle of Fuel System Cleaner. Same thing exactly. 
Good basic procedures trump quick fixes always.
