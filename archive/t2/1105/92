Ah yes, I know the sound of a cavitating fuel pump well.  Replaced a 
failed/overheated one with a Ford F150 truck Bosch pump in Ohio, much 
cheaper than the VW one which they did not have and a perfect fit/specs 
except smaller filter inlet required a modern CLEAR filter.  We limped 
home all night from Ohio to NJ with a *&%%%^ PO's coating of a gas tank 
having peeled and blocking the tank outlet (they were so large, the 
filter did not show them)- blowing air up the line allowed some travel, 
but still ended up going in a low gear and driving without any quick 
accellerations.  Cut the inspection hole over the tank gauge and opened 
it up, and vacuumed out all the coating using a flexible metal gas stove 
inlet run to a vacuum cleaner 25 feet down the drivewaY!
