I don't know Scott and I do understand your point here and won't argue it
either, that is why I qualified at the end, unless he can prove he knows what
he is doing...
 
And perhaps I'm a bit dated in retrospect not taking into account $100/hr or
more shop rates today.  But if this guy is in BFN, and is the local "air
cooled VW guy" and wants $5k, I'd steer well clear and go with whatever Ron is
selling installed for $3500.  You can still build a solid, tight, at least OEM
quality rebuild for a heck of a lot less (given however the limitations of
todays parts.)  Would I pay $5k to a local, not unless he could prove to me he
did as good a job as say Bob Donalds did or someone of that caliber and was
going to be there to back it up.  But of course, I'd personally scrounge the
$1000-1500 in parts and still have a tight engine I built going a good solid
120k miles on, time after time.
 
Even with R&R, and a ludicrous shop rate, $5k better be a damn nice stock
rebuild on a 2.0 with countless years, engines, and happy customers to back it
up.  If so, sure the $5k seems reasonable, if its a guy who hasn't put
together a T4 in 5 years, I say drive on.  What did Boston Engine want for one
right before Bob passed (recent discussion should mean someone knows) $3500 or
so, was he up to $4000, if so sure I'm off base, if the local can do that
quality.

to me it's a strong indication that whoever offered that quote might actually
have a clue what they are doing, and what is involved in doing a good job on a
type 4 engine.
