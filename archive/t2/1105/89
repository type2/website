Never heard one making strange noises that wasn't either low on 
pressure or failed within a few weeks. If it's noisy, it's bad or 
will fail in short order.
That's from 41 years of VWing, and 15 years providing professional 
services for VW's, where in one month I would typically fix more FI 
VW's than I did in decades as just an owner/DIY/Saturday/backyard 
mechanic. Thanks for playing but no bananna for you, sorry.
