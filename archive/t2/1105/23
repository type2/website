I'm on the fence with this one. But, perhaps the argument could be  
made that the construction of the nose of the bus is less resistant  
than that of the spare.  If the object hit the front of the bus,  
without hitting the bumper, and the spare did not collapse at all,  
then would the spare do nothing more than cause the nose of the bus to  
be pressed further into the cab? This would rule out the spare  
contributing to the amount of crumple zone available.

Another viewpoint (from FasterLaster) that I had not thought about, is  
what kind of transition does the nose of the bus go through while  
dealing with the fatigue and strain of a spare tire being mounted to  
it over the years? Would it be enough to alter the resistance that the  
metal would have if it were involved in a collision?

Food for thought.

Peace, Troy
