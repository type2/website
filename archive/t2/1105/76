Check the pics here:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatra_T97

The metallic-colored one looks closest to the Life Scarab photo.
Reading the article, you see that VW paid Tatra 3 million DM for
patent infringement. Porsche was willing to settle before the war. It
surely would have been a smaller settlement had Hitler not interfered.

The cutout at the rear wheel makes it unlikely a Tatra or a Scarab.
The Scarab and many other similar vehicles are pictured as pre-VW
influences in Battle for the Beetle. The Scarab pictures appear on pp
166-8. The Scarab frame photo makes the wheel cutout impossible, and
the Tatra doesn't have one either. Window size on the door looks wrong
too, as well as lack of a curve on the outer edge of the door.

Another Stout prototype for Graham-Paige on page 187 looks closer,
especially on the side door window size, but still not right.

In this book, Karl Ludvigsen has photos of nearly every period
rear-engine vehicle to show the context of the Beetle's development. I
can't find one compatible with the Life photo. There is an unnamed
1940 Ford tubular frame prototype photo on page 262 which is more
compatible with the Life photo than the Scarab frame photo, but no
body picture is provided.

A clear pic of the Scarab rear quarter panel is here:

It is not compatible with the curve ending at the wheel arch of the
Life photo. Conceivably the Life photo could be a different prototype,
but I think the unnamed 1940 prototype is a more likely candidate by
the frame shape.
