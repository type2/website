Now I didn't say that now did I? Furthermore you don't even know 
anything about how many of these pumps I've seen/heard. Although 
unlikely I could have been a fuel pump quality control engineer. (I'm not).

You made the statement : "Never heard one making strange noises that 
wasn't either low on pressure or failed within a few weeks. If it's 
noisy, it's bad or will fail in short order. "

I offered that at least my one noisy pump did not have problems for many 
years.

Don't be so touchy and righteous. We're just swapping experiences and 
opinions here.
