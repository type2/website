I had problems getting the archives search functions to work. I have 
finally figured it out. Just must be very careful with inputting the criteria.

The oo9 is OK for the upright, and nothing like right for the T-IV. 
Just verify something like 25 degrees total advance.

I would try to find a vacuum advance original in good order and use 
that for a dizzy. As to the Solex, the Pict 3's can be nothing but 
problems, where as the Pict 2's are virutally fool proof and just 
clean running on a stock upright.
