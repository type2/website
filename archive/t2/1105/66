Subject: Goodyear 185R14C

With all the recent flurry over tires, I finally decided to get online
and get the information to evaluate the previous owner's decision to
put Goodyear Eagle GA Plus tires on my bus.

While at Goodyear's website, the first thing I found was that they
actually do make the actual 185R14C tire specified for our buses. It
comes in the standard version in the Integrity series, and also in the
Ultra Grip Ice series:

or if you can't click that, try this:

Going deeper into the mystery of my tires, I didn't really expect them
to be correct for the bus, but the first mystery was no leading P or
LT designator on the tire. Just 195/70 R 14.

Then a mysterious "Reinforced" marking on it. Then when I got to the
Eagle GA page, I saw that it is a Carbon Fiber reinforced sidewal
series, "Carbon Fiber reinforced sidewalls help keep the shoulders on
the road for crisp responsiveness and manueverability." Plus somewhere
else on one of the pages it said something about increased load
carrying ability.

So next I went on to look up the last codes on my tires, 95 H, which I
learned meant a speed rating of 130 mph (speed rating numbers are for
10 minute endurances) and a load rating of 1521 pounds, more than
enough for our buses. What a surprise!

It's good to know that the tire is in spec for my bus, but considering
all the other factors people have talked about in terms of tire
quality and handling, I'd be interested in any additional input people
with experience with these tires might have to offer me.

Thanks,

John
