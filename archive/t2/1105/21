Subject: Re: [T2] Great Video on Dangerous Tires

We took a BRAND NEW looking tire out of the spare tire compartment of a 
a 77 bus and put it on the 78 camper front to go to a show about 2 hrs 
away; this was ~ 5 yrs ago. I think it was a Continental.  On the way 
home its tread delaminated off the wheel and it blew out- very scary and 
we almost went into the opposite lane doing 55 mph. It may have been the 
original spare?! Bottom line is the rubber outgasses, stiffens up and 
the squirming makes it separate from the plies.  Usually I can see 
little cracks if inspecting the sidewall of a used tire to clue in on 
this, but if this tire had no cracks, likley it was the original never 
used tire!  Now I look much more closely at the history of a tire.
