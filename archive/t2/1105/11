Yeah, that's not good either.  BUT: a) it's relatively rare, because
the T2 front bumper is considerably higher up than those on most
modern cars, and b) even if a car impacts the T2 front wall above the
bumper, the front mounted spare will make things worse if present --
it delivers the impact force into a narrower area than the opponent
would hit if the spare were not there.

Airhowlingly yours,
