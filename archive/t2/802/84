Subject: Re: [T2] garage door height?

I designed and contracted our almost 28 by 33.5' ft free standing garage
11 years after we built the house, making it 3 bays wide with the right
bay using a standard door and holding the shop/storage side, and using a
laminate beam (actually 3 we nailed together in place) over the double
bay so no post was in the way between the bays.  52 10" overlapped 14
foot joists make the cap on the concrete block wall sides.  The one post
has a woodstove in front of it.  I built it into a hillside to get
around the 18ft height limit, as they average the hight from the four
corners.  It is actually 24 ft floor to peak, which is 45 degr on front
but very flat in back to make a storage loft reachable by walking up the
side hills.  The earth acts as a buffer to keep it cooler in summer and
warmer in winter (in NJ- it never went below 38 degrs in winter). It has
2 9W x 8 ft doors and one can open the Westy poptop enough inside to
work on its upholstery.  As my sig shows, I have a pod on top that just
clears the door opening when driving in.  Glad I made it 8 ft.
    To do it over I'd likely had put in 3 bay doors, but it was an
exspense consideration- the beam was cheaper by far, and one can drive
to the side to access the rear of the "shop" on the right.  The regular
door allows quick entry without losing too much air when going in and out.

Whatever the height of your vehicle, make the door appreciably higher than

  something that makes it taller, such as taking out weight, putting on a
  rack, changing tires, etc.
