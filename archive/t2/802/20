Nope, Polar Bear. :-) , or Canada Goose. 

 

Yes Mark, it's identical to the U.S. idea of Thanksgiving. I don't know why
we celebrate a different day though, dumb butt politicians back East I guess
 They are as stupid as your guys. :-) They even have a hotline phone to
exchange idiotic ideas I bet! :-)

Happy Thanksgiving to you too!

 

Take care,

Courtney
