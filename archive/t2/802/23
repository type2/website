Subject: Re: [T2] garage door height?

Just a word of warning, I have gone through the same process recently when 
buying my new garage. One big trap is a lot of manufacturers quote a door 
FRAME size, but the actual height you get once the door is installed is 
lower (and narrower), some up to 3" lower than the frame (and 4" narrower).
The one I bought has the door guides etc inside the frame so you get the 
full opening. I went over board and got a door 7'10" high so I can load the 
roof rack in the garage :).
