Subject: tow mirrors mounting

Hello all,
Does anyone have a set of tow / wide angle mirrors like these?  I had ask 
this question in the past but had no picture to explain.  
http://www.thesamba.com/vw/classifieds/detail.php?id=222103
I had bought a pair of these but received no mounting hardware (to the 
doors).  I can't figure out a way to mount these.  There must be some pin insert to 
the mount (like a VW Thing's mirror).  The seller gave me no additional help.  
The seller of the bra in the add just used the picture.  Any help would be 
very much appresiated.

Thanks,
Dino Spentzos
