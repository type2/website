why go to all that trouble, you can pull a 79 tank without taking the
engine out.  take the stuff off the top of the engine,. remove the panel.
remove the tank, might have to lower engine an inch or three but not
always  having small hands helps but doubt if it would be any easier thru
the back seat area..
