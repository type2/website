Hey Dan   1   no you dont have to pull the motor to install a helicoil or 
timesert   If you do rethread just flush the case with kerosene or such  also 
grease the flutes on the tap to catch any shavings   2  shouldnt be a problem to 
re heilcoil  timesert might be more perment  3 I wouldnt use the rubber plugs 
unless a dire starit situation , hell a wooden plug would work almost as well.
