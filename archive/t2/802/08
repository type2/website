As the center of the bus is under the door frame I tap the turbo boost button on the dash causing the bus to accelerate and the rear end squats. Once through the door I have 8 ft to slow from 35 mph to stop... Has worked well for me for some time but my buddy who also has a '78 and the same height door has had alot of trouble with this technique. Currently he is on his 8th door and 5th Westy. Last I heard he was considering putting hydraulic cylinders under his house to raise it 6 inches when he needs to enter the bus into the garage...

doubt if it will work, got those awesome koni shocks turned all the way up
