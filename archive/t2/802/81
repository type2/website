Correct.

The gasket is much thinner than the spacer so it's not a direct

There's no part number that I'm aware of. I think the paper probably

The compression ring is Swedish and the oil control rings are made by  
Deves here in USA.

Check set# 1945 B at the bottom of the page to see what kind of rings  
come in the set:
