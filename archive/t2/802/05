What makes them horrible John? I've never seemed to have any trouble, of
course I haven't used them in about 5 yrs, has the quality gone down the
tube? They used to be non-chrome edged and seated in quickly.

Grants are the lowest quality ringset you can get, shame that most VW Places

sell them as their "standard" rings; they are horrible.
