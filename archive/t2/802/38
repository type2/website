hmmmmm, do we let him in??? or does he have the breatfast fixin's

BTW, what do you want me to bring?? sasauge like last year??


Absolutely! Hell, Chris didn't mind that I came to Everybus last year in a Ch*vy van! We won't discriminate at JBB either-it's bad enough to have a bus that's down! Jeff (who's sore from replacing canvas on a Westy ALL day today)
