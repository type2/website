Subject: Re: [T2] garage door height?

My westy roof slides through openings without doors. Uniform codes mean 
yours should too, if built to code.

With hinged, side-opening doors, there should be no problem. If you 
install a one-piece swing up door, you won't have enough clearance. But 
if you do a roll up, make sure the roller track extends above the 
lintel a few inches, and that the opener is out of the way. That 
shouldn't be a problem.
