Thanks for the info on the fuel filler neck.  I know I
neeed a new one.  I once had to show a 25 year old New
Jersian how to pump gas when we were on a business
trip to DC.  He didn't have a clue what to do!  I can
understand that in the People's Republic of New
Jersey, but Oregon??  Haven't they heard of free
market capitalism yet?  Cheers...KR
