Subject: [T2] 1975 westy gas tank filler, replacement sequence

Here in Oregon, we are `not allowed` to pump our own
gas.  So I cannot provide the TLC needed to prevent
damage to the rubber filler neck during refueling.  As
a result, my 78 fuel filler neck gets damaged
(perforated) about twice a year, by careless
entry-level gas station employees.  I know its damaged
when a strong gasoline smell hangs about the bus cabin
while driving (as the gasoline is jostling about). 
The damage is always identical...it is in the same
place without fail.  The rubber filler neck gets
pinched & perforated between the gasoline filler pipe
and the sheet metal.  I temporarily patch the leak
with silicone RTV caulk.  Later, when I have time, I
replace the rubber part (-at-) $22 + S/H per repair.

Unlike some earlier T2 models, my 78 did NOT have an
interial fuel filler pipe access plate.  So I had to
cut a nasty hole to gain access.  Why?  I have 2 hose
clamps on the lower-end of the fuel filler boot.  I
can only get access to those hose clamps by pulling
off the pressboard cover to gain access through the
sheet metal hole I cut.   Too bad VW GmbH ceased
providing that access plate in later T2 models like my
78.

PS:  The Oregon `Gas Filling Law` requires Filling
Station Employees to dispense gas, except for
Motorcyles and Historic Vehicles.  In othe words, it's
illegal for me to pump my own gas in Oregon.  I have
not found a filling station yet that will allow me to
fill my `Historic Vehicle` to avoid damage to the
filler neck.  I understand Oregon and New Jersey are
on the only states in the US where pumping your own
gasoline is not allowed.
