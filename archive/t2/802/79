Subject: Cylinder Spacers

Cylinder Spacers - I guess these go at the base of the cylinders.

Bus Depot lists these Cylinder Spacers:::

17-2000Cc, .040'', 4Pcs	$6.98	80540

Does one-size-fits-all ???  So a 2000cc cylinder will fit into a 1700cc 
case, or is there something I am not catching??  Is the .040" spacer the 
right one to get to replace the cylinder head gasket and the old cylinder 
spacer??

Also, I am looking for part number for the two paper gaskets (four needed) 
that fit on each side of the aerobic block gasket that fits between the 
intake manifold(s)  and the head(s).  Anyone sell these??  Or suggest 
appropriate gasket-in-a-tube substitutes.


Also, are all Deves rings for the 2000 type IV engine pistons the same??  I 
mean, are there different qualities, like some made in India and others made 
in Brazil or Germany, and are the oil rings the same in all Deves ring sets 
for the 2000 type IV engine pistons??

Thanks
