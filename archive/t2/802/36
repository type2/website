Subject: Re: [T2] 1975 westy gas tank filler, replacement sequence

Can one get gas cans (plastic) filled at a gas station?
What if you took 2 5-gallon gas containers and had
them fill that. Then drive home and fill your tank
yourself! Kind of a pain, but it might be worth it
if you can get away with it.
