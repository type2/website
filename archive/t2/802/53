thanks to all that replied.  having now seen pictures of a helicoil that
is in fact what i pulled off of the drain plug.  so basically someone
threaded the helicoil into the case and stuck the drain plug in and
mashed it all together so it doesn't leak.  does that about sum it up?
this raises a few more questions...

1.  timesert and redrilling and tapping both will require the engine be
pulled, or can the bottom come off so all the little metal chunks can be
removed?

2.  it's obvoiusly been leak free with the helicoil fix in place, so why
not go with another helicoil if it saves me from having to pay to have
the engine dropped or whatever a timesert fix would require?

3.  as far as rubber plugs go are these called expansion plugs?  freeze
plugs?  i can't seem to find much searching the local auto parts store
websites.

4.  ok.  i have to ask.  what the heck is a FLAPS?
