Subject: oil change gone bad

after draining the oil i went to put the drain plug back in and it
wouldn't go.  a closer look showed metal in the threads on the drain plug
...

... at this point i can't get the drain plug in.  i'm guessing that this
isn't easily fixed, and that the bottom of the ?case? needs to be
replaced.  is case the right part?  if i can't get the plug back in and i
need a tow truck do i need to request a flat bed?  can i hook a tow rope
up to it somehow?  does anything ever go as planned when working on these
things, or do i need to adjust the plan to make that happen?

uggh!
