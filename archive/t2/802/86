Subject: Re: [T2] Pulling bay window gas tank

Has anyone tried getting to the gas tank by means of the back seat?
It'd be nice if you could cut out that panel and put hinges on it
or something to seal it back up. Seems like it would be easier
to pull the back seat than the engine.  ..just a thought.
