Mark / Volks,

When you say flush the case with kerosene do you mean put kerosene in the
oil filler tube and let it run through the engine and out the drain hole?
This is all really new to me, so assume i know NOTHING :)

If I use a helicoil wouldn't the case have been rethreaded so another
helicoil should drop right in?  Any change a timesert would?
