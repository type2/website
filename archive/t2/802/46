I was in Oregon two months ago and was surprised to see people pumping
there own gas at the rear pumps of the Klamath Falls Chevron. As they
pumped our gas I walked back to see what was going on. It was a
Pacific Pride outlet of Cardlock Fuels. I once looked into getting a
Cardlock account. That might be one way to go.
