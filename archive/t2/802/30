Subject: FS: 78 Bay Parts

I have a 78 Bay Parts bus that I'm going to be tearing down.

 

If you have anything that you'd like from it, I'll be able to bring the
parts to JBB.

 

Some of whats there:

 

'H' Style AC, complete with compressor.

Front and Rear seats, no middle seat.

Dash board and all of its components

 

Lots more. Just ask.

 

Dave
