Subject: Trade 2 buses for 1 bug or ghia

Hey Y'all,
I have got a couple of buses I am trying to move. One
is a running 72 deluxe, the other is a 79 parts donor
for the 72. I'm looking to trade BOTH for a road
worthy bug or ghia.
Heres the link to the ad:

Let me know if you have anything.
Peace, John Baker
