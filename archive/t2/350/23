Subject: Re: [T2] Cold-hot idle mystery

Unlikely that the thermo-time switch would affect the cold idle.  The
thermo-time switch controls the cold start valve so its failure could make
for hard starting; once the starter is out of the game there's no power to
the thermo-time switch so it shouldn't have anything to do with after-start
idle.
