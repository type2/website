Subject: living in a bus in NC

Hi everyone.
It has been a long time since I have been on the list, but i am back and 
need some advice.
I am currently living in the Chapel Hill, NC area and am looking for a good 
junk yard near by.
Also, I am going to begin living in my bus this month and will continue to 
do so through  the summer.
Although I have taken many road trips in my 79 westy I have never stayed in 
it for more than a month.
Any expereince and advice would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Kyle
79 Westy
