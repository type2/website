Talked to the PO, and he said that they got the bus home one night by tying
a rope to the clutch lever and running the rope under the bus and up to the
driver's window and shifting "by pull".

Personally, I'd gather from that that the cable needs replacing?

Took the steering wheel up to see what was wrong with the turn signal
switch.  First, all four screws were there, though all were loose.  Second,
the two curved "arms" that are part of the turn signal lever and arc around
the steering wheel shaft to engage the switch mechanism, are broken
completely off!

I was able to recover the two arms, and could cast a new lever, but wasn't
sure if the switch itself comes apart.  Looked like it was one piece with
the lever?  this isn't an enclosed switch like in the Haynes, but appears to
be an open setup that includes all of the switches in the column.  Parts
pic/diagram anyone?

At least I cleaned up all of the horn contacts and now Giacomo his voice
back. :O)
