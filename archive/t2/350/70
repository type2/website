"I made quite a dent in the beam today when I did the screwdriver

Has anyone tried pre-treating their 'New' beam from the inside, before 
installing it as a replacement?  What sorts of products would be good for 
this sort of project?  Cosmoline?  I ask because I bought a NOS VW front 
beam last year, and I am considering tackling this project this spring.

ThanksIA
