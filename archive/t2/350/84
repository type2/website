I ordered a new actuating lever from VWOA for about $7 but the angle of the 
dangle was slightly different, enough of a difference that it over stressed 
the cable by causing it to bend at the swaged fitting till metal fatigue 
caused a fractured cable.
I put the old lever back on with another new cable and things have been fine 
every since.
I suppose if I had changed my adjustment spec to limit the movement of the 
lever it would work as well.
