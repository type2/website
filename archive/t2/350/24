Subject: Need May VW Trends w/ Everbus article- can't find it

A sign of the times- checked the usual magazine stand and 2 major
bookstores and no VW Trends!  Can anyone who has seen them on the stand
email me about me paying you to send me one? If not, perhaps scanning
the article? Thanks- I'd like to have the Everybus Article.
