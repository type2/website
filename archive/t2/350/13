Subject: Looking for Bondo in all the wrong places

Hello list,

I will soon be buying a bus in another state.  My only experience with 
VWs is My ex-72 beetle, '90 Fox, and '02 Jetta, and I don't know 
*anything* about the peculiarities of busses.  So, I need some advice, 
please.

One of the busses I'm looking at has been recently painted.  Since I 
can't see the original surface, this makes me wary.

How do I identify areas where filler has been used (incorrectly)?  I 
know it has legitimate uses, I'm talking about big gaping voids in 
quarter panels, rocker panels, and noses that have been filled.

Thanks in advance for all replies.

Dave Newman
