Subject: Turn Signal Relay Nightmare.... I'm desperate.

Hey Everyone,

I cannot get my turn signals or emergency flashers to work.  I followed
the Bentley manual to the letter.

Here is what I have tried:
1.  After following the steps in the Bentley manual, it seemed that the
emergency relay was bad.  So, I was able to get two from a junk yard.  I
tested them both and they both are good.  I connected one of them and
nothing worked, tried the second one and nothing worked.

2.  Thinking that it might be a ground issue, I tried to create a new
ground wire and attach it to the frame, same place for the radio.  Nothing
happens.

Using my test light, I get current on the following prongs of the relay
(with the wires on them).  The +, 15, and 30.  When I pull the emergency
relay knob to the out position I get a strong green light in the console,
but the bulb does not come on.  When I get the green light on the console,
I don't get any current on any of the other prongs.

Am I doing something wrong?  Maybe I am making a stupid mistake somewhere.

Thanks so much in advance,
Don Manzano
