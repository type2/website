Subject: Cold-hot idle mystery

Hello,  I have driven my 1981 automatic for about 4000 miles.

The problem:  It will often stall when idling when cold.  Warm idle is fine.

The Mystery:  The first time I started it this spring (sat for 3 months) it
idled GREAT when cold - but now after 100 miles it's back to it's old
problem of stalling out when idling cold.

Any ideas why?

Thanks,
Steve
