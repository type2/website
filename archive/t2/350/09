Mine is about an eighth of an inch on each side, if you find the right
height!  Another good reason to have a roof rack!

OTOH, the yard boys at the lumber yard were amazed that a 4x8 sheet fit at
all!

No pics, as I only saw it once.  really simple, though.  Just pieces of
square tubing that slid into the jack points, secured by a pin behind the
jack point.  The outer end of the tubing had a 3" piece of flat stock
welded on projecting upward.  The flat stock had a hole drilled in it for
the tiedown, which extends up to the drip rail.

The way I saw it used, a sheet of plywood was placed on the hooks, a
blanket was laid across the top of the plywood to protect the paint, and
two nylon tiedown straps were used between the "hooks" and the drip rail
to secure the load.

I don't think I would want to take this on the freeway without securing
the load better, but for around town it looked like a good setup.
