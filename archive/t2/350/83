That's not a bad idea.  I asked Rancho to give me info on break-in and
related stuff too.  Gee, I may have to break down and use the phone if
they don't answer my email by the weekend.  I'm so spoiled.  (I'm going to
encourage them to add some info on this kind of stuff to their site, like
an FAQ for customers, even indirect ones.)
