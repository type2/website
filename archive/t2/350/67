Blows warm air through the heater channel under the bus into the cabin when
you pull the right red lever.

I have not seen the 74-79 leg for sale on it's own. Junkyard or try
BustedBus.com.

Some people have done that with success. Other methods are documented in the

There is just a relay in the corner by the driver's rear taillight. The
wiring diagram is here, note the use of the fuse:
