Got under the bus and traced the clutch cable from front to back.  No damage
that I could see, except that the dust caps on both ends of the tube are
missing and probably have been for an age or two.

I sprayed 1-2 oz of WD40 down the tube at the rear end and it seemed to free
up the cable some, at least I was able to shift up and down through the
gears better.
