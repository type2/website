First thing to look for is a vaccum leak.... the engine, with all those darn
hoses are full of places where a sizable vaccum leak can develop. My
favorite troubleshooting "tool"  is a roll of duct tape...If I suspect a
leak, I temporarily slap on a wrap of duct tape and see if that fixes it...
also check for any hoses that might have fallen off of their nipples on the
manifold and any cracks in that funky rubber elbow.

After that, you might want to think about checking out the
Thermo-time-switch ...see the Bently for troubleshooting and checking it
out.
