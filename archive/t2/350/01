Bob,

You realized that you have opened up the closed can'o worms on
the tranny lube stuff!

So, I have a couple of questions for the list...
I have a hi/perf F**d that has a manual trans(5spd), but takes
ATF...that's right, *automatic* transmission fluid in a manual trans!

I was having some problems shifting it in cold weather and did a 
search...recomended cure was to add 1/2 half bottle(2 oz?) of F**d 
"fluidizer" and change the tranny lube to *synthetic* at the same time.
So, I did it and the results were amazing...no more shifting problems.
This stuff is apparently hot on the drag race and street rod guys lists
cause the F**d counterman says he sells a *lot* of it....to the chevy and
mopar guys too!


So, when I changed the lube in my 68 bug trans yesterday, I added the last
1/2 bottle of the fluidizer to see what happened....Wow!...really nice 
shifts now(even at 39 degrees this morn).  This is a rebuilt trans with 
about 20,000 miles on it.

Bus content....wonder how it would do in my 78?...and what *is* this 
stuff?...and if F**d can run ATF in a manual trans, what's up with that?

Pro's or cons?...dealership guys?

Cheers, dave
