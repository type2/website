Fuel line inlet inside gas tank.

Dunno about the late bay windows but my '65 Beetle had a wire mesh "sock" 
over it. It rusted away until it began letting junk into the line. Clogged 
it up hard. Required me to run a stiff wire into the fuel line and break 
loose gunk that had settled in the fuel line and solidified. Luckily on the 
bus you'll only have to clean a few inches of fuel line.
