Subject: Re: brown wire revisited and no spark

    Just to make sure I wasn't having a "senior" moment I checked my
Bentley maual with color wiring diagrams.  Brown wires do one of  two
things.  They either connect a circuit to ground or to the computer
analysis plug.  There are no brown wires shown on the coil so maybe
that is supposed to go to the ground tangs underneath the intake air
distribution box that sits on top of your engine.
    I'd suggest you trace the wire back and see where the other end
goes.  If it is already part of a circuit then ground the free end.
