Steve:

It sounds like the aux air valve may not be doing its job.  The aux air
valve is open when the engine is cold raising the idle a bit, sort of like
you were pressing down slightly on the gas.  When the engine warms up the
aux air valve closes down.

Go out to the vehicle in the morning when the engine is cold and detach the
hose running to the aux air valve from its connection at the large "S" hose
and then blow into the hose.  If the aux air valve is open you should be
able to blow into the air distribution box.  If the aux air valve is closed
you won't be able to blow into the air distribution box at all.
