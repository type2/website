Yeah, nowhere unless the seller wants to be sued. :-(
These were available everywhere for years (West Coast Metric,
Motorworks, you name it) until it became known that whoever made them
didn't have a license to use the VW logo. Now, for fear of legal action,
nobody will sell them.  The closest I can get is a similar set that were
made by Volkswagen of Venezuela, which we do come across periodically.
While they are "legit," frankly they're not as nice as on the "bogus"
ones were. They're nice and heavy, but the white logos look like they
were colored in by my 4 year old.  In fact, she would have done a better
job.  (Perhaps she could have applied for the position at the Volkswagen
factory there, if it still existed.:-)  Then again, they're all that's
available (short of perhaps a lucky find at a swap meet), so you take
what you can get...
