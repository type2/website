Subject: Bosch L-Jetronic Tester

I recently acquired a Bosch L-Jetronic Tester. You can learn more about it here:

http://homepage.mac.com/ratwell/L-JetronicTester.html

Until recently I did not know that a Bosch unit even existed. If anyone knows about the history or function of this unit or would like to help me understand it contact me via pmail.
