Who is Todd Hill? Is this good or bad?


I have to add that my transmission is an infamous Todd Hill rebuilt, and it
does have issues.  It started whining last summer, but the whine pretty much
went away.  I do not think that this is lubrication-related, and the Redline
may well have allowed this transmission to continue to live!
