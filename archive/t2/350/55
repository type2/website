Thanks, Richard.

Not only is that bushing missing, but the hole is as bit wallowed out.  The
pics that you provided made recognition of the problem a matter of seconds.
Thanks.

Is that bushing soft or hard?  With the hole wallowed out, do you think I
should use a brass washer of appropriate size, or try to fit the OEM bushing
in the hole?
