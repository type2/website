To reduce confusion I left out the green lead for the condenser.

There are 3 terminal. Terminal 1 (negative), Terminal 15 (positive) and
Terminal 4 the high tension lead to the distributor cap.

Terminals 1 and 15 both have leads for multiple connections. A Bosch coil
should embossed on top with a 1 and 15 for identification.

With points there should only be four leads connected:

Terminal 15
 - black to heater fan
 - black to backup lights fuse

Terminal 1
 - white to ECU
 - green to condenser

Some busses with the VW computer analysis plug also have a gray/green wire
on terminal 1.
