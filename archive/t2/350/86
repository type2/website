Yep, I agree that a missing/malfunctioning Head Temp Sensor (temp sensor II)
will cause poor performance especially when cold and will make cold starts
difficult. So, I would check that before getting into aux air valve pr the
thermo time switch. It is a small wire thingie that threads into the
driver-side head.
