Subject: rough idle when cold

When I first crank over the FI 2.0L engine in my 78
westy, It idles and runs rough for the first five
minutes or less. What could this be? I would not even
know where to begin looking in the archives, so I put
this question to you, fair type 2 community. I read
Bartnik's explanation of how the cold start valve
works, so I don't think that is the problem.

I just had the engine rebuilt, and everything else is
grand! Just needs to warm up a bit! Doesn't seem to
matter if I let it set and warm up or just start
driving. Still the same results. 
P.S. new fuel pump also.

Thanks,
Matt
