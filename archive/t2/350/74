Subject: RE: [VB] Re: [T2] Good source for Redline MT-90?

Some shops say use anything, even GL5, some say use only GL4.  I went with
GL4 staylube in mine.  I bet it wouldn't be an issue, and if it isn't acidic
to the bronze (don't know), it should be ok if viscocity is correct as well.
Probably the only safe alternative. Isn't the first change at 500 miles or
so, I wonder if gl4 then a switch is a cheaper alternative?

One of the guys in the local club says he uses MT90 in his bike and that
it's more prone to leak, though maybe that's not an issue since everything
on mine is rebuilt, with new seals, gaskets, RTV, etc.

I'm gonna ponder this some more, thinking about Sta Lube GL4 some as well.
I emailed Rancho through their site to get a recommendation from them as
well and will pass on their response.
