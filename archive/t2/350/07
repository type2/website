The aftermarket power window kits (all that I've ever seen anyway) are
basically motors that attach to the same place that your window crank handle
attaches to.  They fit behind the door panel so you don't see them and
there's a plug that covers the hole where the handle used to go so it's all
invisible.  But it still uses your stock window regulator.  If yours is
broken you're going to have to replace it with another one.  Otherwise
you'll have a $150 electric window kit that doesn't do anything but make
some noise (and open/close your passenger window of course).

If you can't find what you need at a yunk yard, check with Joe at Busted Bus
up in Boulder, CO www.bustedvw.com  I don't know what all his business
includes, but I know he's a good guy and he's got TONS of salvaged bus parts
at reasonable prices.  Or just put out a "parts needed" post to the list in
general and specify what it is you need to make yours whole again -
somebody's always parting out a bus somewhere.
