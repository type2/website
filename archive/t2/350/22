That's another reason to buy the spare before the original goes
completely!  You can compare the lengths

Yep, BTDT.  Any 30-year old vehicle will have wear on these parts and the
only solution is to weld 'em up and redrill.  You're then good for
another 30 years!  They take a fair load and reciprocating motion tends
to move any lubricant away from the joint.  Any time you have the pan off
is a good time to remove the clutch pedal and lubricate all moving parts.
