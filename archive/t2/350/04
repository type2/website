Maybe the fresh-air injection ports in the head? Common problem around 74-75
when they system was used (and is generally stripped off now). Easy to check -
just stick your hand in the engine compartment to the front and aft of the
intake manifold at the head - feel for blasts of hot air.

Let me know if you need the fix...
