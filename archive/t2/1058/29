I dare to say with a little searching you can find plenty of supporting
evidence that GM systematically deconstructed the mass transit system of the
Detroit area.

The issue today isn't as much with large cities, it's with the Tier2 cities
(for lack of a better term), that had pretty good trolley and bus systems
back in the 40's that were shut down.
