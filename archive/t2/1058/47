Re: [T2] Re: GM must re-make the mass transit system it murdered

I mostly read w/o posting.

Don't kill this thread. It is hitting the current news right on the head. It's
Friday! Let us read it.

I don't often ask questions here, but I do email my representatives & senators
to express my concern & opinions.
