The subject is not up for public debate.B  This list is for discussion
of type2VWs only.B  Not bugs, not ghias, not Volvo station wagons, not
Corvair vans.B  Certainly not mass transit or failing domestic
automakers.B  I don't know how I can be any clearer than that.B  Here
is my favorite quote from the charter:


"If you think the message you're sending is so important that the "bus
content" rule does
not apply to you, that means that you should ==NOT== post it."

One of the reasons this list is intelligent and civil is because its
intelligent, civilB membersB choose notB to have their mailbox flooded
with off-topic posts.B  Please respect that.B  I guarantee you that if
this list is opened up to other subjects, most of the members will
leave and then you will have... just another mailing list.


If anyone wants to discuss this further, e-mail me PRIVATELY.B  Do not
post any more on thissubject to the list.
