	Comments so far are fine with this old carb fan.

	Having spent considerable periods doing 20 mph flat-out in 
2nd on a good, stock 36 hp splittie clawing up to those skifields in 
your district, I can testify to the large power-loss when the Typ 1 
motor, tuned carefully for sea-level, is driven at your altitude.
	For both cooling and power, pay particular attention to that 
big 'gasket' sealing the gap between the horiz engine tin and the 
fixed engine-compartment platform.  (Someone may give us its official 
name.)  I've expouned making your own, of Armathane or similar 
closed-cell foam tube.
	You could try widening the scoops which take the air into 
that compartment.  At speed, if not at 20 mph, that may help.

	If you can access exhaust-gas analysis, your diagnosis will 
be better and you can monitor effects of any fixes.


Keep on truckin'
