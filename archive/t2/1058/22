Hellllllllooooooo there group!
 
I recently purchased a green & white 1972 bus, now named "Gamera" although I
was hoping she would be a bit faster turtle. I was told she had a few issues
and recetly had the engine out to take care of a few of them.
 
The engine was almost falling out! All of the bolt were loose, less than
finger tight and the passenger side exhaust manifold was falling out. I drove
it for about a week or two like this not knowing. Then it started loosing
power like it was running on two or three cyl. which was hard to tell as it
backfired sooo much. I think from the loose exhaust man.
 
Engine came out...my son's learned a bit about VW engine removal that day.
 
So I tightened everything up, replaced the exh. man., muffler, new wires, cap,
rotor, plugs, added a Pertronix elec. ignition, new fuel lines/filters,
adjusted the valves, changed the oil and filter ad cleaned the screen. We
replaced the engine and today I went to hook up a few last wires, hoses and
nuts turned the carb screws in all the way and backed them out 2 1/2 turns,
and started her up.
 
I do live in Lake Tahoe at about 7,000 feet too. She seems to not have all the
power she should and is still backfireing. Timed (-at-) 5 deg after. What should I
be looking for here guys? Any suggestions? I am thinking about a compression
test...
 
Oh, Will...thanks for the junk yard info and the muffler is yours anytime you
wish to pick it up.
