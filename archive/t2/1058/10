Couldn't agree more, Will and everyone else. I've been a soft lurker for

a few people through the list and through AIRS. Donated in the past and will
donate again. I read every day and look forward to the questions and answers
(and am sometimes disappointed when the answers go through pmail and I never
see the conclusion....)
