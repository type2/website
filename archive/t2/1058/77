I found the instructions for checking dizzy advance in my Bentley manual.1.
The book says to disconnect the vacuum from the distributor and set thetiming
to 7.5 degrees btc. this was ok to start with, no adjustment needed.2. Run the
rpm up to 1600 rpm. Should get 9-14 degrees. I got about 19degrees.3. Run the
rpm up to 3400 rpm. Should get 21-25 degrees. I got about 31degrees. Is my
distributor advancing too far at higher rpms? If so what can I do aboutit? How
can I be sure I have the correct dizzy in my engine? It is a vacuumadvance
dizzy and seems to keep timing stable even at 3600 rpm. I'm thinking Ineed to
set the initial timing lower than 7.5 degrees to lower it in theupper rpm
ranges, but won't that cause low power coming off idle, and lesspower at
highway speeds? Does this have something to do with worn out advancesprings in
the distributor?Thanks

Those are the correct specs BUT Bentley neglected to mention that you need to
add the 7.5 initial timing to them!  Or if you don't want to do the math, set
your timing to zero.

Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 8-12deg Adv (-at-) 7.9 In. Hg; Centrifugal: 9-14deg (-at-)
1600 rpm, 21-25deg (-at-) 3400 rpm

9-14 + 7.5 = 16.5-21.5    Your 19 is right there in the middle.

21-25 + 7.5 = 28.5-32.5   Your 31 is right where it should be.

Leave the vacuum hose on and set timing to 7.5. Run it up to 3500-4000 and
look at the timing. It SHOULD be at the O in VOR!  Which is 100% correct and
the way VW designed it. Revving it in neutral is NOT the same as driving it
down the road under a load. Under a load, vacuum advance goes away when you go
past half throttle. Then you have only 31 degrees of advance. Not the 42-45 it
shows when you rev it.
