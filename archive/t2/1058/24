Subject: RE: [T2] 72 bus issues

I would suggest checking the compression on all the cylinders, to rule out
any valve issues with the heads.

if it is  still running the original fuel pump(not electric) , and is a type
4 engine, I would be suspect of it causing a lean backfire  condition, but
if you are running a weber progressive you may just need rejetting.
