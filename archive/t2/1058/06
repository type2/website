Subject: Vintage VW Jack?

I work maintenance in a mobile home park, and we're moving older homes out
to make room for lots suited to RV's.  When we moved  one this morning, I
was surprised to find a Bilstein DBP auto jack under the home.  It looks
almost exactly like the one on this webpage, except that the base is concave
in the opposite direction.

It's got some surface rust, but might clean up okay after a good long soak
in some cleaner and lubricant.

Would I be right in assuming that it's from a Beetle?  I'm pretty sure that
it's not tall enough to lift a bus.
