Hi Bruce,

Remove and cap off the vacuum line on the retard side, and time the  
bus to 7.5 degrees BTDC. The retard circuit on the distributor is  
notorious for causing accelleration issues. A compression test  
certainly couldn't hurt; a bit more data can always be useful.

That'd my recommendation.

Happy Trails,
