Subject: Dakota Digital cylinder head temp sensor

Hey Everyone,
I just received my new Dakota Digital CHT sensor and thought I'd give my 
initial review - WOW!  What a great package!  I haven't hooked it up yet 
but it already looks very impressive.  Documentation is very clear and 
explains everything.  They even include shrink wrap for the two 
connections and it just looks like a very well thought out product.  If 
the readings are as good as their presentation, I think this will make 
for a very good pick should you be looking for a good quality head temp 
sensor.

Btw, the VDO CHT sensor, in my opinion, is a waste of money.  The Dakota 
Digital is temperature compensated (the VDO is not) so it doesn't deal 
with that whole ambient temperature mess.  I don't feel that I should 
have to do any special math to figure out what my head temp readings are 
- I just want to read the number and drive.  Plus, the Dakota Digital 
sensor will blink should you reach your preset warning temp - this is 
great when you have a friend driving and you want to make sure they pay 
attention to the head temps!!

So yeah, looks really good so far.  Based on my initial impressions and 
Richard's write-ups, don't waste your money on the VDO and get yourself 
a DD sensor!  I'll letcha know how it is when I get it installed!

Here's the link to Richard's page with the DD sensor details:
