Syd,
All fuel in my area has 10% ethanol to supposedly reduce emissions. Having
been in the two wheeled classic bike world for the last few years, there has
been a lot of talk there about ethanol indirectly causing higher temps. The
idea goes something like this, Ethanol reduces the available BTU in the fuel
therefore less horsepower is produced for a gallon of fuel. Riders (in this
case drivers) are used to the power of there machines before ethanol was
added. Rider applies more throttle to get the power they are used to. Engine
is forced to work harder to produce given horse power and in doing so produces
more heat.

I have no idea if this explanation is right or not, but if it is, could have
something to do with my troubles.

  Im not sure..but the use of Ethanol fuel, might be a cause to investigate,
  since that fuel was not available, and is maybe causing 'bad chemistry' in
  your fuel system!
