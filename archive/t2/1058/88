Not again.

(Actually, I *think* I've solved this conundrum.)

I thought I had isolated the cutting out of the Guacamole Bus when I
replaced the distributor. Twas not to be. A couple weeks ago it started it
up again. (I don't know about ya'll, but mine only starts doing that crap
again when my wife gets in the bus. Coincidence?) I decided to take a
different tack.

After kicking the famdamily out of the bus, I verified it was doing it
again, then pulled over and wiggled ONE wire. I worked my way through the
wires, pulling over, wiggling ONE, driving, pulling over, etc. I isolated it
to a break in the tach trigger wire. Someone here mentioned this wire WAY
back when but it passed all my continuity tests with the harness out. So I
had marked it as good.

I pulled the connector off the ecu and spliced a new wire into the wire
where it went into the connector. I used one of those super cool screw on
splices. Ran that wire back to the coil and hooked it all up.

This was last week and it's been rock solid since.

Apparently mucking about in the engine compartment would result in nudging
this wire just enough that the connection wherever it's bad would make
contact again resulting in it what I thought was success. This wire tells
the ECU when to fire the injectors, so without it no fuel is provided to the
engine.

I hope this is it. Then I'll budget for a rebuilt wiring harness sometime in
the future. (Actually, it's already there.)
