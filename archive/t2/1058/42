Subject: Linkage Friday

Hi,

I'm making a linkage for my weber progressive so that a standard throttle 
cable lines up properly on my type 1 engine. Currently I have an alternate 
torture path tube running thru the fan housing around the dog house cooler, 
the exit of which points to the standard throttle link on the carb. Will let 
you all  know how it turns out.

David, isn't it open line Friday? The thread started last night here, but 
Friday on the other side of the dateline.

Cheers!
Chris
