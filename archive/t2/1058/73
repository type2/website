	Good to recognise a fellow classic motorcycles fan.
	I've been in touch over several decades with a range of 
advocates & opponents of the fuel you mention, E10.
	The theory you mention assumes of course that a motor tuned 
accurately for ordinary petrol  -  call it E0  -  will give less 
power, all else being equal, on E10.  Could we hear some facts on 
whether it works out that way?
	The issue is at most minor, in your context.  If the 
octane-raising effect of the ethanol is used to save genuine octanes, 
i.e E10 of a specified octane rating is marketed as a substitute for 
E0 of that same octane rating, the effect you fear will be more 
likely than if 10% ethanol is dissolved in the same 'petrol proper' 
as used to attain that octane rating.
	Of course, if the engine has been carefully re-tuned after 
switching to E10, the ignition may be further advanced and, esp if CR 
is raised,  you could get more power with no different mpg or 
overheating.
	I could burble on, but my main reaction is that the whole 
plurry issue is minor compared with whatever turn out to be your main 
problems.
	Is the intake to your fan, or even the blades, somehow fouled 
so as to decrease cooling?  The metal-gauze filter largely blocked by 
oily grass clippings, all non-standard in my fan intake (Typ 1), cost 
me a rebuild  ...  Better keep trusting your thermometer till you 
have good reason to doubt it, and keep looking for odd causes of 
overheating.
