Subject: Brake Fliud resevoir OK, I must be looking at the wrong sites. I am
trying to purchase a Brakefluid and a windshield washer reservoir for a 68
double cab. Does anyone knowof a site or company that sells them or is it back
to the bone yard I go? I was
hoping to get new/aftermarket if possible as I'm restoring and fulfillingmy
long overdue dream/nightmare! Any help would be greatly appreciated.

For a 68, the upper brake reservoir is ONE-YEAR-ONLY!!!

Looks like it is kidney shaped and has a metal tube down to the lower. No one
makes new ones or repros them. They look like this: [you will notice a crack,
a weak point in them]

Your best "repair" is to replace the lower and the tube with the 69-70 pieces.
The tube is plastic/nylon. Looks like this:

But I would not use the 69-70 round upper. It self-destructs as easily as the
68 upper.

Best choice for the upper is the 71-73 square one behind the drivers seat. It
is made of much better material.
