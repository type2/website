You mean the old Beetle Widow-maker??? VBG! Yep, looks like a Beetle jack.

I have them and have used them but a couple times the vehicle 
rolled/slide forward and the jack let me down. I still like the design, 
wish the jack point on the car was better braced. More like the bus.

That said I like them a whole-lot more than a scissors jack.
