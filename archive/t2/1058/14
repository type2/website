I was wondering why someone would fiddle with two tie rods when they could
do the job easier with a single adjustment of the drag link!

Of course, the drag link will only adjust in 1-turn increments so it might
not be possible to get it exactly horizontal.

Not much of a concern to me, since the steering wheel of my bus has been
about 80 degrees from horizontal since I got the bus in 1990.  I don't
have a puller to reset the wheel and it didn't respond to shadetree
techniques.  I'd rather keep the steering box happy than have the wheel
horizontal.
