Subject: Transmission ground strap

I want to take this opportunity to stress the importance that you have a well
connected, viable ground strap between the transmission and the frame of your
bus.
 
On my recently purchased, all original, one-owner 6V '63 Bug, there was an
intermittant starting problem, i.e. you'd turn the key, the lights would dim
but no activity from the starter most of the time.  It took me 15 minutes to
take the ground strap off, clean the ends of it until shiny and reinstall it
securely.  Now, the starter on that little 6 volt bug spins over faster than
some of my 12V VW's first time and every time.  What a delight it is to own.
