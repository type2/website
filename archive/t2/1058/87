and like our old buses sometimes if it ain't broke don't fix it..  one
of the things I do when I'm not working on or driving my bus is work
with the W3C/WAI.   What is that, to make it a little simple the W3C
is the world wide body that sets standards for the internet.   the
subcommittee WAI or Web Access Initiative is the group within the W3C
that sets the standards for accessible usage of the web.

very bluntly the web was probably more accessible to a higher
percentage of users (not totals) in 1996 than it is today, mainly
because of what we call "eye candy" stuff that has little or no
function just there for pretty.

pretty is fine if it degrades nicely but very few websites do this.

not publicized here but www.type2.com is one of the examples we hold
up as a "very accessible and well designed site"   why.  because it
can be used by just about any browser in the world at any speed and
works well with all the adaptive and odd contraptions used to access
the web.

imagine trying to use the web if you are blind, (don't laugh one of
the better VW engine rebuilders is blind)   but not only that but
people trying to access the site via hand held devices, on a slow link or in
some out of the way place in South America.  this is after all the
WORLD wide web.

and while the web may work fine with Windows (what version) what about
Apples, linux, solaris, BsD, unix and a thousand other operating
systems in use around the world.  the current type 2 list works in
every system it has ever been tried with using browsers as advanced as
the latest Firefox and as old as Lynx.

nothing more frustrating than being stranded, getting onto the site,
and not being able to actually see the solution to ones problem.

so I highly encourage the website administrators to tred lightly when
changing the basic layout of the website.

and I sincerely thank those who have spent their hard earned VW
driving and wrenching time to keep a website running for the rest of
us herd of wildebeasts.
