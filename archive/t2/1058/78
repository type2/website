1. The book says to disconnect the vacuum from the distributor and set
the timing to 7.5 degrees btc. this was ok to start with, no adjustment
needed.

2. Run the rpm up to 1600 rpm. Should get 9-14 degrees. I got about 19
degrees.

3. Run the rpm up to 3400 rpm. Should get 21-25 degrees. I got about 31
degrees.

As I understand it the figures you have quoted are the degrees of
advance. You have to add them to the initial advance to get the total
advance. This would mean that your observed figures are within spec.
That said, there is a school of thought that you should limit
centrifugal advance to give a total advance of 28 degrees. Yes this
would reduce the initial advance in your case.
