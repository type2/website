Yes, I suppose it has. I suspect "reply" would have been a better choice 
than "reply-all".

So has the Type II list ever started an off topic sister-list where list 
members can ramble and rant together? I know it has been brought up a 
few times over the years.The Corvair guys have a VV list (virtual vairs) 
and then they have the VV-Talk list. Lots of soapboxes getting used up 
over there, but those are Corvair guys. They're "different" <griN!>

I know on other lists as long as the subject was labeled with "Off 
Topic" there was some leeway.

I can see it both ways. Yeah it's off topic because there is no specific 
Type2 in it but on the other hand it's still about owning a vehicles 
like ours in and the current state of things.

Sure, I can go thousands of places to debate and discuss stuff but I 
like do that with the type of folks that meet up here. We are a certain 
kind of people brought together by our admiration of the VW Type IIs 
from '68-'79. Discussions are intelligent and civil. Now that's a tough 
thing to find on the internet. <griN!>

Thanks for your patience and have a great weekend all!
