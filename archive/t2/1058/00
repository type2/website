  Anyway, while I was installing the woodstove, I toyed with the idea of
  installing a very small one in our bus.  Found some plans on the 'Net for
  some custom jobs, but thought that I could come up with something I liked
  better on my own.  Never settled on a design, and won't now until I 
replace
the bus, but it was a novel idea to play with.  I figure that it would need
  to be an efficient woodstove design rather than a "fireplace" or "pot 
belly
  stove" design.
