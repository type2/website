Man, I wish... They'd screw it up somehow though... 8,000 lbs, twice the 
size, half the mileage and it would have some engine that would make the 
early aircooled engines  seem advanced... It would be more like a school 
bus than a VW.

Just kidding. They aren't that bad.

Going out to work on my VW. (the other one... shhh!)

Have a great weekend.
