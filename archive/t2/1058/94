Subject: Re: [T2] Running hot- I have NOT found the trouble

Don, I pulled the spark plug wires and used an inspection mirror and
flashlight. I bought the engine as a long block and put my tin on it. If there
were any spark plugs or sockets in there I would know about them. As an
alternate test I started the engine with the boots around #1 & #3 spark plug
wires pulled back from the tin, Got a good breeze at the spark plug holes.
Also shined flashlight in the spark plug holes after dark with the engine off.
Looked under the engine from the back, I could see the light shining through
the fins and lighting up the tin below the engine. Had to move the flash light
around to get confident there was nothing stuck in the fins.

That's a good call on your part though. I've found plenty of junk under the
tin on several engines back when I worked on Beetles and buggies.

  How have you confirmed this? Did you drop the engine and pull the tin?
  Actually, you can pull just the fan and shroud and look in. You may just
see
