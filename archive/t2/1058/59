I did a compression test today and found #1 & 2 cyl were (-at-)80 lbs. #3 & 4 were
85 & 50 lbs. So I am thinking its time for new heads & perhaps cyl.
 
Any recomondations for parts? Speed and price are major factors here as I do
not have a garage (snow is comming any day now) and my pockets are lean LOL!
 
Thanks for all the imput I received too. Soon to be pulling the engine again
