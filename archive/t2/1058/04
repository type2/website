Subject: Why you/we must press on regardless

Listees;

This is an example......

"Actually, it's pretty simple IF you know the differences between 68-71 and
72 only wiring.  It boils down to this:

Ignore the Black w/Red Stripe, Black w/Yellow Stripe and Grey w/Black Stripe
wires coming from the replacement switch.  These are what operate the Rear
Turn and Stoplight circuits on the 68-71, which were Double Filament Single
Bulbs (1157) for each side"

                            .......of why this marvelous resource must 
not be allowed to pass from the scene.
The collective wisdom of Jim Thompson, et al, is too valuable to lose.

I've been a quiet listee since the days of Ken Hooper, Joe Fournier, Bob 
Hoover and their exalted colleagues. Post hardly at all - just a few 
questions, have fewer solutions and have had little time for 
conversation. But I've always read the posts (digest mode) and value 
this widespread community, not only for its wisdom and experience, but 
its varied values as well.

Really all I can contribute, other than good will, is a few bucks, as I 
have in the past. Don't have much and the economy has me reeling like 
many of you, but I'm in for at least a C note a year to keep going. I'll 
send it ASAP.
