Subject: Re: [T2] Running hot- I have NOT found the trouble

Karl!
So glad you are still on this list. Thanks for pointing out my
misunderstanding of the manual. Now that you've explained it, the manual makes
sense. Unfortunately, what you have clarified, kills my trouble found
statement, but gets me one step closer to solving the puzzle.

To review, this is where I'm at:
1. No obstructions to cooling air flow.
2. Electrical tests of all fuel injection devices test ok per Bentley manual.
3. Fuel pressure tests ok
4. Temp sensor 2 tests ok at low and high temps.
5. Timing and advance tests ok.
6. Previously checked and repaired all vacuum leaks I could find.

Possible causes not yet tested:
1. Dirty injectors
2. 10% Ethanol in Gas
3. Bad CHT gauge

If anyone has any ideas that should be added to my possible causes list,
please let me know.

I've been going through my maintenance log and now think I should discard the
thought that E10 may be causing my troubles directly, seems I've been using
the stuff since well before the trouble started. There is a possibility it may
have indirectly caused my trouble. Ethanol is known to degrade rubber and some
synthetic rubber compounds and could be eating my fuel hoses from the inside
out. Ethanol has a high affinity for water, so much so it will pull the
moisture right out of the air if there is any humidity present. In the bike
world this is causing lots of problems with rusting of unlined fuel tanks
causing fouled carbs. Bikes don't usually have fuel filters but buses do. Much
of my fuel delivery lines are metal, so there is a chance I'm getting some
rust that way.  Seems either drawback of ethanol would result in clogging of
the injectors.

Thanks
Tom

  Those are the correct specs BUT Bentley neglected to mention that you need
to
  add the 7.5 initial timing to them!  Or if you don't want to do the math,
set
  your timing to zero.

  Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 8-12deg Adv (-at-) 7.9 In. Hg; Centrifugal: 9-14deg
(-at-)
  1600 rpm, 21-25deg (-at-) 3400 rpm

  9-14 + 7.5 = 16.5-21.5    Your 19 is right there in the middle.

  21-25 + 7.5 = 28.5-32.5   Your 31 is right where it should be.

  Leave the vacuum hose on and set timing to 7.5. Run it up to 3500-4000 and
  look at the timing. It SHOULD be at the O in VOR!  Which is 100% correct
and
  the way VW designed it. Revving it in neutral is NOT the same as driving it
  down the road under a load. Under a load, vacuum advance goes away when you
go
  past half throttle. Then you have only 31 degrees of advance. Not the 42-45
it
  shows when you rev it.
