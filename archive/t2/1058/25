Just be sure you use a properly sized wire. For instance, if you use a 12
gauge wire from the battery to the fan shroud and the strap from the trans
fails, all of that starter current will travel through the 12 gauge wire and
light it up.

I used a 4/0 gauge wire for my trans ground and starter hot.

"To take from one, because it is thought that his own industry and that of
his fathers has acquired too much, in order to spare others, who, or whose
fathers have not exercised equal industry and skill, is to violate
arbitrarily the first principle of association, 'the guarantee to every one
of a free exercise of his industry, and the fruits acquired by it.'"
