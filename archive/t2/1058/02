Subject: Generator light stays on?

Hey guys,

     I have a 1973 VW Bus with a brand new 1971 Main Harness from Bus Boys. It's got an 1800cc hydraulic Type-4 motor with Webber Progressives. I believe that I've hooked everything up correctly, but the generator light stays on the entire time that the engine is running. I'm pretty confident that the battery is getting charged properly since I've had that battery for something like 3 years now, and the Bus has never felt like it was running out of power. If course, I've maybe put 100 miles a year on it...

What can I do to fix that, do I have something crossed?




Thanks!

Todd
