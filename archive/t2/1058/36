Subject: Re: Cleaning rusty threads

I use a wire wheel on my bench grinder. It works beautifully and since my grinder is mounted on a small grinder stand, I bring it out to my van and clean them all up. I also use it on my motorcycle bolts, then apply a light coating of spray-on oil based preservative of your choice. Works VERY well, bolts come up like new.
