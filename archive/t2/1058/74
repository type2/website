Robt Mann asked:The theory you mention assumes of course that a motor tuned
accurately for ordinary petrol  -  call it E0  -  will give less
power, all else being equal, on E10.  Could we hear some facts on
whether it works out that way?

The difference is minimal
A gallon of gas has about 115000 btus of  energy.
A gallon of ethonal has about 75000 btus.
The equation to figure out  the btus in a gallon of e-10 would look like 
this:
.9G + .1E = E10 with G being the btus in a gallon of gas and E being the 
btus in a gallon of ethanol and E10 being the btus in a gallon of E10
.9x115000 +.1x75000 = E10 or
104400+7500=111900 a loss of only 3100 btus or about a 2.7 percent loss in 
btus.
in terms of gas mileage this would be about a half mile per gallon in a bus 
that normally got 20mpg.
