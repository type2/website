Subject: Running hot

I guess I need to reintroduce myself. I've been lurking in the background for
quite a while. I have a 1980 Vanagon with an engine that was rebuilt by AVP
several years ago. I sold off my 1975 bus because it just wasn't getting any
use. I've been distracted from my bus simply because it's been running so well
over the last few years & the fact that I've been busy restoring 3 motorcycles
to road worthy condition.

Here is my situation:
Engine starts, idles and runs great. Nice and smooth with no stumbles,
backfires or popping. According to my cylinder head temp gauge, things are
getting quite hot at speeds above 45 mph. I don't know how much I trust the
gauge but it does show a trend here. Up to 45 mph I get temps around 300
degrees to 350 degrees depending on terrain.  If I go over 45 mph The temps
climb to 400 degrees. I realize these temps are probably not entirely accurate
because this gauge is not temperature compensated, but I never used to get
temps above 350 degrees.

This is what I know so far:
1. Checked for vacuum leaks, found and repaired 2 minor leaks. No change in
temps.

2. Timing is good at 7 deg. I still need to check total advance.

3. Idle set at 900 rpm. If left to idle , cht temps around 250 degrees.

4. Tested co levels with a Gunson gas tester. (Not the best tool but it's all
I have). With the engine warmed up, the lowest co I can get is 3.0% at idle,
when I run the engine speed up to 2000 rpm I get 0.5 on the Gunson tester.
Seems a bit lean, doesn't it? I have tried to richen the mix by adjusting the
bypass on the AFM to get 5.5% at idle, but I still get 0.5% at 2000 rpm.

Here is my suspicions:
1. Clogged injectors? My bus doesn't get a lot of use, so it's possible they
may be getting clogged with fuel varnish and not able to deliver full flow at
high rpm.
2. Low fuel pressure, weak fuel pump or clogged filter.
3. AFM going bad, I hope not, I bought a rebuilt one a couple of years ago.

Here is my question:
What is the wisdom of the type2 community? I'm feeling like I'm missing
something here, so your help and ideas are most appreciated.

Thanks,
Tom
