hey Mike, glad you got it back in OK--timing will depend on your distributor, I can't remember if you have a dual vac. dizzy on there or not.  if you don't have the stock '72 distributor (anything can happen over the years), chances are that timing will be something different.  if you don't have a "retard" vacuum line hooked up, mayeb time it at 7.5 BEFORE (will work for most). look up the dist. on www.oldvolkshome.com/ignition.htm and time to that spec.  

I'm headed out of town for the weekend but can check it out next week.  We can put a strobe on it and see what is going on.
