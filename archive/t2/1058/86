I would try to figure out if your gauge has gone bad for one. Has anyone 
tried an infrared temp gun and where do we "shoot" to get a reliable temp?

Has this engine run hot from the beginning? (after the rebuild)

If so - ever checked the compression to see if the compression is too high?

I once had a Beetle with a catalog engine that had issues from before my 
ownership. In the end it died. One of the crank journals got sloppy, 
lots of hammering, and still alot of heat. We came to the educated guess 
that the line bore wasn't straight or the compression was too high.

All of the cheap chrome tin from ??? (JC Whitney?) wasn't sealing or 
doing a good job either but the hot engine problems continued after we 
replaced everything with good VW factory tin.

Do you have all of your tin? Do the flapper work well? Is the thermostat 
in good condition? Cable intact?

Are you running a carb retrofit or stock EFI?
