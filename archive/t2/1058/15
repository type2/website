Since when do we expect the jack to keep the car from moving forward and
back?  That's why wheel chocks were invented!

The biggest complaint that I had with Beetle jacks was that they had a
nasty tendency to slip, which is hard both on my nerves and the jack
point.

One of the first things I added to my Beetle was a bus jack!
