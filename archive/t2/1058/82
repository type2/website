Subject: Baywindow Heating

I was wondering if anyone had any source for heating system information for
our Baywindow buses.  I am specifically looking for diagrams and descriptions
of the heating system for my 1971 Westfalia.  The information in the service
manual is almost non-existent.  I was able to find this article
(http://www.ratwell.com/technical/Heating.html) by our friend Richard Atwell
and it is excellent.  But I can't find anything for the earlier Bays.  My
Westy has a two position knob on the far right of the dash that says, "HEAT"
but I can't tell were the wire goes.  I assume it is a fan somewhere (maybe in
the duct near the junction where it splits to the small vents in the floor
going to the back.

Any help would be great.  If anyone can send me pieces of info together, I
don't mind pulling it all together for a web article.

Thanks,

Michael in Montevallo
