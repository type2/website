By now, every AFM has had it's screws and springs messed with.  Get your 
self a wb o2 sensor and you can see the tune of the AFM while you 
drive.  If it's running too lean, then open it up a few clicks and be 
done with it.  It's one of the best diagnostic tools available at a very 
reasonable price.
