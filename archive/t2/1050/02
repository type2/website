The only goop I recommend on valve cover gaskets is Hylomar, which is a
non-hardening oil-proof sealer.  Hard to find in the US, it's carried at
some Harley-Davidson dealers, part number 99653-85.  Put it on the
valve-cover side of the gasket only.  The gaskets should be replaced every
time the cover comes off.
