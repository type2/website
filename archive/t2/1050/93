That's why you join a local VW Club.  It gets you back into the crack habit.

My crew cab sat for over 10 years.  When I started going to VW shows and
club meets, I was driving it in less than 3 months.  Now I'm scanning the
internet looking for more stuff!  Sheesh, it's worse than crack!

I don't think I'm going to make any shows this year
but not because of gas (I'll find gas money for a bus trip) but
because of unfortunate combinations of family plans, bus problems and
work causing scheduling conflicts...... will even be forced by a work
trip to miss buses by the trax....first time for that campout.
