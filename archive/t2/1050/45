Subject: Re: [T2] Using Carb Fuel tank for Fuel Injection

Hi Dave,

Why the problem with the T? Mine has at least 4" of fuel above the T,
and the pump will always be drawing more gas than the return line flows
back. My VDO fuel pressure gauge says I am right on the money.

Jamie Rivers came up with a different solution; since the early tank
uses a screw-on fitting for the fuel line instead of welding the lines
directly into to the tank he created a replacement fitting with two
lines. Jamie offered to make me a similar part if I wanted one but the T
has been working so well I really don't see the point.

If you can be relaced with a whole different engine and cooling system I
don't see why a little T-fitting would spook you. ;-P

I just read about what some of the X-aircraft folks do - add a header tank. A tank of maybe a quart capacity could easily be rigged to have a connection from the fuel tank to keep it filled and a fitting for fuel out to the pump and a fitting for fuel return. Proper configuration would create a minimum of agitation and assure a steady flow under all conditions. The tank could be as simple as a piece of aluminum tubing with caps welded to both ends as long as there is adequate thickness to thread for fittings.
