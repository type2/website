Subject: Resistor Pack Readings

Thanks to Chris, the specs according to his Vanagon guide say the
resistors should be 5.5ohms to 6.5ohms. Could someone check the T2
bentley and confirm? The L-jetronic guide I have doesn't show squat
for the resistor pack. But I suspect the specs would be the same for
both T2 and Vanagon.

The next question is what happens when 3 of the 4 resistors read
significantly lower than the spec? What are the symptoms? And who has
a resistor pack laying around that meets spec for sale cheap? ;-)

My resistor pack. Numbered beginning at the top left looking at the
wire end and counting clockwise:

1- 6.4ohms
2- 3.5ohms
3- 3.5ohms
4- 3.4ohms

Test was repeated several times with the same results. Also, same
results with the pack plugged in or disconnected.
