Dear Robt

I have not as yet done any schematics or photos of the set up.  It is  
base on your illustrations and instructions (thank you!) with the  
difference of having a 'tee' piece to allow a second
hose to go to the RHS (drivers side for us -- passenger side for the  
northern hemisphere) carburettor.  To connect to the carby I used the  
sealed port where a vacuum line would be
connected on this carby if there was a need.  I drilled a 1mm hole in  
the port to slip the needle into & siliconed it into place (will  
effect a better arrangement later).

Other than that the system is exactly as your illustrations.  As I  
noted, I think the water container (a 3-litre plastic milk bottle)  
probably sitting too high in the engine bay at the moment.
With any more than 1.5 to 2 litres of water it wants to syphon.  I  
will rectify that when time allows to under the auxilliary battery  
tray with an internal engine compartment filling neck.
