Subject: RE: [T2] 1970 Break lights

Jamie:
	I replaced the entire light assembly and side markers on my 72
bus.  I was replacing the main wire harness and since the assemblies
were in bad shape and did not work, I yanked them out also.  Then to my
horror I found out that my wire harness was for a European 72 and my bus
was a North American.  They are different.  I said all that to say this;
The shop manual did not have both schematics, the one I bought at
O'Reilly's did.  When you have both schematics, it shows that all they
did was wire the side markers in series (kind of) with the middle light
(brake?) of the 3 light rear assembly.  The power comes from the middle
light (it has two spades on it) and to the marker light, then to a
ground spade on the bus, just inside the hatch.
	I have not finished wiring, so I do not know if it is correct,
but that is the way the wiring diagram looked to me.  I got the spades
at home depot and the wire also.  Use brown for anything going to
ground, that seems to be a standard.
	I hope that helps more than it confuses, this is my first
restore and it is a B****, I am in over my head!

	In conclusion, the wiring for these is in the North American
wiring diagram.

Anyone have experience replacing the rear lights on a 1970'ish Bus?

Anyone know the correct way to wire these?
