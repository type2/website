I totally agree with Mike about using the Vanagon setup so you have self
adjusting brakes.
Its an easy swap you just need to find the write up Karl did with the correct
parts. I didn't look on the Ratwell site that would be the first place I would
look. If not there I am sure Karl will reply with the info or....errr search
the archives if your not on dial up. Just don't ask to view all the post from
Karl,thats almost as big as the archives themselves. I think Karl and RIchard
should get together and write a reference book for the Baywindows. The hardest
part would be getting past the use of vw names,likeness ect...They could make
the Bentley a book of the past! As it is I can spend hours reading the Ratwell
web site even though I have been involved with these van for years now. The
same goes for Karls posts. He is always including the details you need like
part numbers and sources.
