I would make sure to run the bus for a while and/or drain your oil so it 
can remove the water from the oil.  Who knows if water sitting in the 
cylinders leaked passed stuff and got into the crank case.  That would 
just be my initial worry if I ended up with water-flooded cylinders.

Btw, there is a guy on the megasquirt forums that uses water injection 
on his turbo bug.  You might want to read up on his setup:
