Subject: Bolt size needed please...

On the drive into work today I apparently either lost or broke the top shock mount bolt on my 71 Westy.  I am going to try to pick up a bolt and nut at the local hardware here, so without me having to climb under the bus in my big boy clothes to try to guess the bolt size, can anyone just tell me the length \ diameter of this bolt??
Thanks & PEACE!!
