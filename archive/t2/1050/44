The springs are available - I'll have to see if I can locate the 
reference for you.  Beetle springs don't work, or at least the ones I 
ordered don't.  The bus spring is essentially flat and the Beetle ones 
were curved.  Removing the backing plate is not that difficult in theory 
however mine was "stuck" and I wasn't really sure of the correct way to 
get it off.  More later on that point too.  I removed the backing plate, 
cut the Beetle pieces and then welded the two pieces into the correct 
positions - not the correct repair but it worked. It appeared that the 
original springs fit into a groove and had been "staked" securely in place.
