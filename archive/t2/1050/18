Subject: Westy top

I'm finally getting around to getting the top squared away on my 68 Westfalia.
a few questions:

I put the top from a 71 on, it's much better shape than the one on the 68.
The wood bar at the back(that the two lift assists attach to) has come away
from the fiberglass.   Just glue it back on?  modify it by screwing it back on
from the outside?

I have three pairs of lift assist bars - all different lengths.  Just use
which ever ones seem to fit the best?

Does the old top have any value to anyone?  I have 1 good hinge available for
it.

I don't have any clever tag lines except my favorite old aviation saying "To
make the houses smaller - pull back"
