It's 11mm fo sho.

a good thing about it being 11mm is that in a pinch you can actually  
get an imperial size that is almost exactly equivalent, 7/16". bad  
thing is the inch hose we've tried and the quality is poor compared  
to the genuine article. the hose we supply is german made 11mm, good  
stuff. very expensive unfortunately but it is excellent quality hose.  
we tried a few different hose types for that application and the top  
line stuff was the only one that fit properly. the 10mm one from MB  
is too tight for my liking.
