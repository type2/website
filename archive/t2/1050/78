Hi Adam

Water injection is a very old method of obtaining 'something for  
nothing' in a way.  The aim for me
is to cool the engine temps a little and increase fuel consumption  
slightly.  Additional power is also
a side benefit.

All these gains are not large but are measurable.

For a full explanation on the history of water injection & what has  
been obtained by it is found in
Robert Manns excellent article at:

http://www.kuratrading.com/PDF/WaterInj.pdf

I am not aiming to get some of the spectacular results obtained by  
others in times past as I only
want to introduce water to the fuel mix not other substances such as  
methanol or methylated
spirits, etc.

Hope the link helps
