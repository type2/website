Subject: no arrow on piston

To the list,

I recently bought a new set of AA pistons for my 84 Vanagon 1.9L and
discovered that no where on the pistons are there any arrow to indicate
flywheel direction. Each top has only the letters STD stamped on the rim
along with 94 stamped in the center. If you look on the other side, there is
a blue dot on top of on one side of the wrist pin hole - 3 pistons have it
on the side with a boss sticking up - one piston has it on the other side.
According to Bently, the blue dot means they are a matched set. Does anyone
know how to orient them? Does the raised boss on the wrist pin hole mean
flywheel side? I've e-mailed AA Pistons with this same question but have not
heard back from them. 

 

Any help is appreciated.
