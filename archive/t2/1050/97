Subject: Re: [T2] how is the gas crunch affecting your tripping

With fuel prices over here rising to #1.20/litre  (#5.40 or $9.8/imp gal) I
decided to convert to LPG (Autogas) recently. It cost #1200 to do -
although, with hindsight, I could have done it myself for half that.
I used to average about 23mpg on petrol and over 2500 miles I've been
getting 19mpg on Gas. With LPG at around .55p/litre that is a saving of
around 10p/mile. There are numerous calculators on the net and most will
calculate your money back after about 10,000 miles. I reckon I'm on course
for that.
There are numerous reports about engines running hotter on gas. I have a
Dakota Digital CHT gauge which tells me that I'm running 30-40 degrees F
cooler on gas. There is a slight loss of power going uphill - the revs seem
to fall off quicker, a bit like the early diesels, but ir runs significantly
quieter and smoother. I used to have a hesitation problem on petrol at low
revs in 3rd and 4th gears. That has disappeared with LPG. In winter they
reccomend that you start it on petrol and switch to Gas because the gas is
very cold and needs to be heated before it is combustible (mine is done via
a probe in the heat exchanger). I've only run it in summer so not had the
problem as yet.
The main drawback is the need for a supplementary tank. There are various
options and  went for a 55litre (about 40 usable) in the spare wheel well.
It has been adequate so far but the bigger you can get in the better I
reckon.

Anyway happy to chat with anyone who's interested.

All the best from over the pond.
