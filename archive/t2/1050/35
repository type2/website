Subject: Re: [T2] Pulling to the left

john,

not sure exactly this might apply, but some of the new balljoint  
replacements are very tight, too tight in fact. this can have an  
effect on steering. usually it just makes the whole steering system  
very tight. you might try to jack up the front end and pop the outer  
tierod ends out of the spindles. then turn the steering knuckle on  
each wheel by hand and feel if there is anything that seems odd, like  
one side being much tighter than the other. i would also verify that  
the notches on the balljoints are correctly aligned with the bumps on  
the torsion arms.

will it pull to the left from a straight steering position, or does  
it just "stick" once you are already turned left?

if the latter, it might have something to do with the above, if it  
pulls left while the steering is straight ahead, i can't see the  
tight ball-joint issue being the culprit.

you might also look at the left caliper hanging up. again, jacking up  
the bus and looking at the brakes might tell you something. the  
calipers have to be played with to re/re the balljoints so it  
conceivable that something happened when the job was done.
