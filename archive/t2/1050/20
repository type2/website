did you replace the torque convertor seal. should always be replaced
when ever engine is out.  (the seal is in the tranny not the TC)

these seals will leak if pushed to far in, they must be flush with
front of tranny case.  the Torque convertor will hold a quart or more
even if tranny fluid is changed.  there is no way final drive oil can
get to there, it is either engine oil or tranny fluid.
