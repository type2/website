Subject: 78 Bus and acc brochure

I have an excellent 1978 Bus brochure and a very rare accessories brochure.
The Bus  brochure is about 6 pages long and the accessories brochure is
single
tri-fold. Has info on bumper over riders,side step ect.. It is in excellent
shape and I have
only seen one other in a collection on ebay. There is a picture of a guy on
the front
with his hands spread out over a bunch of parts. He looks like a picture of
Greg Potts
from the early 80's... I also have the introductory 1978 issue of Small World
a vw owners
magazine also in perfect shape. Has driving tips,how to save gas,where to
gripe,VW research,lots of pictures 31 pages long. Its the first issue of the
mini mag and is one
of the hardest to find out of the series. I would sell all three for 40.00
including shipping or
a reasonable offer.
