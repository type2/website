Subject: 1970 Break lights

Anyone have experience replacing the rear lights on a 1970'ish Bus? I
recently bought replacemts from the Bus Deport that cam with a ground, a Red
and a Black wire. I can get them to work, but not without blowing the fuse
when I try to attached the side marker lights. It alos seems that a few
different wireing combination achieve the desired result, but I still end up
blowing the fuse when I try adding the side bulb. I may not have tried al
combinations yet - but I'm getting frustrated.

Anyone know the correct way to wire these?

On the lights:
  - One connector right on the unit
  - Red wire
  - Black wire

On the Bus
Left:
Rear light wires:
  - Black with 1 white stripe
  - White with black stripes
  - Red
Marker light wires:    White with black stripes
  Red

 Right:
Rear light wires:
  - Black with 1 red stripe
  - White with red stripes
  - Red
Marker light wires:    - White with red stripes
  - Red

Thanks for any help,
