I'd like to add that there was one thing that wasn't mentioned on Karl's 
writeup.  I'm guessing that he sees it at trivial, but for someone that 
has never taken off baking plates, it can be a bit challenging.

When you try and remove the backing plate, get yourself a nice drift 
(piece of metal that you can hammer on to drive out a pin) that is about 
8mm in diameter or so, and a nice deadblow mallet or small 
sledgehammer.  A hammer might probably do as well, but the deadblow 
mallet's are really nice cuz they have sand in them that transfers the 
energy well and doesn't bounce.

 From under the bus, you need to drive the pin out that goes through the 
adjuster plate/backing plate and through the hold in the rear swing-arm 
assembly or whatever it's called.  It takes a few really strong whacks 
and penetrating oil and heat helps, too, but it can be done without 
them.  It took me about 10 strong whacks with the mallet to get mine to 
move and then it's out.  Obviously, take off the two big nuts holding 
the backing plate on before you try and drive it off cuz otherwise it's 
not gonna go anywhere.

When you're putting it back together, you can use the big screws to 
press the pin back into the axle assembly.  What might happen is that 
the pin pushes out from the backing plate and not into the axle.  Just 
take the hammer and drift and tap it back in before you tighten the 
whole assembly down.

Good luck!
Mike
