Hi Martin

I chose Premium on basis of slightly better fuel consumption -- it is  
marginal, perhaps 1/2 to 1 mpg and on the recommendation of the  
mechanic who built the motor.  The motor was
built by Andrew Robinson Automotive, an avowed VW lover and an  
excellent mechanic.  Our motor has now done approximately 25000 kms  
without the slightest hiccup that was the
fault of the motor (I have to put my hand up & admit that I have  
caused a few minor problems).

Additionally, I find with Premium that the engine runs slightly  
cooler -- oil temps show about 3-5C difference on long highway runs  
over standard unleaded.

None of the above probably justify the additional expense, but  
anything I can do to help achieve longevity is worth it in my book
