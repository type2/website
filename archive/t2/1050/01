Subject: steering box

At some time, I am going to have to deal with my steering box lube.

There is a slow seeping leak.

I can't imagine the side coming off. There is a spring and pinion that
would seem to be impossible to get off.

Do I fill it from the top?

Cheers,

Alan

P.S. Checked Archive and now off to the good Mr. Ratwell.
