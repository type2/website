Hi folks:

What worked for me was a very careful removal of the windscreen and the 
rotted gasket.
Carefully cleaning, scaling and application of of primer/sealer to metal 
surfaces and lip (there were no holes)
A brand new Original VW gasket from Bus Deport (Worth the extra $$!)
An auto glass guy looking for extra $$$.

No more leaks and no more carrying a pile of turn signal relays on 
camping trips to the Lost Coast.  And yes, the last part is key in my 
book.  The professional  removed it in 5 minutes and returned to 
reinstall it in 10 minutes.

BEN
