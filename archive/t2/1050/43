The only possible issue there is to make sure it has sufficient
cooling capacity. High pressure fuel pumps need cool gasoline to keep
cool. If you keep recycling progressively warmer fuel into a small
insulated container you could have an early fuel pump failure.

Outside of that easily sorted issue, I like the idea.
