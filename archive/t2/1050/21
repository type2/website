Subject: 1700/1800cc Pistons and Cylinders

Hello All,

It has become necessary for me to replace the pistons and cylinders for my 1972 Campmobile with a 1973 1700.  I have heard that I can replace the 1700 p&c with 1800 p&c without machining the case or heads.  

My question is, is this correct?  I tried the archives and could not find anything concerning this.
