Subject: Late Bus rear brake parts

I'm missing the springs that hold the adjuster wheels in place (The clickers). Near as I can tell, this requires replacing the entire brake backing plate assembly. Anybody have any suggestions? For the past ten years I have been using wedges cut from clothespins and siliconing them in place from the adjuster holes every time I adjust brakes. For some reason, this has not been working well the past year or so and at least one adjuster wheel loosens. Maybe I have just gotten more sloppy about it, but it's a PITA anyway, so I'd like to find a better solution!
