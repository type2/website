Subject: Re: windshield leak

I had the same problem after the windscreen was replaced a few years
ago. The water got into and wrecked the indicator relay. So after a
couple of years (!) I decided to squirt silicone (auto stuff) under the
rubber seal starting right at the top. A guy at work suggested that the
water was getting in from the end of the gutter and tracking along under
the rubber until it reached a low point. Made sense to me and sealing
all the way around fixed the problem.

HTH,

Martin.
