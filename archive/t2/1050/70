I just returned from 2 weeks on the west coast, between San Francisco and
Seattle (non in a VW, unfortunately).  I can tell you, folks out there were
dragging huge campers, 5th wheels, and driving RVs all over the place.  I've
never seen so many "houses on wheels" in my life.  The campgrounds we
visited were also pretty full, and the minority of campers were in Subaru
wagons and tents.  They were RV/camper villages.
