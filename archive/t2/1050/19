Subject: Leaking Oil

Just recently installed the motor back into my van and started it up. I was
checking for oil leaks etc., when I noticed oil slowly dripping from between
the engine and differential. The oil is old oil (black) and I would not think
it is coming from the engine since I completely replaced the oil in that after
installing the engine back in. The oil appears to be coming from just under or
behind the torque converter in the final drive housing.
A few thoughts, that maybe upon reinstalling the engine I have upset a seal in
the final drive somewhere, or maybe it has always been leaking, just never
noticed it? I am very sure it is not ATF as I just replaced that too and it
would be red coloured.
Is it a problem to just keep topping up the diff. oil ?
Appreciate anyone's thoughts on possible causes and potential fixes.
Thanks.
