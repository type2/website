Subject: Re: [T2] How is the gas crunch  affecting your tripping?

What's camping with a few or a few hundred friends worth??? To me, it's worth 
every penny of whatever it costs whether it's a 100 miles or 250 miles. FMBC 
does that to you. :)  Thanks for all the great times and great memories FMBC. 
Can't wait until the next.

I just read this article about Airstream owners (Airstreams also stay in 
use for decades and "clique" like us bussers).  I smile when I see it 
takes 11 mpg vehicles to tow them. 800 characters to the link, so here 
is the tinyurl:

So how the current cost of travel affecting your tripping?  RV sales 
are down nearly 20%, and people are camping closer to home. Is the 18m 
mpg daily driver status of your bus looking wan compared to a 35 mpg 
Hundai? Joel Sell, gotta see your electric bus when it's finished!
-For us in NJ, we had to forgo VW shows and some campouts, having 
only gone to Everybus (because we were headed for Savannah) and 
Riverside Westies in Vt (love the drive, river tubing, and Newfane flea 
Mkt).  We will make the Assateague, Va campout because it is on the Way 
to Busch Gardens where we want to take in the Halloween weekend.  Ron 
Salmon's BUSDepot campout in Oct. is also an hour away. We have 2 busses 
(campers) in our family, and it is just too much to have Nyssa bring 
along her own bus 7 hours away, so it's squeeze in our camper or bring a 
tent with her hardtop.  Jamestown Beach campground near Busch Gardens, 
here we come!
