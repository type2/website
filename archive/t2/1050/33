Subject: Pulling to the left

Hi all,

I have a '74 type 2 that has recently had new (X4} Ball joints fitted to the
front end. Ever since I've had a problem with it wanting to steer to the left,
it would happily go round in circles if I let go of the wheel, I've had the
toe checked by two garages and double checked it myself. The camber is as near
as I can get it with home made tools (notch to the front and no more than 45
degrees in either direction) it actually seems impervious to any adjustments
here - wherever I position the camber adjuster it still pulls to the left,
there is a visible movement, however, when you turn the adjuster.

Any ideas?

Thanks,

John
