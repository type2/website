Subject: Oil Leak HELP

HEY,
.
I have a 69 Westy with the original type 1 engine in it.  Over the 
summer it seems to have developed an oil leak the size of Iraq!  It 
does not leak when cold and sitting and only leaks a very little bit 
when running.  However, after it reaches operating temp and I turn off 
the engine the oil come gushing out.

It appears to be coming from dead center about where the engine bolts 
to the tranny. What it is it?!  Rear main seal, oil cooler or something 
else.

Brian
