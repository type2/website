Subject: Re: [T2] how is the gas crunch affecting your tripping

I havent changed a thing.Most of my camping trips are around 300 to 400
miles round trip.at 19 mpg the diference in cost between 2.50/gallon and
3.50/gallon is around 20 bucks. If 20 bucks is gonna stop me from going
camping and fishing for three or four days I might as well just sell my
bus.I just got my motor completely overhauled this spring($3500) and my gas
mileage is up 5 mpg.That pretty much makes  up the differnce.I just got back
from BNNTA monday and gas for the bus was 48 bucks.(250 miles (-at-)18mpg)We
pulled a small bass boat and pulled it in and out of the water 5 times and I
still managed 18 mpg.We spent 30 bucks in gas(8gallons (-at-)6mpg) for the
boat(ran it 48 miles on the lake).30 bucks for the campout fee.90 bucks for
beer food and supplies plus another 26 bucks for 4 1 pound prime rib
steaks(I have a friend who mages a meat department and he sold them to me at
cost and I think he got a deal on them himself.) Probably 40 bucks for
crappie jigs and soft plastic jig bodies misc stuff like ice probably
another 10 bucks.Oh we had to put a new fuel line from the gas tank on the
boat to the outboard 28 bucks. So we spent about 250 bucks to camp and fish
from friday morning till monday afternoon.If gas cost $1 a gallon cheaper it
would have save us a whopping  22bucks including gas for the boat.Not really
that much when you do the math.
