Subject: Re: [T2] Bolt size needed please...

It wasn't indicated whether it was front or rear needed, so here's a
run-down on sizes, part numbers, etc.:

FRONT (70-79)
Upper/Lower Bolt VW N10270601  12x102x1.5 Thread (Was VW N0101921)
Upper/Lower Hex Nut  VW N0111351  12x1.5 Thread (Was VW N0110202)

REAR (68-79)
Upper Bolt  VW N10270601  12x102x1.5 Thread (Was VW N0101921)
Lower Bolt  VW N0101904  12x90x1.5 Thread
Lower Hex Nut  VW N0111351  12x1.5 Thread (Was VW N0110202)
Upper Nut is "captive" in the body.
