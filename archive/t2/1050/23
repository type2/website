Subject: Shock bolts for sale

I have two of the metric correct grade bolts for installing the astrovan
shocks in the
rear of your bus. When I put the astrovan shocks in my 78 I needed to order
a min of four. Their longer than the stock bolts and are I was not able to
source them
locally with the correct thread,length or correct grade. If your interested in
them
email me.  I paid 2.50 each plus shipping. Came to about 14.00 for four
freaken bolts!!
The change to the astrovan shocks was pricless though. I got the heavy duty
load levelers
that had a spring to assist with the load. Made it ride nice and kept it from
sagging
when loaded up with all our camping gear for four people,three dogs and
multiple stuffed
animals. Their slowly getting out of bringing their babies (stuffed animals)
and have cut down to a couple a piece. Thank goodness!!!
