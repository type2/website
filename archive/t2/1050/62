It doesn't pertain to my situation, Greg - just offered as another alternative! I hadn't considered the issue Don brought up, with heat building up, but I suppose that IF there is an issue with the "T" that might be it. I know that you wrote before that it worked fine for you and I'm fine with that. -BaH
