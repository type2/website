Subject: Using Carb Fuel tank for Fuel Injection

This subject comes up every few months. I understand some people use a T fitting and it works, but I don't have a lot of comfort with it, myself. I just read about what some of the X-aircraft folks do - add a header tank. A tank of maybe a quart capacity could easily be rigged to have a connection from the fuel tank to keep it filled and a fitting for fuel out to the pump and a fitting for fuel return. Proper configuration would create a minimum of agitation and assure a steady flow under all conditions. The tank could be as simple as a piece of aluminum tubing with caps welded to both ends as long as there is adequate thickness to thread for fittings.
