	When did VW cease producing asbestos brake-shoon?
	But if you can identify unused or good used asbestos shoon, 
you should then consider why they were superseded with other friction 
material.
	I know little of what the more recent substitute brake 
linings are made of, but I did live as an academic active in public 
health and advising the NZ Govt minister of health thru the period 
when asbestos got severely restricted because of lung damage from the 
tiny mineral fibres spread around the air we breathe.
	If it is true  -  and I have yet to see the data  -  that 
asbestos brake linings are much less prone to develop squealing 
(presumably from glazing), please do remember that the dust they 
generate in normal operation is a public health hazard.  What are the 
alternatives?  What treatment of the noo-fangled linings can cure the 
squeal (at least for a while)?
	In my limited experience with this problem, wire-brushing the 
lining can cure  -  for a while.
