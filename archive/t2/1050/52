I looked at the article and it is a really neat idea.  It appears from the
article that the only change really needed is the backing plate and that the
wheel cylinders and everything else from the Baywindow may still work.

Questions:
1.  Please confirm... Can you still use the Bay's drums, shoes, wheel
cylinders, etc...?
2.  What year Baywindows will this work on?

Neat...

You never know what knowledge this list's collective consciousness will
reveal.

Resistance is futile...


Peace,

Michael in Montevallo
