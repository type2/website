Subject: Re: [T2] Rear brake adjuster

few small corrections in CAPS:

 From under the bus, you need to drive the pin out that goes through the 
adjuster plate/backing plate and through the HOLE in the rear swing-arm 
assembly or whatever it's called.  It takes a few really strong whacks 
and penetrating oil and heat helps, too, but it can be done without 
them.  It took me about 10 strong whacks with the mallet to get mine to 
move and then it's out.  Obviously, take off the two big BOLTS holding 
the backing plate on before you try and drive it off cuz otherwise it's 
not gonna go anywhere.
