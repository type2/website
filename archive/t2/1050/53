from the article:
The matching difference in the backing plate is the width of the space 
between outer and inner raised lips. You can use bay drums on Vanagon 
backing plates; but you cannot use Vanagon drums on bay backing plates. 
Make sense? The Vanagon drum outside bell diameter is bigger and it will 
not fit inside the lip of the bay backing plate. I don't know why you 
would do this unless you got a deal on the Vanagon drums.... but at Bus 
Depot, the bay and Vanagon drums are the same price, 49.95 each.

The cylinders are also the same - pads are not.

That being said, while I did take the drums and cylinders from the 
junkyard, I still ended up purchasing new drums, cylinders, and pads cuz 
I like new stuff better than old ;)
