Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Leak HELP

Brian
smell the oil.... can you tell the difference from engine oil smell,, to
hypoid gear oil smell...??

I am betting it is hypoid .. trans fluid...   and I am guessing you just
changed the trans gear oil..
I am guessing the hot oil is blowing past the trans input shaft seal...

if it is that.. drain the oil,, and install a different brand.

I clipped Karls experience to the bottom of the email
