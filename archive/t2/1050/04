Subject: afm setting

Im kinda wondering ,with the spring tension being screwed around with so much
plus the fact that the afm is of unknown age and could very well be the
original.would I be better off just buying a remanufactured afm?
If I did that you shouldnt need to adjust the spring tension? just set the co
level with the screw on the top af the afm and gp right?

What I wrote earlier:I guess what Im really looking for here is a guide to
setting an afm that has had the dial and spring on the inside fiddled with to
the extent that its way out of wack.My mechanics analizer displays rpm co co2
o2 hci and air fuel ratio.If I get the co set at idle does that mean that the
air fuel ratio should be correct at driving rpm ranges? or are they not really
connected?I can rev the motor to say 2500 rpms and it will display the air
fuel ratio and all the other stuff.With no load what kind of air fuel ratio
should I set it at? I  would really like to get it set close enough that I
dont burn my motor up
