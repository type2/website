Subject: Re: [T2] How is the gas crunch  affecting your tripping?

Our road-trip trekking hasn't been affected one bit; we've actually  
made it out camping a couple more times than we did last year .. so  
far.  And since there's one or two (or three) more months of decent  
camping season in the PNW, we could get even *more* trips in before  
it gets real cold & starts snowing.

On the other hand, fuel prices inspired us to pick up an '83 Scirocco  
back in March and retire the Westy from daily-driver duties .. duties  
we never intended it to have in the first place.  28-29mpg in-town  
beats the heck out of 16-17mpg.  The 'rocco is a fun car in it's own  
zippy, road-clinging way.  Not quite as much fun as our '89 Cabriolet  
(because we can't put the top down), but still...
