Get yourself an LM-1 wide-band o2 sensor (or LC-1 with a cheap-o 0-1v 
gauge) and you can monitor your AFR while you drive.  That's the best 
way to go and you can also tell if your car is going out of tune when 
you see the mixture act weird.  It is also a great way to get your car 
in tune to pass smog.  This is by far the best, and most cost-effective, 
way to really get your car in tune.
