Subject: CHT sender follow-up redux

Now that I've taken things for a test drive, I have found the the 
temperature gradient curve is logarithmic instead of linear.  What this 
means is if you test your sender with boiling water and it reads a 
little bit off, it will read WAY off by the time the temperature gets 
up into the 400 degree neighborhood.

A better way of testing might be to use oil and a candy thermometer.  
Water will never get above 212 degrees, but oil will get much hotter.  
Bring the oil up to 400 degrees and compare the reading on the candy 
thermometer vs. the CHT gauge as the oil gets hotter
