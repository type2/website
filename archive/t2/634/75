Subject: CHT sender follow-up

I calibrated the sender that I got from an aircraft supply and it reads 
spot on.

The sender (as well as the gauge) is probably made by the same company 
that makes some (or all) of the VDO gauges.  The price, however, is 
half of what VDO asks for their sender (go figure).
