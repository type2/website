the 5th terminal is a "spare" if it is the same as my 78 auto tranny
starter. it is electrically conected with the two push on connector at the
top..  I ignore it myself.

I suspect your double relay would be the fuel pump problem, certainly the
first place I would check

does the pump work when the engine is started??
