Um... how many do you need?  $12.00 per set of two red and one blue.  $4.00
shipping on up to three sets.  Dave Bolen bought some earlier this year.

I'm still getting things together after a long period of low sales, but I
can probably work up a few sets if someone is interested.  The masters for
the levers can be seen in our gallery here:

Paul, I'm not sure what the difference is in the '72's heater levers.  The
ones I make will fit whatever takes heater levers that will fit a '77.  Do
you have pics of the '72 levers?  I'd need to acquire a set to reproduce.
