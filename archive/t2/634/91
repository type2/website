Subject: Re: [T2] I suspect carb problems...

Jerry,
 
I had a similar problem with my 71 bus.  I tried rebuilding the carb  but the 
kits I found werevirtually useless and  contained really cheap  parts that 
only compounded my problems.  Maybe someone else knows of a good  kit.  I ended 
up replacing the carb and everything runs smooth now.
