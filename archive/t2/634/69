The light coming on dim is not unusual.  The generator/alternator
normally flows a bit of current through the generator bulb and this
current can make the bulb glow dimly.  Mine does it and has always done
so.  It seems to vary from bus to bus, so it is probably curable if you
want to go through the wiring and make sure that all the connections are
perfect.  Pay particular attention to the grounds up front.
