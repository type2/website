I battled with this intermittent idle problem on the same engine in my 71.
Eventually found the idle circuit solenoid was getting low voltage due to a 
loose terminal lug.
I have been running a Bocar Mexican carb trouble free for almost 200k miles, 
so if you are looking for reliability I can recommend this course of action.
