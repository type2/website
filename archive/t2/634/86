Wide band means they measure from 12:1 to 20:1 AFR . The narrow band ones used in the bus and by other simple ECUs (and the $100 AFR gauges) only measure a limited range around 14.67 because they basically act as a switch (lean/rich).

The extra wires are for heating elements, signals from multiple cells within the sensors, etc.
