Subject: Mixture and 3-Gas analyzers

There were some interesting posts a few days ago, concerning a DIY project to 
build a air/fuel mixture indicator; also there was an observation that antique 
exhaust analyzers (on the well-known auction website) have no practical value 
in 2004.  Since my 1969 Bay falls into the 'historic' segment [age >25 yrs] 
antipollution testing is not required; but for another vehicle I got nicked 
~175 bucks for carburetor recalibration as part of a major tune-up.  I am told 
the gizmo required is a 3-gas analyzer.  

Here's my question:  Are there some brand names and/or models that would be 
suitable for a do-it-yourself person?  Does anyone have experience with same?  
Even some general pointers, as to the proper name of the instrument, would be 
helpful..... thanks!  Glenn
