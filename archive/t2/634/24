I'm thinking about using a 3 wire O2 sensor to speed up the readings
(3 wire=heater, right?) I actually even have one in my parts stash
from my Volvo. I had replaced it because I didn't like the readings I
was getting (seemed flaky) but the new one did the same thing. Turned
out to be the distributor that I haven't replaced yet.
