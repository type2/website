Subject: I suspect carb problems...

Hi Folks,

When I put in the new Mexi 1600 DP last year, I kept my old PICT30 carb, mounting it on the adapter plate that is marketed by our friendly parts dealers.  The carburetor is 13 years old and has about 100K miles on it.  After the new engine I noticed that sometimes after driving for awhile and then stopping for a bit and then starting again, I'll get a pretty good cloud of smoke for a couple of seconds.  I've been thinking that somehow gas might be dripping into the cylinders.  Another symptom: while the engine is smooth under acceleration, I get some bucking at nil loads (for example, cruising at 30 mph in 3rd).  I'm thinking my carb might be needing help.

My questions for you:
* Do you agree that this is a carb issue, or should I be looking at something else too?
* If it's the carb, would you suggest trying a rebuild kit, or should I be thinking about a new carb?

Thanks for your help.

Regards,
