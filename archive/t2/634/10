Richard,

I can not vouch for myself this year I really do not see it happening, even 
though my bus needs a rear shock too, one has been missing since I got it. 
But I plan on having this bus on the road in the near future and fully 
getting to know her. The need for the best shocks I can find will come after 
I am confident in some of the other major areas. I still need and want to 
build a new engine to replace the refreshed GEX that is in there now. So I 
definately can not commit to any purchase. But there is definately a full 
bodied "interest", especially if they are so unavailable. If this 
constitutes a placement of my name on a "list of interested", then count me 
in. Kudos to you sir and your investigative mind set to find what we need, 
that we may not find. I wish that you had an Automatic bus and were more 
inclined to find some of the parts that are NLA or CBF.


Thanks,

Michael Knight
