Put your sensors as close to the exhaust as possible to get fast 
readings.  I used to have mine just before the cat and the readings were 
slow and behind.  I moved it to the exhaust header just after 3 & 4 and 
it starts reading in about 10 seconds after startup and is super 
responsive.  Yeah, I only meter half the engine, but I'm not that 
worried.  Hopefully the UMS will be able to monitor two o2 sensors and 
I'll stick one on the other side of the engine, too.

later,
mike
