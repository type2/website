Subject: IT RUNS!!!!!!...........but doesn't

After six months of tinkering my van started.  Idled
really high, but it was running.  Then it started to
make a backfire noise, but not from the exhaust,
somewhere around my left carb.  It did this about 3/4
times the I noticed it was the carb that was
backfiring.  Then fuel started to leak from the
linkage at the bottom of the carb.  Is my throttle
bddy hosed?  What causes the carb to backfire
internally?   Help, it's almost there......maybe.
