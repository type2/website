Subject: [T2]what happened? broke down

ok so we went to asheville(60minutes away) last night and everything seemed fine except for maybe the power just wasnt there on the hills going up...?
started back late last night and i noticed right off the bat that things didnt seem right but we kept coming anyways....
the further we got home the more i realized that the bus was going up the hills/mountains and seemed like it was catching and slipping catching and slipping but power wise..? like maybe something wa touching anfd letting go touching and letting go...?
well... got almost home and the darn accelerator cable broke at the linakge.... at the same momment i noticed that the bus lights and such were going more and more dim and that she wasnt firing right....?

she was spitting and sputtering more and corn popping now.while idleing......
i left her running while i jerry rigged the accelerator cable(fearing she wouldnt crank back) and hoped that she would get us the rest of the way home...?
we went to pull out(where we had pulled over to) and she would hardly go at all ... no power at all... was creeping and now my lights were barely lit so that i could barely see...
she was spitting and sputtering badly...
immeditately had to pull back over....
she wasnt going no wheres....
i couldnt even hardly turn around in the parking lot.... trying to move her she backfired a large cloud of smoke and i could see the fire blast out the pipe on the dark pavement behind us in the mirror..
quickly i jumped out and she sat there an idled but wasnt a good idle.. very low power kinda idle and she corn popped a good bit./......
finally i thought maybe for some reason i am just running on total battery..?
i took looose my dual battery and shut the engine off...
hooked it up and tried to crank it....
the  oil light came on when key was turned but she didnt even click..?
i dont know whats wrong..?
i knew we were dead in the water though and it being so late had no clue what to do..?
i could figure the alterator which isnt even a year old..?
but didnt know what it was...
i walked a couple miles home and locked the wife and little one up in the bus...
got home got the bug and went back.....
pulled very slowly the bus home with the bug and i mean very slowly so that i didnt pull the tranny all to heck with it....
finally got her home...
first thing i am going to go charge the battery and tell me if the battery is near deAD OR what..??????
i dont know where to start and reason why is i have been through a dieing alternator before but it was nothing like that besides the power failure and dim lights....etc....
but the backfire and smoke .... when i tried to move,...? backup..? thats where i get confused...?
anyone got a idea i am game for it...
right now... i am down in the dumps and once more my brand new engine has left me high and dry...~!~
i dont know where to start besides the battery... and then????????hmmmmm
thanks for any or all advice ...
i am so tired i think i will start later..
we didnt get in till really bad late last night....2 ish...
peace and love
