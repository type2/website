Subject: emissions confusion with '78 bus

Hi all:

I've been spending some quality time in and under our new bus seeing 
what needs doing.  Regarding emissions, we're in Montana now, and 
they'd register a steam powered bucket if they got their fee.  
Unfortunately, we won't be here much longer, and we don't want to be 
hung out to dry when it comes time for testing.  I have awful memories 
of the New Jersey DMV threatening "destruction of vehicle" after my old 
Rover failed their test.

Here's what we have:  a 1978 bus with a 1979 engine remanufactured by 
VW Canada (I presume it's Canadian) with 1979 Federal F.I.  The engine 
install was beautifully done from what I've seen by an old Porsche tech 
around Seattle.  There's an EGR valve on the intake but the pipe has 
been cut and crimped shut.  The exhaust is a very simple muffler w/ 
tailpipe which connects directly to the heat exchangers (no cat).

What's a 1978 bus supposed to have?  Cat?  EGR?  Both?  I assume an 
emissions tester would go by the VIN model year, 1978, and not any 
engine code, etc.  What would be needed to bring the bus back to spec 
before a future inspection?  Most likely places are Portland, OR or the 
Bay Area, CA.  Thanks for the great resource, and a special thanks to 
R. Atwell for ratwell.com.  We're learning, but we have a long way to 
go.  Yesterday, I was under the bus and suddenly realized: there aren't 
any springs!  Well, one of many firsts...

all the best,
