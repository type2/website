Subject: CHT sender source

I ordered a CHT sender from these guys.  It is for the Mitchell sender 
located halfway down the page.  After noticing the resemblance between 
the Mitchell gauge and the VDO gauge, and observing that the VDO sender 
was $20 (vs. $10 for the Mitchell sender), I thought I would give it a 
try.

The part is identical.  I will hook it up and calibrate it tomorrow.  
My guess is that it will read spot on.
