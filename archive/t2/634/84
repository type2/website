Subject: Re: [T2] Mixture and 3-Gas analyzers

Hey Richard! After reading your posts and thinking about previous threads on 
the subject, I did some searching. The DIY project used a one-wire sensor 
and explained it essentially worked as a volt meter. What are the extra 
wires for on multi-wire sensors? I've found 2 wire and 4 wire sensors. What 
exactly is the broadband concept in oxygen sensors.

At the other end of the spectrum, a previous thread mentioned some 
permanently mounted A/F setups. Can you weigh in with a recommendation on 
any of these?

Thanks,

John
