Hi Scott,

Check the sticker inside the driver's side door jamb -- if you still have 
it.  If it says it was built 08/72 to 07/73, you have a 1972 model year.

If that doesn't work, check the VIN on the dash or in the engine 
compartment.  It will be something like 22x2123456, where the x indicates 
the last number of the model year.  Mine is 2292000000, and I have a 1979.  
If yours is a 1973, it will be 2232000000.

If all else fails, check out the library at type2.com, under VIN.  There's a 
good page explaining what all those other digits mean.

Good Luck!
