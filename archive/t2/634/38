Subject: starter question on a auto vanagon

Hello all - 
 
I'm having wiring nightmares.  I think I may have wired my starter wrong.  It turns over, but no juice is getting to the fuel pump.
 
I have a 1981 Vanagon CA emissions with automatic transmission.  The starter doesn't match the one in Bentley; it has an extra terminal, for a total of five connections.
 
When I'm under the van looking up at the solenoid, there are:
 
1.  The terminal opposite the starter, where the battery cable goes.
2.  The terminal that connects to the starter.
3.  A terminal on top with two connections for push on wires.
4.  A terminal on the bottom with one connection for push on wires.
 
Again, I have five terminals and my Bentley Book only has four.  Any suggestions?
 
I grealy appreciate any help you can provide.
