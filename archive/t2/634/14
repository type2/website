Hi Guys & Gals,

Wow, ok. Response was good for wanting the controls. Mike (Casting Fool 
& Son) wrote and said he can get them so I'm going to defer to him.

If for whatever reason that doesn't work out that I'll begin pursuing 
getting them made. My original post was to get an indication for how 
many people would be interested.

I *do not* currently have the controls I was going to have them custom 
made if people showed enough interest to make it worthwhile to the 
manufacturer.

I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one without them :-)


Cheers,
Harry
