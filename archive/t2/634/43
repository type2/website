Subject: shift problem.

Bus has been running fairly well, but yesterday it got me home and in the
driveway, then quit moving.  Clutch feels fine (new 1000 miles ago), I can
shift into all gears without stepping on the clutch though. But the bus will
not move in any of the gears even reverse.  This happened just all of a
sudden.  Does anyone have any ideas where to look first?
We are going to look into it tomorrow after the rain quits.
Thanks,
Gail Doles
