couple of honest questions because I went from confused to not
confused right back to confused again..

ATDC Ahead of Top Dead Center or After Top Dead Center?
BTDC Behind Top Dead Center or Before Top Dead Center?
using the sticker on my shroud :

I surmise that the A is AFTER, which means the B is Before since they
cant be After and Behind since they would be the same thing then.

the engine rotates clockwise when viewing it from the back hatch.
that means rotation moves from left to right across the top.

if I spark to the left of 0 I am doing it BEFORE the piston reaches
TDC(0) and I am advancing the timing.
If I spark to the right of the 0 I am doing it AFTER the piston has
passed TDC(0) and I am retarding the timing.
Logically this makes perfect sense but is at odds with your statement
about BTDC being to the right assuming the "B" in BTDC is Before and
not Behind.

here's a picture of my timing scale.

if BTDC is to the right, how do you time it to 28 degrees?  My scale
stops at 16.

My retard diaphragm seems to be fine, the advance diaphragm seems to
be a little stiff but still functional (spec says 7.9inHg, mine is
closer to 8.9inHg)
