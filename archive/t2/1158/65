Subject: vanagon water 

So, for the first time I hooked up a hose to my vanagon water supply - it
doesn't seem to have a shut off. I'm I supposed to just turn the knob one
way for water to come from the water tank then turn the other way for
water to come from the street supply - and just have the knob in the
middle to be off? If that's the case then I guess I need a new fawcett?
