For those of you in the US that find all of these very useful sets of numbers
confusing, The difference between the full line and the low oil line is about
1 and 1/3 quarts.

I have the same.
- 1.25L for the 1.6 (2.1
Imp. pints ) (~2.64 US pints)
- 0.5L for the 2.0 (0.875 Imp. pints) (~1.05 US
pints)
With total oil capacity of 2.5L for the 1600cc engine, that seems like
a lot of leeway from full to low.
As for
the equivalent in pints, note that my manual is for the UK market so those
are
Imperial pints and not US customary pints.
That's 20 fl. oz. in a UK pint and
16 fl. oz. in a US pint.
