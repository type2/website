	I have only the official German 'quantity'.  Personally I'd 
go for simple English 'volume'.  <:-|

	My modest start:


	Aug 1972 INSTRUCTION  MANUAL  Part 1 [i.e  owner's little booklet] p.36

the difference in quantity between the minimum and maximum marks on 
the dipstick

	1.6 liter engine	- 1.25 liter
	1.7    "   "         	- 0.5 liter
