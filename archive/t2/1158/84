Subject: Re:Gravity-type Fuel Pump:-McGuyver tricks for FI

Wonder if that would work in a FI bus with a long tube, gas can on the 
roof, feeding gas into the cold start valve hole, or maybe wiring 
injectors open and feeding it into the fuel rail via the pressure gauge 
port?
Another FI trick- keep a couple of wires with alligator clips on the 
ends to bypass the double relay.
I've bypassed a bum fuel tank that way with a boat gas can (has 1/4" 
outlet) but that was a non FI 71 westy.
