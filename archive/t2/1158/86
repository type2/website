I found my '79 UK owner's manual.

I have the same.
 - 1.25L for the 1.6 (2.1
Imp. pints ) (~2.64 US pints)
 - 0.5L for the 2.0 (0.875 Imp. pints) (~1.05 US
pints)

With total oil capacity of 2.5L for the 1600cc engine, that seems like
a lot of leeway from full to low.
You can be missing half of your oil at low!
 I wouldn't ever let it get that low, but I wonder how many folks do.

As for
the equivalent in pints, note that my manual is for the UK market so those are
Imperial pints and not US customary pints.
That's 20 fl. oz. in a UK pint and
16 fl. oz. in a US pint.
That's a huge difference at the pub.

Oil Dipstick Markings

    I have only the official
German 'quantity'.  Personally I'd 
go for simple English 'volume'.  <:-|

    My modest start:


    Aug 1972 INSTRUCTION  MANUAL  Part 1
[i.e  owner's little booklet] p.36

the difference in quantity between the
minimum and maximum marks on 
the dipstick

    1.6 liter engine    - 1.25
liter
    1.7    "   "             - 0.5 liter
