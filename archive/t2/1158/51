Hi Volks,

BOTC is fast approaching, but I have surprisingly few registrations so 
far this year. If you're planning to attend, please drop me a line so I 
have some idea how many to expect. I will be extending the pre-reg 
discount until the end of July...

Later tonight or early tomorrow I expect to publish the T-shirt design, 
it's a classic...

Happy Trails,
