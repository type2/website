Has anyone tried a 5000 BTU 110V AC mounted in a bus window, coupled with a
small generator, like a Honda 2000W or 5000W?

I used a Honda 2000W generator to power a fridge and freezer during a recent
power outage.  The Honda's are whisper quiet in operation, and have a
feature that gauges output to motor running that makes them extremely
efficient and quiet.

The generator could be mounted on the bus in a convenient location (back or
top?).

Just wondering...
