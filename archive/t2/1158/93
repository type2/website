of my transcript:
	Aug 1972 INSTRUCTION  MANUAL  Part 1 [i.e  owner's little booklet] p.36
the difference in quantity between the minimum and maximum marks on 
the dipstick
	1.6 liter engine	- 1.25 liter
	1.7    "   "         - 0.5 liter


	The figures for bottom-to-top volumes on the dipstick 
evidently differ to a large extent just between the two different 
motors in 1972 (1600dp  -  the subject of the original request for 
info  -  and 1700).
	At that rate, a measurement on a '78 may well differ with the 
'72 factory figures.   I infer the '78 engine is different again. 
That is why the suggestion was made to compile a complete table of 
these figures.  I don't know what the official figure was for the '78 
motor, but if it's different again, that would not be particularly 
odd.
