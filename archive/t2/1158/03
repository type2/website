Subject: Preogressive lenses for close up work under a bus.

The biggest problem is that the progressive portion of the lens is at the 
bottom. I've seen bifocals with the close up lensing at the top. Maybe you 
can get progressives built that way too. Of course upside down from the 
usual making the most close up portion at the top of the lens.
