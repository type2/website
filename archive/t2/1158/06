Subject: Re: [T2] Question about electronic igniton (points replacement)

I have read through the manual a few times.
Unfortunately I have a blue hotspark unit and the instructions are for
the red unit.

I contacted hotspark because of the red v blue issue and they
mentioned the ballast resistor in their response.

after posting my message I continued to dig around on ratwell and
found that terminal 15 is the 12v + side.
I am still kind of green when it comes to the ignition stuff.

I also found his blurb on the double relay.

I suspect that the second black lead on the 12v side is actually
feeding INTO the double relay which means that the wire that is hooked
into the other side of the 15 terminal is the lead from the ignition
switch.

I apologize if my email came off seeming lazy or unprepared, I thought
I would post and see if anyone had been through a similar situation
and had an easy answer while I continue to research things on my own.

its more of a bump/hiccup that only happens sometimes when I am
accelerating but doesn't seem to affect it at higher rpms (not much
higher though :-)
