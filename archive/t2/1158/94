 That is why the suggestion was made to compile a complete table of
 these figures.  I don't know what the official figure was for the '78
 motor, but if it's different again, that would not be particularly
 odd.

I don't expect any difference. The Type 4 series differ primarily in
stroke and displacement.

I have a 79 owners manual here. VW sidesteps even the quart vs liter
issue with the fudge word, "about":

"The difference between the two marks is about 0.5 U.S. quarts (0.4
Imp. qt./0.5 liter)."
