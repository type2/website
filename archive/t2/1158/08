Did you check to see that both cans on the distributor hold vacuum?  If 
the retard can does not hold vacuum your timing will be 120 to far 
retarded if you time it by the book at idle.  Always best to set the 
timing at 28-300 BTDC at 3500+rpm's with both hoses off.

Don't understand why everyone wants to change to electronic ignition the 
first second something doesn't work right on the engine.  Points and 
condensers are very dependable.  I typically get 20K miles or more out 
of a set of points and may check them once or twice over their life, but 
probably will not have to adjust them.  They are a very proven system, 
that just needs minimal maintenance to work well.
