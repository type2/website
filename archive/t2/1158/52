Subject: Re: [T2] DVDA Distributor question

Okay so I broke down and bought a mighty vac, it will come in handy in
the future I am sure.

I tested the distributor vacuum can.

spec says 7.9 inHg for both advance and retard

retard starts moving around 6inHg
advance doesn't budge until almost 9

unfortunately I am not going to be able to source a new DVDA
distributor until next week at the earliest and I have to drive it to
an event this weekend for a week.

I am hoping it just needs to be cleaned up, but if not, how bad would
it be to put it back in and use it as is until I can source a new one.
Another option is to replace it with a single vacuum model but I will
have to do some research to figure out what to do with the vacuum
lines and whatnot.

I am having a hard time locating any instructions or tips on
"refreshing" a dizzy.
The usual suspects don't really have much on it.
anyone have any helpful tips or links that might help me through the process?
