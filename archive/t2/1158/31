Subject: The next generation AIRS list

Getting the archives searchable was at the top of list for things to get done
when the server was replaced. Though it still needs some work, it's definitely
functional and usable (the server it's on is powered off right now. I should
turn it on when I get home today *sigh* )

Anyways, next up is a revamp of the AIRS list. Now, I could try and do it
myself again and learn more about mysql, php, and general application
development. But, it would be nice to knock this one out in less than two
years :)

So my question is this...  are there any list members out there with
sufficient php, mysql, and general web development skills that would be
willing to donate some time to help get this done? If so, please reply
off-list.
