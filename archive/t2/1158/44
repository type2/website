I wasn't sucking hard enough.

I verified that the plate moves in either direction and then sucked
REALLY hard on the advance side and it worked

It seems the retard moved with less effort, and I thought the same
amount should operate the advance but I guess I wasn't sucking hard
enough.

I'll have to put it back in tomorrow.

Thanks for the help!
