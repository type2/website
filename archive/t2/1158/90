Nice one.  

I forget where I read that, "if I told you how many seconds there 
are in a year, chances are you'd have forgotten the next minute.  But
you're likely to remember for the rest of your life when I'll tell 
you now that pi seconds are a nanocentury."

Olbigatory Bus Content:  Hmm, tough one.  You see, there's no bus in
my life to help me generate some.  Would it count that I'm cautiously
in the market for a pickup, either single- or crewcab, either T2 or
Diesel T3, cheap but solid, in North Germany?  I hope so.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Ermel.
