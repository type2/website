Hello All,
 
I have done this. I tried to keep the entire 5000btu unit in the bus and I
vented the hot air out of the window using aluminum flashing and plexi glass.
I used tubing and a hand made tray from aluminum flashing to collect
condensation and carry it outside the bus. It was powered by a Honda 1000
watt generator. For all intents and purposes, it worked. However, the
radiant heat from the back side of the air conditioner heated up the bus as
fast as it was cooling it. You really need to keep the back side of the a/c
outside of the bus for it to have any positive effect. New cars use
airconditioners that are rated 22,000BTU or higher. I ended up selling the
a/c. I am going to install stock a/c with a variable output rotary compressor.
That is the plan anyway.
 
Cheers
David Kelly

Has anyone tried a 5000 BTU 110V AC mounted in a bus window, coupled with a
small generator, like a Honda 2000W or 5000W?
