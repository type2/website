Was looking at all the different dizzy settings and specs on The Old Volks 
Home. What a curious melange of information, all for basically the same 
engine with a 69mm stroke. I know that the carbs changed from year to year, 
but why all those different dizzies and settings? Was some of that driven by 
air pollution details?
