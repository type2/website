This looks like the stereo solution I've been serching for for a while for  
my bus.  At this point, my tunes are on my iPod and that is all I need - I  
don't drag CD's around with me any more.
 
I want make sure this unit fits the uncut dash in my 71 Westy without  
cutting or other irreversible modifications, and performs the way I would  like. 
 Not looking for the ultimate high-end stereo, just something that  sounds 
decent and is convenient to use.
 
So, anyone have any experience with this item?  With this  seller?
