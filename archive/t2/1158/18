Subject: Re: [T2] Question about electronic igniton (points replacement)

Now when this thread started before ressurection it was pretty clear I'm a
points fan, but this isn't an entirely true statement.  A pertronix or any
electronic trigger is going to be much less affected by dizzy wear because
shaft wobble isn't going to do anything to them as they just sense rotation
whereas it will affect points.  I do think the things have their place for
some who like them and want to spend the $ on them.  I agree with Jim that I
think points (with good rubbing blocks and a little lube) last a damn long
time with minimal fuss.  And of course I'm a CDI proponent which makes them
last longer, but as he has noted, they can last a good long time as they are. 
 I just typically find a fair mileage gain from CDI on a T4, perhaps a bit of
a fake one as maybe it is just a bunch of 30+ year old coils that are getting
a boost by going CDI, who knows.

So far it has run well but is no more stable than the points were as the
timing flutter comes from the mechanical distributor itself and not from a
properly installed set of points.

At this time I have spent enough time and money on electronic ignitions to
have replaced points for hundreds of thousands of miles.  I would say they are
a failed experiment at this point.
