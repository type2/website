Look up your distributor here and see what the specs say:

Do make sure that the breaker plate is nice and clean and moving freely. 
  You might put a drop or two of oil where the contact points are 
between the plates... there are little plastic pieces that the top plate 
rides on, and you can see where they are as they are pushed into little 
holes in the top plate.
