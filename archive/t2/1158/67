Subject: Re: [T2] DVDA Distributor question

Heads up out there:  ATDC is to the LEFT of TDC (0) and BTDC is to the
RIGHT of BTDC (0). Remember the the Crankshaft rotates CLOCKWISE.
Although not as visible on the Bus crank pulley, take a look at a
71-79 Bug Crank Pulley and you will what I'm sayin'.  If ATDC was on
the RIGHT, the Crankshaft would have to rotate counter-clockwise.

The set-up (75-Early 76 Bus) virtually identical to the L-Jet and
Ignition on my 914 (1.8).  Porsche specifies to time my DVDA at TDC
with both hoses disconnected and at 28 degrees BTDC at 2800rpm.
Because there is no scale to view on the 914, the marks are made on
the rotating fan that's viewable thru a port on top of the fan housing
ala 411/412.  I'll bet you could time that at TDC (0) with the hoses
disconnected, then reconnect the hoses and it would run just fine,
provided of course the Advance and Retard sides of the Vacuum Can were
working properly along with the movement of the points plate.

In my VW Factory Tech Bulletins regarding 411/412 models, there were
initially several different methods of timing the distributor for the
particular years and all used DVDA's, some different for different
years thru 1974.  The newest Tech Bulletin issued in the notebook
finally said that all previous TB's were discontinued and superseded
to Time all Type 4s w/DVDAs (-at-) TDC (0) with the hoses disconnected.  I
imagine this was done to prevent confusion for the dealer mechanics of
the era.  Since 99% of the DVDAs use on Type 1s, Type 2s and Type 3s
were specified at 5 degrees ATDC, I would imagine that they could be
timed using this method.

And for those with a DVDA that the Retard side diaphragm is shot (most
are that I've encountered), I will second the motion of John Kolak's
suggestion that if the Vacuum Advance side is working properly, timing
it (-at-) 7.5 BTDC with the hose connected would work out as well. BTDT.
