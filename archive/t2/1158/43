I meant DVDA, and I just tested one in my garage and sucking on both 
sides made the plate move either direction.  Also, I noticed that even 
when I plugged the retard side while sucking on the advance side, the 
plate still turned.

So, if you're suckin' on the advance side and nothing's turning, either 
your plate is dirty and sticking, or you vacuum advance can is bad.
