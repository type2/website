I have measured quite a few temp sensor IIs and I have found the curve 
to be very consistent.  If you have to move your sensor to a different 
location to fake out the computer, something else is wrong with the 
engine.  All it does is tell the engine when it's warm enough so that it 
can start injecting less fuel.
