Subject: Wiper switch inner workings

Hi

I would like to install an adittional wiper switch (basically push a button)
in my T2ab. The idea is not having to switch on and off the regular wiper
switch if there is little rain, but use a push button. Or eventually build
in a relay 19 (or 99). But I have no clue what the original switch turns on
and off at what point.
Now I am looking for a wiring diagram of the original wiper switch (what
does it do in which position) and likewise for the wiper motor.
I am aware of the following exellent listing:
http://www.vintagebus.com/wiring/index.html
But could not find the 'inner workings' of the wiper switch and wiper motor
assembly.

Does anyone know of a diagram that could help me? Thanks a lot!

Greetings,

Daniel
