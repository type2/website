Hi Rusty,

 

This looks similar to  the Retrosound radio. I just installed one of those
in my '65. It is pretty neat, because I could fit it into my dash without
having to cut the dash. The interface is a bit clunky, but it works, and
kind of looks vintage. It has a lot of functions, doesn't work super
smoothly, but it works. I only have one speaker hooked up at this point (the
single one on the dash) 

 

This one looks a bit more appropriate, with deeper buttons.

 

As for your '71, I would think you can get any regular modern radio to fit.
I put a modern unit into my '69, and didn't have to modify the dash.
