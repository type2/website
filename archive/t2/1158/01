Subject: Question about electronic igniton (points replacement)

DVDA dizzy (don't know the exact numbers), basically a 1.9 ltr 914 engine.
77 block, FI from a 79.

I have a hotspark setup that I acquired a while back and I am getting
ready to install it but I have some questions.

I have already checked my coil, its at 3.4 ohms from terminal 1 to
terminal 15 so it meets the requirements of a primary coil resistance
over 3.2.

Here is a picture for illustration purposes.

Connected to terminal 1 are the condenser/points, Tach, and FI harness.
Connected to terminal 15 are a red and black wire.

The redwire (?1 in the photo) should be black and will be shortly, it
leads to a portion of the wiring harness that has three wires.  A
black, a blue with black, and a white with blue wire.
It was previously a section of marine extension cord and when I pulled
it out, all I had was red wire to re-splice.
The blue wire connects to the oil pressure sensor, the white wire is
disconnected/cut.  black wire connects to terminal 15 via the red
wire.

There is a second black wire (?2 in the photo) that dissappears into
the doublerelay/resistor pack I believe.

The hotspark guys recommend putting a 1.4 ohm ballast resistor.
from an email conversation with them:
"Wiring a 1.4 Ohm ballast resistor between the +12 volt power source
and the coil's + terminal is also not a bad idea."

I am having a hard time figuring out which lead is the 12v source and
looking to the list for some guidance.
Is this necessary?  if so where should it go?

I will also be putting the recommended diode inbetween the tach and the coil.

Hoping this will solve some occasional sputtering that I am
experiencing when accelerating.  usually happens around 3500 rpm.
Adjusted points and set timing to 7 degrees ATDC at idle and it solved
a LOT of my rough starting/idling problems.  Have a spare set of
points and a condenser but I would rather ditch both and go with the
electronic ignition and keep the new points and condenser as a backup
plan.

any suggestions/input are welcome.
