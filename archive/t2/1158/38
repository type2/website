Hardware isn't really a concern anymore. I work with VM's as well and can
appreciate what they bring to the table. It may be something to look at down
the road. The server issue I mentioned was related directly to me not turning
it on. Even a VM needs the button pushed. What I really needed was a
lights-out manager ;)
