I'll second the recent BD kudos.  About a month ago I needed a bunch of little
things for the '77, most critically the engine seal as I spoke about on the
list then.  Wanted to camp on Friday, realized the needs I think the Friday
before, and this is Alaska folks.  Called ordered the seal, some oil filters,
fuel hose, fuel filter, little this and thats, told them my need if
possible but didn't want to blow the FedEx money up here, so just let it ride
as the camping wasn't super critical time wise.  Stuff shipped Monday in a
large flat rate, got to me Wednesday.  Amazed it all jammed into a flat rate.

called BD and spoke to Matt (who also did the original order) he said he would
make sure it arrived the next day.   10AM next day Fed Ex was at the door with
the regulator (in a HUGE box).
