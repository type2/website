The Honda series generators are amazingly quiet in operation.  If you get
the opportunity, see one in operation.  Mounted outside of a bus, you will
probably not hear anything from it over the usual noises of an operating VW
bus.  I'm not kidding as I have run one of these myself and can testify to
the quietness.  Of course, running it while your bus is stopped will be
another story, but it will still be much quieter than you would think.

Also, if you can put up with the noise level, they make a free-standing AC
unit that works by exhausting the hot waste air out of the room via a 6"
flex tube that you hook to an adapter that goes in a window.  Around $279.00
at Sams, maybe $299.00 at Lowes.

I installed one for a friend and it works surprisingly well in a
manufactured home (mobile home.)  It's a shame that you can't harness the
exhaust air as it comes out at 129 degrees F.

As to the noise from the AC itself, I've lived with AC units for most of my
life and your brain tends to filter out the noise with all of the other
background noises in a home.  Doesn't bother me (especially in this current
hot weather spell.)
