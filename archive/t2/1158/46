Save yourself some trouble and get the advance side operating as well and
smoothly as the retard side does before you put it back in, spend some time
fine cleaning the small parts.
Chances are if you are having to pull a 2 footer just to get the advance to
move, then the vacuum is to weak to move it and not working properly.
