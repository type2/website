My grandson has just told me he wants a VW bus, he thinks mine is just 
"Too cool"  he's old enough to drive and in college so he knows what he is 
getting into.

so if anyone is thinking of selling a van in good enough condition that he 
won't throw up his hands in the first week. and reasonable price in the 
Mid Atlantic Area (Maryland, Delaware, SE PA prefered) give me a hollar 
via private e-mail.

71 or 78 are preferred years

Bob
he can't have my 78
