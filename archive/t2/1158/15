VW installed the sensors in two different locations from the factory, 
the earlier one caused the sensor to heat too quickly and caused lean 
running on warmup so they sold a spacer to go with it to make is work 
better.  On later ones with the sensor relocated the opposite was true,  
I first worked on these FI systems when working at a ski area years 
ago.  They were the worst cars in the parking lot for cold running, 
seemingly every one of them gave problems.  Typically people would fire 
them up when they got back from skiing and let them run while they 
changed out of their ski gears.  Two or three minutes later the engine 
would choke and die from running too rich, and were nearly impossible to 
restart between the wrong signal for the TSII sensor causing the engine 
to run rich and a still cold TTS which was still telling the CSV to 
spray in extra fuel.
