Subject: Re: [T2] AC

Yes , it has been done.
if you are using it parked stationary,,, make sure the angle of the bus, and
the AC unit allows the condensate to drain,,,, outside the bus. lol
a lot I have seen , put it in the driver door window

the cool air blowing on you may allow you to sleep,, the noise of the AC
fan, and or generator may keep you awake.. but slightly cool and
comfortable,, but tired.. lol

If you are using it while driving..  The back window might be a better
spot..
I assume you won't be sleeping... and I am not sure how the 5000 btu will
work.. might work just fine in Antartica right now.. but not tooo well in
Phoenix at this time of year,,
