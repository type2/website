Subject: Re: [T2] quick kudos

just a quick message to Ron,  a week or so ago my window regulator broke, 
in 90+ weather  drivers side window is kinda critical.

called Bus Depot and ordered one and a few other small parts, paid for 
expidited delivery.

next day everything arrived BUT the window regulator, which was marked 
"Drop shipped"

called BD and spoke to Matt (who also did the original order) he said he 
would make sure it arrived the next day.   10AM next day Fed Ex was at the 
door with the regulator (in a HUGE box).

so give Matt a pat on the back for me and just to let you know how much 
your appreciated, anyone can make a mistake or experience a glitch, it is 
what one does about it that seperates the good companies from the bad.

installing a window regulator is a royal PITA but window works and I can 
breathe.....

Thanks
Bob

(PS as soon as weather breaks a little will check garage for brake 
boosters.)
