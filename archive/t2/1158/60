Great job Zach.

You got it right about ATDC being to the right, and yes, it does run
lousy. If your state inspection doesn't require it, most recommend
disconnecting the retard line and timing it as an SVDA at 7.5 BTDC.

That's really the less significant number though. Total advance should
be set at 27 BTDC at 3500 RPM. If idle doesn't fall exactly at 7.5
BTDC afterwards, it's not critical.
