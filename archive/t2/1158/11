So long as you have a mechanical distributor it will remain a little 
jumpy due to slop in the drive and advance mechanism.  Part of your cold 
idle problem may well be the TS2 temperature sensor or the wiring to 
it.  The response of the TS2 sensor doesn't always match the warm up 
characteristics of the engine, depending on where yours is mounted there 
are some things you can do to improve the response.

You don't need to use a tach to set the timing.  Shine your timing light 
at the timing scale and rev it up until the timing quits advancing and 
you are there.
