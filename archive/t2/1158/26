Subject: Electronic Ignition

Mistake #1) Making the assumption that the Pertronix 'points replacement' unit
was a true electronic ignition.   As far back a the 990's these things had a
HORRIBLE reputation for Q.A. and poor fitment.
Mistake #2) NOT buying a Crane(previously Allison) ignition, Jacobs ignition,
or MSD ignition.  You really DO get what you pay for sometimes
I have had the same unwaveringly reliable Crane unit in my bus since 1993.  No
hassles since it was installed.  Period.
