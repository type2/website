Further clarification.

All fluid ounces are not created equal.

An Imperial
fluid oz. is 28.4 mL and a US customary fluid oz. is 29.6 mL (from wikipedia).
According to my last fuel fill up, I got a fuel economy figure of 22.55 miles
per Imp. gallon.
The price of fuel was #1.379 per litre.
(That's beauty of the
UK's incomplete membership in the EU.  Distance in miles, building material
dimensions in metric, beer in pints, fuel in litres, height in centimetres,
and weight in stone.)

I have all the equivalent figures in a spreadsheet I
made up, but I'll leave it as an exercise for the reader to compute the
equivalent US numbers.

Dipstick Markings

I found my '79 UK owner's manual.

I have the same.
- 1.25L
for the 1.6 (2.1
Imp. pints ) (~2.64 US pints)
- 0.5L for the 2.0 (0.875 Imp.
pints) (~1.05 US
pints)

With total oil capacity of 2.5L for the 1600cc
engine, that seems like
a lot of leeway from full to low.
You can be missing
half of your oil at low!
I wouldn't ever let it get that low, but I wonder how
many folks do.

As for
the equivalent in pints, note that my manual is for the
UK market so those are
Imperial pints and not US customary pints.
That's 20
fl. oz. in a UK pint and
16 fl. oz. in a US pint.
That's a huge difference at
the pub.
