Troy,  

I'm not much help with web development, but I've been "fortunate"
enough to be handed the IT tasks for our office.
You mentioned about getting
your server replaced.
We've recently gone through some server upgrades
ourselves.
One thing that I've learned, and that I'm now a fan of, is server
virtualization.

It's great.  If you keep backups of your virtual server(s)
you can restore them to any host without having all the usual headaches of
hardware/driver compatibility.
The best part, is that there are some good,
free virtualization solutions out there.  
Virtualbox is one of them.  I'm
using it right now in a production environment where I've migrated a virtual
MS Windows Server 2008 guest from a Windows Server host to Linux host.
It's
aces and thousands cheaper.

Another great thing is being able to try out
different operating systems without having to re-partition your hard drive.
Got Windows laptop, but want Linux/BSD/MacOSX/Solaris development tools (or
vice versa)?  No problem.
Note, you're limited to OSes that run on x86 or x64
hardware, but that's still a lot of options.

I hope one day to be as
proficient with VW's as I am computers.

Josh

generation AIRS list

Getting the archives searchable was at the top of list
for things to get done
when the server was replaced. Though it still needs
some work, it's definitely
functional and usable (the server it's on is
powered off right now. I should
turn it on when I get home today *sigh* )
Anyways, next up is a revamp of the AIRS list. Now, I could try and do it
myself again and learn more about mysql, php, and general application
development. But, it would be nice to knock this one out in less than two
years :)

So my question is this...  are there any list members out there with
sufficient php, mysql, and general web development skills that would be
willing to donate some time to help get this done? If so, please reply
off-list.
