I found this site yesterday when I was digging around for info,
and I think it was mike who also suggested looking at it for the specs.

I don't have a vacuum gauge so I am going to stop at my local VWFLAPS
(autosport in seatac) and have it checked out on the way home from
work today.  if it fails maybe I can get a new can, or just get a new
dizzy....have to see what happens.

hopefully it all checks out and I can just clean it up.

thanks for all the info ans suggestions!
