Subject: Oil Dipstick Markings

Could someone tell me the difference, in liquid volume, between the marks on
the oil dipstick?

I'm looking for figures for a late 1600 twin port.
Although figures for all engines would be handy to compile a quick reference
sheet for the Type 2 tech library...

Thanks,

Josh
