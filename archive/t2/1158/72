The first picture had me questioning all I know about engines.

The second made it clear again.

Maybe this is confusing because the Type1 and Type4 engines are marked
differently.  ATDC is "A"fter and BTDC is "B"efore.

Now, on my engine, and I'm assuming all other Type1s, there is a notch in the
crankshaft pulley which matches up against the seam in the case. When the
notch and seam line up, you are at TDC.  The Type1 crankshaft pulley then
either has a second timing notch, or a scale on it (like the scale in your
second picture).  However, the scale is on the crankshaft pulley.  The notch
for 7 degrees BTDC is to the left of the TDC mark, which makes perfect sense
since with a clockwise rotating wheel the bit to the right hits the seam in
the case marking before the TDC mark.

In your second picture, it appears the timing marks are on the engine block.
So, the reference point on the crankshaft pulley is static, and the reference
point on the engine moves based on the timing.  Again, this is backwards from
the Type1, where the reference point on the engine is static (the seam of the
case), and the relative reference point on the crankshaft pulley moves.  So
with your engine (and a clockwise rotating pulley), the static mark on the
crankshaft pulley hits the mark on the timing scale of TDC, and then travels
to the right along the scale, which is now measuring After TDC.

If this doesn't make sense one of us needs two more beers.
