Subject: Re: [T2] DVDA Distributor question

Didn't intend to confuse you Zach :)

As John Kolak said, I was referring to the Pulley, not the Scale.
Some T4 Buses have a single mark on the pulley, some with multiple
marks,  Knowing which ones are is what is important.

8.9 Hg vacuum is within tolerance specs, sounds like the diaphragm is
tired - you would be too after 25+ years stretching back and forth -
might have the teeniest of hesitation, but an experienced mechanic can
often compensate by ear after setting the initial timing spec.
Probably ok as it is, it's pretty darn close to spec.

24 degrees at full advance sounds fine too, it's only a degree off the
spec (25 degrees for this DVDA).  Remember, I said 99% of DVDA usually
spec out at 28 degrees on full advance.  This DVDA is probably
designed to be a bit conservative, probably to keep the engine temps
down relative to the engine load design and vehicle weight of the
time.  2.0 SVDA's went to 28 degrees full advance in late 76.

In regards to the lean/rich differences between carbs and FI, this is
an apples and oranges thing.  FI is so much quicker and efficient to
compensate for the lean and rich differences over carbs, thanks to the
temp sensors in both the cylinder head and the AFM (Air Flow Meter)
working in concert with the ECU.  The change in timing can have an
effect, but the ECU can sometimes (but not always) compensate far
better than carbs.  This is what makes L-Jet (Air Flow Control) so
superior over the old D-Jet (Manifold Pressure System) Mechanical FI
that the Type 3 and early 411/412 models had to contend with.  And in
my experience, trouble-shooting is so much easier as well.  The
Digijet system on both my Wasser Vanagons is just a further progession
of L-Jet and I can trouble-shoot a problem (usually very trouble free)
in just a few minutes.

Having it timed correctly is important so that you're not overworking the ECU.
