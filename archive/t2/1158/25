One additional advantage to running points is that one is more apt to 
service the rest of the distributor regularly.  The felt needs a drop or 
two of oil every 5-10,000 miles and when I pull the distributor  I lay 
it on its side and oil the upper shaft bushing through the hole in the 
side of the lower body. One can also pull the plastic plug from the 
bottom of the upper housing and spray the advance mechanism with chain 
lube or spray grease.

I am not much into install and forget when it comes to something like a 
distributor.
