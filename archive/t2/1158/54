Hi Volks,

As promised; here's the shirt art for BOTC 2011. Black ink on a white 
shirt OR white ink on a black shirt.

Yes, Black shirts will be available this year, by pre-order only. If you 
want one you MUST pre-order, I won't have extra black shirts at the event.

Email me your shirt size if you're interested. Shirt orders close August 
1st. I will offer mail order shirts, but be warned that I have been 
known to take an embarrassingly long time to mail shirts out in the 
past, and one of my co-workers just gave notice so I KNOW I will be busy 
for the next few weeks after BOTC.


Happy Trails,
