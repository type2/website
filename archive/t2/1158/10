I will check this..My distributor has one can with two hoses one on
the "front" and one on the "back" of the vacuum can.
it looks like the one in this picture :

I purchased the bus in 2005.  I have not touched the timing since I
bought it, but I have only put MAYBE 1000 miles on it.
When I adjusted the points for the first time this past weekend, the
points were not gapped correctly by any stretch of the imagination.
The gap was far too narrow on the points.


My symptoms before adjusting the points and timing were that it took
at least two tries to get the bus running.
It would start and then die after a few seconds unless I gave it a
little gas in which case it would idle roughly until it came up to
temp.

I have the flaps but my thermostat is bad.
Its on the list and I found a guy on the samba who says he found the
factory that originally supplied the tooling to mahle and can get them
fixed, but its 90 bucks I simply don't have right this second. This is
however another discussion.

Now after adjusting everything including the idle, the bus starts on
the first try but stumbles a little in the beginning and then has some
"burps" here and there until warmed up.
Once warm, it idles nicely around 900rpm but the timing is a little
"jumpy" in that it drifts a little back and forth under the timing
light.

I have read some that this could be due to worn points or a failing
condenser.

I could simply replace the points and condenser, I have spares, but I
purchased the electronic ignition a while back and figured now is as
good of a time as any to convert it over since the consensus seems to
be that it makes for an overall better performing engine.  One of the
main reasons I haven't timed the engine at 3500 rpm is the lack of a
dwell/rpm meter, which will be resolved on Thursday when mine gets
here from Amazon (Love those reward
points)(http://www.amazon.com/Actron-CP7605-Tachometer-Voltmeter-Analyzer/dp/
B00062YUUS/ref=pd_sim_auto_3)
and the fact that I am usually working alone so nobody to operate the
throttle and read the tach in the cab for me.

Plus its a good excuse to pull the dizzy so I can replace the seal and
hopfully put an end to the last of my my oil leak problems for
now(some oil on the top of the engine near the dizzy, going to replace
the case breather seal and the dizzy seal to see what happens).

I appreciate the info and will check that out this afternoon after work.
