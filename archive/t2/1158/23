Subject: re: PB Blaster 50

Hello Fellow VW Nuts

    I have three new un-opened cans of PB Blaster 50, in gallon bulk cans. I
wanted to offer them to the list before I do that "E" thing. They retail for
$27.95 at the local FLAPS, MAKE OFFER! If interested, please let me know off
list.
    I called UPS and they will ship. They weigh 4 lb's each and will box
up at 7' x 5' x 11'.
    Will sell one or all. As much as we use this stuff, may as well get it
cheap. A 9oz spray can is $7.95

Thanks Howard
