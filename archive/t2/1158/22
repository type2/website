since hyd lifters are only in the type 4 engine after 1977 unless your 
engine has been modified heavily.

remove the rocker arm over that lifter
remove the push rod
use a VERY strong magnet on a shaft and grab the top of the lifter and 
carefully slide it out.

Lifters MUST stay in the same position on the cam unless they are new in 
which case break em in like a rebuilt engine.

not hard have changed out one or two that broke a spring in a couple hours
