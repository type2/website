	One story I like to spread was told at Berkeley in 1968 by a 
postdoc recently arr from Colo where Geo Gamow had been in residence.

	Gamow was disgruntled that Physics Today   -   I think I've 
recalled the jnl correctly  -  had just printed some item which he 
deemed no better than mere numerology for which he had little or no 
time.  He therefore declared he was going to mock that piece by 
sending in a spoof: multiply the biggest unit of length by the 
smallest unit of area, and ascribe some significance to the resulting 
volume.
	The megaparsec times the barn gave a volume, in the region of 
a litre, which Gamow found vaguely familiar.  Soon he was staggering 
about the corridor, clearly rattled by the realisation that the 
figure was precisely  -  to I forget how many signif fig  -  the USA 
quart (as opposed to the Imperial quart which we thus learn to be 
less cosmically correct).

	I don't know whether Geo sent this in to Physics Today  as an 
attack on numerology.  He may have  thought, for the first time, that 
numerology has something in it.

	I usually mock the pompous claim of my distant cousin that 
'number holds sway over the flux'; but stories like that do make me 
wonder  . . .
