Subject: Re: Wiper switch inner workings

"I would like to install an adittional wiper switch (basically push a button)
in my T2ab. The idea is not having to switch on and off the regular wiper
switch if there is little rain, but use a push button. Or eventually build in
a relay 19 (or 99). But I have no clue what the original switch turns on and
off at what point."

This may be of help. It shows how to graft in an intermittent wiper or how to
install one like stock:

As a PO conveniently provided a couple of toggle switches under the dash and I
have the dash out for some windscreen lip repairs now seems like the time for
me to carry out this very procedure!
