Subject: Re: [T2] DVDA Distributor question

 Thanks for all the help so far.

I was able to remove the breaker plate vacuum can and clean out all the gunk.
I used some WD40 and then relubed the centrifugal weights with some
light lithium grease, oiled the shaft with some engine oil from a
quart I have in the bus for that purpose and hit the breaker plate
with a little oil and some teflon spray.

Smooth as butter now.


On a side note actually seeing how it all goes together and how
centrifugal advance actually works really helps me grok this stuff.


according to oldvolks, my distributor should be timed to 5degrees ATDC

I am confused about ATDC and BTDC.

I thought ATDC was to the RIGHT of 0 on my timing scale, and BTDC is
to the LEFT of 0
HOWEVER
when I had my wife helping me last night(I don't have a remote start
in the back), the bus hardly ran at 5 degrees to the right.
Could this be the result of the advance side of the vacuum can being tight?


When I read about this stuff everyone is talking about a split in the
case but I don't see any split in the fan shroud on my TypeIV.
Are they talking about the split in the block that is BEHIND the fan shroud?

I should mention that I got the hall effect unit installed (hot spark)
 my timing is stable now (before it was jumpy, but that could have
been old points/condenser) and at 3600 rpm I am getting about 24
degrees of advance which is okay according to bentley.

I am just confused about which side of the 0 on the scale is ATDC and
which is BTDC.......
