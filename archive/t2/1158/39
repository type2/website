Subject: DVDA Distributor question

Finally got some clear weather so I could pull the distributor.

turns out its a 022 905 205AB, Is this what is commonly referred to as a 905?

I figured since I have it out I might as well replace the seal and
clean it up a bit.

I wanted to test the vacuum so I hooked a small piece of vacuum hose
to the Retard(flat side that is against the distributor body) side of
the vacuum can and sucked on it and the little lever inside moved.
When I did the same thing to the Advance side (dome side) nothing happened.

Is this a problem?
I couldn't find anything in the archives or tech libraries that
specifically answers this, however I did find a post that stated that
there is a single diaphragm(well two that are connected in a
push-pull)
Based on that I would expect that applying vacuum to either side would
cause a corresponding movement in the arm.

thanks

-Zach
