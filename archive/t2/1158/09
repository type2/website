Never heard of this before.  Was this a promotional thing VW and First Act did a 
few years ago?
Reading up, it looks like the guitars have a VIN plate that matches the car it 
came with.
It's no Fender/PRS/Gibson/Rickenbacker, but looks like a decent, cheap guitar to 
learn on or just thrash around.
