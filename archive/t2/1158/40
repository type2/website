What happens when you try and move the breaker plate counter-clockwise? 
  That is the direction that the plate should move when advancing the 
timing as the rotor spins clockwise.

The plate should have some relative springiness if I remember correctly, 
but I haven't looked at a DVDA recently.  If it moves by hand, then at 
least you know it's free to move.  If you suck on the nipple on the far 
side of the vacuum can and nothing happens, then I'd say that your 
vacuum advance is shot, but that would be kinda odd that the retard 
works as I'd think they'd be using the same diaphragm.

If I remember, when I get home I'll try it on one of my SVDAs in my 
garage...
