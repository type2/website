This is the tough part - you are not tuning for the distributor, but for 
the engine.  I can't remember what year bus you have, or if you have a 
stock engine.  In my 78, for example, I tune for 32 max advance and 41 
with the vacuum hose connected, but I have the stock engine for that 
year, so everything matches up...

Fill us in on what year your bus is and what engine you have and let's 
go from there.
