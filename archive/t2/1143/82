I like analog gauges so in looking around I see the innovate 3822-G5 
complete analog kit    also the 3828 18ft extension cables.

tad more expensive but I prefer the looks and matches my other guages.

what is your opinion of these guages.   welding a bung in is no big deal I 
have a  welder and drill so souldn't be a problem.  where to put it now 
could be a big deal.   also have to clean up some minor exhaust leaks that 
have been bugging me for a bit.

but once I get it working how do I get it to tell me what to do to improve 
fuel enoconomy....  don't mind buying a tool but sure would like to know 
how to use it.

thanks
Bob
