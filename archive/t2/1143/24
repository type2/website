Be careful of the shade band.  Is it really needed?  The line of sight in a
bus is higher than in a conventional sedan.  How often do you have to crane
your neck when you're the first in line at a stoplight?

I'm bout 6 feet tall, and a seldom have to use the sun visor.  Come to think
of it, I am seldom bothered by someone else's high beams.  One of the many
things I like about driving a bus, I guess.
