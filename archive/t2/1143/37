yes had to use a bosch coil as I normally run an MSD high output coil with 
a crane high output XR3000 rather than the normal XR700.

but this system has been on the bus for years, long before the problem

??? put new temp sensor II in the other day and fuel mileage went up a

and may be a hint about problem, or maybe just aberation will need to do 
more than one fill up average to be sure.
