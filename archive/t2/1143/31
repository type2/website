Yes, a tight crank or rod would lead to overheating. I had a 1500cc 
Beetle engine with a bad linebore. Was a cheap catalog replacement motor 
that the PO bought. I think a JC Whitney special. Anyhow it lasted a 
year. Rod was hammering away for most of that year. PO gave up on it b/c 
it ran so hot and mileage was so poor. Whole engine and tin and carb and 
exhaust was the cheap shiny chrome versions. Sold the car to me. I drove 
it until it was ready to fly apart (on purpose to see how long it would 
last). Pulled it out so I wouldn't get stranded and put in a Type IV 
engine. Excellent Beetle motor that Type IV engine.
