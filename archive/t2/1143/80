Lot's of good fun in this post.

I'd throw in that if the engine chamber has higher pressure, you
should have an increase of horsepower, too, since the fan is being
helped along 8^p

I've also heard that the outer scoops on the T1 increase engine temp
in city driving where you do not get the ram air effect and air cross
flow is reduced. A VW mechanic told me that's why the scoops fell out
of favor. They were quite the thing to have at one time. Plus the
"original German" type types don't favor them :-)
