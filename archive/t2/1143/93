Speaking of arcane :^D
The splitty inherently suffers from a weaker cooling system design than the
later baywindows did(the doghouse on the '71 and the type IV).  If any cooling
gains were accomplished at driving speed, it is because there was 'room for
improvement' in the cooling ability of the vehicle already.  Anybody use these
scoops on a splitty with a properly installed doghouse-cooled upright 1600cc
engine?  Notice any cooling improvement at speed?  I doubt it.  I agree with
Chris.  There is no such thing as a free lunch.  At a certain point, you can
only push so much air into the engine compartment before it becomes
irrelevant.  A better fan shroud, or possibly adding a few louvers to the
intake vents would have the same effect.
