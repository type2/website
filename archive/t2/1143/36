I'm not exactly sure of the layout on a 71, but if I understand you 
correctly, those puffy things around the exhaust are the heat 
exchangers.  Those allow exhaust gas to heat up the air and then send it 
on up to the cabin.  If you don't use the heat exchangers, you're just 
sending ambient air up to the cabin.
