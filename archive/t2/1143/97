Like I mentioned in a previous reply to this message, you do NOT need to 
use any resistors to use the LC-1 with various AFR meters (home-brew or 
production).  The LC-1's voltage output is software configurable and 
while using resistors may work, it's going to make things more complex, 
introduce more complexity, and quite possibly make the output less accurate.
