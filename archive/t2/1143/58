It takes a special controller - it's not like narrowband O2 sensors 
where you can just hook it up to your exhaust, power it up, and read the 
signal.  You actually need to have something to control the heater 
circuit, among other things, if I remember correctly.  The MegaSquirt 
folks were working on a wideband controller so people didn't have to buy 
the LC-1 or similar products, but I think it's been stalled for a few years.

I've also heard of people using this:
