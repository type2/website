When I got my bus it had a Weber progressive. At some point prior to
purchase, the idle mixture screw had been wound all the way out so it
was running very rich. As I result it would barely run at idle and there
was a puff of black smoke when I accelerated away after idling for a
little while. I suspect that Bob's ignition is fine or he would have
similar problems to what I had.
