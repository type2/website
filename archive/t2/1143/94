Subject: front blinker assembly: gasket replacement

Hi All,

So I've drilled out the two rivets holding the front blinker assembly, so I
can replace the gasket. Given there are only the two rivet points, I have to
wonder how well this will re-seal... the original gasket seems spongy, the
replacements rubber... of course, mine were likely leaky (and maybe spongy)
due to age and shrinkage, not necessarily poor mating surfaces, but...has
anyone use any sealant (I was thinking just silicone) between the
gasket-to-body edge?

Thanks Mike
