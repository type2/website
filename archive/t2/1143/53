I don't know much about sticking the sensor in the tail pipe as it'll 
get banged around and I don't know if that's good for the elements in 
there.  I would assume that it's built well, but I'm not totally sure.

In my case, I have a slightly different setup than what most would use. 
  I have something similar to this:

http://www.vwgolf-mk2.com/modification/air_fuel_gauge/006.jpg

It reads 0 to 1 volts and has 10 LEDs that light up appropriately.  I'm 
using one of the analog outputs from the LC-1 to drive the meter, and 
the other analog output drives the MegaSquirt.  The analog outputs can 
be configured most any way you'd like and you can even use a multimeter 
to read the output voltage from the LC-1 if you wanted to be on the 
cheap, however that gets difficult to monitor while you're driving, 
which is exactly when you need to see it.  Oh, and it doesn't really 
help having someone else watch the gauge while you drive - you really 
want to be able to see the gauge reading out of the corner of your eye 
while driving as you know how hard you're pressing the pedal and can 
then get an idea for what kinda AFR to expect.
