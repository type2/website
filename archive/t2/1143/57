Hi Robert,

The "scoop" has fallen to the wayside as it is not stock. It is a remnant of 
the 60's and 70's. I for one opted to remove mine when I had my bus 
restored. There was some annecdotal information that it didn't make any 
significant difference to engine temps. Was never able to check on that. 
What with the newer dog house oil cooler and wider fan, engines run cooler 
naturally

P.S. I attended that particular event in 08. Was quite the show. I attended 
the winter event just 2 weeks ago. Over 300 splitty buses in attendance and 
quite a good crowd. The raffle prizes were very nice. I was the lucky 
recipient of a gift certificate for West Coast Metric as well as Koch's 
steering wheel restorations.
