	You don't need to convince me.  My friend Dr Geo Blanshard, U 
of Auckland mech eng'g dept, was among the first c.1988 to slap 
oxygen sensors in exhausts, to enable feedback control of mixture by 
actually measuring in the exhaust some index of combustion 
efficiency.  BMW etc soon latched on.  It is elementary logic: if you 
actually monitor the combusion products in at least this one aspect 
(O2 ), you gain data which can be fed back around to keep the 
fuel/air ratio closer to optimal.
	The fact remains that FI to specs, or a well-tuned carb, can 
produce exhaust when warmed up which is IMHO pretty clean.  Of 
course, water injection will improve CO, NOx, & HCs  ...
	Bus content: let's counterattack on this mpg fixation.  The 
ton-mi/gall is a more realistic measure of fuel economy, and I 
suspect the T2 looks pretty good on that criterion.
		Brazil, pull yourselves together :-[
		Revive the aircooled T2  which delivers spiffing ton-mi/gall
		Offer the Brazilian Weber, & optional FI

	Could we hear from autodigital ace Jon Syder on whether Bob's 
FI 'computer' could have developed a dud 'program' ?   Is that a 
known family of failure modes for this class of device, or are they 
the marketing division's dream, the 'all or none' non-repairable box 
lacking partial failures?
