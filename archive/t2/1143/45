Without getting into a lot of detail and going into non-standard
(non-OEM) AFR theories and experimental practices, the LM-1 manual
lists the stoichiometric ratios for the various fuels on page 3. For
gasoline, it is 14.7 to 1.

This is only desirable at idle. OEM specs rely on excess fuel for
cooling and to compensate for imperfect atomization of fuel droplets
in the combustion chamber. Mixtures leaner than 13:1 are dangerously
hot. By comparison, hot rodders use about 12:1 as an optimal power
mixture. Properly tuned VW systems should run between 12:1 to 13:1.
Since you are running rich, I expect you will be seeing much lower
ratios.

Since the LM-2 is the current model, there are a couple of LM-1s on
that auction site at $75. The LM-1 also offers a tailpipe adapter so
you don't have to weld a bung onto your exhaust.

My wires are quite long, but I don't think it would reach the dash.
It's a handheld meter anyway, so you don't dash mount it. It does data
recording too if you take it for a drive, but I've never explored that
function.
