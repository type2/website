	I'm staggered these Splittie fans have
not yet caught on to the air-scoop for improved
cooling.  Just a strip of aloominum (or some
plastic) the width of a hand, vertical at the
rear of the air-intake louvres, yaw'd fw c.450,
makes a big improvement on the engine oil T at
cruising speeds.
	Devoid of any shred of direct evidence, I
nonetheless believe the factory ripped this same
idea off us Berkeley hippies for the built-in,
higher-level intake scoops std on our beloved T2.
	Anyhow, current Splittie drivers should avail themselves of the idea.
