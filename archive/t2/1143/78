Subject: Fallacies of weak induction

Ahh.  I thought as much.  You know what they say about opinions.The ol', 'if
you can't disprove it it must be true' fallacy.  A.k.a the appeal to
ignorance.  Nicely blended with a Non-causa, Pro-causa fallacy.Well
done(sarcasm).Eron




        Why
won't my word do?  What is being sought beyond that?  Surely
not some refereed jnl paper, or even SAE report   ... ?
Pray tell, Eron.  And please clarify which theory you're now
referring to; is it what I said, viz.
>  if the pressure difference
between the engine chamber and the air rushing past underneath the
engine is increased, then all else being equal the fan will pump more
L/s [down past the engine]



Meanwhile I'm put in mind of a favourite Winnie quote (upon
being unexpectedly contradicted by a main ally, at Yalta I
think):



        When
I state a matter of fact that is within my knowledge, I expect it to
be accepted.


        That
has been the spirit of this T2 List in my few y of experience.
It is a precioius community.  When I feel some twinge of doubt
about the reliability of a listee's recollection, I don't cut up ugly
by expressing doubt.  We have to live with uncertainty.
Not that there is any to speak of on this non-issue of scoops.


        And now
I unleash the king-hit: if intake-scoops didn't improve cooling, why
did my '69 1500 T2 sport these slightly expensive features of
bodywork?  Far be it from me to say VW designers were never
wrong, but I've never heard the late-T2 scoops called superfluous.
So I am hitting you, Eron, with die Krdute;  I believe
they knew what they were doing on this one, and I'd like to hear from
any contact in that design process, so as to confirm or correct my
claim to have been an originator.
