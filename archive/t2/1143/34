Subject: Heater question (71 bus) 

I installed a "crappy" empi quiet pack muffler 2 years ago  on my 71 bus w/
stock 1600 DP. Now I'm replacing that crappy and "very rusty" empi pack and
I realized why I might have lost some heat. I have fresh air hoses connected
from the fan  housing directly to the heat exchangers.. This  bypasses  the
stock "thingamajigs" , those puffy looking things that wrap around the #2
and #4 exhaust pipes, that were on the original  muffler.  Am I correct in
assuming those things might be important to helping with the heat in the bus
than without?
