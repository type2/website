Always find it amusing when some parties presume that THEIR reality MUST
apply to everyone else, anyway, I don't know how it is where SOME people
live, but my '74 poptop Campmobile WITH new seals runs notably cooler WITH
scoops than without. In Oz we're often running outside temps of 35-40C or
more in summer, and I don't baby the old girl, but she'll happily cruise at
110-120Ks most of the day WITH scoops, she was getting noticably hot
without scoops at lower load.

That's the evidence I've found in my part of the world.
