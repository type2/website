Hi Chris,

I have one of those in my Vanagon. For those who don't want to solder, 
Ken Lewis makes them for $22. Connect it to a 3-wire O2 sensor and watch 
a lambda equipped FI system bounce the signal back and forth from lean 
to rich all day long. Excepting for throttle input and coasting...

Not as useful as a wideband sensor, but useful nonetheless.

Happy Trails,
