I've said it before, but I'll say it again - you really should get 
yourself an AFR meter and adjust your fueling.  You're making the very 
large assumption that your AFM is tuned correctly and that very well 
might not be the case.

Another reason why you might want to do this is because you can get your 
AFM adjusted and get the car running normally.  Your rich running might 
be masking the real culprit, if there is one.  Then, as you make tuneups 
and other adjustments, you can see how it affects your AFR.  That, or it 
just might continue running normally from there on out.
