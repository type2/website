Can this can be made portable if you don't need to see it while driving 
or if you must, have someone in the back read it through open upper 
engine access??  Can you provide it power/ground (alligator clips to 
battery) and stick the sensor up the tailpipe?  I see the portable ones 
cost much more than just the gauge and sensor.
