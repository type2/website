After you've checked an verified your cam and piston timing, I would 
recommend renting a wideband.  I'd either look for some local hot-rod 
shops, or go to a dyno shop (they'll usually have one that they use when 
running a car on the dyno), or rent one here from John:

Regardless of the fact that you have a rebuilt AFM, it could still be 
tuned incorrectly for your engine.  If you have a wideband, and assuming 
that the rest of your engine is within spec, adjusting the AFM for the 
correct AFM should be trivial.  There's only two adjustments - spring 
tension and then adjusting the idle mixture.
