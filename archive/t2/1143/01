I am referring to the hose that runs from the manifold to the fuel 
pressure regulator.  While disconnecting this hose might kill the engine 
a bit, I think it should still keep running if you kink it quickly... 
that or just bend it and then pull it off of the regulator (it's been a 
long since I've done this test).  Allowing air to leak into the manifold 
for this test isn't *that* big of a deal, but what happens is that it's 
unmetered air, which means air is bypassing the AFM flap and also 
causing the flap to close slightly.  This in-turn causes the mixture to 
lean out.
