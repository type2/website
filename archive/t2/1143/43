. where is it placed?

The O2 sensor is screwed into a bung welded into the exhaust. They
supply the bung with this kit (and a plug for if you run with the sensor
out.)

. how does it work

It estimates the air fuel ratio. So a big number is rich and a small
number is lean.

. does it have wiring long enough to reach the dash. (I have empty hole
in guage panel) . what is the ideal setting for a type IV engine

Good question! I would presume most are designed for front engine
vehicles. Ideal settings are dependent on whether you are cruising or
under load. Sorry I can't be more specific, but I know it has been
covered in detail on www.shoptalkforums.com
