I had scoops on my 65 camper and the drag they added I don't think was 
overcome by the additional cooling,,  I considered it a draw and only left 
em on because I thought they looked "cool" have never put them on any 
other van I had.

of course the later bay vans had a sort of scoop built into the air 
intakes so maybe the folks in Wolfsberg thought differently
