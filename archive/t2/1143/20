Subject: Re: [T2] Pilkington windshield glass and seal

When my co-workers and I installed a Pilkington Windshield in a 71 Bus
a year ago with a VW of Mexico Seal, we didn't have to bevel or shave
any edges.  Went in like butter.  Perhaps a bad one of the batch yours
was made in?  It's been known to happen, but just speculating.
