the tranny book doesn't really give a test, and it would seem it would run 
hot.  I'm going mostly by the fact that it shifts at the right time and 
15yrs seat of the pants with auto tranny buses.

the trouble shhooting book for the auto tranny doesn't even have that as a 
possible problem...    top speed is normal and it gets there in normal 
amount of time,  it would take a LOT of drag to cut into fuel mileage that 
much which would result in a  lot of heat which would probably have killed 
the tranny by now

the engine just doesn't sound like or feel like it is under unusual load.
