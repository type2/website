there is a chance it is off a little but I did take it thru a "meausured" 
mile a few months back and it was pretty dern close.  this far off the 
seat of my pants is telling me I'm in the gas station too often.

speedo part is accurate too so rarely one working and not the other.

would that it was so easy.
but it almost has to be one of those "Duh" things i think, I've checked 
all the complicated stuff.
