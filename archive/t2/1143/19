Subject: Re: [T2] Pilkington windshield glass and seal

I went with a German seal.

The glass shop had to shave and bevel the edges of the Pilkington
windshield they put in my 70 bus after the new guy broke my German
one.  One of my friends works at the place and was a bit annoyed with
the piece after having to reshape it around the corners.  And no, the
body/nose isn't tweaked on it.
