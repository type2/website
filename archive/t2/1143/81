Ah there, I think is the key point, my understanding is that the point of
the scoops is to boost the airflow for cooling AT CRUISING SPEEDS, in my
experience, for this, especially in high ambient temperatures and load
conditions, they work quite well. The original design (once again, MY
understanding), was for a commercial vehicle operating in urban conditions
in temperate zones, therefore the cooling system would have been optimised
for low speed operations in urban areas, rather than cruising down the
highway under higher load conditions, especially not in generally hotter
climes.

Anyway, my point was that at highway speeds at higher ambient temps, they
appear to provide a notable improvement.
