Because I'm sure someone will ask, the only reason that this works for 
Greg is because his VW EFI computer uses a closed-loop algorithm to 
control the fueling based on the output of the *narrowband* O2 sensor. 
This closed-loop control usually only happens during cruise.  It will 
tell you that you're rich of stoich (14.7:1) during rich events, and 
lean of stoich during lean events, but not by how much (regardless of 
what any web page on the web says).

The reason is because of the way a narrowband sensor works - it will 
sense on either side of stoich, but never actually stay there - but 
that's the intended behavior.  The computer in Greg's car will adjust 
the fueling such that the sensor reads lean/rich/lean/rich/lean/rich, 
which means that it's averaging to stoich.  Do not expect to be able to 
just install a cheap narrowband sensor and get sensible readings from 
this gauge, especially if you don't have a computer with a closed-loop 
O2 circuit.

However, you can get an LED meter like the one Greg linked to and use it 
with your LC-1 instead of spending the money on an Innovate gauge.  The 
reason that it works is because you can configure the voltage output of 
the LC-1 to match the voltage input of the LED meter (0-1V), which is 
coincidentally the output of a narrowband sensor.

I was looking for another gauge similar to that one, but it looks like 
they're all red or green.  I'd rather have one like my current meter 
that has 10 LEDs that transition from red to blue (with other colors in 
between).

thanks,
Mike
