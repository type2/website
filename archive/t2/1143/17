Subject: Pilkington windshield glass and seal

Does anybody have any experience with Pilkington Auto glass.   A local glass
dealer can get this type of windshield for my 1973 Bus, tinted with a shade
band for $153.

 

I know this is often discussed here but after looking through the archives I
just want to be sure on the general consensus on the best seal for the
windshield.   OEM German? IIRC.

 

Thanks,

Tom
