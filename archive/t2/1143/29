I did the ignition tune up on my CR-V this weekend. New plugs (60K old), 
new cap and rotor (214K old), same wires. Won back 4 mpg. Would a weak 
spark really account for a 15 mpg drop? Just curious...

Partially seized tranny bearing like in the differential? But then it 
would be noisy, right?

Plugged exhaust?

Massive air leaks in the tube running from the air meter to the engine? 
Injection tuned very rich to make up for these vacuum leaks?

Leaky EGR valve? I blocked mine off b/c I could not locate a new one.

Is the air meter and computer and sensors all matched? Not from 
different versions of the VW EFI?

Tight crank or rod bearing clearances?

I've got nothing concrete to offer. Curious as a cat though about it.

Somebody up near Bob needs to offer Bob another engine to test with his 
bus.
