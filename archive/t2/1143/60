When you get the LC-1, you get a controller (which is essentially the 
sensor plug receptacle) and the sensor.  The sensor has an 18 inch wire 
or so with a plug, then you plug that into the LC-1, which then has a 
6ft pigtail coming off of it.  To those wire ends you will hook up 
power, ground, and then send your signals where you want to go.  I would 
assume the serial/digital outputs can be extended (they look like 
headphone plugs), because I've used the serial adapter and added another 
20ft serial cable to hook it up to my laptop up front with no problems 
at all.

That, or you can get any cheapo A/F ratio gauge that reads a voltage 
signal and send the analog voltage to that gauge.... or, you can buy one 
of the innovate digital gauges that reads the signal off of the 
serial/digital output and uses that to display the AFR.  It's probably a 
bit more accurate, but nothing you'll ever notice.

There are quite a few options on how you decide to set this up.  You 
don't even need to get a gauge - you can just hook up the sensor, get 
power to the LC-1, and hook up a laptop and read it on the screen while 
you drive.  Once you get your engine dialed in, it really shouldn't 
change tune unless you have something *really* wrong (i.e. valves, 
plugs, timing, etc).
