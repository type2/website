Subject: Re: [T2] Pilkington windshield glass and seal

Not a bad price, considering it is tinted and has the shade band.

There are two OEM VW seals that Airhead Parts carries, German and
Mexico. In my experience both have been very good quality in both
material and installation: Pilkington is one of the largest
manufacturers of glass in the world and has been good quality.
