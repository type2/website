Plus, the funny part about this is you'll install it and then wonder why 
you never got one earlier.  I always moped about how expensive it was 
until I got one - then I got a second one!  It's one of *the best* 
tuning tools that you can have.  Once you get to know what AFR your bus 
likes to run at, you'll instantly recognize when it's going out of tune 
because you'll see the AFR deviating from normal running AFRs.  No more 
tuning by the seat of your pants - with the WB you'll have quantifiable 
data to back up your suspicions and you'll have a much stronger 
understanding of what's happening with your EFI system.
