I'd either rent this one (LM-1):

or get one of these:

Controller, sensor, and gauge for 169:

That's actually a really good price considering it comes with the gauge, 
too.  Plus, if you have a laptop, you can hook that up as well... but 
that won't really matter much for you.

This would be a permanent install, but I think that would be good setup 
for you long-term.
