	I fail to see what theory  -  what version of fluid dynamics 
-  could point to that conclusion.
	On the contrary, if the pressure difference between the 
engine chamber and the air rushing past underneath the engine is 
increased, then all else being equal the fan will pump more L/s.
	Of course (as I've emphasized previously) leaks of that 
precious pressurized air above the engine must be minimal.

	Anyhow, facts trump theory.  The intake scoops do improve 
cooling.  Actual facts were measured on buses in the range '56 - 66, 
i.e T1 engines.
