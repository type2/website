I just realized that this won't necessarily give valid readings because 
the engine isn't running and the injectors aren't firing so the results 
might be skewed (I think the Bentley wants the engine running during 
testing, right?).  I'd remove the manifold vacuum hose from the 
regulator and if the engine is stopping because you're removing the 
hose, block it off and restart the engine.  If it won't run regardless, 
let us know.

I have one of these:

Maybe autozone has one that you can use - you'll need a T-fitting and 
just put it inline with the hose that runs to the fuel pressure regulator.

While this is nice to know, it's not really *that* big of a deal - 
you'll just get a high idle if it's not closing all the way.


Also, what is your max advance with the vacuum hose disconnected and 
with it connected?
