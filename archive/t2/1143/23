Internal friction from a poor align bore, a seizing bearing,  a bad 
connecting rod bearing, cam shaft, or distributer gear, etc.?  You should be 
able to get a sense if there is an internal problem by goosing the engine at 
idle.    A trouble- free  engine should require just a light tap on the 
accelerate to jump to the 4,000 - 5,000 rpm range.  An engine with internal 
problems will likely not be so responsive.

Probably not the answer but one more thing to cross off.
