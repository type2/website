Hi Volks,

It's that time again... Time to sell some early bird camping passes to 
the best Bus-oriented Cornroast in the whole country!!! Buses of the 
Corn 2011 will be happening at Heber Down Conservation Area on the 
weekend of August 12-14th. Gates open at noon on Friday!

In order to help cover the increased cost of registration this year I am 
offering up a dozen early-bird weekend passes including a T-shirt to the 
first dozen people who pre-pay their registration fees. $25 can be 
mailed or paypal-ed, see the website for details.

Website?

Yup. www.busesofthecorn.ca . Yes, dot CA. There is plenty of BOTC info 
there, including maps and local attractions. If you have any further 
questions please don't hesitate to email me off-list.


Happy Trails,
