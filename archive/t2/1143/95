Because I'm sure someone will ask, the only reason that this works for 
Greg is because his VW EFI computer uses a closed-loop algorithm to 
control the fueling based on the output of the *narrowband* O2 sensor. 
This closed-loop control usually only happens during cruise.  It will 
tell you that you're rich of stoich (14.7:1) during rich events, and 
lean of stoich during lean events, but not by how much (regardless of 
what any web page on the web says).
