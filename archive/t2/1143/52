Re portable sensor/gauge
$75 for a pipe that holds the sensor and clamps in place?  Can one make 
it to protect the sensor wire? I don't have a cat., so up the tailpipe 
should work?  How did you extend the wiring to go up front to the gauge?



  Yes an no.  They have this, which allows you to put the sensor in 
tailpipe:

  ... but it needs to go before the cat.
