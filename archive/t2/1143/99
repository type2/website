Subject: air scoops & mythbusters....

I have heard that they don't help, and I have heard they do help.I thought
this might be a good thing to send to Mythbusters. I don't know exactly how
they decide what to test, but I signed into their system, and posted the
question.if you want them to take a look at it, maybe we should all request
it.

 

I think this is the link to my question:
