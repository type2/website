Subject: Fuse blew and stopped my van

Hi everyone,

After digging into the fuse box I became intimidated because there were a
variety of wires that seemed to be in the wrong place. I took it to the shop
that I have work on my bus and they fixed it up. The ignition wire was on
the top whereas it should have been connected to the bottom. The bus is now
wired as per the Bentley.

Thank you everyone as always for your suggestions and tips.

Max
