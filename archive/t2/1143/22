	The details Bob has given of his motor's performance, as 
distinct from economy, seem to rule out this explanation.  If the 
motor runs smoothly & powerfully, juice to plugs is OK.
	A motor could possibly decline in economy owing to weak 
spark, but then it would show poor power (cruising speed, 
hill-climbing).  And I doubt it would get rid of nearly as much 
petrol as Bob's Mystery Motor is doing :-(
