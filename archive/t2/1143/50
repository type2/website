Yes an no.  They have this, which allows you to put the sensor in tailpipe:

... but it needs to go before the cat.  Otherwise, you can have the bung 
welded on, and when you use it, screw the WBO2 in the exhaust, and when 
you're done, pull it out and put the included plug in the bung.

As far as reading it through the engine access, that would probably be 
more of a pain than just routing the wire up front.  The reason is 
because the LC-1 is the actual plug - it's waterproof so it can be 
mounted under the car.  So, you have the WBO2 sensor which hooks up to 
the exhaust, then there's about 18 inches of wire, then the plug which 
plugs into the LC-1, and then there's about 6ft of wires.  In my 
installs, mounted the LC-1 near the starter (because I have my WB sensor 
welded in my 3/4 exhaust header), I brought all of those wires into the 
engine compartment.  One bundle is the power/ground/analog signal lines, 
and the other two wires are the serial in and the serial out.  Serial in 
is for programming, out is for going to gauges, which can be daisy 
chained.  The LC-1s can also be daisy chained if you have multiple.

You could just get the basic LC-1, wire it up so that you have alligator 
clips and clip it to the battery, then get a serial cable extension and 
run that all the way up to the front of the car to a laptop (that has a 
serial port or a serial-to-USB adapter) and just look at the gauge on 
the laptop.  Then when you're done, pull the sensor out and it will 
definitely save the sensor's life.  Getting a new sensor is about $50 or so.
