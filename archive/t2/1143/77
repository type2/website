That was in reaction to my saying air-intake
scoops were shown, soon after their invention
c.1967, to improve cooling at cruise.  The latest
way I'd mentioned that was:

	Why won't my word do?  What is being
sought beyond that?  Surely not some refereed jnl
paper, or even SAE report   ... ?  Pray tell,
Eron.  And please clarify which theory you're now
referring to; is it what I said, viz.

	Meanwhile I'm put in mind of a favourite
Winnie quote (upon being unexpectedly
contradicted by a main ally, at Yalta I think):

		When I state a matter of fact
that is within my knowledge, I expect it to be
accepted.

	That has been the spirit of this T2 List
in my few y of experience.  It is a precioius
community.  When I feel some twinge of doubt
about the reliability of a listee's recollection,
I don't cut up ugly by expressing doubt.  We have
to live with uncertainty.   Not that there is any
to speak of on this non-issue of scoops.

	And now I unleash the king-hit: if
intake-scoops didn't improve cooling, why did my
'69 1500 T2 sport these slightly expensive
features of bodywork?  Far be it from me to say
VW designers were never wrong, but I've never
heard the late-T2 scoops called superfluous.  So
I am hitting you, Eron, with die Krdute;  I
believe they knew what they were doing on this
one, and I'd like to hear from any contact in
that design process, so as to confirm or correct
my claim to have been an originator.

	A further invention which I didn't admire
nearly so much was also begun on splitties: the
external oil cooler with exposed oil-pipes.  But
I can't provide any 'research', let alone actual
research, on that similar issue.  Nor, I admit,
on scoops.

	Much of what catches on is rational, and
some of it originates outside Wolfsburg.
