Michael,

You got a fair response on this before...go search thu the archives, but 
just for the record, here is my first reply on this.
========================
Michael,

This is one of the *more* important things to know how to do...*Where*  is 
your manual!!

Yes, there will be a *lot* of play without the flywhell/flexplate/shims 
installed.  The proper way to do this is to *read the manual* and 
understand that you measure the first time with 2 shims on and then find 
the correct thickness of shim to make the endplay come out where it is 
supposed to(factory specs).

I can't stress how important this is to do correctly!

Cheers, dave
