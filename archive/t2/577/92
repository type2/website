Subject: Buses Of the Corn Update - August 6th to 8th, 2004 in Whitby

Hi Volks,

Every week brings us closer to BOTC 2004 and I get busier planning and 
co-ordinating the stuff that will be taking place.

This week's excitement is the announcement of BOTC 2004 T-Shirts. The 
shirts were very popular in 2002 and were missed by many in 2003, so I 
have enlisted Adam Narraway's assistance to bring back the T's for 
BOTC4. The design this year is a simple one-color image that will work 
very well on a tie-dyed shirt.

Did I mention that the Tie-Dye Workshop is free to registered campers? 
As is the Frisbee Golf, Bus Driver's challenge and the Corn Roast!! 
We'll also have a Burrito Breakfast in the morning and a Pot-Luck 
dinner and after dark will be campfire time.

Registration for BOTC is a measly $8 pre-paid, or $10 at the gate. 
That's in Canadian funds of course, which makes it even more affordable 
for our neighbors to the south.

How can we put on a camp-out so cheap? First off we owe a huge thanks 
to our sponsor GermanSupply.com. Secondly, it's because we use a 
relatively primitive campsite with pit toilets and coin-op showers. 
There's also extremely limited hydro available. (Read: "Medical use" 
only!) So don't say I didn't warn you!  We keep coming back because 
it's a great site with virtually no local traffic and lots of room for 
people to set up camp. And after all, it's only a couple of days. Just 
remember to bring lots of quarters.

Happy trails,
