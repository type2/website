Subject: RE: [T2] Exhaust Fastner Help

I recall the stock nuts are 13mm, but many folks use the the Gene Berg copper VW exhaust nuts:
 
1) They are 12 mm outside diameter, so they are easier to get a wrench around in tight spots. Inner diameter is the same, so they fit the studs & bolts.
2) They are split, which provides a self-locking feature (but only use them once I think)
3) Copper won't rust like steel.
 
They say to use copper anti-seize, but I couldn't find it. I don't remember using washers, maybe I did. You can find Gene Berg on the net (they're in LA)
