Subject: heater boxes

I've got a pair of very nice used heater boxes from a 73-74 Type 4 engine, I
used them on my '78 Westy for about a year, I recently sanded, coated with por
15, then primer, then high heat black paint.  I'd like to get $200 for the
pair.  Anyone interested let me know.  I also have a few pics if anyone is
interested..
