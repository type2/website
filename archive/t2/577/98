Subject: Re: [T2] Type 1 engine Alternator Wiring instead of Gen

Ok, Since I had so many responses, all saying they needed more info. Here
are some pics of the current voltage regulator (presently installed) along
with the alternator (attached to fan housing) plus the voltage regulator
(the one in my hand) that I bought that is supposedly for a 72 bus.  I am
unsure if this alternator has an internal regulator or not.  Can someone
please confirm if I need to wire it up as you do for a 72 bus?  I haven't
checked the Bentley yet and wanted to make sure I am on the right track.
