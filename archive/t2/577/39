Subject: Endplay Question

Besides the problems I have been having posting to the list and my email 
account, I have a question.

My engine is down to a little less than a longblock. I am replacing the main 
seals. Flexplate is off, seal removed, three shims found. I have not removed 
the rear main seal (RIR) or the hub for the fan. This is a 2.0L GEX. But the 
travel on the crankshaft seems to be too much. I am getting front to back 
movement in a range of 2mm to 2.5mm. Isn't this just way off. Or is this a 
case where when I reinstall the associated pieces the travel will decrease. 
I tried to Mich the shimms in mid dash on the way to work this morning and I 
think I came up with a combined thickness of .026" or 0.6604mm. Does this 
sound correct. I would like to get this back together tonight. Help please.

Thanks,

Michael Knight
