Subject: Re: [T2] Whats the secret for removing push rod tubes??

I use an open end wrench on the tubes. I can't remember the size right 
now, but it's probably a 17mm. The wrench fits over the middle of the 
tube, but not over the wider part near the head. Gentle tapping on the 
wrench pops the tube loose. This way I'm not crushing anything.

I use a large socket to tap them back in.
