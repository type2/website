Truckers frequent Ch 19, though they often use other channels on specific
highways.  Bus folk monitor Ch 2 on both CB and FRS

Don't expect great performance from that setup!

Those work well if installed carefully.  Be sure to comply with the
"distance from metal" specification in the instructions and clean the
glass very well before installing.

My antennas (CB, HF and VHF) are mounted on my roof rack.  You can
get a wire to the roof rack with no visible holes by going into the engine
bay through a hole behind the spare tire and then up through the air vent
to the roof rack.
