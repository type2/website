Subject: Ball Joint press service & alignment in San Francisco?

I have a 72' Westy.

I've successfully removed my torsion arms following Mike Gensler's excellent
write up in the Type2 Library.

I already have a new set of Ball Joints, but need a reputable place to press
the old ones out and the new ones in.

Can anyone recommend a shop in/around San Francisco where I should go?
Approximately what should I expect to pay for pressing services for 4 Ball
Joints?

After I reinstall everything, I'll need an alignment.  Any advice on SF area
alignment shops with plenty of bus experience?

Ideally I'll find a place that can do both procedures...

Paul
