Subject: Cruisin CB channels for monitoring

Would someone be able to advise on which channels I should monitor on the CB
while on the road to hear the truckers and also the favorites for VW owners??

I am going to match my AM Antenna whip to CB using a tuner that allows the
continued use of the AM/FM radio as well. 35 smackers for the cheap little
box.

Also going to put in a "thru the glass" 2 meter ham radio antenna.
