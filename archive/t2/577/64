Corbett,

If you get them synchronized according to the book, and they are in any 
kind of good shape at all, they will do *very* well.

Follow the instructions in the manual to a "T"!

I had a setup like this long ago on a bus with a stock rebuilt engine and 
it was a screamer...I actually did 105 in the bus early one 
beautiful Saturday morning on an absolutely deserted interstate....I was 
ecstatic!

As always...YMMV as the bus was only a several years old and had brand new 
ball joints and tires all the way around and there was *no* wind.  Loved 
that bus compared to my 67....could haul with the truckers on the 
interstate any day of the week.

Cheers, dave
