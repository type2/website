Actually I did address that issue. As I wrote:

This part does not have any vehicle application data attached to it in
our database. (If you click on it, you'll see that where it says "You
can find this part in...", no data follows that header.)  So even though
YOU may know it fits your bus, the website doesn't know that yet.
Therefore it will not come up in a context-sensitive search that is
looking ONLY for parts that are coded as fitting a specific year. In a
perfect world every single part in the database would have vehicle
application data on our site, so they would all come up in a
context-sensitive search. But in the real world, with almost 200,000
parts to code, this will take years and will almost certainly never be
complete (although I keep plugging away at it day by day...). So
meanwhile, those parts that do not have any vehicle application data
attached to them will come up only if you search using the left side
search box.
