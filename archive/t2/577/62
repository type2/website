Subject: RE: [T2] FW: correct carbs for 73

I am in the process of installing the stock dual solex carbs. Once I get them
installed, what things could I possibly see when trying to tune them? Besides
synchronizing, I figured that since they are stock, they would be pretty easy
to get running. Am I mistaken here? I am not a mechanic, but I do most of my
bus work myself. Do most people end up needing help getting these tuned or is
it a DIY job?

What problems have people been running into in getting them tuned. Why are the
webbers much better?
