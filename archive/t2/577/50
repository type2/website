When I bought my bus and saw the dual Solex's I said to myself: Webers
or Holley.

But once I got my Solex's tuned right, I realized they're actually
pretty good. Reasonable mileage and power. Plus I got my hands on a
pair of rebuildable Solex's that I can swap in when my original ones
finally croak.

The only upgrade I'd consider is to fuel injection.
