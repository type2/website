Subject: Re: [T2] Endplay? Crankshaft moving

Yes I am sorry about this I did get the understanding of the free play with 
the flywheel/flexplate off. I also have my endplay set to .0045" this was as 
close as I could get with the shims I had. My email was screwed up at this 
time and a lot of emails are coming in as much as 3 weeks late. Sorry for 
the semi-repetative posting half went through the others did not until now.

Thanks,

Michael Knight
