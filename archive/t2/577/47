Subject: Bleh. Total loss of power this morning

Sigh. My bus has been running sweet lately, until this morning. Barely
made it to 60 on the 5 fwy.

Guess it's time to check my dizzy and points. I need to replace this
friggin 009 anyway.

Maybe a compression check too. I haven't checked it since the weekend
after I bought the bus.

Wish me luck!
