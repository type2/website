I have had similar situations with trying to get my nuts off. Depending on 
the accessability of the nut or bolt head you can use a openended side of a 
box wrench that is slightly larger the the nut and wedge a flathead 
screwdriver in there to make up for the play. The trick is to wedge it in 
there perpendicular to the wrench.
