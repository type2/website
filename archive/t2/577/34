Subject: Re: [T2] Whats the secret for removing push rod tubes??

To keep from damaging the pushrod tube I put a small hose clamp around it
and tighten it down.  One of those small clamps that has a worm gear built
into it that meshes with slots cut in the metal strap.  Once its tight you
can grab the worm gear by the ends with a vice grip.  This gives you enough
leverage to let you rotate the pushrod tube while pushing it towords the
head.  Use one hand to rotate the tube and the other to push against the
vicegrip.  This works for removal and installation.  If you get clamps that
are long enough to go around the tube but are small enough to fit through
the hole in the cylider head then you don't have to install and remove them
to get the tube lose and then through the head.  The clamps are cheap enough
that, when you find the right size, you can just leave them on all the time.
It saves having to find new ones everytime you want to fix a pushrod tube
seal.

Hope this helps
