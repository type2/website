Subject: Re: Ball Joint press service & alignment in San Francisco?

The Bus ball joints require a special jig for the press because they don't
have a good shoulder on them like other torsion arms. Peninsula Automotive
is a VW shop in Campbell that can do this for you. Or you might check with
other VW shops closer to you.
