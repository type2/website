Subject: RE: [T2] Endplay problem?

I don't know the exact specs, but I think you need to measure end play with shims, seal, and flywheel installed. 
 
But GEX doesn't bode well...

2.0L GEX stripped down to a little less than a longblock. Flex plate is off, seal is removed, three shims found, have not removed the hub on the rear (RIR) yet. My crankshaft seems to be traveling quite a bit. Maybe 2.0mm - 2.5mm. This can't be good or I am just losing it. What tolerance should I be looking for? Will the shims and flexplate make up the difference here? Comments, suggestions, all welcome and needed badly.
