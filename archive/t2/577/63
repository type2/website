Subject: Clip dohickey on the shift rod-resending

This bounced back to me for some reason. I'm trying again...

I about to reinstall my shift rod on my 79 Westy with new bushings but I
can't figure out what to do with that metal C clip that goes on the rod
somewhere. When I took the rod out, the clip was just kinda hanging on the
rod, not attached to anything in particular. The Bentley Manual is pretty
useless just showing the clamp hanging in between the bushings. Any advice
so I don't screw it up?

Thanks
