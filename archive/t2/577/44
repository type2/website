Subject: Lowering kit for busses - air bags

I was looking through the latest VW Trends this week and noticed an ad for a
lower kit for bugs that uses air bags. I was interested so I went to the site
to check it out. These guys have an awesome setup for  bugs. It will put the
frame on the ground. As I poked around more, I found a kit for split window
busses. I emailed the company and they said that they are working on a kit for
the front and back of the bay window busses.

For the people interested in slamming their bus, this looks like the way to
go. Air bag systems, when installed correctly, are great. The adjustability is
awesome. I never knew that their were kits for bugs and soon busses.
