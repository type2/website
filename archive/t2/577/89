Subject: RE: [T2] Cruisin CB channels for monitoring

Some of the bigger truck stops/gas stations that sell CB gear have these. I
had one with a whip antenna in a Subaru for the AM/FM/CB, and another one
with an FM antenna feeding both radios in my old '72 Westy. Radio shack used
to carry them, but I think they've gotten away from that stuff. JC Whipme
may be another source.
