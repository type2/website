Subject: Wipers Work

Hello everyone, I finally have wipers again. I want to
Thank Michael Knight and Dave C. Bolen for their
replies, so Thank you! 
    Now on to the solution, when Michael said to check
for voltage to all wires, I did. I found I was getting
9 volts out of ground wire. I couldn't figure that one
out, then my friend Steve told me to pull any other
ground's that are hooked up in the same area one at a
time and see if it makes any difference. I couldn't
see how that would matter, but I did. I first pulled
the ground wire off of my newly installed CD player(
which was installed about two months before any
problems)After pulling this wire I tested the ground
for volts, and there was none. So I hooked up the
wires to my spare wiper motor, and it was working like
normal. I then hooked everything back the way it
should be on my bus and them wipers was working again.
I've now relocated my CD players ground and all is
well again. I don't see how this one wire could cause
me so much problems, and I don't see how this wire
would cause voltage to go through my wiper ground? But
as long as they are working, I don't care.
Thanks,
Shawn R.
