Yes but, you can not put them back in that way. Actually if you remove them 
this way you will not be able to put them back into any engine, they will be 
FUBARed. I have had success with removing them with the heads loose and not 
removed completely. There are some vendors out there that carry the spring 
loaded pushrod tubes for the Type I engines. They can be installed and 
removed with out removing the heads.
