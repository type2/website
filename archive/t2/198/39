Subject: transmission oil leak

evening all; 

Whilst crawling around my bus searching for potential problems for our
upcoming 3 week trip ('71 Westy, all stock 1600 dp recently rebuilt), I
noticed a steady oil dripping from what appears to be the starter mounting
bolt .. 

I am assuming this is transmission oil...I checked the torque on the bolt
and it appears to be ok. From the looks of it it's been leaking slowly for
a while - crusted crap streaked down the side of the trans housing. 

Big Problem? Forget about it? Hassle to fix? 

thanks for the input...

cheers
