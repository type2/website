I'm sorry that I haven't followed this thread
real closely.  Are you having stuck lifters when
the vehicle has sat for a day or two?  I had
lotsa lifter problems with my vanagon until I
figured out I was running too thin oil.  20/50
helped, but straight 30 did the trick.  No lifter
problems even if the van sat for days.

Peace and blessings,
