Subject: 76 won't start

My '76 will not start.

Starter is strong.

Fuel pressure is fine (replaced presssure regulator).

Injectors are fine (had to replace 2 of them).

After replacing the coil I indeed have good spark.

Timing is at spec but I had to check it while the engine was being cranked 
by the starter.

Any Ideas?

Thanks,
