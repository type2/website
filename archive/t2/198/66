Subject: Re: [T2] transmission oil leak

A starter bolt shouldnt be having any kind of fluid on it.  they go 
through solid parts of the casings.  The leak is probably above it 
somewhere and air currents from the fan and moving vehicle are moving 
the fluid to that point.  On that series of transmissions check all of 
the plugs in the sides of the casing and the bolts all around it.  It is 
possible to also get a rear seal leak from the engine or from the tranny 
to leak down through the weap hole in the bell housing and for air 
currents to make it look like the leak is back on the trannie.  If it is 
the starter bolt you have a crack that you would see very clearly 
running from the bell back to the main housing.
