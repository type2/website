Subject: CD Player Recommendations

I'm about to embark on a long trip and want to enjoy my CD collection
along the way. I have the original dash radio with tape player in my 79
camper. Would appreciate any recommendations/advice re model and install
tips for a single radio/cd player to replace the existing unit. Current
speakers are good.
Thanks,
