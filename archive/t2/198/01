Subject: bike rack bumper c channel 74 bay

I have a 1974 vw bus that I am trying to get ready for a long haul

I want to take my bikes (for my wife and me), but I want to be able to check 
my oil (I do have a hitch -- but just a ball not the receiver 2"or3" thing) 
and I don't want to use the kind that uses the back door as I want access to 
the bus and it seems a bit to much weight for two bikes on that door

i found a bike rack that mounts to c channel bumpers on the front -- but 
they have discontinued the one that provides room for the spare on the front 
of my bus -- any ideas??

do you know if I can find enough stuff at home depot/lowes to do this 
myself?? -- can I find mounting hardware for a c channel bumper?

I have thought about going up top, but do not have a ladder to get that high 
(i have a westy)??
