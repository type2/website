Bob makes a good point! Also check the breather hose coming from the 
engine and make sure it is hooked up to something like the air 
cleaner or the carb. If some is coming from the vents the it is 
coming off the top of the motor somewhere so have a good look around 
for leaks such as around the oil pressure sender.
