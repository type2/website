Subject: 1600 in a new beetle? (friday fun)

happy friday & post-4th of July to everyone.

has anyone seen that show 'Monster Garage'? some crazy
mechanics get together & build dual-purpose machines out
of vehicles. the challenge is the vehicles must appear
stock from the outside.

on the last episode i saw, their mission was to turn a new beetle
into an air boat. so, what did they use to turn the fan for their air
power?...you guessed it - a 1600 ACVW motor!

i thought it was rather ironic that they placed an ACVW motor in the rear
the new beetle. the show is shot in cali, so of course the motor was
one of those "see-through dist. cap & shiny valve cover" motors.

wonder if it was a GEX?
