There's an expensive tape player in my bus and good speakers. I'm too =
cheap to replace the tape player with a really good CD player, and =
besides, I want to play MP3s, so I bought a portable Discman-type CD =
player that will play MP3 discs. It's a Philips Expanium 200 series. I =
also bought an adapter that looks like a cassette tape, but has a wire =
coming from it to the CD player. Now I can burn 170 to 200 songs to each =
blank CD and listen to a huge variety of music.

The only problem with this setup is that the all-terrain tires on the =
bus are so loud that I can't hear the stereo very well at highway speed, =
but I'm about to replace them.

I'm about to embark on a long trip and want to enjoy my CD collection
along the way. I have the original dash radio with tape player in my 79
camper. Would appreciate any recommendations/advice re model and install
tips for a single radio/cd player to replace the existing unit. Current
speakers are good.
Thanks,
