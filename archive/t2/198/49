Thanks to all who replied to my cry of distress.

Today I began to apply the DM (Dolan Methode) to my
"non-bleedable brakes."  The rear shoes were two click
less than wheel locked, as I normally adjust, but the fronts
were completely retracted!  I guess that's where I left off
six years ago..................No wonder the pedal was soft
after bleeding!  It would appear that I now have a perfectly
good spare master cylinder to carry for emergencies.
Even without a repeat of the bleeding procedure, I've got a
nice high pedal, that doesn't seem to fade.

Isn't it amazing how the brain fades with years of drug
abuse and abnormal sexual practices?  I guess I should
have paid more attention to those seventh grade health
class lectures..........8o)

Now, with functioning brakes --> today my bus moved,
under it's own power, for the first time, since I bought it ten
years ago!  HOO-fuckin'-ray!!  When I figure out where
I stashed the seat belts, ten years ago, I can venture out
onto the road.  8o|

Many thanks to you all.
