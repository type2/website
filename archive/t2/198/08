Subject: Re: [T2] bike rack bumper c channel 74 bay

I have a front tire mount on my westy which I used to make a bike rack-
the tire went on top.  I used this until I used a rear rack that I hang
from eyehooks above the rear hatch
(http://www.geocities.com/mike_benthin - too many hits will shut this
down for a month).  The rear rack lets you check the oil but compromizes
the hatch use.  On our '95 trip we tied the bikes on top (use a rack or
eyebolts as I used on the poptop)- they must be in the back of a late
westy so the top can still be put up. For the front rack, I took a piece
of bullnose pine (stair tread) that's 1" thick and rested it on the
bumper tube and drilled 3 holes for the tire studs.  This holds it to
the bus.  The height is up to the front air grill.  Across this board I
bolted (4 countersunk bolts) a piece of 2x4 so it is flat on top.  I
can't recall the length, but it is based on the distance of the gap
formed by your bike top tube triangle.  To each end of the 2x4 you bolt
a 2x3 so it can jut outwards or be rotated sideways
 when not in use.   Two bikes can be carried this way.   If they are
heavy bikes, you can relieve weight by running a rope from the poptop
right down to the top tubes.
   I made a rack that fits over the spare tire, and have seen such at a
show- can p-mail a pic to you.  The rack fits behind the tire and you
deed the rope unless you add the eyebolts seen on each side of the air
vent grill.
