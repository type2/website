Subject: Re: [T2] 1600 in a new beetle? (friday fun)

	Hey, all!  Since it's Friday Fun-day and all...

	I watched that show too, and thought it great fun, especially when
the Monster Garage staff just SHREDDED the NB to get all the AC stuff into
the back of it.  Did anyone else happen to catch how much they were charged
for the alleged "1600"?  I could have sworn the narrator said it took an
approximately $2800 bite out of the $3000 budget!!!  I also couldn't quite
decide if it was sporting a Weber carb on one bank and a Dellorto carb on
the other, when it first came out of the box.  Later on they seemed to have
gotten a matched set of carbs (either Webers or Dells), but I was thinking
at first "Boy, did that off-road shop that supplied the motor have a laff!"
AND they charged them $2800 for the privilege for throwing together some
extra junk they had laying around the shop...  They also mentioned the name
of the shop and/or showed the name on the shipping container, but it was
said really quickly the one time and/or in a real quick camera take.

	Buncha show-biz idjits...
