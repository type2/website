Subject: hollywood bike racks?

Hello,

Someone posted a while back about this $50 bike rack that Hollywood made, 
but I cannot seem to locate any dealers for them. The website doesn't seem 
to list that model anymore either.

Does anyone know of an etailer that has these available still by chance?
