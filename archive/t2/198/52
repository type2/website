Hey I have a 71 Westy with a pioneer CD player in the dash and it never ski=
ps or anything, MOSFET 45Wx4 or something like that is what it says n the f=
ront.  It's very good, it plays CD-Rs but I don't know about CD-RWs.  I wan=
t to change this though, into a really really bitchin' setup.  I want to ma=
ke a 6 or 8 CD changer in the glove box, and put a sub-woofer in the space =
under the back seat/bed (that little cabinet space).  I'm a teenager, and y=
ou know how we are about these things.  I was wondering if anybody knows wh=
at would be a really good speaker configuration?  I listen to all types of =
music (from electronic rave stuff, to punk like the Sex Pistols, to Niel Yo=
ung and the Doors...I go full circle) but I don't know if that makes a diff=
erences.  I just want it to sound good as hell from any seat in the camper,=
 and also to be able to control it, at least some parts of it, by remote, s=
o I can do it from the bed while camping (somebody talked about having that=
 earlier).  Plus how do I make it run without the key on?  I would like to =
know how to set this up since my Dad (now not with us) said something about=
 it being bad for the car to leave it in the on position...I have a 71 with=
 only three positions: Off, On (for going) and Start (for starting the engi=
ne) I don't know key position's technical terms though.  How can I make it =
run without the key in, and how do I make a killer sound system?
