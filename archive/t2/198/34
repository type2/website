Try to find a '73-'79 donor bus in the junkyard or maybe an old =
Squareback or Fastback Type 3, and borrow the top hatch and a hand's =
width of surrounding metal from it. You could use a cutting torch or a =
Sawzall. Then cut a hole in the deck above the engine in your bus and =
weld the donor hatch in place.

'79 bus
