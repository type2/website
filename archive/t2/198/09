Subject: Westy Antenna installation

I know there have been some recently posted questions on how to properly 
mount various types of antennas (Ham, CB, TV, Cell Phone, etc.) to a bus, 
be it Westy, or other.

Here is a shot of my recent antenna installation.

I think this picture might serve to show you that anything is possible, if 
you use enough Velcro and fender washers.
Works really swell.
