"Plus how do I make it run without the key on? "

The wire that is supposed to go to the ignition on, can go to a hot all the
time wire and viola! your tunes are on all the time.  just don't forget to
turn them off.  A friend of mine suggested running the ignition wire (I am
pretty sure he said ignition wire) to the key buzzer terminal, so that when
you yank your keys - no tunes.  keys in - tunes.
