Subject: Any suggestions

I went on a AIRS call today.  Received a call from a young couple 
from Pennsylvania with timing(?) problems.

When I got to them I found the dwell was off and the timing but when 
I readjusted these, it still would not  run correctly.    It's a 72 
bus with a 2 litre engine and  a weber progressive carb.  We switched 
out both dizzy, and coil but still couldn't get it to run.  The carb 
appears to have fuel but its hard to tell because I couldn't get my 
fat head into the engine compartment.


Has new AVP engine and a Air Cooled net Dizzy.  The mechanic that set 
up the engine has altered the dizzy setting so it will fit in the 
area  (out 90 degrees).   Gas is getting to the carb but whether the 
carb is set correctly I don't know.   I haven't worked on a 
carburator in 20 years.   Every thing seems to be correct but it 
still won't kick over.

Any carb fanatics out there with ideas?



Thanks for any help,
