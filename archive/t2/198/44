Subject: Endplay update (when is it rebuild time?)

First of all, thanks listmembers who responded to the question of correcting 
excessive endplay. On the advice I received and the archives, I urged my 
friend to rebuild the engine – or more specifically, to trade hers in for a 
spec longblock from Dayton Painter of Painter’s Grinding in Denver, whose 
techs built my engine last year. I’ve been happy with Dayton’s work and his 
is really the only shop in Colorado I trust with a Type 1 rebuild.

With help from Jason Z., the mysterious pipe-smoking ’79 busdriving 
architectural guitarist, I spent today stripping the old -- I do mean old -- 
engine to its core and scrubbing lots of grime from the tin. (I learned 
don’t use paint thinner to clean tin, doesn’t work.) There is much to do 
before the new engine is running and I am the de facto mechanic, so it 
should be an exciting week. I am glad she decided to spend the money for 
this engine because she clearly loves the car. She bought it in 1985.

I’m wondering about the carb. It’s old but as far as I can tell, it still 
carburetes. Grimy as all hell though. Do I want to touch this thing? Anyone 
successful cleaned and overhauled (at least re-gasketed) a carb in an 
afternoon? Is it worth it? New carb is $150 or so, they can probably afford 
it. Or should I just bolt the old, functioning one on the new engine). We 
are 8,000 feet above sea level and I worry that a new carb will be ultra 
rich (maybe not?)

Will this spur deep discussion about fix-it-now vs. 
fix-it-when-it-doesn’t-work?
