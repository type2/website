Subject: Type 4 Kadron Update

   Well it works and seems to work well. I have just completed the test run
of a 2 litre Type 4 engine with duel Kadrons and I must say that I am very
pleased with the preliminary results. More will be told when the engine goes
on the Dyno!

    While waiting forever for EMPI to come out with there Type 4 Kadron kit,
I decided to build my own, below is a list of parts used.
 1. European Motors Type 4 Kadron intake manifolds
 2. Scat bicycle linkage
 3. Used set of Kadrons

   The European Motors intake manifolds fit like a glove, the SCAT linkage
needed some mods, nothing major, just brain farting to make clearance and
work. I still have a problem I will address now that I know it works and
that is the idle adjuster on the passenger side of the engine now hits the
linkage bar and won't let me sync the carbs. This will be remedied by making
a shorter idle adjuster screw.

   It will be interesting to put this engine on the dyno (even though it is
a little used) just to see what it puts out to see if it is worth the
trouble. I like Kadrons due to there ease of adjustment and availability of
jets. Sure you can use Baby webers or other carbs but with the availability
of used Kadrons this can make a inexpensive conversion.

ps. Now that John at aircooled.net is offering a vacuum port install on
Kadrons it seems we will now have the best of both worlds.

pps. I will take photos and get them posted to some web site soon
(www.volksrescue.com   more then likely)

ppps. If anybody is interested I can write up a full set of instructions and
/or set-up a complete kit less carbs for you to install, with all the hard
work done.
