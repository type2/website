Tom,

There isn't a reason you cant do it, as a matter of fact a good number
of people have placed them in the engine compartment. The one thing I
would avoid doing is placing the filter on the lines that go to the
carbs, place it before the pump. This helps remove the strain on the
carb fittings, causing less chance of them pulling out. Granted, I
personally think a filter would not add enough weight to do so, but I
would rather be safe than roasted, and im sure the bus feels the same
way.

I need to put new fuel lines from the fuel pump to the carbs.  Is there
any reason that I can not relocate the filter and pressure regulator to
the inside of the engine compartment?  I think it would make changing
the filter alot easier.
