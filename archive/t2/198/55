I've always had problems keeping my solenoid tight. What I have found
that works great is Form-a-gasket #2 (NOT silicone, which should never
be used around gasoline). Make sure the threads in the base of the carb
and also the threads on the solenoid are clean (free of fuel/grease).
Put some Form-a-gasket on just the _threads_ of the solenoid and tighten
it as above. Do this before you go to bed to give it overnight.  When I
do this it keeps it from coming loose for years.

The only down side is if you need to remove it, be careful so crumbs of
the Form-a-gasket don't get in the fuel passageways.
