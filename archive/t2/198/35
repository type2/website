It isnt the weight so much as the combination of a weight and heavy 
vibration and push in fittings.  I have seen pull outs on generators 
that had been maintained and someone neglected to clamp the filters back 
down. fortunately no fires, just some individuals having severe heart 
attacks and spraying everything down.
