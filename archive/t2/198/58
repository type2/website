Listees, 

About a month ago I posted that I have a 70 tranny from a bus that I need to 
get rid of. Will on the list, needed it but was unable to get it, so it's up 
for grabs again. I'll gladly sell it or trade it for something useful or 
whatever. Mostly it needs to leave my garage. I'd rather post it here first 
and someone needy on the list get it than post it to Ebay (last resort). 
The tranny sits in my garage in Waldorf Maryland about 25 miles south of 
Washington, DC. I wont ship it, so who ever gets it will need to pick it up. 
I bought it along with a motor and a bunch of spare parts I needed from a guy 
who said he tore them out of his bus to do a complete resto and quit. He said 
it ran perfect, but I have no idea first hand.
