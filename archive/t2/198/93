Subject: George is broken down in Paradise (Utah), cylinder stud

I was checking my valves, right side all OK, left side oh-oh [blue word]
lower forward stud on #3 sticking out.  broken off at case end.

The good:
Stud is broken at last thread, not pulled out of case
We are with (non-VW) friends who have shop space, sleeping space, etc.
If we have to, we can drive the bus, but I really don't want to.

The bad:
I don't know how much of the stud remains in the case.  If there isn't
much poking out it could be a bear to remove.
I'm in Utah on a Sunday.  Not many parts houses open.

What we need:
A source for a cylinder stud for a 1600DP Mexican engine.  I think that
this engine has the small studs.
Advice on how to get the remaining stud out of the case.

George Lyle
