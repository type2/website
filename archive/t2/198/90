Subject: Re: [T2] XM Radio

I think the XM radio service relies on ground based signal repeaters. 
Like cell  phones especially digital, if you are in the sticks but on 
the interstate you may get service but out in Hayseed county there 
may not be a repeater and you will be left to listening to crackpots 
on AM radio.

To learn more about satellite radio you can follow the link below to 
a recently broadcast radio program on WBUR.  The show is archived in 
RA so just click on the listen button on the bottom of the page.
