Subject: Re: [T2] carb question

Andrew, 

Thanks, I may just do that. Meanwhile I am in need of a timing light...a 
purchase that will be made today. I asked the mechanic I took it to check the 
timing but like you said I know he's not trustworthy. I am sure however that 
he adjusted my valves. First off I was totally oil leak free before he did it 
and now I have a small leak. (Great)

I did as I was told and tightened up my cut off valve and choke and 
reconnected the cutoff valve to my distributor. It idles now although not too 
great for the first few minutes. I used Sean Bartniks methods listed in the 
type II library to adjust the carb. When I get out and poke my head into the 
bay I thought I heard a vacuum leak. I replaced all the lines and sprayed 
carb cleaner at the gasket between the carb and manifold. That didn't seem to 
be it. I tried using a fuel or vacuum line to my ear as a stethoscope method 
but I am way to deaf for that. It actually seemed to be coming from the air 
cleaner. The PO removed the oil bath cleaner and put a chrome sit over the 
carb type with a foam filter. It hisses when I apply the throttle. Think this 
is normal? I notice also that the connections both on the fan shroud and the 
oil filler neck that I assume were for the oil bath are both sitting open. I 
felt them and clearly feel air flow. Hhhmmnn. 
I guess the rough idle could still be the carb (?). My new one has been lost 
by Fed Ex. Just my luck !!! Although like you said if my old one is OK then I 
would rather trade the one back in I just bought and get something else I 
could use. 

What's your thought?

Again, thanks for all your help. Everyone is so great on this list. : )
