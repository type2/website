..................You are asking a good question of the wrong audience. Ask 
the SELLER. A bus is a piece of titled property. YOU don't own it unless 
you have a title. So if you BUY it, the SELLER must HAVE or bew able to 
expedite a title that can be transferred to you, somehow. So, the 
government unit or private contractor that impounded the bus  AND TOOK 
OWNERSHIP IN ORDER TOO SELL IT must provide you with a way to get a title. 
They confiscated the previous owner's right to a title when they 
confiscated the bus, which was done under some specific law defining such 
actions. In New York State, there has to be a law that allows 
municipalities and contractors/mechanics to confiscate a vehicle for 
non-payment of bills and/or impound fees (abandonment?). This law may make 
clear (define) any procedures that will result in a new title for those 
buying such vehicles from the municipality.
...........SO, consult the seller for details of acquiring such a title. 
There are probably forms to fill out and fees to be paid. The seller will 
have done this before, for every buyer of every vehicle sold from their 
impound lot. If the impounder is a private company working under contract 
for the municipality, that contractor will have had extensive experience in 
helping buyers get titles. I would talk to the seller for details.
