When I fixed my tank in March I went to NAPA for hose.  I bought:

1055 NBH GAS HOSE $16.49

It's sold by the foot so you can make one major mistake.  This part # is the
right fit.  It's also the right kind of hose for gasoline.

While you are in there replace the filler neck also:

I also bought some better hose clamps to make see it was a tight fit:

705-1019 BK HOS CLMP $1.19 (each x 3)

Because the original hose had a bend in it you'll need to approximate the
bend by cutting one end of your hose at an angle.  Keep making bigger angles
until you've got a good right around the back.

If you can find a molded piece that is gasoline compatible and the right
size go with that obviously.
