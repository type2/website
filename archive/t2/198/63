Subject: Front brake job from hell.

I continue to discover things about my current brake setup.

I had a totally stock '72, but after I paid a mechanic to replace the ball
joints, I am now discovering that I have a mix of '71-'72 and '73+ brakes.

I know for sure that the mechanic swapped:

    rotors
    calipers
    hubs

What I have learned.

    rotors differ between older and newer designs.
    calipers differ between older and newer designs.
    hubs are the same for all.

What think, but am I am not sure about:

    caliper piston diameter is the same for both older and newer designs.
    the only difference between the two systems is the later has provisions
and changes made for greater piston travel necessary for using thicker pads.

What I have experimentally discovered:

    new '71-'72 calipers will not fit existing rotors.
    new '71-'72 calipers will not fit new '71-'72 rotors.
    new '71-'72 rotors will not fit with existing calipers.
    new '73+ rotors fit existing calipers only if the backing plate is
removed.
    '71-'72 caliper rebuild kit fits existing calipers.

Conclusions:

    I have '73+ calipers.
    I have '73+ rotors, worn very thin.
    I have '71-'72 backing plate.

Questions:

    1.  I rebuilt the calipers with the kit supplied for the '71-'72
calipers, if I am correct in assuming that I have '73+ calipers, will this
be a problem at some point?  It seems to me that if the only difference is
the travel f the caliper pistons, therefore, my dust covers may pop off or
tear off at some point as the pads wear.  There are different part #'s and
prices for the caliper rebuild kits for the different designs, so it follows
that there must be some changes of some kind.

    2.  It appears the there is one backing plate part number.  I cannot
make things fit together with the backing plate on.  Does this mean that I
have '71-'72 spindles?  If so, why did the '71-'72 calipers and rotors not
work?

    3.  I got "Brembo" '73+ rotors that seem to be of much lower quality
than other "German" '71-'72 rotors that I bought.  Could it be that there is
a machining error that makes these rotors rub the backing plates?

    4.  How bad of an idea is it to just not use the backing plate?

Thanks,

Bob
