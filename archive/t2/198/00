Another listmember suggested in a p-mail that the flywheel can be machined, 
taking a few thou off the surface where the dowel pins mate to reduce the 
endplay. Anyone have experience with this? Worth trying? He also seemed to 
think I should just throw an extra shim or two between the crank and #1, 
since the engine sees so little mileage (<1,000 a year) and that by doing 
this, I could stop the front seal leak and maybe wring a few more years out 
of the engine (at the expense of the case, I'm sure).

Any opinions?

Thanks,
