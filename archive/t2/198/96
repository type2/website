	Speaking of deals, I just put a radio in my bus for the first time in
about 3 years.  Went to BestBuy and got a Sony.  The deal was not in the
Sony deck, but rather the 4 free speakers that came with it.  The deal
with in NC so I am not sure about other areas.  Retail the speakers sold
for $25 a pair.  Still, I got all four of them in the and for what they
are worth, I am happy as can be until I can afford to do more.  Great
for a budget install.  Good luck.
