Subject: Oil Temp Sender

I recently installed the Berg mechanical style oil temp switch/sender that 
mounts into the dip stick tube.
Bus us stock engine 1600 SP in 1970 Westy.

Drove I-10 yesterday afternoon in the peak heat of the day to Winnie, TX, 
and then down to the High Island area for an afternoon of BBQ, Beer, and 
night time Fireworks at my friend's beach house.

Just East of I-610E, the temp switch thingy started to flicker my light, 
and then it went to full light lock-up a bit further down the road.
I was doing my usual G force speed of 55 mph, and figured that I knew my 
engine pretty well, so I didn't worry.

As I drove East on I-10, the temp light stayed on pretty much all of the 
time. It would go back to flicker and turn itself off every once in a 
while. After getting off of the interstate and driving South on final leg 
to the beach, the temp light went out, only to go back on as I started to 
get back to my steady ride of 55 mph speed again.

I figured, with the outside temp being 95, I could assume the engine was 
running warm, but I refused to believe it was running hot. All power and 
performance felt very good, with no sign of performance drop.

Coming back home last night around a midnight start time, it was cool and 
very humid. The light never came on until I got back on the interstate and 
was doing my full "balls to the wall" 55 mph :-).

Again, I did not worry.

When I got close to being back home, off of the interstate, and driving 
down the final leg of the trip to my home, the light was now going back to 
flicker state and finally to shut off, indicating an oil temp drop.

OH, enuff, back to the point........... tah dah !  ........... The question 
?????

I think the Berg temp switch is a nice concept in simplicity of design, and 
functionality, but I question it's being set to 227 degrees.

After both road trip legs, I opened up the hatch to check the engine temp 
on NewBus, and was very satisfied with what I sensed, smelled, felt. Sure, 
the engine area felt hot, but gave no indication of there being a really 
damaging temperature back there.

I think NewBus is running very well, and I do not believe I have a temp 
problem with him.

What have others observed with the Berg dip switch mechanical temp sender 
as to accuracy of temp sense, and any other comment you care to make??
