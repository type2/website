Hi

I dont mean to panic you but there is another possibility that bob doesnt 
mention. It sounds to me like your rocker box gaskets could be leaking. They 
sit directly above the heat exchangers. If they are leaking oil this goes 
straight onto your heat exchangers (exhaust) and this problem will produce 
the white smoke your seeing out of the rear vents.

I would suggest looking at this BEFORE you drive the bus again :). Hopefully 
bob is correct and the problem will fix itself. The good news if that if the 
rocker cover gaskets are leaking its a very cheap and very easy problem to 
solve.

Hope that helps
Michael
