I got a call on Friday from a couple who are driving
through from Califonia.. just on a road trip.
  It seems they hit a deer on the Olympic penninsula
which pushed in the nose a bit (front mounted spare
tire). This didnt affect the driveability at the scene
but a while later the Alt. light came on. The bus is
up North around Lake City Way. I gave them some basic
trouble shooting info and told them they were very
close to Bow Wow (I was right in the middle of
painting
a room) and advised they contact them also.
  The hard part is not seeing the bus (yet) to see if 
wiring harnes got pinched. I'm thinking the two events
may be a coincidence but not sure. I suspect the 
voltage regulator is good as the round "B" brake light
isnt on... on my 74 I had the regulator go out and it
caused both the Alt. and Brake idiot lights to come on
and stay on. ---Would this happen in all failures
of the voltage regulator?----
 The primary suspect would be the Alt. gave it up...
They have only had this bus for a couple of months so
she couldnt give me a history of what has/has not been
done on the bus.
  The secondary suspect is that somehow the impact has
pinched a hot wire or knocked off a connection up
front.. ----Any thoughts?-----
  She said she will call me back as soon as they do
the
fuse pull excercise checking for a short.
  At any rate I recommended Bow Wow on Lake city way..
and Dr. Tim in Friday Harbor as they are going to do 
San Juan Island tour also.
  If they call back without having been helped I will
take my trusty volt/ohm meter up and do some checking.
its been a while since I checked a alt. so the last
question would be.. Can i take a reading with the bus 
off and then with it running __at the battery posts__
and get a real indication of the health of the Alt.?
I'm am thinking the battery is low or they killed it
trying to run it with alt light on so I will see about
13 volts if it kicks in and something less while not
running.
  Any ideas are welcome as I figure I'll be running
up there this afternoon sometime.

Thanks, Dan
