Subject: 'New' engines

Painter's shop is an awesome VW surgery center, yeah. A big warehouse filled 
with tooling rooms, building rooms, big racks of engines and engines-to-be, 
a few bays and a lobby sponsored by Bugpack. When the '69 I bought with an 
owner rebuild (my first VW) threw a rod in the first 1,000 miles, I cursed 
my life and then I waited six months and then I called Painter's to ask 
about a new Mexican longblock - I had heard he could get them and I no 
longer trusted any old rebuild. He sold me on his shop's "new engine" build, 
which was new Brazilian everything except rods and crank ("I won't use 
Brazilian cranks" he said) plus a few things I wanted like an oil filter and 
1641 P/Cs. It was an expensive engine: $1500 for the longblock and I still 
had to freight it over the mountains. That was 18 months ago; I'm at 23,000 
engine miles - it's in another bus now - and still running strong. The 
aftermarket oil pump cover they slapped on leaked from first start-up, a 
poor finishing touch, but I drove it to Denver and the tech fixed it for 
free - they had put the wrong bolts in.
