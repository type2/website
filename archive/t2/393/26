Tom,

Shimming(or indexing) is an accepted procedure in the "hot rod"
world.  

You can buy indexing washers at your local "speed equipment world"
in a package with several different thicknesses.

You *do* need to remember that they are there when you change plugs.

They are generally used so that when you screw the plugs in, you don't 
have any threads showing inside the combustion chamber.

As to this happening "suddenly", i would be a little suspicious.

I would check the carb and make sure that you didn't swallow and then
spit out the accelerator pump nozzle thru that chamber.

Don't ask me how I know this!(more than once)

Cheers, dave
