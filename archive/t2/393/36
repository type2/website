Hi Bill,

This is a great Friday post, I'll be watching the responses on this 
one, since I recently bought my wife a bus of her own.

Here's my list for you:

#1. FUEL LINES. Inspect and replace if required ASAP.
#2. Structural integrity - Esp. frame and the front beam, but also 
inspect floors and sliding door parts.
#3. Brakes.
#4. Steering.
#5. Tires. Look for proper load rating and 2-ply sidewalls.
#6. Suspension.
#7. Exhaust leaks - Probable cause of backfires on decel.
#8. Vacuum Leaks- Possible cause of other carburation issues, and 
oft-neglected by P.O's.
#9. Compression test. Get the values recorded now and you'll have a 
benchmark to refer to in the future if performance changes. Make sure 
to adjust the valves beforehand.
#10. Steering coupler. It's a rubber coupling at the bottom of the 
steering column, under the cover plate. It could possibly be 29 years 
old, and may need attention.

The very next purchase he makes from eB(-at-)y should be a Bentley manual. 
Or get one NEW, directly from one of the resellers on the list.

Happy trails,
