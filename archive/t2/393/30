well it would be <brakes> hard to say exactly what an important
<brake> item would be. I mean all <brakes> things are important for a
bus run <brakes> proper & stop correctly. Oh yea, I'd look at the
brakes first. :)

I would also recommend for him to purchase a bentley for his bus if he
doesn't already have one. This book will answer most of the questions
he has about keeping it on the road.
