Subject: long distance bus purchase

I'm planning on buying a bus, off of a contact made thru the internet.  I'm
going to have someone local drive and pick up the bus and bring it back to
me.  Does anyone have any ideas on a safe way for me to pay the seller?  I
mean, I trust the guy, but I would just feel funny sending the guy a money
order for that kind of money, you know.......  It is a private seller,
so....... Any ideas?
Thanks in advance!!
Mark
