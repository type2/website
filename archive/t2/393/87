Subject: Re: [T2] Distributor drive gear shims

Hello All   In all of my time I have never seen more than 2 shims under the 
dizzy drive. There have been cases of only 1 thicker shim but never 3 shims. I 
think you might measure a reg. case and compare with the aftermarket case and 
see what differences you find. I personal use one or the other but never both 
together. Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  PS For you east coasters
