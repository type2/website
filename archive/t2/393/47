Subject: Re: [T2] My Kid's New 74 Bus

This is very exciting since I can relate somewhat to your son's 
situation.  When I bought my bus I was fifteen.  The very first thing I 
did was wax it.  I'm not kidding.  Then I took the engine out but it 
wasn't difficult since it was in several peices in the cargo area 
(inside cardboard boxes and milk crates).  Eventually I found a working 
engine at a reasonable price and I was on my way.

So far you've had a fairly reasonable list of suggestions and lists to 
keep you busy for a while.  It all depends on his bus' needs.

As I reflect on those early days of getting my bus moving I couldn't 
agree more that the right books are especially important.  The idiot 
book and the Bentley manual.  Anything to learn about the car is 
extremely important.  The archives on this list, the library on 
type2.com, the pages that list members have made and other bus owners on 
the internet are extremely.  For example in about six months he'll 
probably have questions on how to make his bus produce heat in the 
winter (I know I did).  It's all on the net.

Also to make sure my bus was in good working order I gave it plenty of 
attention.  After taking roll in gym class I would go take a nap on the 
bench seats.  A camper would have been better for this since the table 
would have been nice for lunches too.
