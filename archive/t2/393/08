Subject: Re: Bus Book / contents, years covered ect.

the book covers all years of the bus.
there is a general opening chapter that details how VW came to build the bus

a section devoted to history of Splits
a section devoted to history of Bays
a section devoted to the Wedge (mentions EVC)

a great section on the "Bus Community"

Book is very thorough.   I have about all of these bus books and this one is 
a great read........and I am not just saying that because  I am in it.
