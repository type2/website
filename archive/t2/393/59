And you're right, too.  I got the two mixed up.  I think (if I remember
correctly) that fibrosis is one of the things that happens to your lungs as
a result of the silicosis.  could be wrong on that, too...

Considering that it's the silicas in the resin that does the damage, you'd
think that I could remember it.  Thanks.
