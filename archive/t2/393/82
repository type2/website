Subject: running rich, but stalling. smells. vacuum leak?

Good afternoon everyone.
I hope you are all enjoying your Saturday afternoon.

So, my 79 westy is running like crap.
It wants to stall whenever I just start it.
It is better when the engine warms up, but not always, and it takes a while.
As long as I give it a little gas at a steady pace it won't die,
But this sucks when trying to pull out of a parking spot or sitting at a red 
light with my foot pressing the brake and gas at the same time.
First I turned up the idle, because it was idling really low.
That helped a little, but it was doing it again the next day.
And now I am running real rich i think. It definitly smells that way, and I 
am burning through gas even more than usual.
It is kinda acting like a vacuum leak, but all the hoses are fairly new, and 
are all connected.
Not really sure what to do.

thanks for any advice,
Kyle
