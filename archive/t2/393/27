With sandblasting, it's usually silicosis which is just as bad.

My father did all the wrong things, worked with asbestos, smoked, etc and
is now 91 years old.  However, he is now on oxygen 24/7 and walking five
steps causes him to have to rest and increase his oxygen flow for ten
minutes.  It's painful to watch.  A lot of people don't realize that you
have to _live_ with your mistakes, not just die from them!
