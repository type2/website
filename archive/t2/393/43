first of all, tell your son congrats on his new ride.

as others have pointed out, the safety features are by
far the most important things.

1) fuel lines
2) brakes
3) i know you mentioned it has new tires, but please make
sure they are the *correct* tires for a bus! (consult the
type2 library for info on tires)

good luck & most importantly - have fun!
