Subject: 73 AW on Rte 60 E/B

Coming out to my mom's today (L.A. to Banning), I saw a white on blue Adventurewagen parked on the side of Interstate 60 westbound. I stopped to investigate and found a note under the wiper that stated they were having transmission trouble and would be back to get the bus. There was a highway patrol sticker on the back from 5/29. I left a note referring them to the closest VW shop I knew of (Walter's in Banning) with my phone number.

Do we know anyone from L.A. with a white on blue 1973 Adventurewagen? It's got the earlier 3/4 high roof with the luggage rack on the back.

BTW, the cargo hatch had the "AUTOMATIC" emblem on it, so I'm going to the library to research auto trannies in case they call.
