Subject: electric die grinder

Thanks to all who responded to my electric die grinder post. I have found a 
few possibilities for a decent die grinder to grind down the miles of weld 
beads and spot welds on my '73 bus.  They are not as cheap as I would have 
thought compared to the air powered alternative.  Here is what I found.

Chicago Electric 4.5 amps - $50 at Harbor Frieght
Dewalt                  3.0 amps - $150
Milwaukee            4.5 amps -$230

The Harbor Frieght grinder  seems awfully tempting, and sounds so American.  
I called them for more info and they would only tell me, it was made 
"overseas", but would not tell me exactly where, so in spite of it's name, 
it is about as American as chairman Mao's little red book.  I am not above 
buying cheap tools made overseas, but I usually reserve these purchases for 
throwaways, like my Campbell Hausfeld air chisel , made in Taiwan a whopping 
$15 (which is still going, by the way).  Call me cheap, but $50 is starting 
to be a lot of $$ for a potential throw-away.   The USA alternatives are all 
available locally.

So my questions:  Is the quality of Dewalt, Miwaukee etc. significantly 
better?  Is a 3 amp grinder sufficient for grinding hard-to -reach spotwelds 
or do I need the 4.5 model?  Is the more powerful model worth the price 
difference?  I am looking for a long term alternative to an air powered die 
grinder.  I don't have the space for a compressor large enough to power air 
tools efficiently.  I am looking for good value and durability.  I know it's 
nit-picky for a one item purchase, but I try to select tools carefully and 
keep them for a long time.  Feel free to e-mail me off line if you feel I am 
straying too far from bus content.  Any help is always appreciated.  - 
James.
