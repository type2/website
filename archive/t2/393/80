Subject: RE: [T2] ECU faulty?

Sounds like you verified 12V power to the fuel injectors. Did you check them
all? Did you use an ohmmeter to see if the ground connections to to
injectors are actually being grounded when the engine cranks?

I recall you checked the ECU ground to the case...how about the case/tranny
ground to the chassis?

Also check continuity from the big ECU plug on the FI harness to the
injector connectors (all of them), and to the three case grounds. Bentley
should tell you which pins go where.

Still sounds like a ground problem somewhere. I'd check everything else
again carefully before buying an ECU ($$$)

Anyone had the ECU go out or be faulty on their bus?
What are the possible symptoms?

My 78 project bus has some strange electrical things going on with the fuel
injection system and I know that after testing everything else you should
look into changing out the electrical control unit. I don't want to invest
in it unless I have a pretty good idea this is the problem.

I have good fuel pressure and spark at every plug. The AFC unit seems in
working order and turns the fuel pump on when the flap is opened and there
is power to the fuel injectors, but no spray???
