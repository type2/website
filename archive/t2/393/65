Dave,

Thanks for the info. When you posted that last response to my question about 
what to do about a broken fuel pump base and you said, "split the case", I was 
in denial for a week and almost had to prove you right but with a long lag 
screw and a coat hangar I managed to get it out and boy I was sweating. I 
didn't even disturb the other washers resting peacefully at the bottom of the 
distributor drive shaft.
