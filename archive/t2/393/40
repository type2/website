Bill,

In contrast to the pragmatists with their wise top-ten lists, I would 
recommend that your son spend plenty of time hanging out in his new bus.  
(Not that you'll need to...)  He should probably consider what color 
curtains would feel best in there, and buy him some incense so it doesn't 
get too funky on long trips.
Also make absolutely sure he's got a copy of the Idiot's Guide somewhere so 
WHEN it breaks down he can think straight, and like, communicate with the 
thing.

The right relationship is everything.
Sean
