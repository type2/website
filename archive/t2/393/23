Subject: Re: [T2] respirator for sandblasting?

Here is the proper mask to wear when sandblasting, grinding, playing
around with asbesto's or just sanding--Available at any better body shop
supply house.
3-M # 7182 or 7183.
$30.00 bucks

And this is not just some BS from me--
I just got done calling 3-M.
You won't find it on any web page.
This is the mask that I use for any of the above.

Later,

Dave have you tried calling local craftsmen who work w/ sandblasting
equipement on a regular basis? Like a gravestone maker or the like? just
a thought. 
Ask around until you think you've got a good answer. One of the local
sandblasters I know here used to work with no mask or the wrong mask and
gave himself some sort of poisioning. Now can hardly do anything b/c of
weakness and such. I too would start with the gravestone makers. They do
my sandblasting on hearty metal (thick stuff). Wouldn't let them loose
on a door or anything.
