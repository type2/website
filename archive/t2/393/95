Subject: ref operation

Hi!

I have a 78 westy with a ref.  My question is how cold do these get?  cold
enough to chill beer?  freeze
stuff hard or keep it frozen?

Mine has a 1-7 range dial.... which is cold 1 or 7?

My unit, after fixing the power converter, now makes the top coils too hot to
keep
your hand on .. is this correct operation?  however the inside Ref coil is
cool to the touch not cold. Please advise....

thanks!
