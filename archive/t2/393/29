Subject: Re: [T2] respirator for sandblasting?

Success!

Man, that was easy...once I had a number, I looked in the ole phone 
book,called the local autobody supply place and bingo!

They put a 3m 7182 back for me to pick up at lunch time.

The lady said it was $20 too!  I feel safer by the minute.
   


Thanks Terry and thanks to your 3m rep!

Cheers, dave
