Subject: No Muir or Bentley to help and first time doing this.

Dear Volks !

     I am visiting a small town where there isn't a machanic and no library to
help me out. My problem is i have lost my brake booster on my 71 Deluxe and
have gone and gotten a used one from the junk yard, but it was already pulled
so i didn't see how it came out. My question is how to remove the old one and
replace it with the new one. I have a general idea but want to make sure i get
it right. I have looked through the archive and i saw about master cyclinders
and checking vaccum pressure on a good brake booster but nothing in the
removal of it.

if one of you folks could be kind enuff to put the dirrections from the
bentley or from prior experience it would help so much.

Thanks for all your help !!

Mike and Leigh
71 Deluxe
