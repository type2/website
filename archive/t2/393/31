Subject: long distance bus purchase

I'm planning on buying a bus, off of a contact made thru the internet.  I'm
going to have someone local drive and pick up the bus and bring it back to
me.  Does anyone have any ideas on a safe way for me to pay the seller?  I
mean, I trust the guy, but I would just feel funny sending the guy a money
order for that kind of money, you know.......  It is a private seller,
so....... Any ideas?

Hey there Mark,

Look into private escrow services (yep, just like a mortgage escrow).

You deposit money into the escrow account, and the money isn't released to the
seller until certain conditions are met (delivery of vehicle, title, etc).

Do a search for "escrow" here:

It's a Porsche site, so these guys (and gals) are very familiar w/ send big $$$
to private sellers from a long distance. Lots of good "research" material
there.

Another well heard mantra there is to get a PPI (pre-purchase inspection) from
an independant shop that's familiar w/ the type of vehicle you're buying. 

Hope this helps,
