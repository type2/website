Subject: Sandblasting shop ... was  respirator for sandblasting?

ho ya gravestone shop are the best!

  i bring everything i can to them (recently my bays rims) and they sandblast
for cheap!  great job! it come to bare metal without problem!

Last year i sent them my bumpers and engine tin and some small goodies too
(inside engine trap, front belly pan...) .. they have powerful sandblaster
... then i send everything to powdercoating!

but they cant do body sandblasting, and ill be afraid too to bring something
like a doors... or panels!!
