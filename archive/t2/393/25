It's a form of fibrosis, similar to the "black lung" that coal miners can
develop from working in the mines without proper breathing gear.  Being in
the resin casting industry, I sometimes refer to it as "brown lung", "resin
breath" or simply as "gross stupidity"; owing to the similar danger from
inhaling resin dust (and I admit to having shown some occasional stupidity
on my own part in this area).

"Promote proper breathing apparatuses, the lungs that you save may be your
own."
"Save The Lungs (They're an important part of your environment)."
"A lung is a terrible thing to waste."
"Breathe, it does a body good."
