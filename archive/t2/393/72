it is rarely the ECU that causes the problem, the library has the Bosch
Fuel Injection trouble shooting flow chart, follow this.  I can think of a
dozen things that it "might" be none are the ECU....  

when you checked to see if the injectors had power did you see if it was
being "interupted" which is required for them to inject.  also have you
checked the resistor pack??  how about fuel presure, should hold around
30-35psi if I recall.... my manual is out in the garage so I am going from
memory.   also check ALL of the plugs and hoses.  BTW all 4 injectors fire
together every other revolution of the engine.

good luck
