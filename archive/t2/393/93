Subject: re:ECU faulty?

Make sure the three ECU grounds under the air plenum are clean.  Take them
off, clean them and re-attach with some protective grease.  Do it twice a
year (<10 min) and many of your FI 'problems' will go away.  The ECUs have
a good rep for not failing if not excessively abused.  My spare came out
of a bus with an engine bay fire hot enough to melt part of the ignition
module.  All parts still work well.
  
	If you have a spare dizzy you can 'run' the injection without the
engine running and listen for the injectors clicking.  Best if you
disconnect the fuel pump and coil first.

	For those with a little bit more cash the Fluke automobile series
meters have pulse duration ranges which are nice for working on the
injection.  Our fave auction site has them most of the time.

snip> I have good fuel pressure and spark at every plug.  The AFC unit
seems in working order and turns the fuel pump on when the flap is opened
and there is power to the fuel injectors, but no spray???
