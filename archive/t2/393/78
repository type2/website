i will also keep the milk carton trick in mind if needed...

thanks alot richard this is what i was looking for.
I have made my order form up to send off to them...
i have looked all over for this certain gasket.
i guess that now i have found it ....
very grateful....
thanks
p.s. will this gasket need anything or will it do fine alone.
like talkig sealent or anything?
i always put a layer of sealent on the back side in between the valve cover and the gasket not between the gasket and the valves. as noted in john muirs book...

just wanted to make sure that i can use this oil filler tube gasket by its self or should i use anything with it...?
thanks again
