How do you figure that? The Amazon associate system works by traking incoming
links into Amazon. If you make a link on your site with your associate ID in
the link and someone uses it to buy something, you get a portion of the sale.
That's all that happens. Amazon doesn't require any amount of banners or other
advertising or list of users, etc., etc. And you can't buy anything at Amazon
until you've registered with them - so if you do use the link you'll be
personally giving them your email address.
