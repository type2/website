Subject: trip report - DC <-> Playa del Fuego

After a few frantic days working on my '71 so it would be prepped for a 
weekend of camping, I headed up to Delaware for Playa del Fuego last 
weekend.  Before I left, I basically gave it a tune up (new plugs&wires, 
valve adj., timing, point-gap, oil change), fixed an oil leak or three 
(new sump studs & oil P sender), fixed my tail-light and turn-signal, 
drained the fuel tank and changed the tank screen, new fuel filter, and 
did a compression test (all above 100, all i can hope for from used heads). 

I also re-tuned my 30-Pict-1 and was happy to find the flat spot gone now 
that all the plug gaps are spot on.

The one addition to my bus was a sump plate oil-temp sender.  I also have
an oil galley temp sender which screws into the pressure relief galley and 
that I've been pretty happy with after my dipstick sender "died".  

I've been having some cold-start problems with the bus -- it doesn't want 
to catch -- which I expect is a combination of:
	- the choke needing to be adj. (but it works and is disengaged 
					once warmed up)
	- point gap slightly off (dwell reads 24deg, but I think 
		this meter reads high) and/or need new points (didn't 
		have any handy)
	- clogged heat riser tube (hope not, as it's a PITA)

The bus, once warmed up, runs beautifully.  

I left Alexandria around 7:15 pm on Friday and despite the holiday 
weekend, traffic wasn't too bad.  The bus was running strong and oil temps 
were staying particularly low, so I started pushing it up to 60-63 mph in
an attempt to make up for some of my lost time.  

Just after crossing the bridge on I-95 North of Baltimore (exit ~90 in MD) 
I realized that my headlights were out (doh!) and had to spend 20 minutes 
confirming the bad dimmer relay and running a hot-wire from the headlight 
switch to the low-beam fuses (#3&#4 on a '71).  I guess the rain leaking 
in the bad windshield seal/rust got in my fuse box again and now the relay 
is completely toast (it had been having issues switching between high and 
low beams previously).

Headlights reinstated, I made it up to Delaware without any additional 
problems other than the cold-start issue coming out of the supermarket.

Oil temps barely crested 185 the whole trip, which made me suspicious of 
my new oil temp sender, although other factors led me to believe that 
this could actually be true:
	- head temps were below 350 the whole time  (?!)
	- relatively cold evening (45-55 deg F)
	- rainy
	- type-IV oil cooler mod
	- larger pulley installed

Camping over the weekend was good and the bus kept me mostly dry.  I got 
to meet up with a couple of other list members, which was both unexpected 
and very cool.  In fact, I turned my bus around so that we could 
make a rain shelter with my bus and Ben&Ellyn's '76 (?).  Good stuff.

The return trip was uneventful.  With a little coaxing (and me manually 
disengaging the choke) she started up and made it back to delaware 
without a hitch.  I was again averaging ~60-64 mph and roughly halfway 
home I switched back to my oil galley oil temp sender and saw results a 
lot closer to what I expected: temps ranging from 190-210 as opposed to 
170-185.  I would have thought that the sump sender would be more accurate 
(and it might be), but further investigation is needed.  If anyone in the 
DC area has a dipstick sender, I'd be interested in comparing the readings 
that gives in comparison to the other senders, so drop me a note.

Oh, as an aside, I've been getting ~15 mpg (as opposed to the ~17-18 i'm 
used to) which I attribute to my heavy footedness of late, but which is 
still a lot lower than I'd like.  The 30-Pict 1 is also "new" to the 
setup, so I'll be comparing that with an H30/31 i've got to see if I 
notice any difference in efficiency.  

all in all, a good trip with lots of fun in the mud in between.

thoughts, comments, wise-cracks are, as usual, appreciated.

happy bussin'
