The best way I can think of would be to use a watercooled engine fan to 
blow through modified tin on the top of the engine. Tin would look 
something like a Corvair shroud and have louvers that closed when the 
engine was running so the OEM fan would do the work.

You could run Corvair style shrouds and add a motor to drive the fan for a 
few minutes when the engine was off.

Idle the engine for a few extra minutes - as I understand it per Mackerle's 
book on aircooled engines the temps go up initially but will begin to fall 
on a "modern" air cooled engine idling on a hot day.
