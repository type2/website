Subject: sat morn junk yard report

so, i went to the ecology in willmington, ca this
morning and after all the talk of trannies not being
in the busses low and behold their was an automatic
tranny in one and the complete engine though i got the
automatic chokes off of it.  it has a complete smog
setup and an a/c pump that isn't bolted on the engine
but is sitting where the spare battery would be.  also
at the yard is a delux bay and though it is missing
the doors and some of the trim is bunged up the rest
of the trim clips are there and it does have some nice
trim pieces for those who need these parts.  well,
take care everyone and have a great weekend.
