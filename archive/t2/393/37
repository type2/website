Subject: RE: [T2] My Kid's New 74 Bus

Top ten? Hmmm. Let's see...

1) Brakes: especially the rubber brake lines, but check the whole system
over. Profesionally if necessary.
2) E-Brake: Working? Adjusted for good action? Is the cable in good shape?
3) Suspension, front & rear. Does it handle well? Shocks OK? Steering not
too loose?
4) Fuel lines: Check for chaffing, replace any worn or old lines. This has
killed many VW's.
5) Lights: All working? Brake Lights?
6) Tune-up: Get the VW idiot book by Muir and the official manual from
Bentley. Oil & Tranny fluid.
7) Exhaust System: Intact, not leaking?
8) Seat Belts in good shape? Make sure the panel they attach to on the floor
isn't rusted out.
9) CV Joints: Rubber boots intact? If not, do the full
teardown/inspection/lube.
10) Engine cooling: Are all the tin pieces present? Is there a foam seal
around the engine? The engine can cook itself on long highway runs or hills
if the cooling parts are missing. Does it have the thermostat & control
flaps (more important in cold climates)

Have Fun,

My son bought a 74 Bus off of e-bay.  He has been driving it for about a
week.  Apart from some backfiring when it first starts up and cosmetics, its
appears to be in good running order.  It came with new carbs, new tires and
a year old battery.

Immediate needs to buy or schnore are a passenger side rear view mirror, a
rim for the spare tire, and an antenna.

He says he is going to restore it, which will be cool if he does.  I was
wondering what you guys would recommend as the top ten list of things to
check out and make sure are in working order for an old bus like this.
