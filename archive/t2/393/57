You may need a time-warp to procure this item:)

I will suggest (again:) a cross-post to
vintagebus(-at-)type2.com  for this one.
Be sure to include the engine # and
some history of the dizzy clamp problem.
The post should also include which
Bentley and page # reference for the
dizzy spacer. Be sure to specifically
announce your affiliation and request 
a cc ( copy ) if you are not a regular subscriber
