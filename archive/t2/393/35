- check the transmission fluid and/or replace it.

- gas lines (as mentioned)

- brakes -- check/replace pads/shoes to prevent having to spend more money 
		on drums and rotors later

- flush brake lines with new fluid

- grease front beam with grease gun

- spray hose at front of bus and check if water leaks inside 
	bus.  if so, consider replacing windshield seal (or 2 years later
	you'll find it rusted out - ask me how I know)

- oil and filter change

- adjust valves

- compression test (all plugs out, valves adj., and car warmed up)

- inspect, check, re-gap, (and/or replace) plugs while they're out

There's 10, although I'm sure there are more...
