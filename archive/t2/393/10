Bill,

Bought mine thru harbor freight I believe, and use "solvent"
from the local petroleum distributors.

It comes out of a pump at a little less than $2.00/gallon.

When I change it out(usually once a year), I take it to the local
recycling center where they collect old paint, oil and such.

I did buy a 5 gallon can of the same type stuff at the local 
"tractor supply company", but it was close to $6.00/gallon from them.


Cheers, dave
