Subject: Rusted bolts

Of all the bolts I've removed from the underside of the bus the bolts in the
worst condition have been the ones holding the rear bearing housing, spring
plate and diagonal arm together.

A lot of powdery rust came out with one bolt and it had no threads in the
middle. Anyone had a similar experience?
