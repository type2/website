Ask around until you think you've got a good answer. One of the local 
sandblasters I know here used to work with no mask or the wrong mask and 
gave himself some sort of poisioning. Now can hardly do anything b/c of 
weakness and such. I too would start with the gravestone makers. They do my 
sandblasting on hearty metal (thick stuff). Wouldn't let them loose on a 
door or anything.
