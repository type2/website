Subject: FI have power but no flow??

The FI have power, but they do not flicker when I turn the starter over; or
in other words there is no flow of the fuel out of the FI.????

I checked the double relay last night, it's good.
Fuel pump good.
Stuck a pencil in the AFM, opened the flap and the fuel pump runs (when bus
is in start position).
Cleaned off the 3 ground wires under intake on top/left side of motor.
Cold start valve (I think that is the name, it's the FI type valve going
into the intake) has power and test light flickers when starter turned over.
Distributor and solenoid good--spark to every plug.
I think I have covered all that I have tested so far.  Did I miss something?

What do you think??
Thanks,
