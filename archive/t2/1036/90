Subject: freebie kitchen unit for aircooled westy in east bay area, san

yes, friends, it's true ... there is a santa claus
and he drives a vw bus. and he's giving away a
"kitchen unit" from his old-but-not-forgotten camper bus.

it has the icebox (not fridge) with liftup door on the top, and inside 
it is a coleman stove.

now the Gotchas:

a. it's been sitting outside for a few years. :(
b. you gotta come get it (in the concord/moraga/walnut creek areas).

so, anybody interested please contact me. i'm the middle-man/broker 
(ha!) for this gig, cause i'm still on the type2 list. the owners are 
trying to clean up (can't imagine why), and just want it gone.
