Subject: Head temp and valve play

Hello all,

I finished up the installation of the DakotaDigital CHT gauge. I ended
up using a piece of L-shaped aluminium, cut in 2" holes for oil and CHT
temp gauges and mounted it on top of the dash. Downside is, it doesn't
look very pretty, but being in the direct line of sight of the drivers
position, you just can't ignore the gauge readings. Driving in nice warm
weather (outside temperature 77F) I got around 400F when driving on a
level freeway (65 mph) and 445F when going uphill (just for a short
time). Oil-temp was always lower than 230F. I think the head temps are
okay, maybe a bit high, what's your opinion? I think Richard Atwell
posted on thesamba that he is running 65 mph whith 380F head temps. But
this was with 55F outside temperature. Strange thing happened when I
re-adjusted the valves yesterday. All of the valves were just a bit too
tight (intake, as well as exhaust on all cylinders). This was the first
valve adjustment after the rebuild and I drove about 120 miles so far. I
did the valve adjustment just before firing the engine up the first
time, so I wonder what is happening here. Is this normal after
installing brand new heads (only installed used ones so far) on a used
bottom-end? Is this a break-in of the valves and seats? I'll definitely
keep an eye on this. Help is always greatly appreciated.
Cheers,
Timo
