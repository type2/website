   Just yesterday, the State of New Jersey was out in force in Orange, NJ...
   Now, this might not affect you personally, but what they were doin' was
   performing "on spot" inspections...Mostly for emissions, but also doing a
   visual for obvious violations... ;-(
   OK, now I understand that most of this is for revenue, but it does raise 
   the question of "Is your homebrew CNG conversion gonna be "legal" in
   your state?" 
   Vehicles that come from the factory to run on CNG have DOT stickers
   on the components...Will yours?
   And while you're doing your research, find out if your insurance (even
   if it's just liability) covers a planned conversion...You do not want to 
find
   out when you really need it that you don't have insurance... ;-(
