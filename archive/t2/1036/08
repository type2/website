Jason -

71-79 is the same drum.  Go for it....

Had to replace the Rear Right Drum on the 84 GL 1 1/2 weeks ago because it
was scored up from the Self-Adjusting Pushbar disentegrating into several
pieces while traveling back to Ventura from San Jose (Kelley Park Vintage
Show). I happened to have a new one in my spare parts stash for the 84
Westy.
