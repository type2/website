Subject: 74 vw bus restoration

Hi everyone,

  I have a 74' VW bus Sportsmobile that has been sitting for the last 4
years.  It used to be my daily driver through college until I moved moved
across the country and it stayed at home.  Well, I know have the means to
have it restored.  I am curious if anyone can give me tips or
recommendations on a pretty full restoration.  I do not want to spend more
thatn 10,000 dollars.  The bus i/was in decent condition.  However, after
sitting for 4 years its probably gotten much worse.  Besides the
Sportsmobile conversion the bus is basically 100% original.  Has around
120,000 miles on it.  I live in the Charlotte area.  I think I have found a
good place in western NC however, any good suggestions would be
appreciated.

In the end I want to end up with a really clean reliable bus.  Nothing to
fancy, I want it to be a daily driver again.

Thanks for the input.

Jason
