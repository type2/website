Subject: Seatbelts in a bug - can they come from a bus?

So, my friend has a bug and it doesn't have seatbelts.  Would my 78 bus 
belts work in a bug?  I have some extra so I thought I'd ask before we 
try and fit them into her bug (haven't actually looked).  Are there even 
mounting points in a bug for seatbelts?

Thanks!
Mike
