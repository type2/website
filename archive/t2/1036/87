 I had to buy a WorldWide Starter this past weekend (store brand from
AdvancedAuto Parts $39) I was stranded. Wanted to know if anyone knew anyone
who would rebuild the original Bosch outof my 71 Westy. Is it worth it to have
it rebuild? I actually think theproblem was in the Solenoid as my Hot Start
Relay was blowing fuses. I would like to keep the OG Starter. I checked
Ratwell's site but didn't seeanything regarding starters. ThanksTrey71

I have given up on 'rebuilt' starters.  The lifespan is a crapshoot. I now use
new starters...... I do not like being stranded or have to replace them
constantly. Even with a 'lifetime' warranty, when they take a dump you have to
do the R&R labor.
