Bring it by today. I'm stuck home with pinkeye. :( I'll share!!! =D

Seriously, there's a couple-three wires that ground under the front left
part of the plenum. (Black thing that connects the air from the air filter
to the 4 gray-ish runners.) You can feel them if you reach under the plenum
on that side at the front of the engine... Front is front, remember.

Pull those wires off and clean any goop off them, especially inside the
connectors. Same at the spade connectors sticking up from the case. VERY
gently tighten one side of the connectors on the wires. Only do one side
because that old metal can be pretty brittle. If it snaps, only one side is
lost until you can get a replacement on there.

Try that and let me know how it goes.
