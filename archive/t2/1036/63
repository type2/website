Subject: Re: [T2] head light relay

Hi all

Sorry about the delayed post.  I had a problem when my relay wouldn't
pass the test either.  Took it apart and inside is some springs and
things that the electromagnet has to overcome when you click the stalk
switch.  This then trips the latch and holds it on high beam.
I suspect that through old wiring or more powerful halogen bulbs there
was not enough juice to flip the mechanism, so I weakened the spring a
little (by stretching it) and its worked fine ever since.
