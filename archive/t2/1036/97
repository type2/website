The usual culprits to bad bus gas mileage are the Temp II sensor and a dirty
air filter.

Exhaust has less of an impact on mileage than intake volume and mixture.

Hi, I'm driving a '77 Westy, 2.0L, fuel injected. It runs good now but is
going through a lot of gas. The muffler I have on it is an aftermarket type
thing. The outside of it is in good shape but there is nothing inside of it
anymore. It is VERY loud. Would a muffler with no backpressure mean that I
would be going through that much extra gas? Would a stock muffler change the
power of it? Because now it goes really good.
Thanks,
Bernie
