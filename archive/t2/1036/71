Subject: Buses by the Beach Bus Benefit May 15-18th, 2008!

Woke up to beautiful sunshine and birds singing here in Indiana this
morning.  Wished I was on the road in a bus headed up to Michigan.

Got to thinking about two weeks from now at Grand Rouge Campground just
outside Grand Rapids, MI.  Will be loading up the Aardvark and JoesVan and
heading up to be with all our bus buddies again.  Always amazed at the great
Volks that gather.  Someone new joins the group every year and much fun is
had by all.  Can't wait to feel that new Buses by the Beach pint glass in my
hand and taste that home brew!

Just wanted to report we are over 30 awesome donated VW themed items and
counting for our raffle which raises money for the Phoenix Society for Burn
Survivors.  Raffle immediately follows the car show on Saturday (right
before the band starts).

PMail me if you have any items you would like donate or for a list of raffle
items.

Who's going to Buses by the Beach in two weeks?
