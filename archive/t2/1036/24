I fought a similar problem, it was my key switch, the slot that was supposed to be straight, like a flat blade screwdriver slot, between the key part and the socket, had worn itself into an hourglass shape, I would fool with the starter and it would start and I would think I was onto something, I chased it for almost a year, my brother in law figured it out when it succeeded in not starting at all.
