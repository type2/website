And, like most vehicles of this type, the number of production Teslas on
the road is precisely, ummmm, one.  And it is owned by the Chairman of
Tesla Motors.

If the Tesla follows the standard established by the GM EV-1, The actual
range will be about half of the stated value when driven by real-world
drivers.

Lower-tech electric conversion is certainly feasable for our buses.  An
electric motor plugged directly into the transmission and a lead-acid
battery pack will provide a real 30 mile range, which is suitable for 90%
of vehicle trips.  The remaining 10% is the sticking point.
