Subject: Bosch Starter Rebuild ?

I had to buy a WorldWide Starter this past weekend (store brand from Advanced
Auto Parts $39) I was stranded.

Wanted to know if anyone knew anyone who would rebuild the original Bosch out
of my 71 Westy. Is it worth it to have it rebuild? I actually think the
problem was in the Solenoid as my Hot Start Relay was blowing fuses.

I would like to keep the OG Starter. I checked Ratwell's site but didn't see
anything regarding starters.

Thanks
Trey
