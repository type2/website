They just dump onto the top of the roof.

The best thing to do is remove the rack, and clean all the gunk out. 
You can access the bolts by loosening the screws on the headliner (you 
can see where they are by looking at the rear of the rack through your 
pop-top window; 3 or 4 bolts in total).  Then there are a few screws on 
the outside of the rack.

If you have a bulb-style seal, junk will clog it up fast, preventing 
good drainage.  Bus Depot sells the OEM style seals, which leave a gap 
all around the base of the rack.  This allows for better drainage, at 
the expense of greater wind noise and intense vibration when semis pass 
  the opposite direction on 2-lane roads.  ;)

The compromise is to use a bulb-style seal, but cut several drainage 
slots around the perimeter of the rack base.

Hope that helps.
