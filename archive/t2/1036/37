Subject: Cough is getting worse

So it seems that regardless whether I am in 3rd or 4th, I am starting to get
a more regular cough/hiccup. I notice that it happens more noticably when
the engine is at a consistent RPM for a length of time. Like a
rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrdrrrrrrrrrrrrdrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrdrrrrr. (Enjoy
mouthing that one :-))

It has the sensation of the bus being deprived of gas for a split second.
However, I know that my fuel filter is clean, it only has a few hundred
miles on it. That and the last one was pretty clean as well. I again started
to think vacuum, but feel too confident by the way she starts, runs, idles
and was checked out when the AFM was tweaked to think it's that again.

Again, new plugs, wires, valve adjustment, oil, filter... even the air
filter is 90% clean!

The only things I can think of are electrical malfunctions of some sort.

Any ideas or anyone who has had the same problem?
