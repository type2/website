Subject: 2' x 2' x 1" louver under westy

Under my 75 westy, mounted right in the center of the vehicle is a 2' x 2' x 1" thick metal box with louvers on the bottom. It has two hoses that travel back to the engine compartment and just sit there attached to nothing. Does anyone know what this is/was/is supposed to be..etc. It seems to be dead weight for now and I'm going to take it off after looking at it for 10 years. I just was curious.
Thanks,
Blake
