Subject: Hot Start Relay blowing fuse..

On a ride yesterday and stopped to adjust the dizzy, got back in the bus and
turned the key, nothing, nada, lights work, radio works..... Notice the fuse
blown in the hot start relay... a guy helped me push start the bus. This
morning , went out and put a 15 amp fuse in it, cranked it, heard a click or
two, the fuse blew again.

If the relay is bad would that trip the fuse? I checked the archives and
didn't see much.

Thanks,
Trey
