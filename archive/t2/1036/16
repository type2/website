Subject: Re: [T2] Starting Problems

     When I've been driving a long hot run, I rev the engine, turn off
the switch, and turn it to start for a microsecond- if I don't hear the
"cr-c-ch" of the solenoid pushing the gear to the flywheel, I leave it
running.  Rev it to a high rmp you can induce the "c-r-c-c-h" and it
will start OK after that.  I think the heat swells/sticks the solenoid.
When I visited my daughter at college- (I flew down), she mentioned this
was happening and  would lie under the buswith a hammer to beat on the
solenoid which usually worked.  We went to a WalMart where I bought a
minitorch and a momentary switch and at lease 8 gauge wire.  Soldered
the wire to upper terminal of the starter (from ignition) and ran it
through the grommet to the battery area.  In my bus I just keep the end
wire nutted and touch the battery (the spark lets me know the draw) but
that'd scare her so I added a wire from batt to the switch.  I've had
relays fail usually to bad contact; the former always works.

The "start" position wire
   goes back to the solenoid and closes the circuit to
   power the magnet that moves the solenoid piston which
   moves the starter gear and closes the BIG switch to
   the starter (also powers the double relay
   temporarily).
