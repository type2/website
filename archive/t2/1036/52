I will have to work on that tomorrow after I get a chance to pressure spray
out the engine compartment.

On my way to work today, I certainly noticed that the coughing and
"sputtering" is become more regular. Before it was only occasion and at high
consistent or low consistent RPMs... now it is happening in just regular
traffic. I also noticed that it never happens when the engine is cold. Only
after it is nice and toasty.

First I have the coil (on order), I now have a condenser to look at
potentially, and lastly a ground wire. Any of these sticking out more than
the other for anyone? I would just like to look at the most likely candidate
first, then move on.
