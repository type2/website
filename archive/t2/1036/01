You can use some pieces of plastic tube inserted on the holes of the luggage 
rack. You can then make them cross the bulb-style seal in specific drainage 
slots.
Doing this, you will need from time to time to check if they are obstructed 
with leafs or other debries.
This is not finished yet, but you get the picture:
