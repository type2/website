Subject: Electric Bus

Thread formerly... Gasifiers, Alternative Power Plants, etc...

I would like to see a real world discussion on electric bus conversion.  I
have seen websites mentioning bus conversions like..

http://www.monkeywork.com/p/Bus1.html
http://www.electroauto.com/gallery/bus.shtml
http://www.evalbum.com/159.html

But what I want to know is...


1.       Cost?

a.       Where can an electric motor be found?

b.      Where can we get all those batteries (and what kind of batteries) at a
reasonable price?

2.       Who?

a.       Who has done it and what were their experiences in building it,
maintaining it, and are they still using it?

3.       Comparison?

a.       How long did it take to recoup the money spent building the bus when
compared to using normal fuel?
