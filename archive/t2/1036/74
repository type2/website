If the relay itself is bad, that could blow the fuse (same for any electrical component). Assuming your relay is mounted under the bus, it might have been damaged by water, road debris, etc.

But is the fuse for the relay itself, or for the starter circuit that runs through the relay? If it's for the starter circuit, then you might have a bad solenoid or starter.
