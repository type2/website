   I can understand that, but a 30 mile range is gonna be cutting it
   really close if you ever have a detour or even if the batteries 
   haven't fully charged...Kinda like never having more than a gal-
   lon an' a half in your tank...AND if it quits on the road, it's a tow
   home unless you know someone with reallly long jumper cables... ;-(
