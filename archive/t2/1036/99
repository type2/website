Actually a bad muffler could reduce your mileage if the internal baffles have failed and are still inside the muffler, potentially creating excess backpressure.

But you would probably see a power loss too if that were the case.

A stock muffler might reduce power slightly, but probably not enough to notice.

Modern exhaust systems are tuned to use the shock waves in the system to help suck exhuast gas out of the cyclinder.  In this case lack of, or a non-stock, exhaust might harm performance and effeciency.  Not really sure if buses have tuned exhausts...
