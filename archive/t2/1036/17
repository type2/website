It sounds like it is coming.  So, knowing that the setups for LP (Propane) and
natural gas are similar and since most of the previous LP application
conversions for our buses have been "hybrid" run, it might be a good gamble to
put an LP hookup on the bus and hope that CNG will be viable in the near
future.

Something is going to be done regardless.  Converting our buses to electric,
at least for now, doesn't seem viable or cost effective for now.  Gasifiers
may work but are typically impractical from a maintenance and delivery system.
"Water as Fuel" (using "HHO") seems to be a scam (at least according to the
"Myth Busters".  LP is an option especially as gas prices make LP more
competitive.  Maybe CNG is the way of the future?

Peace,

Michael
