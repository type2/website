Subject: Re: [T2] 1972 Westfalia for sale South Bend, Indiana?

It's a '72, made about 27,500 before mine, it's just that '72 is an odd year.  It's the first for the big tail lights and larger air intakes.  It's also the last year for the round bumpers and even they don't mount the same in the rearas the '68 to '71.  Some parts are the same as '68 to '71, some are the same as '73 to '79 and others are '72 only.
