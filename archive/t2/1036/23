I don't typically know how much gas costs and I haven't for years, and it is not because I am rich.
While everybody else is paying $300 - $600 a month to drive their cars around with a scowl on their face and their middle finger pointed at everybody I spend about $600.00 a year to drive my bus much slower with a big smile on my face.
I am not even talking about insurance, I pay about $20 a month for full coverage on my '77 Westfalia.
People ask me about my mileage and ask me if I should get a Prius and I tell them that the pollution created by the manufacture and delivery of a new car will take me decades to equal with my lesser fuel economy, not to mention the negative environmental impact of disposing of the cars you used to drive because something newer would be better for the planet.
I am getting pretty sick of the biofuel bumper stickers and the hybrids covered with pro-hybrid stickers and all of this talk about about different fuels, it is a scam by the man to keep people from changing their habits, just a way to feel better about doing what you were already doing, "nothing to see here folks, move right along."
I am just going to drive my bus, burn gas, and keep smiling!
A diesel would be nice for pulling hills, but I am not going to fool myself into thinking that I am saving money or the planet by making this change, only making my bus more fun to drive, biodiesel and bioethanol is not better for the planet and has a lot of impacts on other things not easily seen, (most importantly causing a shortage of barley for beer because corn is being used for fuel and barley is being fed to cows, ride a bike, save a beer.)
I am taking my bus morel picking tomorrow more than 30 miles away, good times.
