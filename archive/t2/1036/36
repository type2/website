Subject: Re: [T2] Electric Bus (Hybrid Module)

I really enjoyed reading about the pusher trailer. Of
course, with a bus, the pusher trailer could be built
in. Add the conversion electric to the front (yes,
major front-end re-work) build down for battery tray
and have the original powerplant right where it is/was
all along. If you can get a 15-20 mile range on your
electric charge, you still have the original
powerplant for trips and maybe can afford to take
trips if not buying gas for commuting. Lead/acid is
still by far most bang for the buck.

With a little more ingenuity a person could make
modules that plug into the back of a bus. One gas or
diesel module complete with fuel tank and transaxle,
the other an electric module, complete with a
different rear suspension, batteries, and motor. In
theory, it could be as little as an under 5 minute
switch from one to the other. A friend's dad had
designed this concept for trucks (as in semis) such
that the entire running gear module could be quickly
replaced. This way a fleet of trucks could have one or
two spare modules that could be rotated through the
fleet for maintenance and rebuilds. It would mean zero
downtime for regularly scheduled overhauls. For our
buses it would take a dedicated soul to rework the
back third of a bus, but that is still far less work
than much of what I have seen like tandem drive units
on stretch buses and other oddities! Even my Subaru
conversion with front radiator or my concept for
amidships radiator are as much work as a modul-ized
power delivery system would be.

Yes, I'd love to do it, but I am soooo out of money!

 There was a guy who built an electric VW rabbit, and
 when he wanted more 
 range he built a diesel-electric trailer with
 forward-mounted controls 
 to PUSH the electric car when needed.
 
 This sort of technique could be applied to a bus
 just as well as a 
 rabbit. Or else you could tow a diesel or gas
 generator to cover longer 
 distances when the usual electric range is
 insufficient.
