You could go and spend somewhere around $250 or $300 at your local rack shop
or you could make your own. It's actually quite easy to make with parts from
a Yakima rack. Just made one for both my '71 T2 wagon and my sister's '71 T2
pop top...

Parts:

(4) Yakima rain gutter type posts
(4) 8''x3/8'' bolts
(4) 2''x1/8'' bolts & lock nuts
(2) 6'x3/4'' black iron pipe
(1) 4' treated 2''x2'' wood fence post
Duct tape or black electrical tape

Tools:

Drill
Wood Saw
7/16'' spade wood drill bit


So the Yakima posts by themselves aren't tall enough hence the modifications
with the wood fence post. All you really have to do is replace the stock
bolts with the 8'' bolts and cut a section of wood with a hole in the center
drilled out to extend the height of the cross bars. The black iron pipe can
be used in place of Yakima bars. Since they are slightly too small of
diameter for the posts a little tape wrapped around them tightens them up
perfectly.

It's a rather homemade rack but I thought it better than spending more than
$500 to outfit both of our '71s. I got the Yakima posts down at the local
used sporting goods shop and the rest at a hardware store.

Each rack only cost me about $75!!

Lastly, because of the wood I wouldn't test these to the limits of an all
Yakima rack but my sister easily put a car topper luggage box and a kayak on
top of hers with no problems. If someone wanted to even buy the Yakima
attachments for skis, bikes, canoe, etc. they could and have them attach on
like normal.

If someone wants more specific information or instructions let me know! Not
bad for less than 1/3 the price!
