Subject: brake drums...

Hey guys... 72 is still running Strong, Going 80 miles a day ;). But  
brakes have been giving up the ghost for a while.. well.. pulled the  
rear wheel to replace the cyl to find very nasty greasy mess and  
disentegrated pads.. had no choice but to put it back together and  
drive it home until i can get new pads. But.. The drum is scored up  
pretty bad.. anyone know of a good CHEAP source for 72 drums? Can i go  
to the junkyard and pull them off a certain year besides 72 and have  
them work ok?
