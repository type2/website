Hi Tony,

There was a guy who built an electric VW rabbit, and when he wanted more 
range he built a diesel-electric trailer with forward-mounted controls 
to PUSH the electric car when needed.

This sort of technique could be applied to a bus just as well as a 
rabbit. Or else you could tow a diesel or gas generator to cover longer 
distances when the usual electric range is insufficient.

Happy Trails,
