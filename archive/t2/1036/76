all I can tell you is Brax Euro Parts in Divide, MT 250 miles from Billings.  Wyoming is beat street, as far as I know closest to central WY is either Brax or Idaho Falls.  I was having engine trouble in 2006 and wasn't able to locate anyone else who does aircooled work.  Brax took care of me in 1999 when I had a blown generator.
