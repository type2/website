With all these discussions on starting issues, I wanted to drop everyone a
line and say, "THANK YOU!"

Three old starters later, it wouldn't start at all and I was stranded last
Friday.  Luckily, I was stranded at my dad's house.  I had to go to the local
FLAPS (Advanced Auto Parts) and get a rebuilt starter (I was stranded...sound
familiar).  However, I also picked-up some 10 gauge wire, some connectors, and
a push button switch.  I hooked up the push button switch directly to the
battery and the spade connector on the starter (one that worked fine in
another vehicle) and nothing.  So, I put the new starter in and everything
worked fine.  However, I am glad I put the by-pass switch in because I have
had two incidents where the ignition switch apparently wouldn't send juice to
the solenoid and I have had to use the by-pass.  That leaves me with the
wiring under the dash and/or the switch itself.

In any event.  All of your help and willingness to work with a very frustrated
VW not-so-enthusiast was very much appreciated.

Thanks,
