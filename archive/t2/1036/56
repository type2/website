Subject: [Q] Engine

Group-

I know I've asked this before, but what reasonable engine suppliers are
within close proximity to Huntsville, AL?  I'm in the Northern part of the
State -- only about 15 minutes from the TN state line.

I'm aware of some of the major suppliers (can you say Boston Bob), but can
only guess as to the shipping $$$ involved.

I do have a prospective supplier close buy (a reputable engine rebuilder
who's working on a quote), but I'm not sure if his schedule will work with
my restoration schedule.

Thoughts?

P.S.  It's been recommended for my Westie that I upgrade to something on
the order of 2.0 litres.  I intend to drive at highway speeds quite often,
and I am interested in longevity.
