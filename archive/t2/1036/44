The opening into the engine compartment is just a rectangle that looks crudely
cut which makes me believe this was an "in process" attempt by the PO to
install  A/C. Also, there are no signes of a compressor ever existing in the
engine compartment. I'll just probably stick a piece of sheet metal over it.

diameter of those holes, so what kind of plug or grommet
could fit those
holes."
