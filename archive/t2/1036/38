Once Blake removes those hoses to the engine compartment, what does he do
with the two holes that will be left??  I mean, they have to be 'solved' or
Blake won't have a sealed engine compartment.

And what is the diameter of those holes, so what kind of plug or grommet
could fit those holes.

Suggestions sought, and neatness counts...
