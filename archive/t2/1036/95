What I found was that, depending on the year of the Beetle, the middle
seatbelt section may work and the shoulder strap would probably take some
modification.  The main issue I see with the shoulder belt is that the bus
doesn't have a upper mount and the seats, being mounted higher, might make the
belt length questionable.  My 74 Beetle also has a retractor while, of course,
my 76 bus does not.

All I can say is try it and see.

But if it is just lap belts in the back, it should work.

Hope this helps,
