Subject: Squeaky Front Brakes

Good morning Gangie,

I am getting a lot of squeaking from my front brakes. I have looked at the
the pads and they are full of life, however the rotors are a little rusty on
the outsides. Could the sound be coming from the fact that I need to have my
rotors machined? I know I can have it done locally for about $40, but I
figured I would inquire as to if that is in fact the problem to start with.

TIA!
