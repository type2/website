Hi Jason,

I'd suggest that it's spark plug wires or coil. A similar effect 
happened on my bus recently with a coil failure in 2006 and a plug wire 
failure in the vanagon coming home from EveryBus this year.

A bad coil will run fine at idle and start to die out when the revs get 
higher under load.  Or it may e a bad spark plug wire, even if they are 
new. Watch the engine at night to see is there are sparks jumping off 
the wires, or use a timing light to detect if the impulse is getting 
through the wire.

Happy Trails,
