What is the capacity of a those tanks (20lb?) used in those BBQ grills?
Is it about the same as the forklift tanks?

If it is 5 gallons (or about 75 miles?) that would make the mpg only about 15.
What would the mpg on gasoline be in the same vehicle, as a means of
comparison?

I just got the phone with the local BORG (Big Orang Retail Giant / Home Depot)
and the tank swap out cost was about $20.  If the tank does only hold 5
gallons (if 20lbs tank = 5 gallons) then the cost per gallon is $4 ($20 / 5 =
$4).

So, if you get less mpg and the cost is as much or more than gas, then it
isn't really worth it.  BUT, if you go with local home delivery (large tank)
or something else, you might get the price per gallon to be less.

Now if I can tap my house's Natural Gas and use it...maybe still useful.

As for range...75 miles is still not that bad.  I actually work about three
miles from the house.  Heck, even when I worked "in the big city" it was less
than 70 miles round trip.  If I can develop a mechanism to fill-up when I get
home that is doable.  Especially if the cost out of my pocket is less than
what I am paying at the pump.

Peace,

Michael
