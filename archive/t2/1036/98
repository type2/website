Subject: Another seat belt question

I have another seatbelt question.? I am missing the belts for the center seat in my? daughter's'77.? It is a 2/3 seat.? 
Will any of the aftermarket (bug) lap belts work for this, or does the seat sit too high to use them?
Were the belts originally a retractor type, or just a non retractable lap belt?? I don't need retractors, but I do need? belts.
