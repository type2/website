Subject: Re: [T2] 2.0 stuff i need

Why bother with a "hydraulic" cam?  According to Karl, they spec out the 
same when compared stock.  My daughter's 75 had a top end rebuild 6 
years ago with hydraulic lifters, pushrods, springs, etc. and she gets 
22 mpg+ on the highway, many 800 mi trips from college in Savannah to 
New Jersey.  Good power too.

  What i am curious about is if  anyone
  has a Hydraulic 2.0 Cam and lifters set they would want to  trade for
  any of those parts?? I bought a 2.0 that I want to rebuild  but it is
  out of a 76 and has solid lifters and cam. So i am wanting  to build it
  as hydraulic. If any of you are interested in any of the  parts i have
  let me know and we can work something out :)
