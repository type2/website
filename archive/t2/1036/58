Subject: 2.0 stuff i need

Hey guys... I thought i would see if i have any biters on this. I have  
a complete 1.8 minus cam i robbed for my 1.8.... Good tested heads  
good crank and rods pistons and jugs.. What i am curious about is if  
anyone has a Hydraulic 2.0 Cam and lifters set they would want to  
trade for any of those parts?? I bought a 2.0 that I want to rebuild  
but it is out of a 76 and has solid lifters and cam. So i am wanting  
to build it as hydraulic. If any of you are interested in any of the  
parts i have let me know and we can work something out :)

Thanks,
       Jason
