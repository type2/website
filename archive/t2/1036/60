<fancy, I want it to be a daily driver again.

I am mostly finished with my '77, I had the same goal that you did (daily driver).  The key in my mind was to obtain a rust-free body, which I did when I bought it in 2001.  Since that time it has been a gradual, on-going work in progress. I did most of it myself (except paint and body), but the process should apply regardless of who does it.

I have done the mechanicals mostly on an as-needed basis as a hobby.  These safety items should probably be addressed regardless...  
Brakes
Tires
Brake Hoses (rubber)
Possibly Metal Brake Lines (inspect carefully)
Suspension parts (shocks, ball joints, vehicle frame, etc)
Fuel Hoses (ESPECIALLY if you are fuel injected)
Fuel Tank Vent Hoses

Unless you're engine is in great shape and well maintained, it may need new heads with improved valve seats...if not a total rebuild.

I had my long block rebuilt, R&Red it myself...took 6+ months part-time. Also did the clutch and gear shift bushings.

Lastly I removed windows, seats, camper stuff, and trim before turning it over to the body/paint guy.  Had some issues here, be careful who you select to do this. I actually hand-painted some of the interior surfaces (those covered by carpet or rubber mat).

Re-installed all the body stuff (windows huge PITA), and had the seats redone with OEM fabric.

If you want somebody to completely tear it down, paint, and re-assemble you could easily be looking at $20-30K...and it will be hard to find someone who knows what they're doing.  Do NOT let anyone take your bus apart unless they have AC VW experience!

For $10K, the key is probably rust...if you have structural rust it will be tough to do unless you can weld panels yourself. If you have little to no rust (surface only) and are willing to do much of the grunt work yourself, you can probably get body and paint for $7K, engine for $1500 (if needed), and all the trim, parts, and upholstery for $2K-3K depending on what you need. My prices are estimates based on my experience, assuming that you want a decent paint job...not top-end, but not Tijiuana Special either.
