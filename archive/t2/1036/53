With the L-Jet FI, I'm inclined to look for grounding problems first. 
Then move on to other suspects.

That being said, last year I had issues with hesitation and "coughs" 
(mostly at highway speeds) after the engine was warmed-up.  It turned 
out to be the coil.  Mine was original, and just plain worn-out.

If your coil is original, it probably needs replacing anyway.  So this 
won't hurt.  Just make sure to get one of the good Bosch blues.  See 
Ratwell's site for more info.
