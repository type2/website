Hi Pete,

That bus is authentic, it's just that 1972 was an interesting year. It 
is the only year with square tail-lights and round bumpers.

The "swamp cooler thing" is actually a BN-4 gasoline furnace.

That bus looks pretty rough, but there is definitely better than $500 in 
value there.


Happy Trails,
