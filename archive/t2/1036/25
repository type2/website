Hey Gangie,

It feels good to be back on the road. Driving Zoey to work is awesome, and
the looks I get from people in there high priced cars is priceless. I
actually met a woman in a 62 Firebird in showroom condition that looked at
my bus and wanted MY car!!! It just doesn't get better than that.

My question is, I have every vacuum leak taken care of, AFM tweaked, engine
tuned (completely) and she purrs. Only concern is this: When I am in third
and have the engine at a low RPM for third, when I hit the gas and start
climbing up to 4th instead of downshifting to second and then *back* to
third, I sometimes get this quick hiccup and feel a small jarring motion. Is
this anything to be concerned about? What is causing this?

Anyway you slice it, it feels great to be back on the road again... even at
$3.30 a gallon.
