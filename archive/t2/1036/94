I took some from my 1976 Bus a while back and put them in the back of my 1974
Beetle.  But then again, that is the back seats/bench seat belts.

It seems that the bucket seats might have more variables.  What year Beetle?

I am heading home for lunch right now and will compare my 76 bucket belts with
my Beetle and update after lunch.
