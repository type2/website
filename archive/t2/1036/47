Hello Jason,

I have had the same problem with my bug hiccuping/coughing or just hesitation in general. I used to assume that it was a coil or a fuel starvation problem but every time it turned out to be corrosion building up between the points and on the rotor/ distributor cap contact surface. At the risk of being flamed, try using an emery board and clean between your points and then re-check the point gap. This fixed the hesitation problem every time wit my bug. Good Luck!
