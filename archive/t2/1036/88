Subject: Engine ran on,,,Ignition Switch/Wire Woes

Hello Everyone,
   
  So..after weeks on working on the van, she finally started today!  However, she only started once and is not starting again.  
   
  When she did start, she didn't sound very nice.  When I turned the key off, the engine ran on.  So, I quickly disconnected the battery, adjusted the timing (per John Muir), and attached the cable back on.  However, it started running as soon as the cable was connected.  I turned the distributor while the engine was running (probably the wrong thing to do but it was my first instinct), and the motor stopped...for good.  
   
  I learned that the starting problem lies in my ignition switch/wire.  My voltmeter says that electricity is running the the switch, so I tested the wire.  The voltmeter showed no current.  I connected a wire from the coil to the switch to see if the van would start, and she didn't.  Now, I'm confused.  If the wire is the problem, wouldn't the car have power using the temporary  wire?  Am I correct to assume the switch is working properly since the voltmeter shows the correct current?  
   
  Is it just a coincidence that the engine ran on, I turned the distributor while it was running, and it is not starting?
   
  Thank you for all your previous advice!  It's helped so much!
   
  i'll be working on her tomorrow alllll day, so keep a lookout for more questions.
