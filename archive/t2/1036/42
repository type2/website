Yeah, it makes sense that the coil would be the issue. I think it is the
only part I haven't ever touched since I got Zoey so long ago.

Now 15 years ago, I would have raced to the NAPA down the street and
insisted on getting a Bosch. However, my understanding is that Bosch isn't
as great as it used to be and are more reliant on their name than anything.
I know I can get an AutoZone brand coil for about $25 (cost of a Bosch 15
years ago) but I am not sure if I am looking at a potential quality issue.

Should I spend the money on the Bosch, or just get a Duralast and be done
with it? Has Bosch really gone down-hill?
