Subject: Westy for sale cheap in Sacramento

I noticed a Westy which had been sitting in the yard of a house near 
work is now on the street with a for sale sign on it.  It's an early 
70's, white with red bumpers?   Seems complete but needs a really good 
cleaning and is full of  crap like records and old clothes.  Had 
up-to-date CA vanity plates which expired last year so is likely legal.

It's not mine and so I can't answer questions.  The sign on Friday said 
$450 or BO now is $950 or BO.  I can't afford it or I'd grab it.

Vehicle is at V street and 50th street in Sacto.  I can go look for a 
phone number if anyone is interested.  I still might get it if I could 
talk the "accountant" into it.
