In case you can't find a good local source, I'll throw this out...

AVP in Sacremento, CA does a good, reliable rebuild at a very modest price.  If you're planning on R&R-ing the engine yourself the shipping would probably not be too much extra. Not a high-end, blue-printed, rebuild but adequate for a daily driver on a budget. I have 10K+ on mine, no hiccups yet...

As little as I drive my bus (short-distance daily driver) , I couldn't quite justify a Raby or Boston Bob unit...it would take decades for me to reap the longevity benefits.
