Hello Volks:

Check the ad I posted on the Samba:
http://www.thesamba.com/vw/classifieds/detail.php?id=605140

It is not my bus, I am posting for a nice guy I met today with no internet
access.

The bus is kind of wierd in my experience.  It is a '72 yet has square
tailights.  Also has the side steps like most '72's.  Thought the 1st year
for that was '74?  Also has a Type IV engine with a swamp cooler thing on
the driver's side of the engine bay.  Never saw or heard of that before.

Thanks for any thoughts.
