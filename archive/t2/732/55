Subject: Re: [T2] sunroof cable value??

Hi Jay,

I bought a new set from CIP two years ago, they cost me something close 
to $400CDN.

If they are perfect, then $250 US is not out of the question.  $US200 
would be a bargain.

Happy trails,

All,
     I have a set of absolutely perfect sunroof cables that I want to 
sell.  I mean perfect, no wear or kinking, no damage, absolutely 
perfect.  I have hooked several people up with good parts for free, or 
very little recently, but not with these.  As far as I know, sunroof 
cables are simply impossible to find these days.  I'd like to sell them 
for a full, but fair, price.  This is one of the items I planned to 
sell to help finance the restoration of the 73 camper.
     What should I charge for these sunroof cables to get their worth, 
but not gouge?  I can't find any of them available anywhere to figure 
out reasonable pricing.
