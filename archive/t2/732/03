That's what I did.  I ran 8-gauge wires from the battery to the front of
the bus, coming up under the passenger seat.  From here, the circuit
branches off to the various devices.  Don't forget to put a fuse in the
line right after it comes off the battery.

One nice things about buses is that the entire body is grounded, so you
can use it for a low-impedence return.  You don't have to run a ground
wire all the way back to the battery like you do in "modern" cars.

For ham radio antenna purposes, you can run the coax to the roof with one
hidden hole.  Just put the hole behind the spare tire!  You can even make
it big enough for a PL-259 connector.  Run the coax down
through the hole and then up and out through the vent.  A roof rack is
wonderful for planting one's mobile antenna farm!
