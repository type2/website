WOW! I'm impressed! Ron and Bus Depot are the Best! This was the first time 
I've had any kind of problem with something I've bought from them. Maybe I'm 
just lucky but I don't think so. I just wanted to tell the list that I 
really appreciated Ron responding so quickly to my troubles, especially 
after normal business hours. Does this guy ever rest?~) A lesser outfit 
would have blown me off till Monday at best.
I know where I'll order my next batch of parts!
