I'm with you and Josh on this. It's really irritating when you get
glares because you are not the bearer of good will they expected.

 OK, it seems off-topic.  But since I started driving
 the Bopmobile as my daily-driver, I've been amazed at
 the looks I've gotten.  I drive up to a bum and he is
 almost beside himself.  He just knows that the guy in
 the rusty VW bus will help him!  When I drive on by,
 man do they get pissed.  I've seen it numerous times
 including a few minutes ago.

 Has anyone else experienced this?
