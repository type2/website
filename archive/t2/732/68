Thanks for all the tips folks.

I'd forgotten I promised my son we'd go see Hitchiker's Guide today so
my brief window of dry weather went byebye.

I did try tightening the screws around the body, but it doesn't seem
to have stopped the leak.

I'm going to get the $35 Facet pump from Napa on Monday and use that
until I can afford a new one. (I might be talking to you Mark...heh)

Now let's see if that solves the power issue. LoL!

I have noticed something that reinforces the bad pump diagnosis: When
I come to a stop the bus wants to die. If I keep my foot in the pedal
for a few seconds it will idle fine. I'm imagining the bowl having to
fill up some before it can idle.
