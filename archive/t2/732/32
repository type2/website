I might bring my TDI to them but doubt anyone is there who would know s..t
about the bus nowadays.

Hey folks, I last week received a mailout from VWOA
celebrating their 50 years of doing business in
America.  It had a new VW and an old bug on the front.
 Inside among the other words there was a statement to
the effect of "Whether it's brand new or 50 years old,
bring your VW back to the people who love it as much
as you do." (the dealership for service) I found this
very interesting!  Greg
