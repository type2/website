Subject: Wheel Bearing question?

Anyone ever had a problem with replacement bearings not fitting?  Got a set
that was made by Bugline and they will not slide over the spindles.  The old
ones slide fine.  Are the bearing made to tolerance with the race?  My old
bearing seems to be in good shape, was replacing it while everything's apart,
but the race is now thrashed (ground it down to use to install new one)  Also
discover that the new bearings in my 66 front-end are the same, but don't want
to pound out the race and them reuse it.
