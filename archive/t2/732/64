Subject: Alternator Upgrade/Replacement

After all the work fixing the striped out oil drain plug and fixing a few
other oil leaks, it seems that my alternator has decided to start making
very loud squeaking noises.  I guess the bearings have decided to really
give up.

Engine Type: CV installed in a '72 Bus

Current Alternator

Bosch # 0 120 489 913 = 914
VW # 070-903-023B
Specs from plate: K1 14v 65A 21
Rectangular Plug

Since I am planning to eventually add A/C to this bus, should I go to a
larger output alternator?  Is one available?
