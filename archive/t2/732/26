On Saturday I was washing my westy, nice sunny afternoon minding my own business, when this scraggly long haired 20 y.o. dude, (looks like he is from Evergreen State College-if your from around the Puget Sound, you know em!) checks me out washing my bus, Immediately thinks I am his best buddy and savior of the Alaska wilderness preserve where Bush wants to drill.  Tells me I must give him $50 to help with the grass roots campaign and Sierra Club''s objective to stop Bush from opening the preserve.  I tell the kid to look under my bus and check out how much fresh oil is on the ground- he does and is appalled because now I am also killing salmon habitat....Any way, I won't give him any money and sign up for the Sierra Club and he won't leave me alone, follows me around my bus while I am washing it, reduces the amount he will except from to $35. When I still say no, he looks at me as if I just broke all of his dreams...If this Earth Loving Bus Owner doesn't help me and the Sier!
ra Club,
 then who will!
When people come on to your property and you say you are not interested, why won't they leave? Do they have a code about guilting the nay sayers into giving, or something!
