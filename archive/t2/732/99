Subject: CD Manuals

I recently bought a Golf-Jetta 84-92 service manual on CD - this thing is 
great - it has the Bentley manual, Haynes manual, Haynes info about tons of 
different cars, Mitchell manual (what is that anyway?).  Does anyone know if 
a comparable disk is available for earlier years of VW's?  I tend to travel 
with a lap top .. so this disk is a lot smaller than my 63 to 67 Bentley or 
my later Bay window Bentley.
