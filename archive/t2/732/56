Hi Richard,

Canadian Tire's site doesn't play nice with tinyurl, so you're going to 
have to do it the hard way.

Go to http://www.canadiantire.ca and enter a postal code. If you don't 
have a postal code, then they aren't going to ship to you. But if you 
still want to browse, use their sample code.

Search by product part #32-1411-0.  According to the blurb in the 
catalog It's 12V and 110V.


Happy trails,
