Subject: RE: [T2] Re: Type 2 list fellow ham

All this talk about Ham radio got me to thinking.  My red bus,
Krista, was first owned by my father who was an RM in the U.S.
Coast Guard for 30 yrs.  He used to instruct morse and was all
about radio of all varieties.  He had a license (I think it
was KBTT3540) and messed around with all types of setups.
Originally he mounted the mast aft on the bus, but was
experiencing feedback when the alternator would turn.  You
could hear it whine as the motor would rev.  He ended up going
to a different type of setup that mounted off of the roof of
the bus with a massive magnet.  That bus has a small rust spot
where that magnet used to sit now, that I will have to treat
soon.  I don't know why, but he was adverse to mounting it on
the front bumper.

My question is this:
where do you Hammies and/or CB'ers (yes I know that they are
not interchangeable) mount your antennae?  Do you bolt or
clamp or use a magnet as my father used to?  Seems to me the
motor in the waaaaay back and the rest of the ignition in the
waaaay front posed some interesting factors...
