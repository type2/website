I'm going to have to pick up one of those AH-4's.  I
just have a 144/220/440 mag-mount and a 10m stick.  I
need to also buy a 20 and maybe a 17.  That's be
enough for what I do.  Hadn't thought about AM/FM.  I
have a stock radio with no speakers.  I need to
install a killer sound system but that would get me
by.  Thanks and 73....KR
