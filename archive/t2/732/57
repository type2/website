Me too, I run Brosol 30-31's on a 1641 dual port on my trike and a 1776 
single port in my bus-they run great. Not going to win any races but then 
I'm not entering them in any. I tried a Bocar 34 and didn't like it at all.

<I have a 30/31 on both my dual port VWs.  One with a 30mm center section
that I picked up at a pick-a-part (didn't know I had exactly the part I
wanted until I got it home and tried to use an adapter on it!) and the
other is on an adapter.  Both worked very well right out of the box.
