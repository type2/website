Subject: speedometer rollback calculator

Ok, so who has that speedometer rollback calculator (older thread)- and can tell me exactly how long it will take my 2100 rpm Makita to rollback a 4,232.9 odometer!?  :-)
 
but seriously (or maybe I can do it with the Makita), I have the speedometer out, can I just move the numbers by hand?
