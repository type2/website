Bay buses are those with a single "bay window" windshield.  In the US that
means anything post-1968.  Split window buses were built later than 1968
in other parts of the world, so you can't always go by the date.

A solid roof camper is somewhat rarer than the pop-tops, but they did make
quite a few of them.  There are also some solid roof campers that started
out as station wagons and had camping gear transplanted into them.

I found out about the "rareness" of baywindow solid roof buses years ago
when I was looking for my '71.  Lots of campers were available then, but
station wagons were few and far between.  Not precisely rare, but not
common either.
