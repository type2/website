Subject: Luggage rack edging troubles

Just finished with the frustration of trying to put on the luggage rack edging
I got from Bus Depot. Seems it's about 4 inches too short. Of course I wasn't
aware of that until I had installed it on one side and across the front. The
edging seems to be good quality material, difficult to put on and equally
difficult to remove (that's a good thing). For all the parts I've purchased
from Ron's place this is the first one I've had trouble with so this is NOT a
flame on Bus Depot. I suspect it was the last of a spool of the material and
the factory didn't do proper QA to make sure it was the right length.

Does anyone know how long these things are supposed to be?
Is there any difference in length between the Bay Window edging and Vanagon
edging? According to what I saw on BD's web site they are all the same part
number.
