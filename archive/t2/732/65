The only thing electrical on an automobile A/C unit is the blower fan(s).
Not enough draw to need a bigger alternator.

Also, a bigger alternator will create more torque drag on the engine when
it is loaded up. Adding a bigger alternator AND A/C would definitely let
you feel the power loss when both were running full tilt.

A bigger alternator is really only needed if you plan to build a super
spectacular camper with all the 12V doodads you can find and you plan to
use them while driving and trying to charge the battery(ies) or if your an
audiophile who plans to install a concert hall quality sound system or a
big thumpin' ultra amped out sound blasting beach bus.

Oh, one other reason might be if you're a big holiday fanatic and like to
"dress up" the bus for things like Christmas. Have a buddy on another list
who goes through all kinds of finagling of the electricals on his bug every
Christmas when he lights it up for parades. He's gone to using low wattage
120V AC lights but he has to use a couple of BIG honkin inverters to light
'em all up.
