My boyfriend owns a VW shop in North Seattle, and we have a ton of parts
at our house. We just moved to a new house and we do not want to move
ALL of these parts. So there will be a VW garage/yard sale this Saturday
starting at noon - possibly going to Sunday (also a BBQ!). We will be
selling parts for cheap, even giving stuff away for free!
He has a garage full! and also 1200 sq ft under the house full of parts
ranging from early rabbits to MKIV golfs. He has a ton of rare stuff for
scirocco's, rabbits, vanagons, etc.
Come check it out: 8623 Palatine Av. N Seattle, WA 98103
If you e-mail I can give a phone # as well.
Questions: e-mail us!

I emailed her to see if they had any bus/aircooled parts and this was
her reply:

"My bf said that we only have a few air cooled parts (a crank, a head
and a carburator). Sorry if that doesn't help!!"

I won't be going, but it might be worth going if anybody needs that
stuff, or for any other VW's you may have.
