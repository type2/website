I get this ALL the time with hitchhikers.  When they see my bus coming
they are almost 100% CERTAIN I am going to stop and pick them up.  I
should carry a camera so I could take pictures of the looks I get when
I drive on by.  Its a mix between anger and bewilderment.
Unfathomable that a VW bus would not stop for a hitchhiker!!
