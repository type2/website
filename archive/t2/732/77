Subject: Vanagon Seat Into '75- The Findings

OK, as I said last night I'd know for sure this morning. The answer is: Yes,
but with conditions. First, the seat tracks are the same width, but the
Vanagon uses a double sided track where as the '75 Bay uses a single (outer)
track. The Vanagon seat I have came out of a later water-cooled model, year
unknown to me, but it is velour with the armrests. Now, since the Vanagon uses
a double sided track, the toothed comb on both sides of the seat track of the
'75 need to be flattened (I hear the purists gasping in horror). The second
problem is that while the seat is in the track. there is nothing right now
keeping the seat from sliding forward. For right now, bending the toothed comb
back up will keep the seat from sliding forward. Is this safe? Don't know, but
I  am going to work on a more secure way of fastening the seat. This could be
more of problem for those with more than one driver who need to move the seat
back and forth-this isn't a problem for me. So, end result-I'm very satisfied.
The Vanagon seat is VERY comfortable. And, since I'm 6'4", I had worried that
the Vanagon seat may have me sitting too high, but it doesn't. The outer
armrest will have to go, even though the door does close with it in place, it
is very tight. My feeling is that the huge increase in comfort, which will
result in less driver fatigue (and back ache) on long drives makes it
worthwhile.  Now, next project; fitting that retractable seat belt from the
same Vanagon into the '75.    Jeff
