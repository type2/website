If you've got the "typical" early T4 QP exhaust with the flange "aimed" at the passenger side, 
it's a standard 2 1/2" collector.  Get yourself to a good muffler shop (not Midas, you want 
someplace that does hotrods) and have them build something.  If you can afford it and they 
have it available, go for stainless.  If not, the steel used by shops is usually of much better 
quality than what Empi uses.  Use the steel as-is or have it ceramic coated.

You'd still have the issue of the header itself potentially rusting out, but mine has lasted 
through two mufflers already with no problems..
