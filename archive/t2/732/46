Does Thunderbird make a T4 exhaust?

I only ask 'cause I have a T1 with a Thunderbird extractor/QP muffler.  
It replaced a beetle muffler that broke down after 2 years (even OEM 
stuff can fail prematurely).

Anyhoo, the guy that owns the shop where I get my VW stuff from (and 
who does the work that I'm too busy/too lazy to do myself) sez that 
Thunderbird was bought by Pertronix.

Oh, noooooooo!

What does this mean?  Will "quality " suffer?

When I bought it, I mounted onto the bus for 3,333 miles and burned all 
the "paint" off of it.  I then took it all back off and stripped it 
with a wire brush, then painted it with high-temp paint.  Three 
thousand, three hundred thirty three miles later, it still looks nice.  
These set-ups have held up well for me.  Maybe not as long as stock 
(except for the last muffler) but I think the cost/benefit ratio is 
better than stock.
