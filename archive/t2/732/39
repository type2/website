Subject: Why cut up a hartop for camper making?

Depends on what you need, I guess.  My 70 bus
started life as a hardtop and now sports a late
westy poptop, but I don't think I would cut one
myself.  However, my children do love sleeping up
top in that breezy poptop.  

The hardtop gives you the option of all those
cool roofrack options like the vintage ones, a
surco style safari basket, or multiple
quik-n-easy/thule/yakima.  

A tent/ side tent definitely greatly increases
your camping space and liveability.  I like the
side screen tent and rear tent setup.  Both a
generic screen room for the side and rear tent
from campmor.com can had for less than proper VW
sidetent.  

Enjoy!  Any bus is better than any other van/suv.
 


Happy bussin'
