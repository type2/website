Actually, that would be our fault, not the factory's. They ship them in one
huge roll and we cut them to size using a template. The Bus and Vanagon do
require two different lengths, but we simply send a longer piece than
necessary so it can be trimmed to fit either one. At least that's supposed
to be the idea. Sounds like someone was dozing when they cut yours. :-(

We will get a replacement out to you on Monday. Sorry for the inconvenience.
