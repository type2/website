Subject: Re: [T2] Brosol 30/31 vacuum port vacuum advance dizzy.

OK, I have been doing my homework today. If a master could correct my
handout it would be great.

The Brosol 30/31 has four vacuum ports. I measured the signal they
send at idle, acceleration and stable mid rpm range. All measurements
in Inch Hg. Unfortunately no measurement in "over run" conditions.

1) left hand side right above idle speed screw. Small connector Signal :
- 0 i at Idle
- 4-5 vacuum when throttle opens.
- Stays at 4-5 vacuum when rpm is stable

2) back of carb, upper left side. Large connector. Signal
- Idle 19
- Drops upon accelerating to 6.
- Slowly gets back to 19 at stable rpm

3) back of carb, upper right hand side. Small connector. Signal
- Idle 0
- Acceleration : 0.5 vacuum
- At stable rpm. 0

4) back of carb, likely under the butterfly. Small connector. Signal
- Idle 0
- opening throttle 18 vacuum
- at stable rpm vacuum is proportional to rpm. At max rpm vacuum is 18


Distributor Bosh part 0 231 167 055 or VW   part 211 905 205Q

Vacumm can : no number on it. There are two vacuum ports.
1) on the outside "cone" with a Small connector
2) on the inside of the can, Large connector.

Responses to vacuum
1) With the maximal vacuum i can create with my mouth (likely around
10) the can "pulls" about 1-2 degrees of retard?
2) "Pushes" about 5-8 degrees of advance proportinally to vacuum in
range 0 to 15.

It seems that I would need to use 2) on the distributor can and
connect it to 2) on the carb to achieve "vacuum advance". The size of
the ports tells me this (only one large port on the carb and only one
on the vacuum can). However I'm puzzled by the signal sent by 2) on
the carb. Basically it always "pushes" on the vacuum can shaft, except
at the instant when throttle opens. That is how advance happens.

1) on the distributor connects to 1) on the vacuum can. There was a
cut and plugged vacuum hose on carb #1 that gave a hint.

The vacuum can is a mediator between signals sent on 1) and 2)
When 2) bigger than 1) => vacuum advance
when 1) bigger than 2) => slight vacuum retard.

Now it's dark but i'm going to try that combo and time it to 5degres
ATDC at idle with vacuum connected.

However reads this should not take it for granted. It's only a
homework handout :)

Happy vacuuming
