A 25.7 inch diameter tire has a rolling circumference of roughly 80.7
inches.

A mile is 63360 inches long (5280 feet * 12 inches per foot)

The tire has to rotate about 785 times to travel 1 mile
(63360 inches / 80.7 inches per revolution)

2100 rpm = about 2.7 miles per minute (2100 rpm / 785 rpMile)

2.7 miles per minute = 162 miles per hour (2.7 mpm * 60 min per hour)

Unless you have a 180 mph speedo I'd lock the drill at a lower rpm or
you'll stress the speedo return spring.

So figure with that drill you do have the ability to max the speedo at
90mph.

You have 95767.1 miles to go to roll it (100,000 - 4232.9).

Divided by 90 mph it would take 1,064.1 hours or 
44 days 8 hours and 6 minutes. 

I may have gotten the tire diameter wrong but it's not gonna change the
time by more than a few hours either direction.

This is your best bet BUT...

Only if you are brave enough to take it completely apart. There's all kinds
of gear action going on in there and you pretty much have to take the outer
odometer gear off the shaft and slide the other over far enough to
disengage them from each other. I did it to my bug speedo when it started
squealing and I decided to take it apart and give it a good cleaning. Many
TINY parts press fitted onto a shaft.

As to legality -- Odometer disclosure is required by FEDERAL law ...

unless the vehicle is over 10 years old on January 1 of the year the
vehicle is sold.
