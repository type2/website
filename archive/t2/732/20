You're right, it is the throttle positioner.  The purpose was to hold the
throttle open upon deceleration to allow a combustible mixture to reach
the cylinders so they would keep burning and not send raw gas out the
exhaust.

The hose path was from the tap on the left dual port manifold, through the
gizmo on the left side of the engine bay, to the positioner, and thence to
the carb, on the back side, IIRC.  No drivability issues if this is left
off and the vacuum taps capped.
