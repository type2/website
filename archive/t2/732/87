It was pounding 'em out and pressing 'em into the hub that took effort ;)

If you don't have them already, go and by the set of disks for driving
out/seating the races. For years I struggled with trying various ways of doing
this without the right tools, always worrying that I'd gouge the hub or damage
the new race. When I did my '75 recently, I bough the set for about $35.00 and
it made the job a breeze.  Jeff
