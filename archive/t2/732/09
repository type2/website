I run a IC706mIIg in my bus, with an AH4 tuner and a CB whip for HF/6m.
VHF goes to a 2m/440 hamstick.  The CB whip is leaned back 45 degrees to
keep it below the 13-6 limit, but still works well.  Operation couldn't be
easier, just tune the radio, click the mike button, wait a couple of
seconds and the antenna is tuned!  I probably don't get out nearly as well
as a Bugcatcher or Screwdriver, but I prefer the ruggedness of my setup.
The first time I dragged it through a tree it paid for itself!

I also tried Hustler resonators on a short mast, but they worked poorly
and were so narrow I could only use one frequency, period.  They don't
work well with tuners.

The 706 also receives broadcast AM and FM, which is nice as it is the only
radio in the bus.  I call it "my really expensive mono FM radio."
