Definitely.  I replaced mine last year and my hands were killing me ... Of course, I had the luggage rack off of the bus, and for some unknown reason I waited until after I reinstalled it to put on the edging (duh...)

>Seems it's about 4 inches too short
 
Hmmm... I seem to remember having to trim mine because it was too long... maybe I got yours by mistake  ;-)
