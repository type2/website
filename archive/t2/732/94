 Hello John  I dont see the advantage of the CIS  some of the fuel dizszys 
are no longer to be had except for used and if they sit too long they gum up .   
It seems like taking a step backwards to use that system  Vw even did away 
with it in 1989 and went to a port injection that was electronicaly controlled  
later and have fun mark dearing
