Subject: Weber 34 ICT's for sale

Hey folks, I've got a pair of 34 ICT's with manifolds,
air cleaners and linkage for a type IV engine.  They
came on my 74 Single cab and it was reported to me by
the seller that they had just been installed new 
before I bought the truck so I think they're fairly
new.  I only ran them for about 3 months. I know they
look shiny!  They ran ok but I don't think they were
jetted right for my engine which I was told is a 1700.
 I'm really more of a PDSIT person because I'm
familiar with them so I took off the webers and went
back to the original equipment.  I would like to sell
the entire weber outfit if anyone's interested.  I
would like $125 including shipping within the U.S. 
Please pmail me if you're interested.  Thanks!  Greg
