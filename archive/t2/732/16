Most any VW parts store should carry this filter you can but BEFORE the main
filter (not in replacement of):

Look at 9066. You can undo the filter on the bus and clean it out over and
over. I did this for years with rust in my tank. If your tank doesn't have
large pieces that will be blocking the opening then eventually you'll clean
out the particles that are suffocating your filter and causing the engine to
buck.

I used to carry around this little toolkit for roadside cleanings:

I would let a little fuel drop into the tupperware container and use the
toothbrush to clean the filter.

74 was the last year probably. The strainer was just a copper sock (not very
fine filtering).
