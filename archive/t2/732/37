I sometimes eat breakfast across from our local VW dealer and park my '71
in front of the place.  It's interesting to note that it gets a lot more
interest from passers-by than from anyone from the dealership.

VWoA only
pays attention to their roots when they see an advertising opportunity.
If only the customers brought in by their "history" advertising only knew
VW's true attitude toward aircoolers!
