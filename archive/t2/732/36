Actually, in 2002, I did take my '78 to a local
dealership to get it past DEQ.  I didn't have the time
to fart with it, after failing 2 or 3 times.  It took
them 5 days to get my bus to pass DEQ. $1300 and
several trips to DEQ (by their mechanic) later, the
bus did pass.  But....
   
When I first showed my face, the order writer was
pie-eyed when I spoke the words `seventy-eight type
two bus.`  I think he almost laughed.  They luckily
had a long-term mechanic employee who like way old. 
Ancient.  Very old-school.  He was in his fifties. 
LOL.  But I know they bought heads and gaskets from
both www2.cip1.com and West Coast Metrics.  None of
the parts were VWOA.
    
I took my T2 to a dealership out of naivety.  At this
point, VW dealerships do not offer viable repair
options for me.  I will not make that same mistake
twice.  VWOA has ceased support of my 78.  And I have
ceased support of them in-kind.
