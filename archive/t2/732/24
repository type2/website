Subject: bum rant

OK, time for a rant.  We've all seen bums with a 'will
work for a Westy' sign.  OK, food.  When I first moved
back home (Chattanooga) from Houston (whew!), I was
disappointed to see a bum with one of these signs at
MY exit.  What is the world coming to?

Anyway, I mentioned it to my brother and he said,
'that guy is retired and has a house on St. Marks' (a
couple of blocks over).  Then, one of our local news
stations ran a story where they planted a guy with a
sign at one of the freeway exits.  He averaged $9/hour
free and clear! Then, they offered every one they
could find a job.  Said they'ld even send a car to
pick them up.  Only one showed up~   So I've made up
my mind, I don't know who's legitimate and who's not. 
So here's my tip to all of them...Get a job, pal!

OK, it seems off-topic.  But since I started driving
the Bopmobile as my daily-driver, I've been amazed at
the looks I've gotten.  I drive up to a bum and he is
almost beside himself.  He just knows that the guy in
the rusty VW bus will help him!  When I drive on by,
man do they get pissed.  I've seen it numerous times
including a few minutes ago.

Has anyone else experienced this?  I used to help
these guys but I've developed a healthy intolerance
for these bums after some of the things I've seen. 
I'd be glad to donate my time to the food bank, but
some guy that is a nearby homeowner?  Wow.  OK, rant
over.  Anybody else with a similar story?  Thanks..KR
