hello Jeff      Gasp   No not really LOL   I have been into VWs since the 
late 50s and non of them had good seats . till the late  vanagons   The thinking 
was taht if they put in high dollar seats how could they sell them cheap.  
Another seat that we have been using is the Toyota 4 runner and pickup seats  
Very comfy and low for tall drivers . You do have to bolt their seat rails in 
with the seats .  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
