Subject: aftermarket fuel injection systems

Hi,
I am new to the list,
I have a 78 transporter and have been told the fuel injection computer 
is bad.
the local parts shop says he has to mail the computer to Califorinia to 
have repaired for 500.+ dollers.
does anyone know of a aftermarket system that I can replace the the 
jetronic computer with,
I would like it to have the ability to program it from labtop.
I think the advantages of doing this is I would be I could have greater 
control of the system, bypass the govener that is in the boche computer 
and I would know that all componets of the computer are new. I am afraid 
if I put the 500. into the old computer they could replace a 2.00 
resitor or somthing and the computer would work fine untill the next 
thirty years old part fails.
thanks James
