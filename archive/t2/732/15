Subject: Exhaust advice

Okay, I am sick of these POS Empi single quiet packs that I have been replacing on my '72 bus.  I started getting the backfire popping on decel and realized the Empi has rusted out again after only 1 1/2 years use.  The first I had on this bus lasted less than 3 months before the seams blow out and I got a free one through the FLAPS where I bought it.  
 
So If I want an exhaust system to last 5 or more years, is there an option besides the German made stock system?  I prefer something that flows since I am feeding my 2 liter with dual 36 dells, but also quiet enough to hear the radio.  I also have an O2 sensor plumbed in so I can monitor my A/F ratio.  (it has saved my butt a couple of times when my engine starts running rough!)
