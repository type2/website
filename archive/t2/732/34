Hey Guys  our dealer just built a new place and put in all the old adds with 
all the older bugs and buses on them all over the place  I found it pretty 
funny and even asked the parts guy if I could still get one of the buses  ( 23 
window of course )  he laughed and said he couldnt even get any parts for them 
and that he sends everybody over to me   LOL  I hope in a couple of years that 
I can get some of those pixs that they had hanging on the walls of the adds  
they were really big size.  like 4x8 feet big  later and have fun  Mark dearing
