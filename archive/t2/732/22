You could do the following:

1) Drain the tank until empty.
2) Take off the fuel link connection at the bottom. It is a big nut that 
holds on the in-tank screen and all, right. Makes about a 3/4 inch hole 
once it is off of there, right?
3) Get a baby bottle brush. They have some that are pretty flexible and 
have good bristles. Stick that up in there and jimmy it around. Bend the 
wire a little and jimmy it around some more. Bend a little more and keep 
working at it until you have at least distubed the goop near the discharge. 
But, my experience is that if there is any rust flakes or goo in there, it 
is all right by the gas outlet and hung up in the prefilter screen, if you 
still have one attached. Brainstorm about other stuff you could put in 
there and not loose.
4) Put a cork in the gas outlet, or otherwise block it off. Dump in about 5 
gallons of fuel. Grab the rain gutter firmly and shake briskly. Pretend 
that you are a World Bank protester and it is a cop car. Get a friend and 
each work a different side. Really shake for 5 minutes or so.
5) Drain fuel into a 5 gallon bucket.
6) Pour fuel through a couple layers of t-shirt back into your 5 gallon can.

If you have some time, before you put it back together, for the last round, 
mix a can of Sea Foam fuel cleaner with about 2 gallons of gas and leave it 
in the tank overnight. Drain, then fill. Or, you could use a gallon of 90% 
ethanol, depending on the type of crud you have in there. If it is water 
sludge, that might break it free.
