I've got one of those, too.  It suckered me back into
ham radio, in fact.  Most expensive $129 item I ever
purchased, ha.  No, after looking at your post again
I'm wrong.  Mine is their 10M radio. 25W. Now my
vehicle rig is an Icom 706.  But since my Taurus SHO
got totalled, I never have gotten around to
transferring it to the bus.  But I plan on it as it is
now my daily driver.  Maybe we can meet up sometime. 
I drove mine to Atlanta a while back to pick up my
hang glider.  Heavy traffic all day.  I had to stop
and cool her down several times on that trip.  With my
new engine seal it runs much, much cooler. 73....KR
