Subject: Brake trouble-Need help

Working on my brakes today and getting nowhere! I simply want to adjust my
rear brakes on my 80 Vanagon. I have looked into the inspection hole and the
linings look sufficient. I tried turning the star adjuster to tighten the
shoes but it either wouldn't turn or I couldn't get the right angle with my
tool with the tire on. I thought I would remove the drum from the hub and lube
the adjuster then try adjusting again. AAARG.  No good! the hub seems rusted
to the drum. I've squirted some PB Blaster around the seam between the hub and
drum then hammered with a dead blow hammer. No progress yet, getting quite
impatient! where should I be hitting the drum to have the greatest effect
without damaging the wheel bearings etc.

With the tire off I "think" I am able to turn the adjuster now. Not sure
because there is no way to see the adjuster move without removing the drum.
The shoes don't seem to be tightening though. Am I turning in the wrong
direction? Using an adjusting spoon with the free end pointing up, I am
pushing the free end away from the backing plate causing the adjuster on the
drivers side to turn in the clockwise direction when viewed from the rear of
the bus. Bentley says one of the adjusters is left hand thread and the other
right hand. This doesn't help considering I have never seen the adjusters yet.
I don't know if the threads point toward the front or back of the bus.
