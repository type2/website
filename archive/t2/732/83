**disclaimer- this speedometer was sold to me with the whole guage cluster and is NOT in a vehicle, it is only a part.  The vehicle must have been junked.  Therefore it is not illegal and you are relieved of any liability (or of going to jail) if you give me advice. :)

Turn it on
and come back in 30 minutes.
see how far it has moved. 
divide the number of miles
my 30.

originalmiles - after30minutes / 30 = 
ammount of rollback per minute.

**great, I'll try but is it possible to move the numbers by hand?
