Subject: Heated massage seat cushion

Hi Volks,

This week's Canadian Tire Flyer brought out a treat to warm your  
buns... a $69.99 heat/massage seat cushion for home or bus has been  
reduced to $27.99.  It seems to me that this could be a way that 12V  
might actually help keep you warm in a bus.

Canadian Tire part #32-1411-0.

Mother's Day is just next week.... Show your co-pilot's heinie the love  
and respect it deserves.


Happy trails,
