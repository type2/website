Subject: Vanagon Seats Into a '75

Hey folks,
    Searched the archives, and found lots of info but no clear cut answer to
this question: Will a seat from a Vanagon (86 or newer) slide onto the track
in a '75? I'm wondering tonight, but I'll know for sure tomorrow. I bought a
seat today from a Vanagon, but had to pretty much destroy the base of the
stock seat when removing it as it was rusted in place. The track on the floor
is perfect, no rust at all.  TIA ,   Jeff
