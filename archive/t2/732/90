Subject: Re: [T2] Crud in fuel tank...I need a miracle!

Chris Chubb's suggestion sounds good.  There are cheap, clear fuel filters
that are readily available -- personally, I've bought them at aircooled.net
and at Bow Wow (local VWFLAPS).

You might want to leave the screen out of the tank for a while, to let the
stuff accumulate in your fuel filter instead of clogging the screen, and then
just change your fuel filter often until it's all gone.

Of course, you should make sure that your fuel filter is BEFORE the fuel pump
(i.e. between the tank and the fuel pump) and certainly not after it.

I humbly suggest using a Mr. Funnel (available at mrfunnel.com, or from West
Marine) to filter any gas that comes out from an untrustworthy source.  It
filters out crud AND WATER, both of which are very bad.  I use one whenever
I'm adding fuel from 5-gallon cans.

Cheers,

- Miles
