From USA TODAY today:

< In 1999, refiners reaped 23 cents for every gallon they processed. As of 2004, they made 41 cents per gallon, he says, citing Department of Energy data.

Economist Don Nichols at the University of Wisconsin cites other data suggesting today's gasoline prices may be out of line. Even if oil reaches $70 a barrel again, he reckons the cost of regular gasoline should be $2.44 a gallon ($1.59 for the crude oil, plus a typical markup of 85 cents for refining, distribution, and taxes).>
