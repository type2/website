I for one am glad to see this.  As a long time consultant to Fortune 500 
OCFOs, this is a breath of fresh air.  The current paradigm, embraced by 
Baby Boomer executives without question, is Milton Freedman's "Maximization 
of Shareholder Value" theory from the late 1950s.

Well, while it appeals to stockholders, it ignores everyone else who 
contributes to a firm's success:  neighborhood residents, customers, 
taxpayers, employees and their families, the extended value chain, etc.  I 
almost hate to say this as a Died-in-the-Wool Republican, but Freedman's 
theory is the origin of "trickle down" economics but with less intellectual 
validity.  On the contrary, Freedman's advice has gone far in encouraging 
the needless destruction of families, communities,  businesses, all in the 
name of a short term uptick on some stock exchange, mainly for the benefit 
of the options-compensated executive team and their cronies on the BOD.

Blood is thicker than water, and in the Porsche clan, thicker than making an 
extra euro at the expense of your people.

NEW YORK - There's a concern that nostalgia may be
getting in the way at Porsche (pedants and polyglots,
take note: correct pronunciation "Porsh-uh," not
"Porsh"). The company has always boasted a close
relationship with Volkswagen (otc: VLKAY - news -
people ) beyond its family ties--the first Porsche
roadsters used many VW Beetle components and had
air-cooled motors that were essentially sharpened VW
engines.

Yet Porsche's (otc: PSEPF - news - people ) designs to
buy 20% of its alt ally have left some scratching
their heads. The luxury automaker's shares tumbled 10%
on Monday, a day after it said it would honor those
family ties--and ward off any potential hostile
takeovers by investors "who do not have the long-term
interests of VW as their aim," according to a
statement by the Stuttgart-based Porsche.

Sentimental stuff--but analysts gave the move a cool
reception, saying it was a poor use of the company's
pocket money. A few even saw the move as crushingly
reactionary: "This deal is depressing confirmation
that the old ways of German capitalism die hard," one
analyst told the AP.
