It probably wouldn't hurt a thing to burn veggie oil.  After all, we eat a
goodly amount of it whenever we enjoy an order of fries!

Traditionally, waste oil goes to a rendering plant where it is converted
into base materials for other products such as pharmceuticals and
cosmetics.

It isn't well publicised, but most "recycled" motor oil is used as bunker
fuel for ships, so it ends up being burned anyway!
