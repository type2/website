Any danger to that oh-so-expensive diesel injector pump running veggie-oil? I love diesels and plan to buy a diesel if i can find what I want (Passat TDi wagon) next time we need a car. Would love to have the TDI in my Westy... If i ever go watercooled it would be a Subbieroo 6 cylinder or the VW TDI.
