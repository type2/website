I paid 80$ (US) to have these two welds done on the bus. That price was
bargained down from 100$. Knowing nothing about welding, I'd like to know if
this is reasonable or I next time I should look somewhere else. Should I
mention that this work was done in the heart of So Cal - where everyting is
expensive.

The "prep" work I did consisted in removing rust with hammer and chisel.

80$ is 20% of the cost of a MIG welder, isn't it ?
