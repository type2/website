Too late!!!

Molson (Canada's largest brewery) merged with Coors last year.   
Labatts has been owned by the dutch megacorp "Interbrew" for a long  
time now. And independant "Sleeman" was bought up by Molsons just  
around springtime.

The last independent Canadian brewer may well be me and my Red Cup  
Ale. Coming soon to an EveryBus Near You. (Obligatory Bus Content)
