Yay! It's running! Troy just called me and held the phone up becasue I
didn't believe him. Heh.
 I'm going to head over straight from work to help set the dwell and carb.
Then hopefully Greg will be on the road for North Carolina!
 There's also a thread over on The Samba with some discussion if you want to
see it all: http://www.thesamba.com/vw/forum/viewtopic.php?t=135286
 Thanks for everybody's support!
