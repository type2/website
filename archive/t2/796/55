Just read the Samba thread.  I'd like to say a great big "THANK YOU!"  
to everyone who has worked so hard to help Greg out... especially  
Troy and Don...

I may be in Denver over the Christmas holiday ... If I do make it out  
there, I think a test of just how much beer you guys can drink will  
be in order.
