Subject: Re: [T2] Leaking egr valve, rough idle

        What did you use for a gasket?

Felpro Hi-temp Gasket material. Bought it at the flaps years ago. Seems to
hold up well. It feels like real heavy card stock material. Resists fuel, oil
and antifreeze and other automotive chemicals per the label. I figure with no
exhaust actually going into the valve I don't need to worry about burning out
the gasket from heat, maybe just a little fuel vapor from the plenum. I would
have preferred to block off the valve between the valve and plenum but if I
recall, the stopper on the plenum side of the valve sticks out a little and
prevented me from putting the block off plate there.

        What's your vacuum level at idle?

Last time I checked it was 14" vacuum. Don't forget I'm at 7000 ft so I don't
consider this too bad. I'll check it again tomorrow to see if it has gone
down.


        You can undo the hex nut in the middle used to adjust it and the
linkage splits in two.

I thought of that but if I remove the EGR valve long term, I don't know if I
want that piece of linkage flapping around. Maybe I could tie it to the lever
it's attached to with a piece of wire to keep it out of harms way.
