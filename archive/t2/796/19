Remember, there are air-cooled, and diesel Vanagons.  Let's not paint
them all as wasserleakers  - in fact I have one for sale.   

As to the name "Bus" for Vanagon - I believe it's common outside of the
US to call the T3 a Bus.  Just about every German I have had at my work
(plenty) refers to the T3 as a Bus., although because of the name
Vanagon, I (and we in the states) tend to think of the T3 as a VW van
more than a VW Bus.
