It costs around $14 to extract a single barrel of oil from tar sands 
while recovering the same barrel from a typical light crude oil well 
costs less than $2 per barrel. This means that this kind of oil will be 
produced when the gas prize will hit $15/gal ... well ... $14 if you go 
to Cosco !!!. I hope I won't see that time coming any time soon. at 
20Miles/gal for my vanagon, I will call directly AAA to tow it if I want 
to  go somewhere with the van, would be much cheaper !! ;-)
