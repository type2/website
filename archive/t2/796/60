<In school they used to teach us that the bitumen was too expensive to extract. Fortunately the OPEC price of oil is so high that it's become affordable. Alberta's economy is doing well as a result.>

I saw something one the web saying GM had demonstrated a 100 mpg SUV... 

Exactly what do you have to do to the "normal" vehicle recipe to get 100 mpg? I thought we were pushing the envelope with the toyota and Honda hybrids... 

I can see it now, we'll still be talking about oil, about engine swaps, and tires but it'll be super slippery oil or fryer waste oil, hybrid conversions, and very, very low rolling resistance tires... 

I can seriously see our society changing at that point. We won't be wandering around the country in our old VWs, we'll be staying much closer to home, passenger trains will return to wide use, and our towns will condense - or more of us will be working from home. I am eager to see smaller/more clever cars return to the American roads but it's going to turn us upside down for a while until everyone and our businesses adjust. It's going to kill off any value our old cars have I think. 

What do you think?
