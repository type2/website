Just got the flywheel and valve covers off. The flywheel looks pretty clean
and there are no marks where there would rubbing. There is a little bit of
new oil though at behind where the flywheel would be, up against the case
halfs.

The valve train looks ok. Although, on my T4 the pushrod tubes are flush
where they meet the heads. On this engine, the pushrod tubes actually stick
out into the head just a fraction. Like maybe they were not pushed all the
way in the case? Or are they supposed to be like that. There are some
pushrods that slightly touch the top of the tube itself.

This thing is locked up tight and I can't get it to rotate at all.

Just got the motor out and the motor will not rotate.

*sigh*

Not sure what to do at this point.
