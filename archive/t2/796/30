Subject: Used or GEX?  

>>1.  Buy a used 1600 which is said to have been
rebuilt ($1,200 
installed)
2.  Buy from source like GEX 

Buying a GEX IS buying a used 1600 which is said
to have been rebuilt...  But you have to pay for
the ads when you buy a GEX.  The archives are
full of GEX.  You may get lucky, but then you
could probably grab a box of used parts and
assembly an engine blindly (no machining) and
have about the same odds. 

Another vote for a zero mile VW of Mexico here.  



Happy bussin'
