Subject: Re: air tools

Although I know next to nothing about the properties of nitrogen, I'm going to offer up some points from the top of my head... maybe they're valid? Maybe they aren't... I dunno, but it comes to my mind when I think about the possibility.

What kind of pressure would the tank have to be under, so that that you would get a consistent CFM at 90 PSI for most power tools? I know with my 60 (or is it an 80?) gallon compressor...  I have my regulator set to 90 psi because that's what all my power tools call for. 

After using my grinding wheel for about 15 minutes, the compressor eventually comes on again to boost it back up to 130 PSI. (135psi max in the tank). 

So it seems that you'd end up having to fill up quite a bit.. even with it maybe only half full..?
