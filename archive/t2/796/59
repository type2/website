And it means that you get less oil for each USD as the CDN dollar strengthens.

I'm moving back when the CDN dollar is par with the US again. That's the best gift Dubya Gump could have given Canadians who need to buy bus parts. :-)

In school they used to teach us that the bitumen was too expensive to extract. Fortunately the OPEC price of oil is so high that it's become affordable. Alberta's economy is doing well as a result.

If they blamed the Canadians they wouldn't be ignorant pundits. Besides, who's gonna believe Canadians are the enemy and then use that fact to ruin pristine Alaskan wilderness. :-)

Seriously, the US is a global bully but in as far as Canada is concerned they would have no problem taking the oil for pennies on the dollar like they do with fish, softwood lumber, electricity, water rights, and so on.
