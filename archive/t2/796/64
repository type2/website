Hi Dave,

I hope you're not suggesting that the US Military should be in Canada  
rather than in Iraq!!!



BUS TRIP GAS PRICES THEN AND NOW:

In 2001 I attended EveryBus and my trip log tells me it cost about  
$1.66 Canadian to buy a single US$. That was an all-time low.  The  
cheapest gas on that trip was found in Gettysburg PA at $1.50/gallon.  
Gas up here in "Soviet Canuckistan" at that time was selling for  
about 75 cents per liter.  That's US$1.70/USGallon. It was cheaper,  
but not by a lot.

(3.78L =1 US Gallon)

Today one US$ costs $1.20CDN, and fuel up here is selling today for  
$1.05 per liter. ($3.30US / US Gallon)  A lot of gas stations can no  
longer post pricing info because their usual signs only have three  
digits and they like to compete for that last tenth-of-a-penny. They  
post on chalkboards instead.

We also have a very annoying tendency to offer low prices between  
10PM and 6AM, then raise them from 6AM-10PM. The price difference can  
be as much as 20 percent. This allows the gas stations to charge  
exorbitant rates during the day and sidestep the web-based statistics  
collection at price-tracking websites like www.torontogasprices.com.  
Long line-ups and shortages are resulting.... but only at night.

http://www.pennsylvaniagasprices.com/ says that American gas  
(imported from Canada?) is selling for as low as $2.63/gallon. The  
high is $3.29/gallon.  With three weeks to go until John Brown's  
Buses, I'm looking at a major tune-up and a severe "equipment  
reduction campaign" in order to cut fuel costs. The westrailer is  
staying home for this trip across the allegheny mountains.



HISTORICAL NOTE:
The Canadian dollar was valued above the US$ until mid1975, when the  
Quebec Separation crisis destabilized the currency and it fell to $US. 
87 by the end of that year. Y2K saw another drop in the dollar thanks  
to millenium anxiety and trade disputes and additional Quebec unrest  
have also damaged its value. As the trade disputes are slowly coming  
to a close and the Quebec populace backs away from talk of  
separation, the $CDN will eventually regain much of the ground it  
lost in the last decade or two.
