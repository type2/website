Snake oil.  The clue is the line where they say "upping efficiency from
35% to at least 97%"  The only way to raise the thermodynamic efficiency
of a system is to raise the combustion temperature or lower the ambient
temperature.  The combustion temperature is limited by the metallurgy of
the engine and the only way to lower the ambient temperature is to move to
Alaska.

97% is a fanciful efficiency number!
