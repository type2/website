Yes, this is the real problem with biodiesel. It's one of those 
interesting experiments that works well as long as it's just a handful 
of folks across the country doing it. And until someone figures out how 
to sue just one restaurant owner for bad grease, or something, and 
brings the whole experiment to an end.

Unfortunately it's a lot easier to put together a biodiesel-burning bus 
than to work out a hybrid, as that stretch Vanagon project shows.
