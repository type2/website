You wouldn't leave us in the dark would you? What year
is the bus , what engine ? 1.7L engine, replacing the
heads on it, the sealing ring in the top of the
cylinder has been discontinued, check the deck height
and add steel shims under the barrel to achieve the
proper C/R, hone the head to get a good fit so it wont
leak when torqued down. You can only use 1.7L heads on
a 1.7L engine. Make sure that you have the proper
heads. Phil
