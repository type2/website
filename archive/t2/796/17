Nevermind.

It was running. Was being the operative word.

I got there to tune the carb and such, heard Greg fire it up, then it
stalled. After that... KaChunk. Again. Couldn't turn it by hand or by
rocking the bus in gear.

Greg's pretty frustrated (as are Troy and I). We're thinking (hoping) it's
endplay. That and the fact that the gland nut needs to be 253 ft lbs. That's
a lotta feets. We didn't tighten it enough.

Greg's dropping the engine tonight to see if that is the problem. If so,
heavy sigh, and reinstall. If not...
