Jenny,

Deck height is the distance  between the top of the cylinder and the 
top of the piston.

You want them to all be the same(within reason)...and can get them there 
by adjusting the shim thickness at the bottom of the cylinder.

You also want them to be some "best" amount like a minimum of .060"

Compression ratio only has a vague connection with your compression test.

Compression ratio is 7:1(read as "7 to one") or 7.3:1 or 8:1

Compression ratio means the difference between the original volume in the 
cylinder and head at BDC(bottom dead center) and at TDC(Top dead 
center)....everything gets squeezed from 7 to 1(or 8 to 1).

More compression means better running(around 5-7% total horsepower 
improvement for each full number(from 7 to 8, or 8 to 9).

Higher compression ratio means a little more heat, and a little better 
gasoline(so *no* pinging).

Some modern cars are running 10:1 or more.

Oh, and to find your total compression ratio, you need to know the volume 
of your heads in CC's...which requires some ATF, a measured burette, and a 
round clear plastic piece that "just" fits into the area where the 
cylinder goes(in the head).

Then you take these numbers and plug them into a calculator and find your 
compression ratio....there are calcualtors out on the net that can do this 
for you.

Really confused now?

Cheers, dave
