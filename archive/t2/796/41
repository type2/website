We're now at 300 miles on our MexiMotor, and while we DO need to pull 
it and check the studs and such...but so far no problems with this 
motor whatsoever.

The main thing I was annoyed by was getting it and having to pull the 
old Dizzy Drive gear and replace in the new motor. We didn't have the 
right tools, and this made things a bit trickier...but we managed 
through it (under a tent, and in the middle of a Lowcountry 
thunderstorm. On the beach.)

Just my 2 centavos.
