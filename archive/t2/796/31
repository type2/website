A friend of mine uses one for his 3/4" IIRC impact wrench that he uses to
take the wheel nut off his Porsche GT3 Club car and to put it in his
tires... especially when he takes the car to the track.  I seem to remember
that his has higher pressure than 125 psi though.  It seems to work for him.

Has anyone tried using compressed nitrogen instead of an air compressor? A
125 lb tank costs about $150 and $15 to refill. It sure is a lot quieter and
less maintenance than a compressor. My neighbors are happier when I don't
use the air compressor.
