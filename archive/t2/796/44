Ok, so no shims between barrels and head.

What is deck height?

Shims between barrel and case:  I need correct
compression ratio.  How do I do this?  install shims,
torque down head, install compression tester,
turn the engine.  If it isn't right, remove the heads
and remove/add shims, reinstall and check
compression again.  Is this the correct
procedure?
