Subject: Re:Air tools

Hi Everybody,

Just thought I'd add my 2 cents on this air tool thread.
I dislike air tools because the hose is always getting in the way.
Electric tools aren't much better.  It seems the electric chords are always
coming apart.
Battery tools are the pits.  The battery ALWAYS dies at the worst time.
And hand tools, well, they're just too much work, plain and simple!

Have a great day and enjoy your bus.  :)
