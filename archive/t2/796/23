Biodiesel is actually a wide spectrum of concepts.  It can be anything
from "used french fry oil" to "corn oil produced specifically for
fuel".

The problem with the used french fry oil concept is that it works fine
when you are the only person who is using it.  Even minimal social skills
will convince a restaurant owner to give you something that they
normally have to pay to have hauled away.  Change the equation to a dozen
people vying for the oil and it suddenly becomes a valuable commodity
that will cost you dearly.
