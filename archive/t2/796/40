You have a point.  The nitrogen tank works for any intermittant tool,
such as an impact wrench.  It would be exhausted rapidly by a continuous
tool such as a paint sprayer or a die grinder.

Figure the tank holds something like 10 cubic feet at 2000PSI.  This would
translate to 200 cubic feet at 100PSI.  Take 200, divide it by the CFM
requirements of your tool, and you will have the running time in minutes.

Nitrogen tanks can't be beat for portability, but they don't replace a
compressor for long-term use.
