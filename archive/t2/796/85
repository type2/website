My 84 Rabbit GTI 5 speed got 36 around town and 42 on the highway. My other
84 Rabbit GTI that was converted to an auto by a DPO got 32/39.

I'm not impressed with hybrids when my 80's sports car got darn close.

Though I have to say it was quite humorous to see the EPA stickers on the
Expeditions 5 or 6 years ago with 30/40 on them. I nearly busted a gut. =)
