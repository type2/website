Subject: help with parts source?

Volks,

I need help sourcing a couple things.

1-  set of pre-66 type1 (25hp?) singleport intake
gaskets. These are the SMALLER crushgaskets that never
seem to come in the gasket kits anymore.

2- a vac can for the distrubutor - smaller,
single-ported vac can. Probably a stock dist for a
1300cc. 

I hope someone can help.
This refab/cleaning job is stalled waiting on these
hen's teeth.

Please email me - im on digest mode...or call.

Thanks in advance,
Clark Gordon
