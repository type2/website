Ray,

On a side note, do you read the Sunday paper?

Do you read the "Parade" or whatever magazine they include in it that has 
Marilyn vos Savant answering questions?

See the one last Sunday?  The question was 

"who do we import the *most* oil from?
A. Saudi Arabia
B. Kuwait
C. Iraq
D. Canada


aahhhh to cut the story short, the answer is *****Canada*****.

And what's more, it has been forthe last **seven** years in a row.

So what do I hear this morning on NPR?
Canada's currency value has gone up 40% in the last year or two and is now 
a *hot* commodity in the money market since their money is now known
as a "petrodollar".

On the same NPR show this morning, it was revealed that the "tar sands" of 
Canada has ***more*** oil available in it than all of the Saudi oil 
fields.

Bus Content: I love you Canadian guys, man!  I love burning Canadian oil
		in my bus!  LOL!


So, the big question....why is the regular media always harping on opec?
I won't ask the other rhetorical questions about why we are in certain 
places...I leave those questions up to the reader<grin>.

Cheers, dave
