Subject: smaller voltage regulator

I recently picked up a new Bosch voltage regulator from Spain. It's the same as the one listed here:

http://germansupply.com/xcart/customer/product.php?productid=16719&cat=296&page=1

I knew the part number (0 192 062 007) was different that the usual ones:

55A 0 190 600 016
70A 0 190 600 006

What I didn't expect was that it is much shorter than the other two. Does anyone know any more about this other votlage regulator such as what vehicles that part number applies to?
