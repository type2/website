If the old folks are like the ones I know, they have all day to sit and stew over something while the rest of us are busy trying to make a living. I have no problems with old folks for the record, but have met a few examples of this type over the years... Was it types or printed out on an ink jet printer? Who else has a real typewriter these days??? I've got one in the attic but it wasn't me...
