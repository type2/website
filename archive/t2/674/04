Bad karma on them...

Two questions: 
Are you truly obeying the spirit of the law? Actually driving the bus
every 2 days or so?
Are you in a homeowner's association (HOA)?

If you're in an HOA you're screwed. They can force you to sell your
bus, or at least leave it elsewhere. As long as you're truly driving
the bus every two days, a good idea for the health of your bus anyway,
you have nothing to worry about getting it towed.

I would file a report with the police that you have received this
letter and others, and want to make sure they're aware of the issue
and don't tow your bus only on the word of another resident.
