Subject: RE: [T2] Anonymous threatening letters left on my bus...

Let's face it, buses to many non VW people are ugly and even more so if 
paint is poor or rusted out. Do you have a pic of your bus, curious to see 
it. Also the broken window, which one do you need?

I would first find out the law and personally, I would go door to door and 
try to find out who left the note. Start conversation, ask if it would help 
to have a cover on her. Ask them to pay for it or half. :) :) :) If you know 
who it is and something happens then you know who to point the police to.

Also are the spots numbered what's with the #17 #19? If you are just on a 
residential street I don't see how they can do anything legally.

Let us know how it goes.
