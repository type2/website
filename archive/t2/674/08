I have mixed feelings about this problem.

A few years ago, when I lived in an apartment complex, I tended to end 
up parking my bus in the same space each day because I was invariably 
the first commuter to get home. One day I was accosted by an older 
German fellow who was incensed that I had parked my bus there and "had 
left it for days at a time." I asked him how he could possibly know 
that. Then I pointed out that his Cadillac was hopelessly vulgar and he 
was in no position to judge anyone. He clearly hated my bus.

At least he confronted me directly. Anonymous notes are gutless.

So I know how you feel.

But Dave, your bus is parked in a neighborhood that is undergoing 
gentrification. You may or may not have the moral high ground (Don's 
right about the "spirit of the law" thing), but the gentry are powerful 
and will have their way.

The text of the note says that the window is broken. Is it? Can you get 
it fixed?

What are your other options for parking your bus? You don't say where 
the neighborhood is, but look at it from the other person's 
perspective. Someone comes home with several bags of groceries and 
cannot find a space near their condo/house/apartment. They park three 
blocks away, while your bus is parked right in front of their place. 
They are going to be a little miffed (even though the absence of the 
bus won't assure them a parking place).

The smartest thing is probably to forgo a little convenience and make a 
point of moving the bus every other day or so, sometimes to a block or 
so away.

And hard as it may be, try to ignore the question of aesthetics. It 
will get you nowhere.
