Subject: Front Door Seals- glue or not?

Spent today scraping out old seals and "dry-fitting" the German Bus
Depot supplied seals- had to even out the loose areas between the
corners, but it is so tight where the seal sits in a groove that my
fingertips are sore- and you really have to slam the door to close it. 
Do I really need to use glue other than on the hinges side where there
is no groove?
