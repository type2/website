I used one when returning a dead 71 westy to the road a few years ago.  
I was having a hard time keeping track of all the tasks - rear wheel 
bearings, electrical, window rubber, interior, etc.  The chart was 
great for identifying critical paths, independent subassemblies, things 
I could work on in parallel fashion, which parts were needed first, and 
so on.  I actually found the PERT chart (kinda like a flowchart) to be 
most useful.  Trick there is to get the whole critter to print at a 
reasonable size.

I used a demo version of MS Project to create the charts.  Dunno what's 
out there now.
