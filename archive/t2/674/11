This is a key item. CHECK THE LAW. I'm betting that the "abandoned vehicle
law" applies only to vehicles without current
registration/inspection/insurance OR vehicles whose registration does not
match an owner address in the area where they are parked.

If you are not a member of a home owners association you cannot be
penalized for the appearance of your vehicle if it passes all state/city
requirements for registration and inspection.

I, personally, being a country/suburb raised southerner still can't wrap my
head around anyone actually living in a place that has absolutely no
personal yard/driveway that a vehicle can be parked in. Parking on the
street only? <grin>

I currently live "in town" and there ARE laws regarding "junk" vehicles.
But my unregistered '73 Riviera sits in my driveway for months at a time as
I try to make time to get it running. There is a towbar on it ALL the time
so it's obviously not a running vehicle. No complaints so far. The laws
would cover my Rivi but they were originally written, in spirit, to only be
applied to true "junkers" sitting visible up on blocks, wrecked, etc. And
that's the way they work. My rustbucket '69 bug is in my back yard, only
visible to me and my immediate neighbors. It's been there over a year now.
But then again I have neighbors who will pick up UPS packages left on my
porch if they know I'm at work -- and call me at work if there's someone
they don't recognize around my house when I'm not there.
