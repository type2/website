In Germany, it was done that way because it used to be the law
that high beams and fog lights must not work together.  That law
was dropped in the 1990s, IIRC, but it still does make sense to
wire it like that, if only for historical correctness (and also
for giggle value: if you have the main headlight switch off, but
the foglight switch on, the headlight flasher will flash all
four lights; and if you have main headlights and foglights on,
the headlight flasher will turn on the high beams and turn off
the foglights at the same time -- nice light show :-)

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
