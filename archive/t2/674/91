We did most of the Prep work on Nyssa's 75 bus, including 2-stage Du
Pont waterfroof primer on bare metal and 400 grit sanding over good
paint..  The bus was going to go from red/white to all white.  We had
not gotten to do some of the hidden door edges, and I planned to ask for
extra urethane paint to do that ourselves. Maaco talked me into painting
this "round the edge stuff" , and the price seemed OK for what they
claimed included surface and priming prep.   The paint coat was
beautiful, no runs, decent masking, but some peeling in the door steps
(due mostly to kids letting the seatbelts bang down) showed to me red
coming through without obvious roughening or primer- I complained about
this, and they said they used some "prep-sol" on the old paint and
proved there was primer (2 molecules thick perhaps?) by peeling back
some white paint and showing it was grey on the backside!  In my
opinion, do the prep all yourself and let them do the spraying.
