Subject: Letter on Bus

I would put a note in the window that the police have been notified and that 
the bus is being vedio monitored. State that you will take legal recorse 
with anyone tampering with your vehicle. Darne straight thats what I would 
do. Also let the police handle the rest.  Cree 79 Bay
