Dave,

I'm cc'ing the list b/c I'd like to see the results of this conversation 
as I'm guessing you aren't the only who has had to deal with something 
along these lines.

Hmm, To start with I don't think you should move it just because other 
people don't like the looks of it.

I guess my suggestion would be to either seek legal council in 
determining your rights to park where you please (presumably you live on 
the street you are parking on?).

And/or I would speak with the local authorities on the matter and get 
their take on it. If the bus is fully licensed I can see it being that 
big of a deal.

I live in Philly and walk to work every day so usually only drive on the 
weekends or to run errands. Surely, in another big city others do so as 
well so you may have some latitude.

I'd check around to see how many of your neighbors might do the same thing.

Also, check the law on what constitutes a "abandoned vehicle". Do not 
trust the people who want to get rid of it to provide a fair and 
thorough explanation of the law.

HTH,
Harry
