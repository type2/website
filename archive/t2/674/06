That's a good idea I think! When they know what's
going on they might not tow your car without letting
you know...or perhaps they warn you first. If they're
good Cops they would tell the complaining neighbour to
first go and talk with you before they tow your bus
away.

If you contact the police also ask them if the
regulation (of having to move your car every three
days) really exists. It could be this regulation is:

a) something of the past.
b) a regulation valid only in certain parts of the
city
c) just a fairytale

The positive thing is that it shows the people care
about their neighbourhood... ;-)
Although I think they should put their energy in other
things.

May be talking with the neighbours would help as well.
Any idea who are the ones that complain? Talk might
help to prevent things from escalating, you know how
these neighbours-issues can develop.

Good luck! I am curious about the developments.


yours,

Vincent
