I replaced all the hoses, suction valve and dryer/receiver on an old system.
I also added an additional 12" x 24" x 1.5" condenser (85 Vanagon Vintage)
under the van. In addition I replaced the seals in the old York Compressor
to handle 134r and recharged the system with 134r. The system works
wonderful.
Total cost was about $270.00 and well worth the DIY learning curve.
Actually I went to my first Automotive A/C schooling at John E. Mitchell Co.
in 1962 and several since then. Strangest thing is that almost nothing other
than the new refrigerant has changed in over 40 years. Everything is still
required and it still all works the same.
