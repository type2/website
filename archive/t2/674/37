I've had a few neighbors who went too far in protesting various things that
their neighbors were prone to do on occasion.  I hope this isn't the case
with your bus.  Baseball bats, rocks and keys leave marks!

I agree with the others who have mentioned keeping an eye on your bus.  Be a
good neighbor, but be a wise one, too.

Hope it all works out.
