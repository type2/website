Subject: Maaco (was Re: Anonymous threatening letters)

David,

I've never heard of a satisfied Maaco paint customer: when I researched paint,
everyone who had anything to say about Maaco said stay away.  (Of course, if
there are any satisfied Maaco customers here, you should say something now!)

On the other hand, I heard lots of good things about Earl Scheib, which I
believe is a nationwide chain.  Not sure if they're in Boston.

I ended up painting my bus with industrial urethane gloss paint.  Sanded the
existing paint and then brushed it on.  In this case, it was brushed on in the
form of murals of mountains and dragons -- thanks to my artist friend Erin
Tilly from Alaska! -- but you could do all one color, too.  Materials cost
$100 for the entire job.  Pretty bulletproof, too: last month a kid in a rice
racer smashed his left-front fender on my passenger-side door when he
attempted to change into a lane that was already occupied by a very large,
visible VW Bus with a very conspicuous paint job.  Despite the extensive
damage to his car, my Bus and the industrial paint did great: he left a little
dent behind the right-front wheel (easy to bend back) and sort of scratched
the paint, but it's not very noticeable from a distance.

Cheers,

- Miles
