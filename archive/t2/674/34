I have to agree that you should get the window fixed, if for no other
reason than to prevent folks from easily vandalizing it.  that way if
something happens it is "breaking and entering"

yes they hose you for the prep.   my take on getting it painted,  find a
place where you won't be bothered, some unused parking lot on a Sunday
etc.    get a dozen rattle cans some tape and some newspaper,  tape it up
and paint it with quick dry paint from a can and when done, sit down have
lunch (don't forget a mask and clean up supplies) and a soda...then start
carefully taking off the masking and put it into a trash bag.  it may not
be #1 but it will at least be uniform and will help stop the rust a
little. try not to jerk the neighbors chain by painting it shocking pink
or anything...it could take a nice long day, help from a friend with
another vehicle that can go get what you forgot would be usefull otherwise
borrow a bike or something just in case.

Good luck

Bob
