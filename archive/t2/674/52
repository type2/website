Any ideas?  I need to know if I can trust this guy.  He also told me to rip off the thermostat and flaps, by the way, that the engine would run better without them....

Hi Marc,

I would question his advice to remove the thermostat/flaps - especially 
in the winter. Better advice would be to check them out and make sure 
they are working correctly.

Good Luck,
