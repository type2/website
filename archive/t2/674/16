Subject: RE: [T2] Anonymous threatening letters left on my bus...  

I am part of the HOA in my neighborhood and we have just implemented new rules
concerning vehicles in the neighborhood. These kind of laws get implemented
because people end up with 9 "parts" cars in their driveway and viewable from
the road. This really has an effect on the value of houses in the area.

Our bylaws now state that the vehicle must be licensed and operational.
Although if it has valid tags, but does not run, they will probably let it
slid. Depends on how bad the eyesore. If the vehicle is in a garage or not
viewable from the road, then it is ok. My neighborhood also has no street
parking and 3 acres lots, so vehicles are easier to hide here. My bus is
licensed, but has not moved in months. I have had no complaints, but I keep it
licensed to cover my butt. Getting it to run is not hard, just would require
hooking a few things back up.

If you have an HOA, start going to the meetings and see what is going on in
the community. That is what I did and that is how I found out the reason that
the new laws were being made.

As for the letters, go to the HOA if you have it. If not, go to the police and
make them aware of the issue. Then install a camera system in a window and
record people putting the notes on the bus :)
