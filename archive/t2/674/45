keep in mind that they are franchised and they are usually great sprayer. Do 
your own prep and find a good owner and your set. I would spend a little 
more on the paint then 350. we have farmed some pray work through the last 
owner of our local shop via customers request and have had ok luck. i dont 
know the new owner and have yet to have a request yet so i cant recommend it 
yet.
