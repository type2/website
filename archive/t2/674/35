Peter,

What a superb letter you wrote!! I will certainly
consider using something like that.. I'm curious to
see what they do next, but putting some kind of
friendly (disarming) message on the dash for them to
see would likely defuse the situation somewhat, and
hopefully persuade them to reveal their identity..

We all love our VW Busses and expend lots of effort to
keep 'em going.. I guess it's hard for other people to
understand that "relationship" and that we care about
our vehicles and have a meaningful bond with them than
other "appliances", even though they might sometimes
be "cosmetically challenged" when between paint jobs..

I've owned (or been the custodian of) this one since
1991 and have seen the lots of America in it, and had
three others beforehand, a 1972 camper that started it
all for me, two 1967's (one deluxe sunroof, one Westy)
and so I think this neighbour's hope that my VW bus
will just "go away" is a reflection of not being aware
of how much some of us (most of us?) really love our
vehicles, and that is pretty sad..

I think the best way might be to kill them with
kindness, or at least put them to sleep by being so
nice that they have to return the favour.. Here's
hoping.. 

:)

Thanks for all the kind words and suggestions,
