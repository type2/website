Is it an idea to to a neighbourhood survey to see how
many of your neighbours actually dislike your car? And
also why they dislike it?

May be it is one person who claims to be talking for
more people just to impress.

I think talking to your neighbours would be the first
priority. They are the ones causing/making this a
problem.

Well, I think you got a lot of hints and experiences
related to your neighbours problem now. I hope it will
all work out positive for you!

yours,

Vincent
