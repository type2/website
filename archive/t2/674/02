Subject: Gantt chart for engine rebuilding?

Has anyone on the list ever tried to Gantt chart their engine rebuild? 
(For those who don't recognize the term, a Gantt chart is a project 
management tool. A google search will turn up thousands of examples.)

For many people on the list, Gantt charting will seem like overkill. I 
just like the idea of sitting down once (over a couple of days) and 
making sure that I've taken everything into consideration so that I can 
"cookbook" the rebuild thereafter (that is, do the work without 
worrying about whether I'm missing something).
