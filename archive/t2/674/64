Subject: [T2]Blowby out dipstick update update

update here got pistons for christmas from salem inports (thanks mark)

phil honed them and yesterday i loaded up and went to buddahs garage so that we could put it all back together again and when starting to install the #1 piston there was a question if the #1 rod was bent or not and after looking more carefully at the others sure nuff the #1 rod was bent.

back to the drawing board arg*&^(&^(*&(^*&^

i have a case to pick up in asheville nc when the guy gets back into town from the holidays.

when i bring it back i am hoping that the rods will be the same or a match so that i can use those...

this has became a real headache.

just was a update and thanks for all those that posted a reply or have helped in any other way.

peace and love

chris
