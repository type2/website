I'm afraid they've got you by the short ones...If 
what they write is correct (and most large cities
have similar ordinances...) then your best course
of action is to figure a way to comply with the or-
dinances even to the extent of moving the Bus to
a friend's house every few days...Another thing,
a twenty spent on spray primer might be a good
idea...As long as the paint is an even color all a-
round it looks "better" than an uneven/worn top
coat...you can't really "win" this one and any at-
tempt to confront the letter writer will only lead
to more rancor...The local cops will probably go
by the letter of the law if they get any complaints
even to towing your Bus...They'd prefer that you
guys argue it out in court if it comes to that... ;-(
