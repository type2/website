Subject: Re: [T2] Anonymous threatening letters left on my bus...

I had this problem where I lived in Redondo Beach...
A neighbor would call the police and say that one of the cars we owned
wasn't moved in weeks (untrue) and they were abondoned.
The police wouldn't tow the vehicle... instead, they painted the tire with a
stripe that corresponded with one painted on the street. They'd return in 3
days to see if it moved. If it did, closed case. If not, it probably would
have been towed. We never had one towed. I wouldn't imagine the police
towing a perfectly legal automobile without some sort of warning. I think in
Missouri where I live now, they put a large orange sticker on the window and
if it disappears within a few days then they leave it alone... otherwise
it's towed within 2 weeks or so.
Hopefully you can come to an understanding with your neighbor(s) who are
complaining.
Good luck!
