No bushing on an automatic starter. It is a self-supporting starter. SR17X
That starter can be used on any 12V bug or bus, manual or auto trans, EXCEPT the 76-79 2.0L bus with the 228mm
flywheel.

Weird...... this starter question JUST came up less than a month ago......I even replied with pics of all the
different styles of starters. I believe Jamie replied with a pic of all 3 starters in a row! I guess we need
to add starters to the FART list......
