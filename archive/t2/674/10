I would contact the police.  Unsigned threatening letters could be a sign of
someone willing to go to extremes to satisfy their desires.  If the letters
were truly from the Home Owners or Neighborhood Association, it would be
signed by their representative; as well as probably mailed certified
directly to your residence.  If the letter was from a concerned group of
neighbors I would think it would be signed by those neighbors.

Hopefully you've saved the hand-written letters.  I would take all of the
letters down to the police and ask for their advice.

And watch your back and bus until you've brought this to a conclusion.
