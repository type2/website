(Of course, if
there are any satisfied Maaco customers here, you should say something now!)

Back in the 80's I had a chevy van painted at a Maaco in Springfield, Virginia and they did an excellent job-far from the Earl Schieb jobs I remember seeing back in the 70's, where the WHOLE car got painted, bumpers,turn signals,license plate,etc. My grandmother used to get her '66 Bug painted by Earl every 2 years, and they did little masking! Anyway, back to Maaco. It's my understanding they are franchised, so quality of work may vary greatly between locations. I checked out cars that this one had already painted, so I knew their work was first rate.    jeff
