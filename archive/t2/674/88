Subject: Westy Replacement foam

Hey folks, I just received my 79 Westy replacement
foam from www dot foamorders dot com.  This stuff is
great!  You can order it any thickness you want.  Most
sources I had found were only in 1" increments.  This
outfit will make it any thickness you want.  I ordered
enough replacement foam for the entire camper sleeping
area (3 different thicknesses.)  Greg
