Subject: Air Conditioned Bus

Hello,

I was wondering what everyone's experience has been
with air conditioning in a bus. I have looked at
rooftop or floor 12VDC conditioning units as a
possibility.

I have the aftermarket a/c unit (no compressor) that
came with my 73 bus. The hoses are in bad shape. I
live in Miami, A/C is essential down here, high heat,
high humidity.

any suggestions ? :)
