Hi Volks!

Wow, a hot topic!!

Thanks for all the replies and support, and even an
(extraordinarily kind) offer of winter parking, though
in the next state over..

I should clarify a few things that came up:

It's a public street with permit parking for this part
of the city, we have no private parking, so everyone
just parks where they can find a spot. I do typically
park on my own street, although sometimes there aren't
any spots and I'll park on a surrounding street, where
I can find a space..

So, there's no Owners Association, thankfully..

My bus is (even in my opinion) pretty ugly, I'll be
looking into getting it resprayed, I think over this
winter I should make an effort to get it into Maaco -
Or any other suggestions, or $$$ cost experiences??

It's true that my driver's window "vent quarter" was
broken (elsewhere in the city) and I have cut and
fitted a piece of plastic to cover it.. I'll have to
make an effort to get and fit a replacement, sooner
rather than later..

I agree with suggestions that I should keep all the
letters.. And perhaps I'll go to the police
"pre-emptively" and make them aware of the situation,
just in case things get out of hand..

I obviously need to drive my bus more, and moving it
around more will ease the tension a bit, I can
understand to a point, it's not really fair to "Hog" a
parking spot, though other people do it..

Unfortunately the bus just doesn't "blend-in" and will
not even if it has a fresh paint job, so I'll have to
play exactly by the rules, but I have as much right
parking in any permit spot as my neighbours do!!

Thanks, 
Dave Burton
