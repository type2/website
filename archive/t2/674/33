David,

A lot of the advice that you are getting suggests that if you're legal, 
you should "stick up for your rights." They have a point, I suppose, 
but what really seems to be at stake is that your anonymous letter 
writer has gotten the impression that you use the on-street parking for 
long-term storage of your bus.

The best solution would be to drive it every day. Good for the bus, 
good for you, too bad for the neighbor who doesn't like the way it 
looks.

An even better solution would be to use your bus to deliver hot meals 
to elderly people. Or help people without cars get to the grocery 
store. Or to pick up something that will only fit in a bus! Think how 
that would look in court if it ever came to that!

You can stick up for your rights if you want to. You have that right. 
But out-good-citizening this letter writer is better for the soul.
