Subject: Engine seized...

So it turns out that the engine did seize.  The guy I
brought it to said my best bet would be to get the
engine rebuilt for 3000 dollars!!!!!!!!  Would you
guys recommend looking on ebay or the samba for a new
engine for waaaaayyyyy cheaper?  If I wanted to save
money, that would be my best bet, but the guy said
that you never know what you're getting.  Thanks alot
for your help.
