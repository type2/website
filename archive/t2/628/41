Oy!

You guys remember that 76 w/ 79 cal engine I couldn't smog?

I sold it to some friends who spent 2K getting it through smog, referees, engine swap documentation, pretests, new AFM, cat, muffler, etc, and they finally smogged it.

I just bought it back last month thinking that it would be exempt on 1/1/05!  Shite!

So will my buddy have to start smogging his '66 bus w/ '72 bug engine?
