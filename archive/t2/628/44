That's why I highly recommend the European made AlKo shocks. They are a
very high quality, TUV-approved oil-filled shock - much heavier duty
than the Boges (which are now made in Mexico). They handle very well;
neither mushy nor bone-jarring. This is the ride that Volkswagen
intended the Bus to have. And at $39 each they're roughly the same price
as KYB.

I just got them back in after a two month backorder. It is hard to keep
them in stock, so get 'em while they're hot!
