Subject: RE: [T2] Clicking front wheel

Stevie,

I also have a clicking in my front end, on the right side.  It is rhythmic
as you describe and is mostly noticeable when I am backing up.
Coincidentally, my right front ball joint is starting to weep and so I am
going to replace both the right and left sides.  I will be sure to let you
know if the replacement of the balljoints corrects this issue.  Still
finding it hard to say ball joint without smirking.....
