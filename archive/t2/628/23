 Just look at Bus Depot's line of AVPs.

 When you post questions about engines on the list, it's always a good
 idea to say what year/size engine you're talking about.

This brings up an interesting point.  A lot of us on this list have buses
that do not have their original motors in them.  These differences can be
subtle or drastic depending on the taste, capability, and finance of the PO.

Admittedly, motorwork is, at this time, my weakest area of knowledge with my
bus(es).  I have one bus that I know for a fact is a 2.0 L type 4, because I
had that engine rebuilt several years back.  Also it looks exactly like
screen shots of other 2.0 L type 4 motors that other listees have provides
screenshots of.  However, my other bus also has a type 4 motor in it(not an
upright and similar in dimension), but it is different than the prior in
several details.  Soooo, I assume that it is one of the smaller displaced
type 4 varieties.  How can I tell which type 4 variety I have in this bus?
Looking over the motor I have in the past, I located several places with
numbers.  As I write this I am at work and my Bentley is at home.  The bus
with the mysterio motor in it is however sitting happily in it's cozy
parking spot outside as I compose this.  Can anybody give me a short/sweet
heads up on type 4 motors so that I can tell the differences (block numbers
etc..) between the various types of type 4 motors?  Both of my buses are of
the same year and are both fuel injected with original equipment (VW labels
and part numbers abound on both vehicles engine compartments/components).
Any Uber Mechanics/Bubble Gum and Shoe String types in the know, care to
fill me in on the criteria?  I would greatly appreciate knowing how to tell
Apples and Oranges apart.
