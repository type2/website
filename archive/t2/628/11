Subject: RE: [T2] bad fuel filter reactions

thanks daniel i got to take the fan off today and get the main rear seal out that is leaking and wait for a friend to send me another one should have it by the weekend....
hoping this solves the leaking oil problem...?
as far as the filter.... i didnt see any red flakes or such... it ws just old...
and yes i love to change the fuel filter along with oil change.. i figure there isnt any sense in not doing it same time... i adjust the valves each oil change also.... or at least check them for adjustment... try to check over all bolts/nuts for tightness also..
kinda like tune up time every oil change.... feel so much better going down the road when i know in my mind whats been done...
let you know laterz how this goes and if the rear main seal so happens to be the culprit....
peace
chris.

When you pull the old filter off inspect closely for little red things. 
Rust. That's rust in the gas tank. I like the train of thought of changing 
the filter every oil change/tune up. They are really cheap and I think it 
prevents junk from getting in your carb.

Take it for a test drive and let us know if it's running better with the new 
filter.
