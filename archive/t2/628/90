You're thinking about what I've been thinking, too :-)

Note, I live in California, so it has to *look* stock for the smog 
guys.  While I don't have solid details here, my general approach:

- Stroke would have sway over bore for me.  As I recall, increased 
stroke produces increased torque.  I drive on hills a lot, so I like 
torque.

- I would definitely use FI, so that probably means MegaSquirt.

- Probably SVDA + Pertronix.  I like how that runs on my stock engine, 
so why change, right?

- CDI ignition.

- 1.8 heads, for the larger valves.  Haven't done enough research on 
cams yet.  But, I really really like my hydraulic lifters, so...

- Yup, fully balanced.  Mmmm, smooth.

- Exhaust as stock as possible.  (See my California comment above :-)  
For me, this includes a cat.  This doesn't really bother me -- I'm 
looking for ways to reduce emissions and increase fuel economy even on 
my stock engine, because I consider that to be just a good thing to do.
