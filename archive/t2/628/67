Subject: [T2]Rear main seal (pics) ???

there is some pics i took while inspecting///taking the rear main seal out...
i am thinking that this is what has been leaking onto the rim of my fan and down in the belly of the tin under the fan....?
 
saturday it let loose on me on the way to help a friend that was broken down...
 
 there was a large spot of oil under my bus.....and a loss on the dipstick...
i got back home and cleaned the engine really well and degreased did all sorts of checkups and such.... valves,filters,adjusted carbs and such.... pulled off drove round block couple fo times and pulled into the carport and got a great big leak coming off bottom of belly under fan houseing...
 
to me in the pics it looks as if this is the verdict,,>? the way it is running down the split in the case... and from the before stains if you look at the pics that i took before removing the seal....
please tell me your thoughts..
i have another buddy that is sending me another seal and ring but what about the thing there that i have my finger on in the pic ,it was broken like that when i pulled it off like it is dried up and cracked..????
the ring was hanging loosely on the camshaft rod sticking out.... not in the fat ring itself ... am i wrong or doesnt that little black o ring go inside that big fat ring..?
peace
chris
