Subject: Re: [T2] SOLID LIFTER COMPATIBLE?

I think the 78 is a square port head and will not work
with the round port exhaust heater boxes, as long as
you leave the lifters in the engine(solid or hyd and
make sure to have the right length pushrods for the
lifters you are using, any head will work, if it fits
the cylinders. Phil
