the 009 will work just fine. You have an upright engine so the advance
curve (while not load sensing like the vacuum advance ones) will be
about right. You shouldn't have to worry about burning up the engine
with it, at least. That aside I have one of ACN's SVDAs and love it.
They push features like improved gas mileage and cooler running
engine. I keep track of my gas and temps. I did not see really any
change in fuel economy, but a tremendous change in drivability and
engine temp. while the 009 will get you there having a vacuum advance
distributor is a great investment.

The big thing with engines in early baywindow buses is the ability to
mount the mustache bar to the engine. This supports the rear of the
engine and should be attached. I don't know if the AN is a universal
case, but if so the bar should be attached to provide support. Other
than that anything goes :)

congrats on getting it all back together, a task not to be taken
lightly :)
