When I had a '71 Westy I was able to fit several sheets in diagonally.

 Full sheets of plywood fit nicely through the rear hatch.

 I went to Home Despot to get the carpet and plywood for the floor
 today on the way home from work. I also grabbed some pressboard to
 make a new driver's side door panel.

 It didn't occur to me until I was pushing the wobbly cart out to the
 bus that the stuff might fit through the rear hatch. Did, with 1/2" to
 spare on either side. heh

 I'll miss that feature when I put the new cabinets in. Sigh.
