Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Building door panels

One last thing to take note of...

When cutting the panels pay extra attention to the door latch hole. I didn't 
cut the passenger side perfect and the plastic trim piece would fall out. 
This trim piece is a press fit situation so it isn't perfect you will have 
the same problem. Probably better to cut the hole small and then enlarge it 
a little at a time. Test to see if the trim piece will fit before finishing 
your panel. Don't forget the cloth (if you use cloth) will make the hole 
smaller too so accomodate for that.

Also if anyone is interested I used black metal or wood screws with matching 
black washers to hold the panels to the door. The original holes are larger, 
to accomodate the clips and you would need big, ugly screws to use the 
original holes. Drill some pilot holes first so you don't split the panel. 
And if you cover the panel with cloth go slow with a manual 
screwdriver....if you use a drill or cordless screwdriver the cloth will 
catch and rip off or wrap around the drill and tear. Guess how I know 
this!!!

Good luck,
