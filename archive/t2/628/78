Subject: starter problems

Greetings!

I'm having some trouble with my 1979 starter.  I'm hoping some one out there 
has had the same problem (and fixed it, of ocourse).  With the starter 
mounted in the bell housing and a good battery attached to the solenoid, the 
gear pops out nicely but the armature does not spin.  There doesn't seem to 
be any sloppiness in the armature alignment.  Any suggestions?

Also, if this has been covered before and is at rest somewhere in the 
archives, please point me to the right location if you can.

Regards,
Mike
