Make sure that the bus is OUT OF GEAR with E-brake ON!
 Crawl under and look at the starter. Take a small
piece of wire (with a little alligator clip on an end
if you have one)  touch one end of the jumper wire to
the small push-on connector and the other to the big
screw terminal where the battery cable attaches to the
starter solenoid, if you hear a "click" then your
solenoid is good. Now take the jumper wire and touch
one end to the big screw terminal where the battery
cable attaches to the solenoid and touch the other end
of the wire to the other big screw terminal closer to
the starter motor, the starter motor should spin
freely but not engage the engine. If the starter motor
doesn't spin when you do this, then you have a bad
starter...
