Subject: update advice please FI? cyl 3 bad?

Today the bus wouldn't start. sealed that broken cranckcase breather hose up 
better, turned the dist counter clockwise and it started.  But wouldn't idle 
at 7.5. (points at 46.5)  Turned the idle screw counter clockwise a little, 
turned the dist clockwise a little, screw counterclockwise, dist clockwise 
... until I got the timing to 7.5.  But couldn't get it to idle at 925 rpm 
(auto tranny).  would idle around 1150-1250.  Very rough when put in drive 
or neutral.  drove about 75 ft. stopped, put it in park, it bucked a bunch 
and was going to die but I shut it off first.
Sprayed starting fluid around all the vacuum connections, but no noticable 
change in rpm (even around crankcase breather hose).
Last night I took a pic with my valve cover off of 3 and 4.  I will post a 
link when I figure out how.  A lot of dark crud especially around 3.  Then 
when I shut it off i could watch oil drip heavily/stream out of the rocker 
arm shaft between the #3 exhaust and intake valve.  I'm afraid I may have 
done some damage to this cylinder by the way I had to drive it home the 
other day.  I was already suspicious of a noise I was hearing. Wasn't sure 
if it was an exhaust leak or if the valves need to be bleed (not sure if 
this is the correct terminology).  Now it sounds worse.  I've got access to 
a parts engine from a 78.  What kind of parts would I need to buy new and 
what special tools would I need to remove/replace the cylinder head or some 
of its components.  I'm going to buy a compression gauge in a couple days 
when I get paid.
If anybody is nearby and wants to pitch in I don't have much $ but I'll make 
sure you have a good time. We might be able to work something out in parts, 
or paint work, or reiki or something. figured I'd throw it out there.
Thanks again,
Kyle
