Subject: Re: [T2] thoughts on converting FI to carb

I posted the same a couple months ago.  I had a friend who kept telling me
'you gotta ditch that FI system and get dual carbs', claiming I'd get all
kinds of benefit.  At the time my FI wasn't up to par, but I've got it
dialed now and you should see the size of my toolbox.  Its tiny. Bus runs
sweet as long as I'm not headed through a torrential downpour (haven't
dropped the fuel tank yet for those following my saga).  Incidentally by bud
still harshes my FI, (not sure what his problem is, but he is a heckuva
porsche/VW mechanic).  If you have a problem with your FI it probably isn't
too big of a deal and folks here can help you diagnose no sweat. Have fun,
Nik
