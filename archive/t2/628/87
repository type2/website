Subject: If yuo were going to build a 2.0...

It's Friday so let's have some fun... 

If you were going to build a 2.0 out of used parts (refurbished parts)... What parts combo would you build. first, this imaginary engine would not be running the stock fuel injection. It would either be MegaSquirt or Dellorto DRLA carbs. 

Engine has to have heat and be an all weather engine - not just a southern California engine.

I'm thinking 2.0 96mm pistons and jugs, 1800cc heads (biggest valves I think), dual quiet pack, Vangon electronic ignition, maybe Ray Sedman's Safeguard system, MegaSquirt through TMI injection throttle bodies. Multiport injection. Solid lifters on a ??? cam. BAS linkage, vacuum advance distributor. 1700 lb pressure plate, stock clutch. Fully balanced everything. 

Reckon it could make 90-100 HP with reasonable torque?

Would 94mm vs 96mm make that much difference?  

Dream options: 914 heads, or 911 SOHC heads modified... 

Opinions? 

Technically this dream engine would go in my Beetle versus my Bus.
