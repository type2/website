Subject: RE: [T2] Building door panels

Ron,
You rule.  Your info on your unfinished panels came at a very appropriate
time.  I have myself cut my own panels but there are a few areas that can be
problematic for the do it yourselfer in my area anyway.  Home Depot is the
local supplier for panel material in my immediate area.  The pressed board
can be had there but not in all of the sizes that are needed in order to put
in all of your own panelwork.  Sure, driver and passenger door panels can be
made by cutting from a sheet, using your old panel as a template, but I have
been having a hell of a time finding a sheet at Home Depot in the same
pressed board material that will fit the length of the sliding door or the
opposing wall in the cargo area.  I have found that their largest sheets are
about 3/4 of an inch short of providing a good mate.  You will probably see
an order from me for some of my more problematic panels in the near future.
I don't care if I do all of the work myself, I just want to get it done
correctly, consistantly, and in the most efficient manner, and if that means
that I outsource some of my panels from your excellant company than so be it
and more power to me.
Thanks for chiming in with the link.
