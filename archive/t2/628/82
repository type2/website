Subject: '80 vanagon speedo cable

List,

I have a '80 aircooled vanagon 7 passenger w/ a bad speedometer, screw style
connecton.
I was given a good later model speedometer w/ the clip style connection.
Can anyone tell me if the replacement cable 251 957 803e which is the longer
one piece
cable that bypasses the egr box is a clip style or screw style?  TIA
