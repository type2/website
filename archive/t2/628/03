Subject: keeping FI, switched 79 air sensor with 78, still runs funny

Thanks everone who has responded about my FI/carb question.
I've decided to keep the FI system.  It seemed to run great before some 
mechanic messed with the spring inside theair flow sensor.  I have the 
bently, Haynes, and Muir, and have read the FI section in each.  I have a 
basic understanding.
I was just frustrated after stalling at every light today.  When I would 
come to a stop I would start to buck and it the idle would sound real low.  
Then it would either die out or it would die when I tried to give it gas.  
It would start again and idle, but die when I put it in drive or when I gave 
it gas if not.  Usually by adjusting the point gap, timing, idle, or some 
combo of this I would be able to get it going again.  and as long as I was 
moving it seemed to run ok, but hot.  If I put it in neutral it wouldn't do 
this, but would die a lot when I put it back in drive, unless I started 
giving it gas in neutral and then through it in drive while still giving it 
gas. Then it would lurch forward and then take off.
SO, when I got home I adjusted the valves (is there a trick to finding 
exactly 180 from the timing mark?), replaced all the smaller vacuum hoses, 
and put clamps on all the bigger ones. Then I pulled the air flow sensor 
(with the air filter and all.) for some reason I got the idea to blow and 
suck through where the small vacuum hose from the dist connects to the 
filter.  I could blow right through it on the one that was on there. When I 
tried it on the 78 one I could definitely tell that there was a diaphram in 
there that must have been broken on the other one.  So I replaced the 79 
assembly w/ the 78.  reset the point gap (45.6 or so) and timing (7.5 btdc) 
and started it up.  Idled smoother than before, but still rough.  Still died 
when I gave it gas, but it would pull itself forward a few inches before 
dying (before it would just die as soon as I gave it gas.) Since it is after 
midnight here I'm giving it a rest til tomorrow.  I almost forgot to mention 
that the intake boot to crankcase breather hose (the big braided one that is 
21 or 22mm in diameter) broke 2 days ago.  I have called almost every parts 
store and a bunch of mechanics in the area and none of them have fuel hose 
that big.  So, at the recomendation of one of them I siliconed it and then 
taped it up real well (just until I can find someplace to buy the proper 
size hose.).  It seems tight everywhere, but I could see it being a problem. 
  Hope I remembered everything.
Thanks for taking the time to read through all this,
Kyle
