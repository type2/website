Hi Tanner,

The early westy has the hole for a sunroof, but none of the hardware to 
go with it. Even if  do you source out the tracks, cables, clips, seals 
and slider, you still need the drains, and retrofitting those into a 
non-sunroof bus would be a major hassle.

Chris's link makes a lot more sense, but I've never seen a firsthand 
report from an owner of that product so I can't recommend it firsthand.

Happy trails,
