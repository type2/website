Hey Snoopy,

If you decide to go with the KYB shocks, a lot of people use the Gas-Adjusts 
on the rear and the KYB GR-2 on the front. I actually used the Gas-Adjusts 
front and rear and love them. A big improvement!!!

The Gas-Adjusts are a stiffer shock, but I like them on the front. Of course 
I don't know what the bus would feel like with the GR-2's but I am happy.

Good luck,
