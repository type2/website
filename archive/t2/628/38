the 009 will work but combined with a 34pict3 is even worse.

the mallory or the aircooled.net svda should be better choices.
you should be able to find a rebuilt orig type though.
one source is http://www.philbingroup.com/rebuilt/distributors.htm
there have been others mentioned which a search through the archives might
uncover.
also dont forget swap meets or e&ay.

no opinion on the positioner (no experience) but I am not a fan of 34pict3
carbs. there are new 30/31 and 34pict3 carbs available just fyi.

the AM is a 1600 replacement case. I assume it has the rear mounting
bosses and it should be fine.

good luck.
