Thanks!

I looked at the 1/8" sheets of wood they had, but that stuff just
appeared too brittle. The pressboard is what the factory used (or
similar) and I can see why. I'm not worried about the interior panels,
but the front doors get slammed closed a lot. The brittle wood seems
to me that it would crack and split in a short time.

There's a tool called a Roto-Zip that would probably do a better job
than my $3 cutter bit. But that costs more than $3. ;)
