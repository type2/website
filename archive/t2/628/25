Seann,

Short and sweet....www.type2.com and look under identification in the 
library.

Be sure and use the "real" engine number, not the one on the fan housing.

Unfortunately, you may have an 1800 "coded" engine that might actually 
have a whole different set of heads and other later model items on it....

In my opinion this is one of the biggest problems a lot of us face because 
who knows what the PO did before you got it....and at that point, the pics 
in Bentley for what you think is your year front wheels/brakes bears no 
relationship to what you really have.

Cheers, dave
