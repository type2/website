Subject: replacing pilot bearing

Hi,
I'm going to be replacing the pilot bearing in a 78 westy.  I've never 
worked on a manual tranny before.
I've looked in Bently, Muir, and Haynes as well as the library and archive 
and it is hardly mentioned.
Is anyone familiar with this procedure?
Thanks
Kyle
