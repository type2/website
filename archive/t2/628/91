find yourself a 1500S motor, these are like hens teeth but the one I had
in "stock" configuration tested at 96hp.

then to dream I would swap out the twin carbs for some form of FI,
probably megasquirt. and a MSD ignition.

that ought to be enough to make your beetle fly...  it got my Avenger
(fibrefab) up to 112mph before I chickened out, it was still willing to go
more...
