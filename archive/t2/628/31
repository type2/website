I had to remove my front gas-a-justs; the roads here aren't perfectly smooth
and I got tiring or feeling every bump.

I recently rode in an original 72 Westy with original shocks that are still
working and the ride was extremely pleasant. After a couple of years driving
with the gas filled shocks I feel the oil filled ones are more appropriate
for a bus.

The real problem is that the selection of shocks is extremely limited.
