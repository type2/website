Subject: Building door panels

Great shots of your work.  I'm also working on the panels in my BUS.  I
have gone the same route that you have with the 1/4" board.  Same cost
at home depot but what I got was not pressboard.  I have some pictures
of my first attempts at it on my on this page of my site ---

I think I'll look into the rotary cutter bit as I have been doing every
cut with my jigsaw.

Thanks for the great Idea and have fun with your project.
