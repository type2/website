$2K? Did they do none of the work themselves? I trade this and that to gather some spare parts. I've gotten a whole second EFI systems and 1 ECM for the price of a single mount Weber. Tradee thought he was getting the best solution in the world. I warned him over and over... 

My point is that the old L-Jetronics are not that complicated. Bentley manual, VOM, and psi gauge for the fuel....

$2K? OUCH! <grin!>

Feeling bad for you California folks...
