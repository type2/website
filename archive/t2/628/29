Subject: Clicking front wheel

Well, I've done some hunting and I've seen a number of people posting 
about a clicking from their front wheel/wheels but never found a reply 
to their messages. So, I will add my query to the void.

I'm planning on putting my new whiteline swaybars and GasAdjusts on my 
73 this week, and while I am down there I would like to get rid of this 
clicking.

Initially it seems to only be there when I was turning right, but now 
it seems to be there all the time, it seems to be coming from my 
driverside front wheel and its quite rhythmic, in time with my speed. I 
cant feel and play and from a poke around I havent been able to see 
anything that is lose or obstructing the wheel. Its quite a clear 
click.

Any idea what might cause this ? On a similar note my signals have 
never canceled on their own, could this be related ?

Thanks for your thoughts.
Steve
