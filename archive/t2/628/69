Seann,

There's going to be a lot of discussion in answer to your question 
because, as you correctly observed, what's in your bus may or may not 
be the original engine.

Not all of the discussion is going to be relevant to what you want to 
do, and there is always the danger of inciting a three-day thread on 
solid vs. hydraulic lifters. So why don't you tell us exactly what you 
want to do -- that is, how the information about the engine will be 
useful to you.
