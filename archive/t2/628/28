yes, Mark does recall correctly. The only way to actually confirm what
you have is by visual inspection. The Wilson book [1] has an excellent
section on identification of most major parts for VW and some Porsche
engines. Basically it's never as easy as getting a number and looking
it up. While it might be correct a lot of the time, you don't want to
make decisions about engines based on guesswork (like mechanical vs
hydraulic lifters).

[1] here is a link to the book for reference if you know know WTF we
are taling about.
