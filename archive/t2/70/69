Volks,
I am going thru the electrical system on my SC, and found the wiper motor=
 only works on low.  I spoke with the PO..(great guy) and he told me one =
time the wipers were stuck to the glass in a freeze and that high speed h=
as not worked since.  I would like to try to repair myself, so any repair=
 ideas?

I looked at the Bentley, but not a lot of help for this situation.
