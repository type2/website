Well, all you want is to expand something, and water expands very well if
you have the energy to convert liquid to vapor.  The energy needed will
come from the burning fuel, cooling the combustion and preventing
preignition.

This works fine as long as you don't care how much energy you use, which
is true in race conditions.
