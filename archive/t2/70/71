Sounds like this guy's been getting to much CO sucked into the
interior of the vehicle, probably due to the tailpipe arrangement you
described (not being in the slip-stream...)

Not a bad deal for a 78 Westy if it's in good shape rust-wise, but I'd
have to tell him to keep his "fuel conversion" doo-hicky.
