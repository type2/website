Subject: Turn Signal Gremlins

Well,

Spent the morning working on the turn signals for the 71 Westy.  I'm 
getting lights, but not exactly where I want them.  : )

I turn the ignition.  The turn signal dash lights come on.

I pull the headlights switch.  The headlights and the running lights come 
on.  This is fine!

I flip the turn signal switch for a right turn and a left turn.  Nothing.

Urgh!!

Any help would be greatly appreciated!!
Joel
