Subject: Re: [T2] Marvel Mystery Oil (was oil additive advise)

I have a very accurate sense of smell, and am sure I noticed that MMO
smells just like the oil used for lubing air tools (jack oil?) and they
smell exactly alike, with the same reddish color!  I'm sure kerosene is
in there......maybe some xylene, as that is a common solvent for cutting
contamination.  As an ex biologist/histologist, I shudder at the
tolulene, benzene, xylene, and acetone I've handled, much of it
carcinogenic.
