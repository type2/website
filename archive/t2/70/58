     The one I bought was square and after tearing I could see some nylon 
reinforcement.  I'll check my Flaps tomorrow as to the manufacture, so folks 
cannot make the same mistake.  If I remember right mine cost about $11.  But 
being the only available part, I ran it and am still running it (but keeping 
an eye on it). Hopping my next parts bus has a nice stocker.
