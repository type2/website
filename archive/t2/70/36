In Seattle, try Autovice or Bow Wow for a new flasher. Don't use generic
FLAPS flashers on VW. They either don't fit and must be jurry rigged or
they are junk right out of the box (typical of Walker brand). Could also be
the turn switch, although if neigher L or R is working, it suggestes a
burned up flasher relay. Hint: do the emergency flasher lights work??? If
not, flasher is the prob. Get a Hella, Bosch or VW item for proper function.
