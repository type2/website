Congrads, you bought a good first car.

Rust is the biggest problem, make sure you check the
font axle for rust, use a screw driver and poke
around.

Do you mean electrical wires?

If you do mean wires, then as someone pointed out
earlier, its not that hard, just time consuming. 
Being methodical and replacing one wire at a time
using a wiring diagram (color)is the way I would
approach the job.

I think this is the best place for the engine to be if
you plan on keeping this transporter for a while.  You
can clean the engine of all grease, paint your engine
tin, inspect it for any problems.  This is also a good
time to replace ALL the fuel lines.  The biggest
safety concern with buses is old fuel lines breaking
and causing a fire.  With the engine out it is much
easier to replace the lines.  It is also a good time
to remove the old fuel filter.  First allow the
contents of the tank to drain through the fuel filter
into a suitable container (remember this is a fire
hazard, no smoking :) After the tank is drained, cut
the fuel filter open with a hack saw and inspect the
filter.  If it has a lot of rust particles then now is
the time to remove the gas tank and have it cleaned
and resealed.  If there is no rust in the filter,
smile a big smile and replace the fuel line.  


Now remember that I am a beginner in vw-busses

Ah but you have found a good Internet resources, first
is the Type2.com and all the info in the library. 
Spend a night or two reading articles about engine
removal and replacement, gas line replacement,
electrical works, and CV replacement.

The CVs are constant velocity joints which alow the
axle coming from the engine/trany to move with the up
down motion of the rear wheels.  These joints get worn
over time and often need to be replaced, again the
engine out is the time to do this.  You will also need
to be familiar with how to re-attach them when you put
your engine back in.  Don't worry its pretty easy and
you get to look like a grease monkey when you come
back inside (for those of us who are forced into a
suit and tie all week, looking like a grease monkey on
the weekends is the most fun part of the week)

Of course your not a fool,(unless you need this bus
running by Monday or you loose your job) VWs are fun
and I believe that everyone should learn about engines
by buying motorcycles, snowmobiles or VWs that are
non-functioning.  It will give you a real sense of
accomplishment to see your first sunset through a bay
window while traveling westbound in the slow lane.

Keep asking questions and myself and many more on this
list with brighter minds than me will always be glad
to help.  And I promise a more concise answer next
time.

Best of luck and Happy Holidays,
