Hello all    Have you ever notice how a car runs better when it's raining. 
The water injection  will increase the mileage and power of an engine. It is 
very easy to do also just make a hooka pipe and put a air stone from an fish 
tank on the bottom intake pipe. this causes the water to vaporize plug this 
to the bottom of the intake,using a valve to regulate the flow. The big 
problem is upkeep putting water in the hooka tank.  Mark Dearing  Salem
