Subject: ford fuel pump

I installed my $20. ford fuel pump from salvage yard tonight on my
'78.....whoooo  who.....   it runs!!!!!...first time i herd it run since
i bought the bus.........motor rattles like hell and smoked at first but
cleared up....(still rattles)I think maybe lifters not pumped up
yet........
