any thing can be heat sensitive. but not likely

I one time some years ago had a similar problem it drove me nuts for a
long time, it finally turned out to be a pinhole in the vacumm side of the
fuel line, as it gets warmer it got soft and started sucking air and
stalled out, later it gets cool and doesn't leak.

another thing that was not heat sensitive but might have some
affect. there are a lot of plugs and connectors, one of them looked fine
on the outside, but one of the contacts came loose and was pushed back
into the plug and wasn't making good contact.

Good luck
Bob
