Subject: RE: [T2] alternator bracket / steering coupler


I've done the steering coupler with the box in, no fun, but it can be done.
Need to unbolt the steering column base from the floor. If I remember
correctly, getting the arm off the steering box wasn't happening and I
couldn't remove the steering box until that happened. Do I remember
correctly? In any case to remove the steering box you need to remove half
the bolts on the coupler.
