I'm at this stage of my Westy restore and you can remove the steering 
column easily and do all the work from the top.

Unbolt the column from the dash and from under the windshield (remove the 
instruments it's easy to see - one 10MM bolt). Unplug the wiring from the 
column. Pull up the trim at the bottom of the column and unbolt the 
coupler. Discard and replace (mine was a cracked mess).

You might be able to do this job without removing the column - I did not 
try this route.
