Folks,

I have one of these from one of the more popular triple discount
suppliers on the list.  It is sitting in my hand as I write.

It is labeled 211-415-417(made in Mexico).  It is square with metal
bushings where the bolts go thru.  It appears to be made in two parts as
there is the remnant of a seam between the top and bottom.  It has a hole
in the middle about 3/4" in diameter

It is *very* stiff and non-bendable.  My guess is that it does have some
sort of metallic reinforcement in the middle.

It is labeled "LEGAR" in the rubber part.

It appears to me to probably be fairly dependable considering that it will
be stressed the logitudinal direction.

Cheers ,dave
