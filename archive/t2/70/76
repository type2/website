If you are a Collier brother and haven't thrown out your J.C. Whitney catalogs
in decades, you could look up the ads for these devices. Even then the J.C.
system wasn't much more than a bottle and a hot air furnace humidifier noz-
zle tapped into the intake manifold...At the other end of the spectrum, I 
think
there are special water injection systems used on turbo/super charged en-
gines but they're integral to the specific engine and probably a bit more 
than 
a backyard tinkerer would care to undertake...
