Subject: Steering Coupler

I just found out I can get a new coupler for my 70 Bus from VW for $56
Canadian, so I ordered it without knowing the condition of mine on my stored
bus. If the aftermarket ones aren't as good, might as well get a good one
while they are available. It's a pretty important safety item.
