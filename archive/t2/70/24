     I recently had to replace my steering coupler again after having 
replaced it a little under a year ago.   Seems that the reproduction couplers 
have very little reinforcing in them.  Reinforcing being that cord stuff.  I 
had notice a little slop in my steering and was amazed find that coupler had 
started to tear!  I tend to drive my bus pretty hard, I corner hard enough to 
lift a wheel off the ground,  so I don't really need steering problems.  Come 
to think of it, nobody does!!
     So please double check those new couplers every now and then......BTW my 
FLAPS gave me a replacement, free of charge, and has passed the warning to 
there customers.
                                                                              
       Peace,
