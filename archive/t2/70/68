Subject: Westy %&*^&!!!! rollerbearing on my bottom front hinge!


The roller bearing that takes all the weight of my door (the vertical
bearing) at the leading edge of the door decided to seperate into various
parts and that is why my door fell off!!! I opened it today to look, and the
big outside piece is there, but the inner bits that I'm assuming held it on
are gone to who knows where!!! Anyone got a spare one of these laying about
that is in good shape? My California Imports Catalogue lists the same
bearing as from 68 to 79 so they must be the same piece for all bays. It
looks like they must be made of pure platinum as the new price is bloody
ridiculous.
Thanks,
Courtney (with no side door :-( right now)
