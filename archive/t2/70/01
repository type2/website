Jamie,

We weld and redrill used brackets. The problem with these is that the bolts
get loose and rattle the thing to death. Check out your fan housing also,
the mounting bolts also get wasted. There are two brackets and the upper
bracket changes. Which one do you need and what year is your bus? The
coupler is easily accessed from inside the cab by removing the trim plate on
the steering column. Just need a 13mm socket and a box end wrench. We also
sell these new.

Bent alternator bracket, anyone know source for one new?  Is it possible
to replace the coupler without removing the steering box?
thanks in advance
