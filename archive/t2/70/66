Hi,

Here was my symptom on a 78 Westy.

1. Would run OK cold (the colder, the better - ran fantastic when it was 
28 degrees outside).
2. Would run like crap hot (could barely get out of first). I didn't 
drive it that summer.
3. Would idle well if the mixture was rich, would die easily if lean. 
(Got it down a hill once and couldn't get it back - had it towed.)
4. If the mixture was rich, got no power between idle and full out 
acceleration. (Didn't get speeding tickets, but got a couple of crazy 
stares - slow lane, fast lane, slow lane, fast lane...)

This is how I proceeded in troubleshooting:

1. Checked spark and timing (replaced points, plugs, rotor, wires, etc.).
2. Replaced fuel filter, fuel lines, then cleaned injectors (made sure I 
got good fog, etc.)
3. Replaced fuel pump. (My wallet was getting empty at this point, about 
to sell the bus.)

Got an AFM from Bus Depot which did the trick. I should have done that 
first, but the price scared me off. My wallet thus emptied, I sold the 
bus.
