I found the MSDS for Marvel Mystery Oil. MMO contains:

* at least 35 percent "heavy solvent-refined mineral oil"
* at least 35 percent "heavy solvent-dewaxed mineral oil"
* and no more than 30 percent Stoddard Solvent (mineral spirits)

That's all they listed. Motor oil with parts cleaner in it. Helluva concept,
and one that works extremely well.
