Rob and List,
   I don't know about alcohol and peroxide, but I do know that a bus can be
converted to run on LPG.  In 1980 I worked for KLM airlines in Holland and
they had a fleet of buses that ran on LPG.  They also had some other
interesting modifications like buses with the body cut off the chassis,
buses with hotwater heat that was heated by a special tailpipe, and other
"special" application buses.
   Happy holiday (whichever ones you might celebrate) and happy new year to
you all.
