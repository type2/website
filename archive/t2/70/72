Subject: Is this to hard for a beginner?

Hi

I have just become a lucky owner of my first car, a volkswagen transporter 
73.
The car is in very good condition, well etleast the body of the car.
I have searched the car all over and I can´t find any signs of rust and all 
of the doors works good.
Now over to the not so good things about my bus:

First of all is the cables, they are old(very old) and the are just a mess. 
And some of them are not working as well, so I guess I have to replace all 
the cables to new ones and maybe some other electrical stuff. The old owner 
has started the job but got stuck so he just left it in a complete mess.
And now I wonder how hard it is to replace all the cables for a beginner, 
how much it costs and if you need a lot of speciall tools for the job?

The second thing is the engine, the problem there is that it´s out of the 
car and I have to get the engine home to my place and then install it in the 
car. Now remember that I am a beginner in vw-busses and I have no ideá of 
how I should do to get the engine back into the car.
There must be some homepages on the internett on this issue but a haven´t 
fund any.

So what do you think? Am I just a complete fool that takes a car home that 
doesn´t even work or are these problems easy to fix even for a beginner?
Maybe I also should tell that I bought the bus from a old friend so I know 
that the engine works and that the buss is ok (or atleast was?)

So now I am in a situation where I need all(and I mean all) the information 
I can get.
I hope you all understand my questions and I am sorry for my poor englich.

Thanks!!

//Johan Svanborg
