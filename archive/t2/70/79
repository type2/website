Water injection is used to curb detonation in high-compression race
engines.  Unlimited racing aircraft run high levels of supercharger boost
and use nearly equal quantities of fuel and water/alcohol mixture.
Usually the fuel is carried in one wing and the water is carried in the
other.  The injection quantity and method is a deep dark racing secret,
along with the actual amount of boost they are running.

For street use, these systems have been toyed with, but usually the
logistics of keeping the water tank filled is more bother than it is
worth.
