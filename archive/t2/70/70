Subject: alternate fuels

I just have a question, not a problem.

For those who don't want to read the story:
Is it common or even possible to convert a VW engine to run on alternate
fuels? A fellow I met yesterday claims his bus (which he wants to sell) runs
on water, alchohol and peroxide!!


The story:

I met a VERY interesting guy yesterday driving a 78 Westy. I pulled up
behind him and stopped him becuase he was driving a bus. Right away I could
tell he was weird, but won't go into that. He gave me his number and I gave
him mine. He didn't really listen to me when we were talking and he was
going off on tangents about Christmas and not making a lot of sense. Anyway
he was saying he wanted to sell his bus so he could get another electric
vehicle becuase the economy was going to crash and martial law would be
inforced and a lot of other stuff.   :)

Well he just called me and wanted to know if I wanted to buy his bus. It
didn't look that great and I don't have the cash, but it is a 78 Westy with
the brown plaid and stove, etc. BUT he told me he had a conversion on the
bus that was "water injected" and that it ran on alchohol and peroxide. He
wants $2000 for the bus and another $400 for the fuel conversion. It looked
like a 1600 motor to me judging by the tailpipes. Is this guy off his
rocker?

Hope this is enough bus content and delete the story if you reply to the
list.
