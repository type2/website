The cables aren't that hard. It's basically a matter of pushing them throug=
h
and hooking up the ends. You should grease them and one guy (Bob Hoover)
recommends painting them, but cables are easy.

The engine's easy too. Get a book called "How to Keep your Volkswagen Alive=
"
by John Muir and turn to the engine overhaul chapter--there you will learn
how to put the engine back in. You will need a very big floor jack, because
that's what you use to get the engine in--aircooled VW engines go in from
the bottom and not the top like you do with watercooled cars.
