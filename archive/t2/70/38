Michael,

Friday content on....uhhh what day is? this?

I shudder at the carcinogenic part too, except I have stayed at
a very nice hotel in California with this notice posted everywhere.

I think this is pretty close to what it said.

"Certain cleansers(chemicals) used for cleaning(at this hotel)
are known to the state of California to cause cancer."

Sunshine causes cancer, steak causes cancer.

I intend to *live* until I die<grin>.

Cheers, dave
