DANG! Why didn't someone tell me about this with the clips when I managed to 
lose half of them along with plenty of skin? :-)

 When you reassemble, you can put these clips back on the screws loosely, 
turn them to face the appropriate direction, and just pop the panel back in 
position with a pop of the heel of your fist over each screw. You'll hear 
the clips seat. Then tighten the screws the rest of the way. This is a lot 
easier than trying to reach under and hold each clip as your partner screws 
into them! It's apparently how the original assembly was done!
