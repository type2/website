Georges;
I would try and put it back to original design for the fuses.
As for the leaks, I had the same problem on my van with a leaking front 
windshield which is VERY common on these because the seal dries out over the 
years (your van is 31 years old) and the leaks start, which cause water 
damage as you found out to the fuses and wiring, but also the metal under 
the edge of the windshield. Here is what I did to fix mine until I can get 
under it and do the proper bodywork around the window.
I went to the local automotive shop and bought a tube of "PERMATEX flowable 
Silicone Windshield & Glass Sealer" Part no. 65AR. Here is a source for it;

It has worked great for me, and you don't see it because it tends to flow in 
under the seal where it needs to be. Before I did it, I took a popsicle 
stick and pried it under the edge to clean out the accumulated pine needles, 
dirt, and moss that grew there for 30 years. Don't overdo it though; I just 
went under about a 1/4 inch with the stick. Realize that this is a temporary 
measure though, until you can get it done right, which in my case requires 
removal of the window and sheetmetal bodywork under the bottom of it.
HTH,
Courtney
