Dave,

Close but no cigar.

I got the SD508 compressor temporarily mounted. The problem is
that the A/C belt just touches the top of the fan housing.

I'm afraid if I modify the mounting plate to lower the compressor
so the belt clears the fan housing it might end up being to close
to the mustache bar on the bottom side of the belt.

If the pulley on my compressor was a 1/2 inch less in diameter,
everything would be perfect.

Did you modify the diameter of the pulley on your compressor?

Steve

mount advice


Steve,

Yes, I have done it.  Rough pics here.

There are two different types of compressor mounts and the one that I had 
worked for this after I changed the way the hoses went on the compressor 
and had to modify the pulley a little bit.

Seems like I modified the mount a little bit also.  You can do it if you 
are serious abou it!

It's all in the archives.

Cheers ,dave
