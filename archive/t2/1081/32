Thanks for all the replies, guys. They've been helpful.

I am going to take a look at the wiring situation in the engine compartment
and up under the dash tonight.
My mech thinks there's a 20% chance that the wiring is at fault, but he's
not sure. Apparently, swapping out the alternator is difficult because you
have to pull it out from underneath?

I wish I had more time, I think this would make a fun project to do myself.
