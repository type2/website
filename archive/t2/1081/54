So, some of the mystery has been solved.
It is a wiring issue under the dash, I'm almost certain of it.

Someone emailed me directly and asked if it was only when it rains. This got
me thinking that a seal at the front might be letting water in. Lo and
behold, when I went under the dash I found some water damage and one of the
fuses was actually slightly damp! I took them all out, cleaned up all the
connectors, sanded down the connection surfaces a bit, and dried everything
out.
Everything seems to be working perfectly now.

My problem has gone from being the alternator to being the seals around the
windshield, the doors and the side windows. But, I am very happy to actually
know what the problem is.
What is a good temporary fix for bad seals? I was thinking of getting some
kind of resin or caulking and filling in some of the cracks I could see
under the dash. I could see some sunlight coming through on the left side
when the driver's door was open. Anything to look at there?

And my final question :) How hard is it to replace the window and door
seals? Time, money, etc?

Thanks!
