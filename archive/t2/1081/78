I'll have to swap the Clutch assembly as well. I presume I should have both 
engines in the same position when doing this swap. Correct? Am I going to 
need an impact wrench?

A clutch allignment tool or an old drive shaft is needed to line up the 
clutch and a tool to hold the flywheel in place while taking off the 
pressure plate.  I have used both a flywheel locking tool and a big screw 
driver, be careful not to damage things if using the screwdriver.  I do not 
think the engine needs to be in the same position as the other one while 
installing the clutch, I never took any notice to this.
