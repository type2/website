Subject: How long to cool down before adjusting valves

What's the shortest time that someone has waited to adjust their valves 
after the engine has been run?  And if you did wait a short time, did 
you verify the valves at a later time to be in spec?

I gotta check mine and I drove the bus about 3 hours ago but I didn't 
know if it would be enough time for it to cool down sufficiently.  I 
could try it and then check them again tomorrow morning, but it's kinda 
a hassle so I figured I'd ask to see if someone else has done the 
research :)

Thanks!
Mike
