Subject: Re: [T2] How long to cool down before adjusting valves

You could take a scientific view of this and calculate thermal expansions in 
the system. Aluminum expands at a rate of  about .000013"/"/F.
Cast iron expands at a rate of about    .0000065"/"/F
Magnesium expands at a rate of about ..000016"/"/F
Steel expands at about .000006"/"/F

Measure the lengths of the various parts in the valve train and then for a 
given temperature differential from ambient, you can then calculate the 
required valve lash.
For example at 70F the ideal valve lash setting is .006. (and of course 
everyone sets this perfectly)

Now calculate the expansions if all the parts are at 170F, a 100 degree F 
rise.
The length of the magesium case is approx.  6" so it expands .0096"
The cast iron cylinders are about 7" long so they expand about .0045"
The aluminum head length is about 2" so they expand about .0026"
Aluminum push rods are about 12" long so they expand about .0156"
Steel valves are about 3" long so they expand about .0018"
By adding and subtracting the above numbers appropriately, this will give 
you the valve lash reduction (or increase) for a given temperature rise.

I didn't actually measure the lengths of each part so if you want real 
numbers, you will need to measure your engine pieces and recalculate. YMMV.
