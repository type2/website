From Lourd Baltimore:
Howdy!

My wife and I just bought our 1976 Bay in London last Saturday, went to a VW 
festival near Nottingham the same day, and drove it back to our home near 
Lincoln on Sunday.
We love it!  Of course, it's needs some TLC, but we're excited to get 
started on improving it.

Anyways, it'll be nice to mingle with the UK VW scene.  Eventually we'll 
make our way over to the U.S. as well...

Cheers,

Josh
