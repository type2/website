Yes about 1700 flycut to fit bore of 1800 or 2000 but again paired.

If you refer to flycut any head to match combustion chamber volume of 
another head chances are you will end up with different head clearance and 
again valve size shall be the same.

They will mechanically FIT but will not give a suitable set-up for engine 
tuning and smooth running.

Some matches are then possible by and suitable by measurement but some 
others much less.
