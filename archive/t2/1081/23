Subject: Re: [T2] '78 - Electrical problems / Battery Light

Do the headlights go dim?
does the starter go click click click....

put a voltmeter on the battery terminals... and drive it till the dash light
comes on..
compare the readings..

if the battery voltage stays above 12,, below 15.. then it is charging
correctly,, and you just might be correct with the problem being at the
dash..

Greg might be correct in thinking the ALT... as maybe the brushes are just
at the point they work for a few minutes,, then don't..

Fuse S12 is common to the problems you describe,,
spin it in place and see if it cleans up the connections
that fuse is the comparison point for the alt blue wire circuit.
it is for the gas gauge.
 turn signals / hazards
oil pressure
