Subject: Re: [T2] one head as good as another...

A lot of answers here, most on target.  I personally don't think there were
ever 3 port air injection heads (but I won't swear to it by any means), more
likely someone had one with a broken off injector (common, plugged air
injection ports also common)  Side to side variance, well mostly temp sensor,
which is certainly surmountable without issue.  Also some differences over the
years (mostly from 914 and true T4 (411/412) applications) regarding PCV
pipes.  Some of those also had temp sensor at an angle down by the rocker box,
not up in the standard bus location.  That all said any head for the
appropriate size engine will bolt fine to either side.  1700 are a smaller
bore, have to be opened to fit on 2.0 P&C, and of course valve diameter varies
through the years, and 2.0 914 heads are 3 intake bolts and plugs at different
angle, and Vanagon have square exhaust ports, all as per Wilson.  But can you
bolt any 1700 head on either side of a 1700
 engine, or any 2.0 head on either side of a 2.0 engine, sure.  If you have
air injection, or FI, will you have the right stuff to attach to, maybe, maybe
not.
