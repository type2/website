Subject: cargo door lower front roller

Hi Folks,
           I can't seem to describe the ball bearing roller at the bottom
front of the side cargo door in a way to find it from the usual sources.  All
I come up with is the rear roller.  Are these available? (1979 Federal
Westfalia)  If not available, is there a practical way to rebuild them?  We
have all the parts except the balls in ok shape i.e. inner and outer races,
cage, seals.  The outer race looks like it is swaged into the metal "tire"
that runs on the track.  Finally, if NLA and not rebuildable, does anyone have
a good one that I can buy?  (Alaska)  Thanks. jon
