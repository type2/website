Subject: Anyone recognize these hubcaps?

This link is to a picture of our 78 bus back in 1998, and it had these hubcaps on it when we got it.

Over the course of our couple trips around the country in it, we lost 3 out of 4.? 

I am just curious if these were Vanagon hubcaps, or just some random one that the PO picked up somewhere.

Today the bus has the regular bus hubcaps on it, but looking back, I kinda liked the look, for a non-stock bus!
