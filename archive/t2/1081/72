Subject: High Country Bus Festival Trip Report

Hi Volks,

I just finished writing my trip report from my recent trip to High 
Country. It was so amazing that the report wound up too big to be posted 
here in a single message. So I put it online instead, and added some 
pics while I was at it.

Soak up the festival vibe if you dare:

Happy Trails,
