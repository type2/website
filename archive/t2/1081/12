Subject: engine tin restoration

am currently in process of putting engine back together for '78 2L FI
bus...would like this thing to look factory fresh.  Regarding the engine tin,
should I have it powdercoated? or should I just sandblast it and paint with
high-gloss hi-temp black paint.  I guess I'd like to do what the factory did
but don't know if it was paint or powdercoat.  Does anyone know?  thanks,
Greg
