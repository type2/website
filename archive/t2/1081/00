Subject: Re: [BP] Case breather vs dipstick tube?

To clarify... I unclipped the breather and lifted it off the case while 
the vacuum hose remained fully attached at both ends.

I am sure that disconnecting the breather vacuum hose at either end 
would kill the engine immediately; I've seen it lots of times.  But in 
this case the hose was not disconnected; only the case breather was.

Thanks for the replies so far. I would have delved further but the 
engine was hot and it was getting pretty dark. This will give me more to 
look at when I get back to it next...

Happy Trails,
