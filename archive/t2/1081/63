Subject: Good read!!

I recently purchased a  "book"....Corvair SAE Papers from a site, and after
reading it..the info helps me to understand the VW motor even more clearly!
It was a very informative, sunny afternoon read..and is published by Clark's
Corvair Parts, Inc in Shelburne Falls, Mass 01370.  Good "reads' on air flow
on cylinder heads, and aluminium metalurgy, as wll as the history of the unit
built by GM.  Since it is Friday...figured I could post this!  Cheers
