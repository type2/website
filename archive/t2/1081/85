Minor correction to my last post.  I used 90 degrees instead of 180 
degrees.  Instead, when the cylinder is at firing TDC position, the 
intake just closed almost 180 degrees ago and the exhaust isn't going to 
open for another 180 degrees or so.  Also, you can probably be off by 
about 100 degrees on either side of TDC, yet be in the correct alignment 
to adjust the valves.
