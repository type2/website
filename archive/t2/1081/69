A few tips that might help but aren't obvious:

While you're in there, check the hazard flasher switch. It can re-route a couple different circuits when it gets loose. Most people wrap a nylon tie-strap (or two) around them to hold them together tightly. Really!

When working with switches like the light switch and hazard switch, they have alignment tabs on the face that mates to the panel. They MUST be aligned properly when tightened (fire hazard.)

When you remove the instrument panel, just pull the handles for the heater and vent straight out (pull hard.) Un-do the speedo cable at the back of the speedo. Unplug the large multi-wire plug(s) (My memory is short on this, but it becomes apparent.) and unscrew the four or 5 or 6 screws that are in the face of the panel (you are looking right at them!) As you unscrew them, listen for where the clips fall and collect all of them! When you reassemble, you can put these clips back on the screws loosely, turn them to face the appropriate direction, and just pop the panel back in position with a pop of the heel of your fist over each screw. You'll hear the clips seat. Then tighten the screws the rest of the way. This is a lot easier than trying to reach under and hold each clip as your partner screws into them! It's apparently how the original assembly was done!
