Subject: Engine seals (Front/Back)

I've got my '79 engine mostly broken down for cleaning.
I still haven't definitively found the source of my oil
leak. There does not seem to be oil leaking around the
crankshaft seals (flywheel or fan). My question is,
should I replace these seals anyway, since I have access
to them? Is there any trick to installing these seals?
