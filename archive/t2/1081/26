Subject: T2 Parts source in the UK?

Hello List,

as this is my first post on this particular list, allow me to introduce my
T2 and myself:
I'm working as a computer and technician in Vienna, Austria; in 1999 I got
a Type 21 delivery van quite exactly of the same construction date as
myself (i.e. 1977) with double-sided sliding doors and had it converted to
9 seats.

I looking for a left-hand-side sliding door (my actual one got a bit rusty
over the last couple of years). However, as there are very few double-side
door T2s, and it's very hard to find a spare part. Probably the biggest
chances would be in a country driving on the left, e.g. the UK.

So, are there any reliable Type 2 parts dealers or other parts sources in
the UK where I could ask for a left-hand-side sliding door?

Best regards,

Lorenz
