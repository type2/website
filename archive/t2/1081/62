mike s.,

around town with 40mph the max usually under 350 F.  out on the
highway running 55mph to 65 mph and heading west with the wind i was
getting 345-375 depending on how hard i was accelerating.  i have not
taken the bus on any extended trips, so, i don't know how her temps
would trend long term.  my bus is an automatic, i wonder if they tend
to run hotter at WTO or even at highway cruising speeds than a manual?
 i suppose WTO would be no different.  the head temp gauge is a VDO
and i have never tested the veracity of it.  i use it for trending.
and lots of analog gauges look cool.
