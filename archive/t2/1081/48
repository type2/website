If you use 3 pieces of the VW 117-877-223 C (used on Std Beetles 64-77) and
do a slight trim on the third piece, it should work just as good.  Several
Bay Window Sunroof Owners reported to me it works out fine.

Granted, at $29.95 each, it's $89.85 plus shipping (& sales tax if in
Calif), but faster than going all the way to Germany.
