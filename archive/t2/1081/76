Subject: heat exchangers...

I was cleaning and derusting a heat exchanger ('72-'74) when the
double holed collar (the part the head studs go thru' to mount it),
fell off! Are these collars an interference fit on the exhaust pipes?
There were two spot welds but they look as if they didn't penetrate
the pipe and just the collar...
The collar just slips back on the pipe...Will new spot welds be 
sufficient
to keep the collar in place without leaking?
