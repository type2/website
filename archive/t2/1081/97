Subject: Fwd: [VWBusCamp] Buszilla ll funding request

Okay so we are in the last 3 weeks to completion.  So far most of the
structural work is complete. Here is a link to the blog
http://mutantbus.wordpress.com. Now we are at the point of painting today
along with a modification to the roof line and the deck lid. However we are
in need of funds for LIGHTING to meet DMV requirements so we can operate at
night. We also need funds for materials for Buszilla ll's "hide" and
interior decor. We have scoured thrift shops  high and low with great
success and acquired some amazing things however we need to buy more decor.
We could really use about $2500.00 but any amount will help get us closer to
completion.  It is easy to donate just go to
http://mutantbus.wordpress.comand hit donate. Don't even think just do
it now. Its paypal. We take all
credit cards and debit. Make Buszilla ll beautiful. And legal. And licensed.
With love from Buszillaland. The Bizzy BZ2 Crew. Workin our butts off here
in Portland for your Playa Pleasure
