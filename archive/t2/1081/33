break the glass out. then remove them.

now if you want to save the glass.
. soften them up, sit the bus so the window is in direct sunlight for
several hours.
. get someone or something on the outside to catch the glass when it
falls out, pushed out, whatever you won't be able to catch it.
. get inside of the bus, and VERY carefully in the middle of a long
side, top or bottom is not real important.  with your fingers and
maybe a popsicle stick start working the rubber over the edge of the
metal it will probably stick and take some real careful "worrying'
with it to get it to come loose.
. pray the last guy didn't use some sort of stickum or silicone

go VERY slow and carefully all the way round working from the center
out.  get a fan on you to keep you cool or such. take your time give
your self lots, and patience patience patience.

maybe 60-70% chance of getting it out safely and in one piece.

if there is that metal looking plastic in the rubber pull that out
first that is almost impossible to save, it is just a wedge type
locking pretty thing...totally unnecssary it is just for looks. but if
you want to reuse it be very carefull they are usually very brittle.


good luck.
