Subject: '78 - Electrical problems / Battery Light

Hi guys,

I just bought a '78 Type 2 and it's been having this problem with the
battery light always coming on.
The battery was new last year, but the PO let it sit all winter and it died.
I had it recharged at a mech and they said it was good to go.

Here's the problem: the battery light will turn on half way through a short
drive (maybe 20km in) and stay on. When it comes on, the gas gauge drops to
zero and the blinkers stop working. However, the hazard lights keep on
working. The pull from the hazards causes the battery light to pulse in time
with them.

So, I brought it back to the mech and his theory was that it was either the
voltage regulator or the alternator. He replaced the voltage regulator and
said he ran it for 30 mins and the light never came on, so problem solved.
Well, I picked it up and got about half-way home and the light came back on,
the blinkers died, and the gas gauge went to zero. But, at least I have a
new regulator :(

I've always understood that a dead alternator would cause the engine and the
electrical to drain the battery VERY fast and the engine would stop after
~10mins. If so, then I don't think it's the alternator as I have been able
to drive it around for 45 mins without issue.

What do you guys think it might be? Corrosion at leads/contacts? Fuses? My
theory is that the dash wiring is just screwy and there may be nothing wrong
with it. How else to explain the blinkers dying!?

Thanks for any help guys,

georges
