Subject: Re: [T2] How long to cool down before adjusting valves

One of our newest list members, Larry of BusBarn has indicated he of the
"old school" of being a dealer mechanic for several years and may have a
better insight on how long a customer's Beetle, Bus or Type 3 had to cool
down for a valve adjustment when brought in for normal service maintenance.

When I bought a 73 Karmann Ghia new and bringing it in for dealer service
while under warranty period, my very dim memory tells me that the dealer
mechanic would place a fan (or fans) under the engine to blow on the heads
and engine underside to cool it for the valve adjustment.  I say this
because it was usually a two to three hour wait in the customer lounge when
this service was to be performed.

Mike - your alternator harness is on it's way :-)
