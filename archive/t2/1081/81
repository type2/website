Doesn't matter if it's not gonna run ever again ;)

Assuming their the same type of engine, the distributor drive gear 
should be exactly the same between every engine.  This doesn't always 
hold true, however, because people put the gear in correctly or change 
the angle to compensate for an incorrect distributor (usually 009).

People also sometimes install the drive dog onto the distributor 180 
degrees off from where it should be.

Regardless of the above, if you haven't already verified that the new 
engine's distributor drive shaft is installed correctly, rotate the 
crankshaft clockwise while watching the INTAKE valve on the #1 cylinder. 
  When it closes, the #1 piston is near the bottom of it's stroke, so 
turn the crank about 180 more degrees until the timing mark lines up 
with the 0 degree mark on the timing scale.  Now you are at firing 
position for #1.  Verify that your drive gear is installed correctly 
with the picture in your Bentley manual.

nope - doesn't matter - unless everything was balanced together.  But 
since it is an unknown engine, I wouldn't assume anything was balanced. 
  I would also double check that the clutch is actually good so you 
don't end up pulling the engine again because of a bad clutch.  New 
clutch assemblies aren't that expensive...

Nope, but you will need a torque wrench when you reinstall the bolts. 
Also, make sure you bolt it back on correctly.  The instructions and 
torque specs are in the bentley as well...

The condenser?  Does it have a little green wire coming out of it?

Shouldn't really matter how you do it, as long as it can breathe but 
doesn't leak.

yup.
