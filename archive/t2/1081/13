Clara from the Vintage Bus list powder-coated a set and they look
beautiful:

OTOH, I've gone through the "wire-brush, TSP, remove rust, prime, 
and paint with high-gloss, hi-temp" process myself and I was pretty 
happy with the results.  That said, it was a zen process (lots
of time for pondering and emptying one's mind).  Kinda like 
mowing the lawn or driving a bus with the radio off...just humming
down an empty highway in the middle of nowhere.

cheers,
