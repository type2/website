Doesn't sound like an alternator problem, but a loss of
power to the instrument.  I would start by taking the 
fuse box down out of it's hiding place (with battery disconnected) 
and look CAREFULLY at all of the various connections.  I bought 
a '79 Station Wagon a few years ago for $100. that the PO couldn't
keep running due to similar symptoms and it turned out to be 
a burned off main power connection on the fuse panel.  This
took about 15 minutes to find, and a few more to fix.  A LOT 
easier than replacing an alternator that might not fix a thing.
 
The engine from that bus is still in my '75 Riviera Camper (with 
Vanagon square port heads and heater boxes and '74 style
exhaust with EGR.  The '79 has provided far more than the 
cost in parts.

When do you want to go to Haiti?  I can make it happen.
Christ lays opportunities to serve him at our feet every day.  
We can choose to pick them up or expect that someone else will.
I choose the first.
