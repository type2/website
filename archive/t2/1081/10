p.s.  both these buses were owned in the mid '70s so I have no reason to
believe they were not as they came from the factory. gt

I specifically remember, having owned both a '73 (1700) and a '74 (1800) that
the air pump injection pipes were different.  One year had 4 air injection
pipes (one going into each cylinder) and one year had only 3 air injection
pipes.  I just can't remember which was which.  Also, i know that the piston
diameter was bigger on a '74 than a '73 but I can't defiitively say whether
or
not the cylinder heads were different because of that.  Greg
