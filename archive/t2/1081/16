1700 are not swapable with 1800 or 2000

1800 are swapable with 2000

Whatever is the swap head number should preferably be the same to match 
compression ratio and valve size to have an "even" engine.  Then an 
adjustment you do for one cylinder is good for the 3 others.

About swapping from right to left or versi versa only features as CHT boss 
or holes for recirculation could but a restriction depending what set up you 
are running (carb, injection, etc)

Hope this help on the topic.
