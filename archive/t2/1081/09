I specifically remember, having owned both a '73 (1700) and a '74 (1800) that
the air pump injection pipes were different.  One year had 4 air injection
pipes (one going into each cylinder) and one year had only 3 air injection
pipes.  I just can't remember which was which.  Also, i know that the piston
diameter was bigger on a '74 than a '73 but I can't defiitively say whether or
not the cylinder heads were different because of that.  Greg

Hi Volks,

As Bob says, the difference is related only to FI. This means that if you are
not using Fuel Injection then you can swap side to side to your hearts
content. If you do plan to swap sides in an FI head, be prepared for the
possibility of some drilling being needed.
