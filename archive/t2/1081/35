Do you guys have any links to reputable parts dealers? I'm trying to figure
out how much this is going to cost, roughly.
Can one get new alternator that fit/work in the Type 2 or are they all
rebuilt units from other old VWs?

BusDepot.com has a rebuilt unit for $79.99 ... seems pretty reasonable to
me.

Thanks again.
