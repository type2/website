Ahh.. the wonderful previous owner :)

Yeah, if you can get it back to normal, that would be optimal. 
Hopefully soldering it didn't mess up the plastic too much.  Otherwise, 
you should be able to find another fusebox relatively easily at a 
junkyard.  I had a PO that did some similar kinda hacking to the fusebox 
so I swapped it out with another fusebox that I found at the junkyard.
