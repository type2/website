Subject: Re: [T2] Engine seals (Front/Back)

If you have the engine out and the flywheel/flexplate off,
look closely at the two plugs (oil galley and camshaft bore) 
on the front of the crankcase.  Whether they are leaking or not, 
use jb weld or marine tex epoxy to seal them after fully cleaning 
and drying the surrounding metal. If the oil galley plug is loose
you can either try to find a new one, or tap the hole and install
a threaded plug, being careful to keep shavings out of the engine, 
and verifying there is clearance for the flywheel/flexplate. 
It is very common for the plug for the main
oil galley to "blow out" and cause a severe leak.  
Better to make sure this doesn't happen before you put the engine back
in.

If the transaxle is leaking into the bellhousing it should
be obvious from the gear oil smell.

When do you want to go to Haiti?  I can make it happen.
Christ lays opportunities to serve him at our feet every day.  
We can choose to pick them up or expect that someone else will.
I choose the first.
