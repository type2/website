Subject: Re: [T2] Remove rear windows and preserve seal?

I have kicked rear glass out of 30+ year old busses, clean across the
driveway, falling onto concrete (with the seal around it) and never broken one
personally.  Don't try to bend it too much (don't work from the end) that will
explode tempered glass.  Personally I think the best way is on a warmer day,
put on jeans, tuck em into high tops, put on some safety glasses lay in the
bus, put the feet up against the glass, work it back and forth a bit, then
shove it out from the top or the bottom.  I've never soaped it for uninstall,
just for install of course, but it isn't a bad idea I guess.  I have literally
done this 100s of times.  As with all things, YMMV.  Only really practical if
you have a new seal you put in a year or two ago, cause anything else is going
to leak unless you glue it in which will be a nightmare for someone later
(maybe you.)
 
I used to even try to get out windshields when seals went for $90 at the
dealer, today it is stupid to try, my sucess rate on them was probably 50/50
at best though.  With the Bus Depot or anyone else's price on a seal, cutting
the seal is best.

I did all my side and back windows by myself (broke one or two in the
process) and it was fun even with new seals.
