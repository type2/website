Subject: Remove rear windows and preserve seal?

I have been scrutinizing the bus lately, looking for rust issues that 
need tackling before they become problems.  Last night, I pulled off the 
sider cover, and saw that there is some surface rust at the base of the 
rear window seal.  A similar issue is developing on the other side.

My rear window seals are in decent shape, and I'd rather not have to 
sacrifice them in order to get the windows out.  Does anyone know of a 
technique that will allow me to remove these windows without destroying 
the seals?

Thanks!
