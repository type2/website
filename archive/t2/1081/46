Subject: Re: [T2] valve adjustment

mike, david, etc.,

thanks for the help.  finished up the adjustment today and the valves
were very tight.  set them to .006" and on the test drive she drove
like a dream.  a good dream.  hopefully the mpg will come back up as
well.  it had been trending downward, but since i had been driving her
so little i didn't pay that much attention.

this engine has under 4,000 miles since she was rebuilt.  is it common
for the valves to tighten up following a rebuild?

thanks,

jeremiah
