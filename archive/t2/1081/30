Subject: Re: [T2] T2 Parts source in the UK?

Hi, I just joined the list yesterday with my 1976 left-hand-drive T2.
It is kind of odd driving on the left with a left-hand-drive vehicle....

Anyways, you can get some new parts from VW Heritage (http://www.vwheritage.com)
They are a really good resource and the diagrams they have have are great.

However,
I was looking at the list of parts and they only have right-hand-side
(or, if you prefer in UK English, "off-side") available:
http://www.vwheritage.com/vwh/VW-Camper-Van-Parts%5CBus-Parts-1968-79%5CBody%5CSliding-Door%5C?templateID=vwh

You can also try Just Kampers, but it looks like they don't have any doors available either:
http://www.justkampers.com/shop/type_2_bay/type-2-bay-original-vehicle-parts/body-panels/side-door-parts?limit=all

If
the rust is not too bad, then VW Heritage and Just Kampers have a lot
of the individual door parts that look like they could be used on
either side.
You would just have to get some welding (and painting) done.

After that, Google is your friend.  I'm pretty new to the VW scene, but I've heard good
things about WV Heritage and Just Kampers.  I couldn't tell you about
any of the other parts places in the UK.

Also, if you're in The South, then there appears to be more local classic VW resources.  I'm up in the East Midlands where there's slim pickings.
