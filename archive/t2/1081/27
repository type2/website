Subject: Re: [T2] engine tin restoration

Than ks,Bob, but this wasn't the tin off one of my buses.

I was visiting Wayne Dittman a few years back, and he was building a
high-power bug motor for a client.  The client had this set of Teflon coated
engine tin sent over for Wayne to install, and the client also sent a set of
stainless steel engine tin screws, the kind that you put a hex wrench into,
not using a flat head or Phillips driver or a socket. (And not the button
head,
which I would have probably preferred).

The return label on the box was of a coating firm in Oklahoma City.
