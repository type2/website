Subject: sunroof seal

Hey folks, I searched far and wide for a one-piece sunroof seal particulary
with our on-line vendors who support this list.  I did not have any success
but was able to find one in Germany.  It's called a Schiebedachabdichtung and
can be found at:

the website is a little awkward to get around but the seal arrived in
yesterday's mail and looks to be of very excellent quality with good round
bulb and nice fuzzy felt.  It wasn't cheap as it was a little over $100 usd
(given the bad exchange rate) including shipping.  It seems someone on the
list inquired about it a few months ago so I just wanted to share this.  Greg
