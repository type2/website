Subject: Re: [T2] Remove rear windows and preserve seal?

Did my back one about 3 years ago.

My caution would be, if you can barely get it out while preserving the seal,
you're going to have a lot of fun getting it back in!

I did all my side and back windows by myself (broke one or two in the
process) and it was fun even with new seals.
