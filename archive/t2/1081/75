Hey Volks!

I just bought a new (to me) engine and while swapping parts and such I've come up with a few questions.

1- Distributor - The old engine is dead and no longer fully rotates and as such I was not able to get to TDC for #1 cylinder. Based purely on the Rotors rotation I was able to get to what I think is TDC for #3; did the same for the new engine (which has better timing marks) and then swapped the Distributor. The drive shafts on each were in the same position so I think this worked out ok. Also, should the Rotor and the Dizzy Dogs/Drive Shaft slot be in the same line? It seems that the Rotor should be pointing along the same line but mine appears to be maybe 35 degrees ahead.

2- I'll have to swap the Clutch assembly as well. I presume I should have both engines in the same position when doing this swap. Correct? Am I going to need an impact wrench?

3- What is the little electrical unit right next to the Distributor? Looks similar to a spark plug with a single wire lead on it.

4- Oil Breather - I'll be using a Duel Weber set-up. The new engine has a single breather outlet. The old one has 2 outlets, 1 to each carb but the 2nd outlet looks like a PO's weld job, ugly but I suppose functional. Should I use the old breather with 2 hoses or use the new with a T in the line?

5- Engine Mount brackets - Will I need to pull the Fan Housing in order to get to these?

I think that's enough for now. I'm sure I'll have more next week.

Thanks,
