Subject: Re: [T2] Retorquing heads "engine in"

Seriously, to retorque the heads you have to remove the runners (FI), 
disconnect most of the vacuum lines, remove the rockers, take off the 
tin, and replace all of the above. All of these are harder to do with 
engine in than engine out. In the end, the effort to do it one may 
versus the other may be a wash, but you're more likely to do it right 
and without stress if the engine is out.
