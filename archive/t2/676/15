The only flaw I see is that every time I personally
have planned something similar, it just never happens.
Something always comes up that's more important and
before I realize it, several years have elapsed.
Usually by then something else has broken that
requires pulling the engine so I take care of whatever
it was I intended to do then. With my personality,
I've found that I'd better do it right the first time
'cause I'm just not going to go back in unless I have
to. I'll spend hours fiddling with something to get it
just right the first time.
