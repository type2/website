Subject: Re: [T2] Which is right or left?

And port is for steak while ... Oh, sorry... ;-)

Honestly, I can never get the port/starboard things straight for some
reason. I can read it, be told, whatever, I still forget. I have no
idea why. I don't seem to have a problem with left/right though. And
it drives me nutzo when I read something that has to do with my bus. I
think I have it, then have to go look it up AGAIN.

Battery (sparks) is to starboard (stars). Hmm... Maybe that will help?
