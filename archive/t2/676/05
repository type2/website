I emailed Mainely Custom a couple of weeks ago and asked about the
flywheel lock. They replied the adapter is machined to accept a Porsche
flywheel lock. I'm still hum-hawing about the purchase, but will likely
end up going that direction. I missed the last Porsche yoke on the
ubiquitous auction site by 37 cents.

I'm also experiencing severe dislike over the list quote bounce routine,
but nothing a sufficient dose of caffeine won't fix. :)
