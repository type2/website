FWIW I hope your luck is better than mine has been... 

Mine have vibrated apart in quick order. I think a year is the best I every got out of one... 

Actually the best I every got was the one I have on my Beetle. Bought it in 1994. Of course it became a barn queen about 1995... <grin!> Beetle was Type IV powered. 

The BBQ paint delays the rust but the paint won't last a year. Seems as thought he heat and road wash when it rains seems to kill it. Vibration and heat too.
