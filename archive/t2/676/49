<port == four letters, left == four letters.  Therefore, port == left.>

Despite my 6 years in the Navy, I can't make that one work. They both have 4 letters. I smell a joke here... <grin!> 

The way I remember it is: starboard has two R's. Port only has one. Starboard = Right. REALLY basic but it works for me.
