Jack,

The pics on the mainely website don't seem to indicate it but I am pretty
sure the one I saw the other week at my buddies' shop had the flywheel lock
slot.  Whatever, it is a really nice design with or without the slot, which
could easily be machined into the ring anyhow. I just love the fact that it
takes any old garden variety engine stand and makes it into the mac daddy
Porsche unit.
