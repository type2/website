You want a bike shift cable.  We sell them for a buck at the bike shop 
where I work.  Way more cable than you need and higher quality than the 
original item.  Incidentally, a bicycle "fourth hand" tool is helpful 
for adjusting the thermostat, but probably not worth it unless you can 
borrow one or have it already.

all the best,
