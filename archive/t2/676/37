Subject: factory stereo in a baywindow?

Last fall I noticed a baywindow bus at a local metal salvage place.  When I
stopped to inquire about being able to get some parts off of it, they gave
me a short amount of time for a reasonable price because it was literally on
its way to the crusher.  One of the things I was able to pull was the radio,
but in my haste I was only able to pull it and cut wires.

Now as I have had time to go back through the things I salvaged, I find that
the radio is a Sapphire XXV, which according to a list member's site (thanks
Scott), is a stereo radio which was available in a 1973 Bus, and that
matches up with the one I took it out of.

Anyway, I figure the front dash speaker was used for one channel of the
stereo, but where was the other channel?  I don't think this bus (nor my
'73) have any provision for 2 speakers in the front dash.  Did they just
mount a speaker in the back somewhere?  Anyone have one of these installed
in their bus?

Thanks,
Dean
