Hi Phil,

Re: "I am considering moving up to the next generation VW Van....."

If I was in the market for another Vanagon I'd look for the following:

No rust along the body seams, along the floor seam on the galley side and
around the spare tire holder.

Absolutely NO coolant leaks!

P.O.s of the water-cooled flat fours in the later Vanagons often failed to
use the proper coolant.  This results in corroded surfaces and a very
expensive repair.  Some times just a replacement head gasket will fix it,
but usually the entire head is so corroded that it must be replaced.  Also
look for coolant leaks in the heater cores of both the front and back
heaters.  Check the coolant color.  It should be blue.  If it is green, run,
very, very, fast in the other direction.

The "wasserdrippers", as the late Vanagons are often called, come in two
displacements, a 1.9L and a 2.1L.  I've seen a note on one of the VW engine
rebuilder's sites (boy I wish I could remember where!) that indicates that
the 2.1L is harder on rod bearings than the 1.9L.

Thus personally I'd opt for a 1.9L.  At least they got heat and a little
more pep than the air cooled.  So which do I own?  An 1981 air-cooled
Westy....with auto....and air.  How fast is it?  Slower than cold molasses
going up hill in January.  0 to 60 in 25 seconds.  Does it corner well?
Damn straight.  (Just gotta have the right tires!)  It is, however, poorer
in snow than my old dearly departed '76 westy.   Why did I buy it?  Because
it what was available at the time I was in the market, and was rust free, a
rarity here in the Northeast.

Hope this helps.
