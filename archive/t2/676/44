To be fair, the wasserboxer's displacement is actually greater than that of
the beetle, even though it shares some internal parts and has a lot in
common with it design-wise. It is 1.9L (or 2.1 after 1985) versus the bug's
1.6L. But in addition it gains a lot of horsepower simply by not being
aircooled.  A lot of an aircooled engine's horsepower actually goes to
turning the cooling fan, not the wheels. I don't remember the exact number
but I seem to recall reading that an aircooled engine uses something like
20% of its horsepower just to keep itself cool. Because it doesn't need to
turn a crankshaft-driven cooling fan, the wasserboxer engine runs more
efficiently and therefore provides more power. That's why the 1.9L
watercooled Vanagons are peppier than the 2.0L aircooled ones.
