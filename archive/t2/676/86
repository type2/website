Subject: Gallery plugs

A couple (actually, a few) questions about replacing gallery plugs:

1) Is this better left to a machine shop? Or can the average rebuilder 
do it himself?

2) Which are the gallery plugs that should be replaced? How many behind 
the flywheel?

3) What keeps the plugs from loosening up with vibration? The sealer?

Thanks.
