Now you need to add a nice big oil cooler and a cylinder head temp gauge,
Oil temp Gauge along with a Oil pressure gauge and you'll be set for Summer
in Oklahoma.
Just for general discussion ..............
Straight 40 weight gives me the same pressure and temp readings as the
expensive 15/50 Synthetic or 20/50 Pennzoil.
Summer and winter I drop back to straight 30 wt. since my runs are mostly
short.
