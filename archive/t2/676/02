Depands on what country the company you are buying from is located in. Ie.
in the USA "LEFT = DRIVER" and "RIGHT = PASSENGER" -- in the UK it's the
opposite. Left and right are YOUR left and right when facing FORWARD (ie.
looking from the back of the bus toward the front).

If in doubt ASK the company you are buying from and specify left or right
rather than driver or passenger.
