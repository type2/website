I don't know if they were in a '71 (mine also came out of a '77), but I have
set of those that I took out of my bus when I moved the spare up front,
along with the plastic (?) tire cover.

You're welcome to them for $10.00 (includes USPS Priority shipping).  If
anyone wants/needs the cover, please make an offer.  It's worn, but
generally in good shape.  The holes where the hold downs go are cracked, but
complete (I've still got the little piece that broke off, and the grommets
are still in place).  I'll even throw in the fasteners, though one is broken
(I think I have all the parts, but the toggle came off).
