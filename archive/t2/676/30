Subject: Retorquing heads "engine in"

Don, Bob, and list,

Yes, you can retorque with the engine in. You can also drive surprising 
long distances with your eyes closed. Both are ill-advised. Especially 
retorquing with engine-in. It leads to swearing and throwing tools and 
other anti-social behaviors. Ask me how I know.
