After doing it so many times, it actually gets easier and my last shot
at it was actually pretty gentle. Once I learned which tin screws to
loosen to get the front plate loose so the main tins will release it
seemed to go much easier. Of course, if you get seized/rusted screws
and stripped heads, it can be another matter :-)
