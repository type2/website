Bit of a mnenmonic I learned from my ex-Navy father .. I'm expressing 
it differently (years of geekdom showing) but the concept is there.

port == four letters, left == four letters.  Therefore, port == left.

.. but this doesn't really relate to Busses unless you haul a canoe or 
a sailboat with your T2 .. :-)
