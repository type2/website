Subject: Update on my 70 bug - now runs but a bog off of idle?

I ended up replacing my distributor with an 009 that has a Porter HEI system
in it, with magnetic pickup. That was as different as  night and day. The
40HP now is strong at higher rpms with good acceleration, but I have a bog
right off of idle. If I pump the pedal I can work through it, but it is NOT
the accelerator pump, as it shows a good healthy squirt down the venturi
when you pump it. The timing is spot on, and the timing mark doesn't flicker
at all, it is rock solid with this magnetic pickup etc. The carb is the
stock 28pict so I didn't think the 009 would display the classic bog off of
idle with this? I thought that was just a 34pict problem? Any suggestions on
this? I might pull all the HEI stuff out of the 009 and install it back in
the stock 205 dizzy the 40HP came with. This is a late 70 standard bug BTW,
that Canadians could buy with the cheapo finish, swingaxle and smaller 1200
CC engine.

Thanks,

Courtney
