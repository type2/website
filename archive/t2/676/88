I really don't know if I happened to be lucky, but I drilled/tapped
out all the plugs on my engine. This was on the engine stand
completely dissembled.

I just went ahead and replaced any gallery plug with a threaded plug.
I happened to buy the brass ones, but IIRC Ronnie at Old Volks carries
the alunumum ones. I don't remember how many but pretty sure I used
two different sizes.

I think the sealer will help, but also it's a tapered NPT thread, so
it gets tighter itself.
