Long before buses (content) I was in the Navy on an aircraft carrier,(flight
deck crew) and all I can remember is the air boss screaming at people during
recover STAY OF THE PORT CATWALK YOU IDIOT. (Planes land on the left side of
the ship as the approach from the back.) You'll get your head cut off by a
wing if you come up that way. We did have a squadron of Type 219, they made
these flying buses for a while but is was totally top secrete. Hold on I
think the CIA or the list admins at my door.....
