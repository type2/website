Subject: Vanagon Experts?

Hello,

I am considering moving up to the next generation VW Van from my current 72 
Westy (it will be going into restoration) to a Vanagon Camper. I am not very 
familiar with these vehicles except for the fact that they converted from 
air cooled to water cooled in 1984. In my short time researching these 
vehicles I have found the vanagon.com website, which has been very helpful. 
I am interested in getting some of your insight and opinions about these 
vans, such as good/bad years, aircooled vs watercooled, notorious/common 
issues (mechanical problems, rust) etc..


Thanks in advance for your advice, Phil.
