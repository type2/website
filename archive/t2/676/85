Hello Jonathan   This isnt  all true,  there are also o rings on top of the 
clylinders that will leak due to old age and heat and expansion rates of 
different materials . These leaks will not be outside  the signs are heavy 
exhust(Like a blown heads gasket on a normal car DUH) that clears up as the motor warms 
up and  coolant level going down and no outside leaks. The main seal between 
the case and heads will leak ussually caused by overheating. I have been using 
a Subaru coolant treatment that will stop the leaks , yes even works for the 
main seal between the case and heads. Probabluy a temperary fix but I have 5 
vanagons that are running with this stuff for over 10 months now so it does 
work  i just dont know for how long.   later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem
