Head gaskets are a notorious problem on watercooled. Solved by
superior aftermarket solutions. Many of the rubber hoses are NLA. If
the water pump fails and the impeller scores the crankcase, VW
considers the case unservicable due to turbulance reasons. Also the
long plastic coolant tube that goes to the front of the vehicle got
very brittle and got stress cracks early on.

Otherwise I like the westy interior on Vanagon.
