Subject: Re: [T2] Oil dipstick with temperature gauge

I have one in my tool shed that looks just like it, but it only cost $3.50 at
Target and $0.35 at the hardware store for a rubber stopper. Picked up the
thermometer that was designed for a large deep fat fryer. Slid the stopper
over the probe end of the thermometer and put a dab of high temp silicon on
the large end of the stopper to make sure it wouldn't move. I could have
marked the end of the probe for oil level with a file. I only use it to verify
the readings on my oil temp gauge on the dash. If the thermometer said 275
deg. f. and you were in the drivers seat, you might as well not have the
thermometer.

If a tree fell in the woods and nobody was there to hear it......

While browsing through their site I see they sell oil temp. dipsticks.
You can find them listed on page

wondering if anyone here has any experience with this product and
would share their opinion of it
