Clean-up and paint the engine compartment with the
engine out.  Whenever the barn gets cleaned is
immaterial.  Jack the engine-less bus way in the air,
safety-jack-stand into place, and attack the engine
compartment with Windex and Kim-wipes if you have to. 
But do the sprucing-up sans engine.   Mine is
semi-gloss oil-based Titanium White, and looks bright
and shiny, even when dusty.
    
Tis wintertime.  Be careful of the paint
manufacturer's minimum drying temperature.  In the
40's and 50's, most paints won't dry.  And below 30F
the paint will "krinkle" and look awful.  Uhh, is the
barn heated?
    
Make that sucker gorgeous!
