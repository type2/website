Slow day(s) on the list?

I don't think they discuss port / starboard as much on the sailing lists!
:-)

Now to delete this thread from the 35,000+ type 2 list messages I have in my
outlook folder so that if I ever do buy a bus and and to search through my
personal archive looking for answers on how to fix it... ;-)

The port/left connection is at least memorable.
