Same thing happened to me when replacing the rear side window recently. We
were also using the string method, lubricated with dishwashing soap.
It basically took a LOT of brute force to get it in place. Two people on the
outside pushing, one inside pulling the string. It was quite a PITA, but it
worked out in the end.
