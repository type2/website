Subject: Re: [T2] Re: How Hot is too Hot for Oil Temperature

I am certainly no expert when it comes to VW's.  I sure enjoy driving 
my three busses and have learned many lessons over the last six years.  
Most of these lessons have come from breaking something.

I currently run an oil pressure gauge, cylinder head temp gauge, and a 
voltmeter.  I was having charging issues at the time, thus the 
voltmeter.  I probably would have installed an oil temp.

I don't view the gauges as exact read outs of what is going on in the 
engine.  I am enough of a scientist to realize that they are probably 
not "accurate" in a scientific sense.  They do, however, give me an 
indication of what my bus is doing, over a period of time.  I reply on 
this feedback to make decisions about how I drive.  My CHT usually 
reads just over 350.  If I drive to the city tomorrow and the readings 
are 450, I'm going to start asking questions.

FOR ME, this is valuable.
