Subject: shifter trouble

My '75 is having trouble going into 1st and 2nd gear. Mostly after coming
out of reverse. It just seems to go in to 3rd and 4th. I've noticed that if
I put it back into reverse it will then go into 1st. The library had one
article. It said something about loosening the shifter assy. slightly and
moving it either forward or backward depending on the gears having the
trouble (1st and 4th or 3rd and 2nd). Nothing about 1st and 2nd. Any help
will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
Dan
