Subject: Any Spare side marker lights in Seattle area? 

Well, the Troll ('76 Kombi) is up and running and insured, and my parts
from BusDepot should be here on thurs/fri including new mirrors and tail
light lenses. However my bank is empty and I still need the lenses for
the red side marker lights, and the whole amber side marker lights. I
don't get another pay-day for another two weeks so I'm wondering if
anyone in the Seattle area might have old cracked/faded ones that
they've replaced that I could use, or anyone in the Northwest that has
some that could mail 'em up. (or of course anyone anywhere, it'll just
take longer to mail)
 
They can be totally chiped, and cracked, and barely the right color. I
can put that red tape over holes and stuff. I just need something to
make the bus legal for the next couple weeks untill I can get new ones.
And yes, the Troll is my only car. :(   Witch is why I'm SOoooo eager to
drive it. :) 
 
Hate to be a begger, but I'm SUPER excited to drive him!
