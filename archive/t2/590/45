Subject: RE: [T2] Rear/side window installation

Sounds like your seals are good. You shouldn't be able to push it all the 
way in there. Try this it may help.
1. Hold the window with seal in place up to the opening. Roll the seal 
toward the opening on the edge of the window. Don't roll it to far it will 
pop off.
2. Line up the window with the opening and start pushing. Push a little at a 
time on each side. The seal will roll back into place and the force of the 
opening will not let it come off.
3. Start pulling the strings and pushingthe window in place.


I just did this Saturday no lube. Worked fine.
