Just did this myself. Although I needed to replace some studs in my 
muffler (72') that I broke off so I replaced these in stainless as well. 
So I now have the muffler held onto the heater boxes with exclusively 
stainless steel fasteners. Also replaced the nuts on on heater box to 
head with S.S.
By the way sourced the hardware through McMaster Carr. Search on google 
for their website. (They have lots of good general purpose, industrial 
supply type stuff, )
