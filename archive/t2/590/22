Subject: I'm completely "restoring" the channel to almost as new.

Thanks for the reply. I've already completely cleaned the channel and
osphoed(sp?) all the remaining rust spots. Today I rebuilt 3/4's of the bottom
channel. I like to use JB Weld. On any holes larger than a dime, I put down a
bottom layer of JB weld then place a small square of steel mesh screen over
that w/ some weight to push it down into the Weld underlayer. Then I wait an
hour and JB Weld over the top of the screen. Then I smooth it out nicely and
wait 'til tomorrow to spray primer it.  Everyone has their own technique
though, that's just mine.
The other 1/4 of the bottom channel was considerably worse. I cleaned it up
pretty well - I use  a drill w/ various wire brush attachments and a 4" angle
grinder. Then I hooked up w/ a professional welder who does welding on the
side at his house. He welded in a foot long piece of heave gauge steel that
already had a 1/4" bend in it (to form the vertical edge of the channel.). To
make the 90 degree bend that goes up towards the roof he cut slits in the
steel bar and slowly worked it into a 90 degree bend. Then he filled in  the
slits. All for $40.00.

So tomorrow all I have to do is fill in the part he welded w/ JB Weld, smooth
it out, wait 6 to 8 hours and primer the whole shebang (after masking off the
interior w/ a cardboard cutout of the windshield.) Then Wed. am or perhaps
afternoon I'll give it the top coat (I usually use 3 coats of primer and 3 of
top enamel).
Hopefully the windshield I ordered today will be in by Thurs. and that'll be
installed  by the glass pros - mainly for warranty purposes. Then I'm on to
the next project, and the next,  and the......

Thanks everyone for the helpful info regarding said windshield.  Talk w/
you'all later.   David-Bernie-Bernstein
