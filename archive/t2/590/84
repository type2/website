i've had good results with VHT only if the parts are sandblasted first. the
silver 1500 degree VHT works well, but if the parts are NOT blasted it will
just flake off. 

if you have new exhaust parts, or slightly used ones, ceramic coating is the
ticket. it adds a bunch of cost to the parts, but it seems to prevent
rusting more or less completely, which actually saves money in the long run.
after 2+ years including some ontario winter driving (slap, slap, bad owner,
you shouldn't do that to your bus...) my ceramic coated heater boxes and
muffler are still rust free.
