Tom, the VW transporter is an MPV - Multipurpose Passenger Vehicle.   In no 
way is it an RV - Recreational Vehicle.

There is a US Code legal definition of an MPV, and your Westy is so 
classified.  I believe that not all states hold the same definiton for MPV, 
but for all that concerns the VW transporter (buillt on a truck chassis and 
can carry no more than 10 people), the states are in line.

I am not aware of any Department of Transportation public law definition for 
Recreational Vehicle.  Since it does not apply to the VW Westy, I am not 
interested.

Barry sends.
