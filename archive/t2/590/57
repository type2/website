Subject: Re: [T2] what part's do I need????

I opened the ball on this discussion a few weeks ago...what we have is
called "negative camber" and the only way to fix it is to reset the spring
plates. Yes resetting the spring plates is a fairly involved job. Check the
archives for "negative camber" or "spring plates" for more info.

Good luck,
