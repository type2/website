Subject: Re: [T2] shipping tranny

A 002 or 091 trans weighs approx 90 lbs. If shipping a used trans, drained, place in a garbage bag inside the box. If any gear oil 
leaks out it can get held up for a long time  and extra charges will be placed on the shippment. UPS fees really go up after 70 
lbs and Fed Ex after 90 (I think). UPS from east coast to west coast is approx 50 dollars.
