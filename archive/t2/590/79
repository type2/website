I shipped my 73 tranny from Colorado Springs to Oklahoma last year via UPS
and seem to recall it cost about $45.  A few years back I shipped my Porsche
901 tranny from San Antonio, TX to Albuquerque, NM for about the same.

I seem to recall it weighed in around 75 pounds.  You can get a good
guestimate with a bathroom scale.

I've discovered recently that UPS has some nasty little "oversize" and
"overweight" penalties and have found FedEx to be cheaper (and quicker) for
big/heavy things.  Box the sucker up in a box-within-a-box with plenty of
styrofoam padding (the solid kind that TV's always have, not peanuts) and
call it good.  And remember to be nice to the guy/gal at the shipping
counter and offer to move the thing around for them.

NOTE:  Do NOT ship the tranny unless you've COMPLETELY drained the fluid!
Besides making it weigh more and making a complete freaking mess, it may
actually be illegal (do they consider 90-wt oil hazardous?)
