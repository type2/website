LoL at the brake lights only come on with the key on. That wasted 2
days of my troubleshooting time before I figured that out.
<embarrassed> I thought it was a law that they had to come on no
matter what. Oops.

Ratwell did provide a simply perfect response. Beers next time you're

While it's possible a wire is responsible for your fuel guage woes,
there's one big reason I doubt it: It's the only electrical thing that
was still working correctly on my bus when I got it! Knock on wood.

I would love for BD to have a Left Coast branch. Especially one in,
say, Anaheim? ;-) I can't help but wonder if a shipping warehouse
couldn't be opened here... Though we Californians would have to pay
sales tax then. :-(

Back to chasing the "hazards-come-on-when-using-the-turn-signal" fun
I'm having...
