You bet James, that 1600 has to work even harder to push your bus along
compared to the 2000.  The RPM range of the type 1 engine is a little less
than the later engines, but I would still keep the RPM's above 2800 and in
the mid 3000's if pulling hills, or driving in hot temps.

Does the same logic hold true for the 1600 SP?  I'm
driving my first bus with an upright and wondered if
it likes to be revved or am i overworking the beast?
