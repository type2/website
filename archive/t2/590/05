Subject: Electronic Ignition

Hi all,

My 70 bus has Pertronix Ignitor electronic ignition in the 009 distributor
(for now until I get the proper distributor). It came with the bus, I didn't
install it, there for I don't know anything about it. Is there any
adjustment? If I hook up a dwell meter, what should it read, the same as
points?

Thanks,

Joey
