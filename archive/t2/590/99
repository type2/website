Subject: westy screen window clips??

I put in new screens for my screen windows that go on outside of 
louvered windows in 74 westy.  SOME HOW, i've misplaced those little 
plastic clips that hold the screen window in place.  I have looked 
EVERYWHERE for replacement clips.  Does anyone know where I can get 
these little clips or know of a home remedy to keep those screen 
windows in place?  Like to keep louvered windows open at night while 
camping.  the bugs can get petsy while sleeping.

Also, any one have a good brake servo booster?  or someplace that can 
replace the diaphragm?

I'm a free spirit and refuse to replace sender unit.  ran out of gas 
middle of nowhere oklahoma plenty of times.
Peace
