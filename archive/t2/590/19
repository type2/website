Subject: Rear wiring/lighting problems

Ok, first off, my turn signals DO work.  But not the others.  No Brake,
no Parking, and I haven't checked reverse.  But I think I know where the
problem lies. Coming out of the firewall is a wire bundle. It goes back
to the hatch and splits into 3 bundles. One bundle goes to the right
lighting assembly. One bundle goes across the roof of the engine
compartment and goes to the Left lighting assembly, and the third bundle
go nowhere, just dead-end in 3 wires.  The wire colors seem to be 'a
pukey yellowish green color' a 'solid brown' color, and a 'brown with a
white stripe running lengthwise'.  I think the 'pukey yellowish green'
one should goto the side parking light. Theirs a similar colored one on
the other side's marker light. I'm assuming that the brown should goto
ground. But I don't have a clue about the Brown with White, or the Light
Blue. ::SIGH:: Anyone wanna tellme where these wires go on YOUR bus? 
 
Here's the pics. I have the full size images if you need more detail. I
also have MORE images, but these ones show it the best. 
 
These are the three wires coming out of the bundle going to nowhere.

and 
 
This is the inside of the compartment where the three bundles split
apart. The one on the right is going outside and can be seen in the
above pic. The left one goes to the lights, the top one goes over to the
other side of the compartment.

Their is also a heavy gauge, light blue wire running from one of the
lights on the right side, up and over the roof, but it's clipped
half-way across about in the middle and theirs nothing on the other side
that looks like it should connect to it.

I have the wiring diagram, but I can't make sense of it. The way I read
it, the only light blue wire that should be anywhere near their should
be the one that goes from the (F9) "parking brake control lightswitch"
and the (K7) "dual circuit break warning light". And I can't find any
brown wire with a white strip going lengthwise. I SOOOOoooooo suck with
wiring diagrams though. 
 
The diagram and keys are found HERE.
