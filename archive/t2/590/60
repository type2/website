Subject: Westy need seatbelts in NJ?

Hey guys-

Sorry this isnt exactly a tech question, but I thought you would all know, if
anybody does.  Since the inside of a westy is much like a camper, are
seatbelts neccessary?  My 73 has none besides the driver and passenger front
seats, no belts in the back.  Is it illegal to ride people back there w/o
belts?  And if it is, where do I find some.

It seems like it might not be neccesary since you can hang out in the back of
an RV while its on the road, without seatbelts I think.

Thanks all
-ToM
