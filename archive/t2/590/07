There is no adjustment to the Pertronix.  One of the reasons to love it 
(and any other electronic ignition, for that matter).

You should see a solid 54 degrees of dwell.

Since you mentioned distributor, I'll take the opportunity to plug the 
SVDA from aircooled.net.  I recommend you go with electronic ignition 
in it, as well (ACN sells both Pertronix and Compufire -- I use 
Pertronix in mine).
