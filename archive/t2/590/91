Subject: Misc. Questions

I was gonna troubleshoot the Tail Lights and Marker Lights today, and do
the Brake Lights tomorrow. But I found that my changing bulbs, taking
apart all the connectors and sanding everything clean, it all works just
fine now. It's never as bad as I tend to think it is. Things were always
the other way around on my honda.  So now I have nothing to do on my bus
untill my parts start arriving. :(  
 
So I've got a few questions to ask about various things. It's a 76 combi
btw. 
 
1: My brake lights don't come on without they key in the Run position.
Is that normal? 
2: On the bottom of the fuse box their are three boxes. They look like
relay boxes. What are these to? Is one the blinker thingie? 
3: What all lights are supposed to be ON on the dash when the key is in
the run position but while it's not running? 
4: Why does stuff take SOOOooo long coming from the East Coat, and on
that note, why doesn't BusDepot have a west coat branch? :) 
5: Why am I finding myself NOT wanting to go and get the gas gauge
working in my bus? I think it's just a disconnected wire.
 
Cheers
