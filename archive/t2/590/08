Subject: Re: How Hot is too Hot for Oil Temperature

I am measuring oil temperature at the oil gallery plug (near pressure relief
valve).  I bought a VDO gauge because they are readily available,
affordable, and have a wide user base.  And yes I should test it with
boiling water.  If I had a dollar for every time
someone said see Muir or Berg. . .  . . .well anyway, thank you for your
reply.  Some times I think Muir and Berg were too conservative.  I also
suspect that some things have changed since they were doing their work.

Thanks to everyone else who replied too.  I am still looking to find out
what the high temperature limits are for oil and heads are.  I know there
probably isn't a simple answer to this question.  Does anyone know what type
of aluminum type 1 heads are made of and at what temperature they lose
strength?  Maybe it is in Muir, but call me too lazy to find out.

I did read that most dino oils have a flashpoint of 400f or above.  This is
when the oil starts to burn off on cylinder walls and such.  I also read
that the hotter it gets the more viscous it becomes and at some point can
not maintain oil pressure.  We all know this from watching our oil pressure
drop when our engines gets hot.  Another interesting fact is that the
polymers used to make multi-grade oils seem to burn off at a lower
temperature then a lot of us run.  Maybe this is a good reason to switch to
single grade oil or synthetic.  Anyways, just searching for group knowledge
here.

Thanks again,

Douglas S.
