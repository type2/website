Subject: amp fuel injection pins 

okay i found out what the crimp side of the bosch fuel injection pins are
called.  most places are simply referring to them as non insulated open
barrel crimp connectors.  so with the help of other list members i found
the crimper and crimper dies that i want.  know i just need to find the
amp pins used in the bosch two pin (flat blade) female plugs.
commonly referred to as Junior-Power-Type:

i've been thumbing around on the amp site (amp.com) trying to find a part
number for the pins. i went to my local old school electronics shop and we
looked through their year 2000 amp catalog but it wasn't in there.  they
told me if i could find the amp part number that they could probably get
it.  so the amp website is getting confusing for me.  i have uncrimped
pins sitting on my desk that i bought from the dealer many years ago but
they are no longer available damn that new etka!  so i am sitting here
trying to match the pins to the ones i am finding on amps site.  the
problem is that i amfinding to many pins!

i am selecting the proper sized that i need for the wire .5-1.0mm or
16-22awg but then i have a other things that i have to specify.
such as:

contact material
contact mating area plating

i looked at the pins and it looks like they are tin, but thats a guess i
guess they could be silver also.  so if i select tin i get CuSn4 and
CuFe2 to pick from for contact material.  does anyone have any ideas
about these pins?
