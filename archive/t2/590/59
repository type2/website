Subject: Pop Top problems

Last Night I met a new westie owner here in Saskatoon.
He saw my sign selling my tires and seatbelts.

He just picked up a 78 westie.
We swapped over the tires putting his old ones on my parts van
and I put the seatbelts in for him. It was nice to get to know him.

The previous 'artists' who owned the 78 put a heavy rack on the top
of the poptop and it's bowed theroof out behind the driverside. When the
roof is down it doesn't snug up close to the roof of the van. Anything we can
do to fix it? It's also cracked the rear corners of the poptop. (which can be
fixed)  First step I agree is to take the rack off.

Here's a pic of his van with new tires and the rack. I have no closeups of the
rear
damage and the bowed driverside.

Ideas? Don't really want to have to find a new poptop
