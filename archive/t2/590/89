Would it be a good idea to replace the rusted bolts (from heater boxes
to 4->1 and 4->1 to muffler) with stainless steel ones? Figured it
might be better for removing in the future, not to mention stronger as
the rusting continues.

        Paul, this sounds like a good idea to me, assuming you can find the 
stainless fasteners conveniently.  I found some copper-plated 10 mm nuts which 
are recommended for BMW exhaust manifold applications.... then a Benz buddy 
told me that MB uses stainless nuts, much easier to source and probably a 
better long-term solution.  You may be aware that stainless fasteners may have 
slightly lower 'grade' so you need to torque them carefully.  I was also told 
that MB uses ordinary steel studs, and the stainless nuts do not seize-up over 
time.  Will be interested to hear what others say.....  Glenn
