Rotate your tires. In the stock form, the front tires lean out a bit, the rear tires lean in and if you rotate the tires (front to back) you'll wear them evenly. 

Now if you still have wear problems, you need to consider replacing or adjusting the trailing arms bushings nearest to the transmission.
