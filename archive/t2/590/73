I know someone else that had this problem, too. Paging Mr. Brown...Mr. Brown 
please answer the courtesy phone. IIRC the problem was the seal or maybe the 
glass...well maybe the bus. I don't remember, but he did order a new seal or 
glass and never cut the bus.

The seals I spoke of earlier that I installed were from Bus Depot. The ones 
I previously installed in my bus were Bus Depot as well. I have not had a 
problem with them yet. The first ones I installed I did by myself. Well me 
and my little partner

To date I have had no problems out of the seals except one. The seam of the 
seal some how ended up right in the corner of the window and is now cracking 
I see a split in the future, I guess this is my own fault and I can not 
blame Bus Depot, but it is not getting wet in the bus and it is doing it's 
job.
