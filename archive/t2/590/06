Subject: Re: [T2] Electronic Ignition

Hey-

Pertronix is a magnetic induction system, right?  I may be wrong, but I
wouldnt think there'd be any dwell reading, since thats only defined with
points.  And there is no adjusting those systems.

I beleve it works just by magnetic induction....  An electric field is
basically transported across a gap by the magnetic materials every time the
unit crosses itself.  Much like the points with the cam on the distributor.

I had one of those, by a company like computech or something, but it wasnt
working right so I went back to points.  I think I may try to figure out
what the problem was and put that magnetic system back in eventually, since
there are no moving parts to go bad.

Good Luck
