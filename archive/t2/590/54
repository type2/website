Subject: what part's do I need????

I have a '78 bus that I have "westfakiaized", with a '74 interior.

I have noticed that my rear tires wear on the inside edges to
almost bald while showing little wear on the out side.
Meaning (I assume) the rear wheels are tilting (top in, bottom out)
I just replaced the wheel bearing/axel on one side, with no noticeable
difference. I seem to remember reading that I need to replace a bushing(s),
on the torsion bar(s). Is this all need to replace??
If so how long will this take? How big of a PITA is this??
Is their any "gotcha-ya"s I need to lookout for??

Thanks
