I don't know what the law is up there but it still hurts in a crash.... 

As a former Navy MP, I went to a few fatal crash scenes. Went to 2 where seatbelts for the back seat rider would have made the difference. The front seat folks were okay, the backseat passenger flew all over the place and in 1 case flew out the borken rear window, the other smashed all the windows with her head. 

But it's your life. 

I've often wondered what happens in a BIG RV during a crash - how much of all that cabinetry comes lose and fly around. We looked inside a $250K camper bus at the local Airstream dealer. NICE!!! Even had a staircase (oak!) that went to a hatch in the roof where you could sit on a patio with fold up railings... Oh and real ceramic tile floors downstairs. A different world...
