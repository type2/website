If the seal will go on the window there really shouldn't be anything wrong
with the seal. It's pretty straightforward, however sometimes they can be a
bear!! We have had to start at the bottom and then gently tap with a rubber
mallet (careful!) to seat it. It must be seated well for the top to follow
suit. Applying some gently but firm pressure on the top as you go will help
too. Take your time. Make sure the string doesn't slide out and if it does
get the seal right before going ahead. I have had success with a very thin
screwdriver getting the seal to correct itself as we go. The seal will rip
though, so be careful.

Just keep going at it...we have had to start over several times to get it
right.
