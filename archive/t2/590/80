I've tried two high temp paints and both were a disappointment. The last one burned off:

I thought I'd give it one more try and this time I used VHT. The finish is certainly matte and rough and not that appealing at first but so far it's held up better than the other two after the initial curing I gave it (The muffler temps aren't hot enough to adhere to the curing instructions which claim the paint won't be solvent resitant. So far water hasn't been a problem). It also smelled very bad for several days but the smell has now abated. I would park the car and then get a strong whiff from it.

I've put 2k miles on it so far with no deterioration and I'll report again in 6 months.

Definitely. There is no benefit to using anything else.
