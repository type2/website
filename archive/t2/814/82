Courtney,

Far easier to replace them....and use a brass wire brush on a dremel tool
to clean up the other half(actual spade part)...with the battery 
disconnected!

Half of them are going to have serious corrosion at the crimp end 
anyway...wait till you cut one off and then examine it closely...use 
shrink tubing when you go back together with new connectors.

Cheers, dave
