Subject: Checking compression on an automatic engine out of the Bus

I just bought a 1977 automatic Westfalia.  The engine was removed
because it wasn't running correctly but I was not able to get more
specifics on the problem.  I'm thinking it could have been a FI problem
but before I put the engine back in and hook up the FI I wanted to see
if I could determine the condition of the engine and I figured one way
was to do a compression check.

The only two ways I figured to check the compression on an automatic was
to reinstall the engine in the vehicle or install a flywheel on the
engine and then use my bellhousing and starter that I have to test
engines out of a vehicle.

Does anyone have any other ways to check the compression on an
automatic?

Thanks,
Kevin
