Subject: Alternator hook-up

Hi all,

I replaced recently the generator of our bay-window bus (1969) with an
alternator I got from the previous owner.
I now wonder about the correct hook-up of the wires. I have this thick red
wire connected to B+, the green wire connected to DF... is this OK? I
suppose the brown wire is ground, should I connect it to D-? And leave D+
alone?

I wanted to be sure before starting the engine...

Bart
