I hate these things. Replaced  them last year. They worked so so and
then quit working...as in middle red lever would not move. I had a
problem with the right cable because it was took too much force to
close that the cable bent near where it attaches to the lever. So
now that the bend is there, the cable tends to bend rather than push
through the housing to close the right side flapper. Ok, so I order
a new right side cable..again. Remove the old one. The lever operates
the left hand cable just fine. Install brand new right cable, hook
everything up at the flapper (all parts there, flapper moves freely).
I can't get the lever to close the flapper...new cable now has bend
in it. Even when I force the cable straight, it will not push through
the cable housing to close the flapper. NOW I have to order cable #3.
What's up with this? I don't understand why the right side is so
difficult to operate. Anyone else have this problem?  Can I run the
cable on the outside of the tube to be back and attach with wire ties?
BTW, I did lube the cable as I put it through the tube.

I'm tempted to find a small selenoid to operate the flappers and just
use a switch to open/close.
