Subject: Re: [T2] Weird signal light behavior?

I had exactly the same problem.  I had to re-do the
connector on the light and checked and cleaned all of
the ground connectors.  It hasn't done it since.  The
connector on the light was barely holding the hot wire
on.  I removed it and re-soldered the post.  Works
like a charm now.  Cheers...KR
