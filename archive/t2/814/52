I just installed a pair of these I collected on my own.
I also have a pair of aftermarket camper sliders w/ screens I collected from
$bay that I will not be using and would let go of cheap.

You will actually receive a 221845321B from Just Kampers if you order these.
If you look up the "B" part number on BD it has an incorrect listing so order
the "A" anyway.

BD says they fit the sliders and the rear side glass only windows.  I
installed one on my 78-79 slider, and am preparing to install one on the rear
glass.
