Subject: Weird signal light behavior?

My signal lights work normally when I am driving and sitting still, UNLESS I
put the brake lights on. If I do, the signal light speeds up. I find that
weird, since you would think the increased electrical load of the brake
lights coming on would make them slow down, not speed up. Any thoughts on
this? I'm thinking they get a better ground when the taillight circuit is
brought into play, so speed up? Just a guess on my part.
