Subject: Re: [T2] Hmmm, 68-70 master cylinder into later bus?

Courtney asked:


 In checking the info on these master cylinders, I see the earlier MC has a
larger bore, allowing for more pedal effort, prob because these buses weren't power brakes. Would one of these
mount up to a later Bay like my 77 to give a greater braking effect?? :-) Heh-heh, you KNOW you gotta play if
you can. :-b

Uh, not really.....
1) the center-to-center nipple measurement of the 68-70 masters are 100 mm.  Vs 85 mm on the 71-79. 69-70
lower reservoirs are crap material.

2) 71 and up masters for bolting up to boosters have an extension AND a square groove for the o-ring. 68-79
have neither. You would have a massive vacuum leak.

3) 71 and up masters are designed for disc in the front/drum rear. The chamber is larger for the disc
calipers. They have more volume, therefore the master volume is larger.

Here is a pic of the 68-69 master:

Bottom line:  BAD swap!
