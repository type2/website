Hi Mike,

The solenoid doesn't have to have an inch  of throw if it were  
attached to the flapper arm closer to the pivot. A door-lock solenoid  
should have enough torque to do the job without drawing too much power.

But you make a good point about volume adjustment. I suppose a  
stepper motor would be a better choice than a solenoid. Up here in  
the Great White North the adjustment is a moot point: when you need  
heat then you usually need ALL that the system has to give.


Happy trails,
