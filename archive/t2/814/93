Subject: Hmmm, 68-70 master cylinder into later bus?

In checking the info on these master cylinders, I see the earlier MC has a
larger bore, allowing for more pedal effort, prob because these buses weren
t power brakes. Would one of these mount up to a later Bay like my 77 to
give a greater braking effect?? :-) Heh-heh, you KNOW you gotta play if you
can. :-b
