Subject: Re: [T2] Alternator hook-up

From Bart Massaer:

 I replaced recently the generator of our bay-window bus (1969) with an
alternator I got from the previous owner.
I now wonder about the correct hook-up of the wires. I have this thick red wire connected to B+, the green
wire connected to DF... is this OK? I
suppose the brown wire is ground, should I connect it to D-? And leave D+ alone?

 I wanted to be sure before starting the engine...

It sounds like you have a mid 70's bug Motorola alternator.

Does it have a odd shaped M in a circle on the edge near the pulley?
Does it have a white ceramic section on top held down with four screws with 3 terminals in the middle that
resembles the back of a headlight?

If you answered YES to both of those questions...... you HAVE to find the bug that alternator came of and get
the voltage regulator under the left side of the rear seat and the harness between it and the alternator.
