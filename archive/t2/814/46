Seems like a ripoff to me, the Mexicans were/are still building them, so I don't see any reason for this. You can substitute a CB pump for it though. Check out http://cbperformance.com/catalog.asp?ProductID=195
 
32 dollars, made for the 914/Type 4

Why?!?!?! What is it about the Type 4 oil pump that makes it $200 more than
a type 1?
