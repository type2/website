Subject: Board for Bed

I have a board I used in my passenger bus to make a bed. It's 3/4" plywood
Varathaned with a full length hinge down the middle. You fold down your back
seat and lay this on top and you have a good sized flat bed. I had a 2x4
front support but space out and tossed it but would be easy to make a new
one.

It fits my '71 but I changed the back seat to a later model fold down type.
Would probably fit most later bays.

I'm in North Phoenix and if you pick it up it's yours otherwise off to the
dump. I probably won't be answering e-mails until next weekend.
