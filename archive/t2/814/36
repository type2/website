Subject: Re: [T2] Plug color and mixture - 78 Bus

I would think the left one is closer to normal, and the right one is running
lean/hot. But I suck at diagnosing plugs.. ;-)

Also, you don't need to replace the injectors, just send them off to Cruzin
Performance to be cleaned, flowed, and benchmarked. Much cheaper. If this is
your daily driver, see if you can get a set of injectors from the junkyard
and send them off while driving on your current ones.
