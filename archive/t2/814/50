I've been off of the list for awhile, but I've been
reading posts daily for 
awhile again.  I went to Ron's website to see the
'specials' he's got going 
right now, and I see(or don't see) that the sliders
are gone.  Did Ron 
announce this, and if he did, did any of you guys
grab extras?!  I contacted 
BD and Karen tells me that they have no plans to
replace them.  What do I do 
now?   Start scroungin' for used ones again?  Are
the replacement seals 
still available, and if so - through whom?

I have about 8 pairs of 78-79 middle sliders. I have
not tried to sell them but unless you are near me
[Fresno, Calif] the shipping will be tremendous and
not insurable.

The outer seals are available from Bus Depot:

or West Coast Metric:
