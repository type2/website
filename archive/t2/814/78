Gasoline works wonders at getting that pesky moisture out of your skin and
hair.

I was almost to work. A mile away. When the bus showed symptoms of fuel
starvation, I pulled over. Into the driveway of a brand new condo complex
(street too narrow) I went. No fuel leaks, but no rattle from the craptastic
Facet pump. I checked the wiring, all good. I pulled the wire and touched it
to 12v and felt the pump click, but that's it. One big solid CLICK. (Yes,
there's gas in the tank. . . As you'll see.)

When I pulled my engine last I installed the mechanical fuel pump I got off
eBay a couple months ago (remember that mess?). I hadn't hooked it up
because I didn't have any proper 5mm fuel line. Well, it looked like this
was as good a time as any.

Had my wife pick me up and take me to Pep Boys (nearest place) and got some
3/16" (4.8mm) fuel line and some clamps. I go back and hook it all up, looks
good. Get in the bus and start it... GAS POURING OUT OF THE PUMP!

Needless to say, I ran back to the drivers seat and hit the ignition. I went
under and double and triple checked the hoses while gas was still pouring
out of the pump (until I got the clamps on... I'm smelling wonderful
now...). So it's not the hoses.

Tow truck time.

Bus is now at home, waiting for me to fix. Sigh.
