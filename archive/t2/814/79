Archives are hard for me to search too, because I don't know how, but trust
that everything IS in there.

Everything has a failure point, but servos aren't short lived compared to some
parts.
My only thought is that you could test it and perhaps use the $ on needed
parts.

Servo initial test:

Take off the master cylinder, insert a piece of cardboard or something into
the hole that can reach the bottom of the inside of the servo.  If there is
more than 1/2" of fluid coming up the dipstick, then it is likely that your MC
has been leaking brake fluid enough to compromise the servo's diaphram.  If
not, why not change the MC ((-at-) $20 for Brazilian) and see what happens?

If you disconnect any of the brake fluid lines during the process, then yes.

No reason not to put a new O-ring on the MC.

Do you have the green Bentley manual yet?  It's required reading.
