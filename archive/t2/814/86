Subject: Can I run 2L engine without od covers, (bottom tin)

Just wondering if I can run the engine for about 20 minutes without the
bottom tin that protects the pushrods? It goes between the heat exchangers
and the engine bottom? I want to check for pushrod tube leakage and other
possible leak areas?



Thanks,

Courtney
