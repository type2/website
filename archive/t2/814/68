Here is the experiment of the day :

*** The battle of the timing lights ***

Snap on timing light (around 150$ I guess) from Bob
                        ~~~~ Versus ~~~~~
Kragen timing light (around 49$ for the light and other goodies in the
"tune-up kit) from Arnaud

Game payed at 8am 11/04/2005 in Leucadia.

We checked the timing on a 1600 engine on running the bench, running
what looked like a pretty new 009. Degreed pulley. Checked timing for
one light after the other

Timing measured at idle
- Snap-on : 9deg BTDC
- Kragen : 9deg BTDC

This is one more reason for me to not believe that timing lights can
have as much as 2 degrees reading difference.

Happy friday - Arnaud
