It's only available from VW, afaik, and any stock that is available is
essentially NOS, that part has not been manufactured for many years. Why
does that make it expensive? I am not sure.

The Eberspacher fuel pump for a late BN4 or BA6 gas heater is over 600.00
from the dealer. I don't know why they even bother to list parts like that,
honestly.
