Check that you have the right wires plugged into the right bulbs in your
taillights. Also check the bulbs, and make sure the ground wires back there
are clean and tight. They plug into spades that are screwed into the body.

It took me some serious time to get all those wires straightened out when I
got my bus. I still have one problem to figure out: Why when the brakes are
pressed I get power to the ignition. I think the + wire to the brake switch
is run to the ignition switch somehow. But I used to have fast signals, then
I'd get a solid signal. Now the signals work as they should (except both
arrows flash when the signals are used. The right lights outside flash,
though.)
