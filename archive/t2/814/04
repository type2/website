Not surprising.  We had a Darwin event during a desert campout back in the
'80s.  We were all sitting around the campfire and noticed that one couple
wasn't there.  We figured that they were in their van doing what young
couples do, so we weren't concerned.  After a couple of hours we decided
to go over and give them a hard time.  We banged on the van to no avail.
We were about to leave them alone when someone smelled the scent of
burning charcoal.  We literally broke into the van to find that these
idiots had taken a burning hibachi into the van with them and closed the
doors tight.  They were in there, alive but unconscious.  It took quite a
while to wake them up and they had headaches from hell for the next day.

I shudder to think of how close we came to leaving this couple alone for
the night.

Since then, I have never left anything burning when I sleep.  I'd rather
be cold than dead.
