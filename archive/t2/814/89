Subject: an another leak story !!! 

Hi Volk !! 

With a 10W40 oil , I need to add a quarter of litter every 400 Miles, it smell burned oil all the time, after driving the van , oil are dreeping on the floor (1 to 4 drops a minute) and slow down as the engine cool down. This is much better (and acceptable to me) when I use 20W50 oil , but the  symptom are the same , just less ! 
I cleaned up the area under the engine and ran the engine. No visible leaks but it seems to be seeping a little from everywhere.  Maybe from the oil cooler, the crankshaft/cooling fan seal, and/or the oil cooler pressure relief valve.  The 20W50 oil I put in didn't help looking for leaks - it seems to seal pretty well.

I plan to take the shrouds off, put back some 10W40 oil in the engine to help find the leak and re-torque the cylinder heads again.

Do you think it would help, any other thought ?

Thanks

Have a great WE, hope it is going to rain ;-))) , can't wait for the snow to show up !!!
