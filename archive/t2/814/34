Do a leak-down test instead. You don't have to spin the engine, only rotate
it by hand. You need the tester and a compressor. Do a google search for
"leak down tester". You can make one for about 30 bucks give or take. It
will cost more if you want fancy gauges, but a rudimentary one can be made
for really cheap.
