Let us know if you find a solenoid with a throw of about an inch!  Since 
it would have to be always on or off, the heat would have no in between 
adjustment?  In a 75, we attached a wire to the lever and ran it through 
an eyebolt fastened to the flat triangle supporting the rear jack 
entrance.  The end of the wire fastens to a key ring you just pull and 
wrap around the bolt.

  use a switch to open/close.
