Subject: Friday bus sighting

i watched the movie Black Hawk Down this past week & there are
a couple of busses in it.

one is definitely a 68-72. i could tell from the bumper & low
turn signal mounting holes.

well, they aren't really busses, just rusty shells sitting in the
battle zone of Mogadishu. i think one of them might have taken
a slug or 2.

happy friday,
