Subject: [T2] RE: rain gutter repair

I saw a splitty bus from San Diego once, with a totally rotted out roof, due
to the salt atmosphere there I guess. Personally, if I saw a bus with rotted
out gutters, I would consider it a parts bus and find one with fewer body
issues. Tom

1 response (Thanks, Bradley)  I guess I'm the only one with rusted out
gutters.  I would have thought that someone's been down this road.
