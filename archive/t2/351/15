The boot is in very good shape, so it just seems like it is not snug enough around the shaft. I read in Bently that these later type boots do not use hose clamps like the ones earlier. Has anyone had this problem before?

At the time you packed the joints, did you wonder if you'd put in too much grease?

Besides the special pliers needed to fit the stock pinch clamps? No. If it's leaking make it stop.

Some people fit cable ties.
