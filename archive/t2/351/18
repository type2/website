Subject: Fuel smell and pump

Hi List,

Just got my '72 camper back on the road after a long hibernation for the
winter.  I have developed quite a fuel smell after a full fill up at the gas
station.  It lasts for about 20 miles or so then disappears until the next
fill up.  Some folks told me it is the rubber "fuel filler neck".  I checked
a few places and unfortunately they are NLA.. Are there any places to get
them?  Any alternatives to use?

Also wondering if anyone could tell me how to get in there to check the
filler neck.  I cant seem to find any access bolts where the fuel door is on
the outside of the bus.  Do I have to remove the gas tank or something?

Also.  Fuel pump is weeping a drip of gas every so often.  Any sources for a
Type IV mechanical fuel pump rebuild kit?

Thanks,
Ed
