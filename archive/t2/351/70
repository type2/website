Subject: RE: [T2] Color Wiring Diagram for 71 Westy?

I bought a VW shop manual that has the color wiring diagrams from 69/9
thru 76. There are 2 wiring diagrams for the '71, one up to august and
one after august. I will be glad to make copies for your critique and
send them. Of course, and here comes the shameless plug, I am sure you
would like to make a donation to the Type2 list. List donations have
slacked off in these hard economic times and any amount would be
appreciated. TBear
