the Orange book that I have is listed as being for the 74-78 bus and it is
printed and listed only as Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft (VW inc) mine
appears to be an original and the electrical diagrams are in B&W and
pretty much the same as the Bentley,  other things are better but not the
electrical diagrams.

what I have done with the electrical diagrams is that I have enlarged them
on a copy machine and followed certain tracks with a highlighter.  not
original but more readable
