Subject: Re: [T2] Todd Hill transmisions:

From the sound of it, the guy who lost $300 and 6 months waiting might have
come out ahead-at least he didn't actually get the inferior transmission!

<  Who is Todd Hill? Is this good or bad?

Bad.  He disappeared a couple of years back.  As I understand it, I am one
of the few people that actually received a transmission back from him.  It
is still in my bus, but it has whines and drops out of second gear on
deceleration.
