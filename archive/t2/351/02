Subject: Everybus 71 seats for sale

Hey All,
I just replaced my front seats in my 71 Westy with
later model more comfy ones (mostly for the wifey!)
Anyway, the stock seats I took out of the 71 are MINT,
they really could be show quality. They are low back
buckets with white basket weave vinyl, did i mention
they are in excellent condition? If I keep them in my
garage, they will just end up getting trashed, so I
want to offer them for sale to some one who can use
them. $50 gets the pair of excellent seats plus gets
delivery to Everybus.
If you are intrested please email me at harmony(-at-)buszen.com please DO NOT
simply reply to this message because I am sending from an alternate email
address because the Type2 listserver is bouncing all my message from my
primary account because it is a yahoo.com address, and the list is
filtering them out because of some kind of problem with Yahoo being
spam-friendly or something.
Anyway, Let me know if you want 'em!
Peace, John Baker
