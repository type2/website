Subject: Quiet - everything is relative  and brown *ground* wires

Well first I got the bus running and I must admit that it probably 
would have been running a day or so earlier if I had listened
Brown wires on Volkswagons are most often ground wires!!
At least two people pointed this out to me and I did not listen - well 
not at first
Once I put my mystery brown wire to ground I got spark and all was very 
well from there thank you!!!

Now the quiet part. This engine pull was also a tranny pull. The old 
tranny had a bad pinion bearing and it made a racket of a whine in  
lower gears
My maiden voyage tonight was actually quiet!!!! No whine ------- 
ahhhhhhh I new I would like this.
Sorry for my thickheadedness and not getting it right away.
Thanks to all who helped!!!!!
