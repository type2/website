Mark,

I believe that busdepot.com may have some of it....bus-boys.com and Rocky 
mountain motor works....RMMW is where i got mine several years ago.

Most of it is from Denmark, but there is a guy in England that apparently 
makes some of it as well.  Look back thru the archives...never mind..here 
it is    http://www.ahschofield.co.uk/home.htm

Cheers, dave
