Subject: other free gifts with VW purchase

Hi Volks:

This a follow up to an earlier posting concerning free gifts with VW
purchase.
Please correct or add to the following list.

1. Bus Driver hat given away with an early 60's Bus. Apparently the hat came
in different sizes which caused additional logistic problems for VW.

2. VW Watch with VW logo ?? came with what car?

3. Book: Think small with a 1967 Beetle

4. Trek Mountain bike with later models of Golf's & Jetta's

5. Other freebies ????
