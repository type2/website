Subject: Leaky CV boot

Hi volks,

One of my inner cv boots is leaking grease between the boot and the shaft. It looks like it oozes out and then gets "flung" around the underside. The boot is in very good shape, so it just seems like it is not snug enough around the shaft. I read in Bently that these later type boots do not use hose clamps like the ones earlier. Has anyone had this problem before? Does anyone see a reason not to put a hose clamp on?

Thanks for the input!
