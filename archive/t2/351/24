Subject: friday..minimal bus content..bad day

ok.

This is why everything takes longer.....

So it's thursday after a long day at work.  I am looking forward to
polishing up my vent wing window for the 78 bus(bus content), but *this* 
is what I come home to!

Oh s***t....ummmmm..this could be bad

Did I buy that part I needed for the chain saw?..yes..sitting on the 
kitchen  countner.

Do I have 2 cycle oil for the chain saw?...cause I used the last treated 
gas a couple of week ago....

Folks who live in the country will understand, you city folks may 
not<grin>.

We had high winds in the Ozarks today, but not too bad....well maybe...

Never did get the vent wing polished for the bus tonight.....   :-()

1 and 1/2 hrs later...

Cheers, dave
