Subject: RE: Magical Self adjusting timing - dizzy problem

Hi John,

	If the threads on the dizzy are stripped, the only way that I can think of
to fix this problem would be to retap the hole up to the next size machine
screw available (I think the original is an M4).  You might be able to use a
Compufire module instead of the points with the dizzy in its current state.
With the Compufire there shouldn't be much of any screw pressure needed, as
there is no physical contact with the distributor cam.  A drop of loc-tite
on the threads should be all you need, even if your threads are partially
stripped.  Keep the 009 loaded and ready as a backup in case the Compufire
ever fails...  Some of the other guys might be able to tell you if this
would work for sure.

						Good Luck!
							Jay
