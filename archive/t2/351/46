Subject: Front floor replacement panel for '72

List,
Where do we '68 - '72 bus owners find a replacement floor panel for the
driver / passenger floor area, as well as where the wheel well meets the
floor, (mine has been vanishing over time..) ?  Can you "easily" modify a
'73 - '79 to fit?  I cannot seem to find a vendor who supplies these
panels?!?
Thanks in advance!
Mark
