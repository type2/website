Subject: Re: [T2] Leaky CV boot

Hi Blake,

You should never use a hose clamp on your CV boots as they are unbalanced. The clamps used had a compression section in them which although it results in an imbalence is much less than a hose clamp.

In the abscence of a prober CV boot clamp then a wide electrical tie wrap will do the job - cut the end off as close as possible to the ratchet grip to minimise the imbalance - which as a tei wrap is very light will be minimal.

Good luck

> One of my inner cv boots is leaking grease between the boot and the shaft. It looks like it oozes out and then gets "flung" around the underside. The boot is in very good shape, so it just seems like it is not snug enough around the shaft. I read in Bently that these later type boots do not use hose clamps like the ones earlier. Has anyone had this problem before? Does anyone see a reason not to put a hose clamp on?
