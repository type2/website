Subject: Wiring Diagrams

I've been able to print the vintagebus electrical diagram files on our plotters at work on 24x36 or 30x42 size paper for myself and my local volks-buddies.

My friend Nick posted the ones I did for his 66 bus up in his garage.

If anyone wants to pmail me with requests and are patient, I might consider printing out the lot of 68-79 files on large scale originals from which I can run blueprints.

No, not in color, but I believe there are text codes to the wires on them anyway right? (ie: brn/blk)
