> - `77 Sliding Door Inside Handle...

Someone mentioned that some pre-76 campers had a different handle than the
`77, that the older handle doesn't have the cap that covers the screw.  Are
these common?

Also, I remember the pics of the handle with the off-set shaft hole.  Will
the `77 handle work on these, or is the restoring spirit such that there
might be a demand for the off-set handle?

Thanks!
