     It's a matter of dollars. Splittys and there related cost have priced most people out of them and the new people can getting 
into buses afford bays so buy them instead.
  Splittys have become more of a weekend, once a month driver when they used to be daily drivers for a lot of people and these seem to all own bays now.
 I watch the post and would say it's the same people answering the same questions for the last few years.  
Then if a newbe ask a question a get hammered to check the archieves   New knowagable people seemed to
 have been chased away by the regulars.
    In the last couple years my calls on bay parts have outgrown my calls for split parts, even though I stock 3 times as many 
split parts now as I did 3 years ago, but also have to stock twice as many bay parts.
    The forums have taken a lot of people as it is easier to find info on one subject and to get replies with-out having to shuffle 
through tons of meaningless crap if you only need help on one thing.
    Trip reports are a thing of the past due to the regulars complaining  about the usless post on where you went
 (don't believe me seach the archieves on trip reports) what you did, etc.
   There are a lot of lurkers also. This list is good and hope it stays as/is. I have many a good friends I have met through 
this list and wouldn't trade those friendships for anything. I think the largest gathering of listys has been at the BBB events and maybe in 
January that can be revived'
