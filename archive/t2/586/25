Your timing couldn't be better!  I just got a really good deal on the
setup you need!  It works for pretty much any Bus or aircooled Vanagon
that used the old square York compressor. 

The compressor you need is a Sanden, not a Sanyo.  It is much more
efficient than the original York compressor; does a better job, and
easier on your engine. It's also cheaper, as replacement Yorks are now
up to $350 just because of their rarity, even though they use old
technology. We have in the past sold an adapter kit for $79.95 that
allowed you to make this conversion, and then you needed to buy a new
Sanden compressor for $299, so it would have set you back $380.

But I just got 4 kits that we can offer at a much cheaper price -
$219.95 complete.  This is a whole kit, including a remanufactured
Sanden compressor and clutch plus the adapter/mounting kit. Pretty much
everything you need except for the ends of the hoses. You will need your
local mechanic to fit new ends to your A/C hoses to match the Sanden
compressor.  (Most garages that do A/C work can do this.)  Also other
minor modification may or may not be required; air conditioning on
aircooled VW's was dealer-installed, so there can be idiosynscacies from
one installation to the next that are hard to predict. 

Since I have only four of these kits, they will be first-come, first
served. I'll do my best to get them off of the site when they're gone.
