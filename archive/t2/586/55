Subject: Re: [T2] Can't find timing any timing marks!

First, I'm assuming the timing scale - that black plastic thing with degree
marks - is in place behind the main cooling fan screen.  It is, right?

The timing mark on the pulley is on the FRONT side of the pulley - the side
that faces the engine - and is hardly worthy of the work "mark."  If you'd
take the pulley off and hold it in your hand you'd find the "mark" is really
a very shallow line, kind of like someone took one stroke on the edge of the
pulley with a hacksaw.  Remove the cooling fan screen and timing scale and
start searching for the "mark" with a fingernail.  Since you've got the
engine running you should be able to hone in fairly closely as to where the
mark actually is.  Put a drop of paint on the mark so you can find it with
your timing light.
