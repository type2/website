Subject: Engine tin painting/prep question

Hey everyone, my latest endeavor has been getting the tin ready for painting(72 westy btw). I sandblasted the pieces clean and sanded them smooth and semi-shiny. I teated the pieces with DuPont's Kwik Prep (the blue stuff). I soaked a sponge and applied the stuff liberally per the directions and left the pieces to dry. I returned some time later. Instead of the uniform bluing the label said would occur, all of the pieces had at least a little bit of what looked like surface rust. There were big streaks of reddish/yellowish/brownish stains. One of the pieces looked downright nassty, WTF!! I thought the metal prep was supposed to destroy any rust that was present and keep more from forming, and I spent the $$$ for the good stuff so it would come out right. I am fairly certain that I can't just paint over these streaks whatever they are.

My questions:
1. What did I do wrong?
2. Is there any possible way that this is really rust?
3. If I sand the pieces again to remove the spots, will I have to reapply the metal prep?

Thanks in advcance for any advice
scratching my head
Mike
