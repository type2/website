i had one great response to my new york request for safe harbor, so i am
encouraged to do it again. my extended vacation is coming to a
rediculously wonderful end. i'm being dragged from my childhood beach and
friends but i know deep down in my dipstick, was it the stones that
said...'you may be high. when forces larger than oneself claim it so, you
gotta move'. i'm going to suggest to my crew of a way west via the big
buffalo falls, across canada to the st croix river [wi/mn. from there i'll
probably b-line it to eugene. would prefer more listees on the way out
just for the sake of listeedom. just a note: 95% or more driving up to
ashville was done on state highways. i averaged 50-55 mph on that segment.
in ashville, nc, i zinged to my spot in so jersey. side bus trips we great
- nyc and va beach, va.

unfortunately its still so fresh and there are to many details i want to
express that it should be a weblink with photos instead of a T2 post. the
last trip to todos santos really set the pace, and i feel i am having the
best time possible taking this trip in a 75 westy. this summer was
unthinkable before last winter. from the margate library BIGthanks list
