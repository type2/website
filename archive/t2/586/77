you need to take a good look at the bus front end, before replacing an
expensive part like the box. lay on your back in front of the bus, so
that you can see all the steering components. Have a friend turn the
steering wheel back and forth while looking to see if the tie rods or
any other components tend to move before the wheels actually start
moving. Blindly replacing the box without replacing any other worn
parts will cause the same problem. :(
