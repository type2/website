Subject: Part request

Anyone have an extra old "VW" nose emblem for a 74-79
bus laying around?  I have a ton of Bay window parts
to barter or I can do it the "new fangled" way and
just pay you some money for it.  Doesn't have to be
perfect, just use-able and reasonably in-expensive
(read John is a "cheap b*stard" ;^)
