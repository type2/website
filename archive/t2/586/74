...but sometimes to a limited extent.  Always check out the Home Owner's
Association if applicable.  Some of the guidelines set up for the
"protection" of the neighborhood are not kind to inoperable vehicles.
I've been visited by the sheriff twice just for such reasons.  Luckily
he was a nice guy and said everything was alright by him.  I can just
see the nosy guy down the street sneering as he peeks out from behind
his curtain... "Rats, foiled again!  There must be some way to get rid
of the long-hair and his POS!"  

Good luck!
