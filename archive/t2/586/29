Subject: missing tin?

Im having a problem with elevated oil temps and have been trying to figure

compartment to find air leaks,and the area right beside the injectors is
pumping air.It seems like there should be a piece of tin beside and above
the injectors.Heres what mine looks like:

something.Need help in MO Thanks
