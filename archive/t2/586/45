I was making a play on my name.  I actually lived in Gary, IN, the singer's
home town for about 3 years.  NOBODY believed that my name is the same as
his.  Well, my wife did, but not too many other folk.

I still get a kick out of the "Bobby" character in Disney's "Extremely
Goofy" movie when he asks himself "Why are we always wearing these white
gloves?"
