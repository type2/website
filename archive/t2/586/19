Uh, it's in my tool box, but I have a '76 witch uses just a plain old
(12mm I think) socket. No Hexes here man. :) 

All ya'll with Hex head bolts ever think of converting?  Next time I
take off my cooling tin I'm SOOOooo going to throw away those stupid
round  headed screws, and put in good bolt style headed ones. I got a
couple that I just CAN'T get off. I'm gonna have to dremel 'em square to
get 'em off I think. 


Just thought I'd taunt a bit. :)
