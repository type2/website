Subject: [T2] Sugar in gas tank

On my tank there is an L shaped tube that is screwed into the bottom of =
the tank. It sticks up in the tank about 1 inch and is also has a 3 inch =
filter that attaches to it. This keeps the crude from the bottom of the =
tank from going into the gas line. This little L shape tube is what I =
was referring to as the "entire assembly". Just removing the hose from =
this tube will not get the sugar out since it sticks up in the tank and =
has a filter. You will need to remove this entire piece, then flush the =
tank.=20

This is what I did when I first got my bus and did not want to remove =
the engine and tank just to flush the tank. It was not ideal, but it =
seemed to work. The filter was just about completely gone. I tried to =
replace it, but I ordered one that was for a bug and it would not fit. I =
think that bus depot has the correct filter.

Maybe your bus is a different year and does not have this piece?
