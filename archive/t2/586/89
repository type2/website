Have you checked NAPA for a solenoid? Advance Auto at one time was pretty good at getting import parts. They will have to check their paper catalog. O'Reilly has had some vintage stuff available really easily too. 

FWIW all the major parts stores now have online catalogs you can hunt for what you want. 

Lastly (or more appropriately firstly?) try Busdepot and Aircooled.net...
