Yeah that is what I was thinking. I figured I would open the little can and 
get set then put on the gloves. Butterfingers in action and the bus waiting 
caused my new silver fingers. I just went out in the shop and the mechanic 
gave me some blake cleaner. No I don't even have to walk I'm floating. It 
did knock the bulk off with some scrubbing.
