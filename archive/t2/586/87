Joel Wilson - Your personal email address keeps kicking back my reply. I think I have the part you need, but I'm negotiating to sell the whole bus and have agreed to not pull any more parts until he decides. I will know by some time next week and will contact you then.      Clark  vwbaybus(-at-)yahoo.com
