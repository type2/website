Subject: one more TDC question

OK
Just got back from my 2 weeks in northern Minnesota and thought I'd catch up
on the list postings.  Read all the recent TDC posts with great enjoyment and
decided before I head out for a well deserved camping trip this weekend to use
my new found knowledge to give the old 71 Westy a tune-up.  It Seems that my
TDC, or at least what I thought was TDC was of by 180 degrees.  So does this
mean my distributor is set wrong.  do I need to remove my distributor and
restart the tune-up process?  I guess I got a bit confused about the post that
stated you have a 50-50 chance of putting your distributor in wrong.  Any help
is greatly appreciated.
