Subject: Re: [VB] junkyard closure in W WA

ah... where is it you want to know

It's in the south sound area of Washington State.   Call Swede at 360 894 3990

I'm hoping to get some good VW karma from passing on the news.   

Due to schedule considerations I won't be able to get out there again for a 
couple weeks.   I can, however, go pull parts and send them, if you want to pop 
me an email with a specific list.  Of course there'll be a pulling fee... I 
gotta get there and brave the jungle to get parts you know.  My impact driver 
set was crucial in removing parts.  Broke a snap on impact bit yesterday, 
though.
