Hey I resemble that remark =D! Silverfinger

Ten minutes and I can leave to go work on my bus again. I also want to check 
out my midnight paint job brush on in the dark. I had extra and didn't want 
to put it back in the can that was already closed tight. So I just 
startinghitting every little rust spot I could find with a flashlight. Brush 
strokes by the light of the moon. No prep involved here hope it doesn't make 
it worse. But from the rust that was there I don't see how it could get much 
worse. Por says that it is okay if there is some rust there helps bond to 
metal. Great lets see it bond to rust and paint flakes. I think I will call 
it experiment Leftover.
