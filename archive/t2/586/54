Subject: Hesitant acceleration

Hello-
I'm relatively new here.  I greatly appreciate any help.  I have a 70 Bus with a 1600 Single Port engine with stock solex carb.  Recently, when I push down the accelerator, the engine seemed to hesitate a little.  I tried to clean the carb this past weekend and now the problem is even worse.  Its so bad that I can hardly even get the bus moving.  I just read Robert Hoovers article titled Cutting Out at Idle and Im going to look for vacuum leaks tomorrow, but I know the timing, points, and plugs are ok.  Again, any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.
