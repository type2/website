Same here as John, but I'm interested in repro'ing the emblem.  Not sure of
the legal implications, but at least having an emblem I can easily replace
for my own bus would keep me safe from souvenir hunters. :O)

Giacomo is a '77 if that makes a difference, and I would need to pay for it
(few items to barter).
