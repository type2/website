Subject: No sugar tonight

Hallo Volk,

Well, no more sugar in tank and everything is suh-weet!

Firstly,

I cut an opening above the fuel sender, then removed the sender and, after 
draining all the gas from the fuel line that goes to the fuel filter, I 
started filling the tank with water. I ran a 1" diameter hose into the 
opening where the fuel sender goes and started siphoning while filling from 
the filler neck. I let this go for about 3 hours ( I tried sloshing but due 
to that cap or whatever that's inside the tank and my 70/30 shocks in the 
rear, it wouldn't slosh no matter how hard I rocked her). I then drained the 
tank completely, inserted the exhaust from my shopvac into the fuel sender 
opening when the tank was empty and let it blow for about an hour. It looked 
pretty dry so I buttoned everything up, installed a new fuel filter, added 
two gallons of gas (which I keep out of habit from my college days when I 
used to have (2) two gerry cans strapped to her rear) and the Naziwdgen 
started right up sounding like a thousand beating hearts of the finest Krupp 
steel.
I took her up on the freeway to my FLAPS  to dispose of the petrol and 
obtain a locking gas cap (which they said they had in stock) but when Gertie 
and I arrived, much to my dismay if not their chagrin, the darn thing (cap) 
didn't fit. Perhaps, it's because of my stupid stupid stupid Peoples' 
Republik of Kalifornia unleaded emissions restrictor in the filler neck, I 
don't know...
Anyway, the Naziwdgen ran fine all the way there and back. Hopefully, 
everything will be all right. I'm keeping my fingers (and hairy toes) 
crossed. I don't know who did it or why but it was right after the 4th so 
I'm guessing it was probably some of the neighborhood kids, -Das 
Schreckliche Kinder.
Thanks you guys for all of your help. Once again, Type2 came to our rescue.

Gross gut,
Oliver the K. and Gertie, the
'78 Bay with 372k

p.s. Along with all of the chunks and rust, I also siphoned out some 
F(oreign).O(bject).D(ebris)., i.e., a cigarette butt! Gotta get a locking 
gas cap...
