Subject: Fuel Tank Sending Unit

Does anyone have an angle on purchasing a sending unit for my 77's fuel
tank?  Bus Depot doesn't have any in stock and of course FLAP's don't carry
that kind of thing.  Is there a good substitute or do I have to get used to
having my gauge swing from half to empty when I get about a quarter tank
down?

Thanks!

Cody
