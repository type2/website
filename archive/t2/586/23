>>> 1. What did I do wrong? <<< 

The key to preventing flash rusting is to keep it saturated. Like
SOAKED. And when you dry, dry it with a towel, then use a heat gun on
high heat to Flash Dry it. 


>>>> 2. Is there any possible way that this is really rust?<<<

Yeah, it's really rust, but it's called Flash Rust, and it's not so bad.
In fact somewhere on the POR15.com site they say that a little bit of it
actually helps the POR products to adhere better.


>>>>3. If I sand the pieces again to remove the spots, will I have to
reapply the metal prep? <<<

Yes, if you sand the pieces again, they'll need re-prepped. 


Cheers
Chris
