Subject: Can't find timing any timing marks!

I recently purchased a 1978 transporter with a 2.0 engine and have just
started going over everything. I converted it to a Progressive carb, for the
F.I. was burned out.  That being said I thought a major tune-up was in order
(plugs, wires,cap,rotor,points,coil, ect...).  Well everything was wrong from
the start-plugs were gapped (-at-) .060, wrong rotor button, and wrong points
gapped (-at-) .040!  The engine code is GE and it matches the Cal. model, BUT the
dizzy is all but the Cal. model.  So the previous owner  just ASSUMED it was a
Cal. model dizzy (I'm glad I checked the #'s on the dizzy!)

Okay now you know where I'm at and what I'm dealing with.   When I changed my
points and set them properly, the timing had changed so much it wouldn't even
start (not very surprising). So I make a static test light and go back outside
only to find not a single paint mark, scratch ,or notch,  or anything! I just
played with the dizzy till it ran Okay. The dizzy is turned about 1/5 from
where it was before.

Finally my question. HOW DO I PROPERLY TIME MY ENGINE WITH ABSOLUTELY NO
TIMING MARKS WHATSOEVER!  Only my dizzy tells me where #1 is firing. I do have
my dwell set at exactly 50 degrees with the engine running now. If somebody
could point me to 7.5 BTDC, my Bus,Wife and I will be very grateful. Thank you
to all that respond.
