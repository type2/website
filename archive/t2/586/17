Subject: '77 Riviera's first trip

After almost 7 months, my '77 Riviera was ready for it's first big camping
trip.  I've got some photos linked below of the bus, campsite and
surrounding areas near Rockport in Northern California.  My wife and I
loaded up our son and left Pleasant Hill Friday night, stopped over in Ukiah
at my folks house, then left Saturday morning at 6:00 a.m. for the long haul
up the Redwood Highway to Rockport.

Thank you so much to the Type2 list members, your emails and the archive
answered any question not covered in the manuals when I was resurrecting
this bus. My bus is far from perfect, but it's camp worthy and most
importantly, safe to drive for over 6 hours straight!  Many times I almost
gave up on the project, but it has all ended up being worth the effort.
There is nothing better than waking up on the beach in a bus you've built up
yourself.  Well, except maybe getting your camp packed in under an hour
while your relatives are still trying to get their 5th-wheels and motorhomes
ready to roll.  :)

Thanks again everyone!

Cody
