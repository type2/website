Subject: Ron out thru Sunday

I'll be at the Great Blue Heron Music Festival near Jamestown, NY from
6:00 tonight thru Sunday night, so any email sent to my personal email
address during that period will not be replied to until my return.  

The Bus Depot will of course remain open and will be shipping usual. You
can email them at sales(-at-)busdepot.com .

If you haven't gone to this festival, I recommend it highly. We never
miss it. http://www.greatblueheron.com/ .  (It actually starts Friday
morning but we will be stopping on the way to visit friends.)  If you
go, look for the "wagon circle" of 4 Westies, and stop by and say hi. We
usually camp in the lower lot, to the left of the main entrance. There
should be a "steal your face" flag flying above our site with a VW logo
in the center.
