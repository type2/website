Subject: Bus fight in court

Going to court today to fight Landlord. He wants to evict myself and family 
because of breach of contract. His wife doesn't like my "disgusting hunk of 
junk". My lease states that no inopperable vehicles be parked outside. My 
camper doesn't fit into my garage, height restrictions. But I should fare 
well with a verbal agreement that he and I made that if it was not visible 
from the street. It's not and he has not told his wife about the agreement I 
am sure. Wish me luck.
