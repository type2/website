Subject: Thank you & Loose Steering

Hey Guys,

I've been so busy trying to get my bus back on the road that I haven't sent
thank you's for all the very helpful advice.  I'm printing all the replies to
my questions for future reference and maybe pass the advice along to someone
else one day...

I thought the '74 was just about road worthy and I found some nasty surprises
on my first test drive... The transmission is shot, there's a nasty oil leak
coming from the oil cooler and the steering is really loose.

The bus tracks great and has no sway even in high winds at 60 MPH, but I can
move the steering wheel quite a bit each way before there is any response?  My
first guess is I need a new steering box, but I wanted to check with you guys
first....could it be a steering dampner or should I order a new box?

Thanks,

Tom
