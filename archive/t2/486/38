I'm beginning to wonder how much the EGR affects mileage.  I haven't 
started tracking mine yet (didn't figure it would be all that 
meaningful during the first 300mi of engine break-in), but I should ask 
the PO of my Bus what he was getting before he sold it to me.  The 
engine was needing a rebuild when I bought it, but it was running with 
no EGR and with a hollowed-out cat (both of which I had reinstalled).
