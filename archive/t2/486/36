Around here, mechanics will often have smog equipment that they use 
only for tuning purposes, i.e. not hooked up to the DMV's computer 
network.  I'd be really surprised if anywhere in the US you couldn't 
find a mechanic that won't do this for you.  I can't imagine it would 
cost more than 1/2 hour labor (the last time I had this done on my Bus, 
it was 1 1/2 hours labor, including installation of a new cat converter 
and EGR filter).  With gas prices these days, you could probably pay 
for that with the savings from just a couple of tanks full.
