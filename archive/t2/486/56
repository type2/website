One of my wife's ex-coworkers was doing a veggie-diesel conversion on a 
Vanagon.  He never got it running quite as well as he'd hoped, but I 
don't think he really had the time to spend that was required by the 
project.

However, we do know a couple here in San Francisco who run their 
Vanagon diesel on bio-diesel.  No conversion is necessary, and 
bio-diesel (also made from vegetable oil, but refined so that it's a 
straight swap with dino-diesel) runs very clean.  I've been told by a 
couple of people that it's also better for the engine because it tends 
to have fewer nasty impurities/additives, although I haven't done any 
research on the topic to substantiate that claim.  Maybe one of these 
days some jurisdiction will have the sense to mandate it for big-rigs 
so that more fueling stations will carry it.  I think the only place to 
get it in the San Francisco Bay Area is a depot up in Richmond (luckily 
this guy works on the other side of the Richmond Bridge, so filling up 
isn't too much of a trek :-)

I do have one logistical question about fast food fryer oil, though... 
As I recall, most of the big chain fast food places use hydrogenated 
oil in their fryers, so that it can be used longer before it breaks 
down.  However, I thought that hydrogenated vegetable oils were solid 
at room temperature (like animal fats)... which brings me to my 
question... how does one handle this?  Or, do you just have to make 
sure you find *good* fast food places? :-)
