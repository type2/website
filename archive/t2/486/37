A few years ago an ad ran on TV...The opening scene was five people
sitting in a car on what appeared to be the Helix leading to the Lincoln
Tunnel in NY...The people were acting "uncomfortable"... The solution
(according to the commercial...) was the purchase of a new Cadillac
by each of the occupants so they could relax in comfort in a traffic
jam now four cars longer... ;-(
(I'm still looking for the empty roads all those new cars are driving on
in the ads, so I can drive my Bus in peaceful serenity too... ;-)
