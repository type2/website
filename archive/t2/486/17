I prefer heaters which are horizontal (lay flat, can't tip, and can be
adjusted to point up) and use a squirrel cage fan like your air cooled
engine-very quiet for the air they push.  The Camping World Kozy-World
is a nice example- its low setting (800 watts) is plenty if you sit
right in front of it.  It also will screw to a wall and flip down
whereever you set it.  I store one in the bottom of the cloths closet of
the 78 camper.
