Hello David    I have put a type 3 motor in a bus a few times  It worked real 
well wasn't hard to do either I ussed an old truck inner tube an screwed it 
around the engine to create a seal.  But if you build a motor right you 
wouldn't need any spare motor to lug around. later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem
