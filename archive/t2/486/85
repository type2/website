Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [vanagon] sand blasting/paint prep & walnut

I bought one of those spot sandblasters, a red unit made in Italy, no? I
bought it for rust spots on my bus, particularly cleaning up under the rusty
windshield seal area. Problem was, it takes a long time to do anything and
only does a quarter sized spot, leaving it looking pitted. I then tried a
$17 Harbor Freight angle grinder with a wire wheel- what a tool! Cleans
things right up, I love it. It's my first choice. I still have the blaster
for backup for deeply pitted or unreachable places, but I rarely use it.

<Look into a spot sand blatser-that comes with 4 different rubber
nozzles--thet fit concave, convex, and two different sixe round
areas--it has a recycling bag on the end of it that recaptures the
silica sand---and not too much goes into the air-->
