Well, on a recent trip through the central valley, there were so many cars
on the I-5 freeway that it just started to slow and stop for no apparent
reason.  Stop, go, stop, go...

We got looking at the map and noticed that state highway 33 paralleled the
I-5 about 5 miles to the west.  We took a chance and hopped off the
freeway and headed for the 33.  The 33 was _empty_!  In 20 miles we saw
exactly one other vehicle!  It was like instantly being in central Nevada!
