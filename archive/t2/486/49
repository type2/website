Subject: Re: [T2] Accelerator cable sleeve

I tried to find the housing looking in the Type2 section of ETKA and
couldn't; might just be that I don't really know what I'm looking for.

Going over to the Vanagon section of ETKA (I'd think this stuff would be
similar) I found:

252 721 573 guide tube for accelerator cable    2430x8

251 721 551 protective tube

Bus Depot has the first at $12.97 and the second (also in a "B" and "C"
flavor) for $20.04 - $21.20.

Not sure exactly what you need.
