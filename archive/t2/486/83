It's not that simple. There are a couple BIO-DIESEL lists you can subscribe 
to. They have the "refine" it before they can burn it. It's not as easy as 
pulling up to the back door of the local McD's and filling up - at least 
not what I read on those lists.

These folks have what I understood to be a still (as in moonshine) where 
they don't exactly distill it like 'shine but filter it and mix in a few 
other things to help it stay liquid. I also noticed that some of them have 
to start their engines on regular diesel but later switch over to bio once 
the engine temps are up.

An easier all-weather solution would be a propane conversion or something 
like that. No at home refineries necessary! <grin> Fewer miles per tank too 
I've read. Lower cost still....

Surely though there must be a Bio-diesel FAQ someplace...
