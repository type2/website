Saying that "buying a new car which does less to pollute the environment" 
overlooks the entire life-cycle of the vehicle: pollution in 
mining/creating materials used for producing that automobile, 
pollution used in creating that vehicle, and energy required for all of 
these, pollution caused in generating this energy.

This does not even deal with the disposal of all of the materials that 
make this new (or old) car, nor their affect on the environment.

But you've also got all the issues associated with maintainence, disposing 
of coolant, oil (how often do you change the oil in VW?), ground water 
pollution, etc.

To say: buying a 'green' car will solve these issues is both an 
oversimplification and misdirection.  If you want to save the enviroment: 
don't drive!  Walk or bike!

Or carpool more.

etc.

Obligatory bus content:  I met a guy at Gathering of the Vibes 2002 who 
had stopped in at a junkyard in ... new england i want to say ... where 
this cat had a barn full of VW stuff, but also had a bunch of VWs 
that he had filled with weights and junk so they would start to sink.  He 
was helping them go back to the earth, as their useful life had ended.

Weird.

Anyway, feel free to contact me offlist if you want to start a thread on 
life-cycles of old cars versus buying new cars.  There's a fair bit of 
material on the subject (although nothing definitive that I know of).

In any event: back to busses!
