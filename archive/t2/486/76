Fantastic !!!!

Glad to hear stories like that, it makes you FEEL what the driving experience was like in that era.. Its nice to know that a 35 year old machine , (a bus to boot with minimal horse power) will sail through the states without a problem..

What was your MPH during the trip? What did you average your MPG were??

 

peace,
