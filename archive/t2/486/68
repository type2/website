Subject: easy out exaust stud not so easy?

Ok,
 
preface: i've never used an easy out before please tell me i'm just skipping a step or something here.
 
while the engine is out of the beast and perched on the bench at eye level i decided to have a go at that blasted exhaust stud that i broke off on the last go around. So i soaked it with penetrating oil bought myself a handy dandy 5/64 screw extractor drilled in set the extractor but she 's a no coming out. am I missing something here. I've got a nice heavy duty milwaukee 1/2 '' drill tightened the crap out of the chuck down on the suare part of the extractor at the very end but it just spins. Is there a tool that i should use to turn the easy extractor with. tried a vice grip???? is 5/64 not a good size for this stud
 
Why do they call it an Easy out it has been anything but?
 
Thanks in advance to those of you who've been there done that for all of the advice.
 
Mick
