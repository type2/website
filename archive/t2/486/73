Subject: Rebuilding/Lubricating Distributor

Hi All:

I am in the process of cleaning up the 20 years of gunk in the
distributors (point based) for my 82 Vanagon. What does the community
recommend for lubricating the centrifugal weights and the point plate
when I reassemble them? Grease, oil?

Regards,
