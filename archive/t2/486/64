you may not want to take the I81 corridor.  seems there is going to be
mucho snow and from the south you may not be much experienced with the
truckers in the snow...  also I-81 is very hilly and has some place that
are quite remote.  the area aroound Harrisburg is VERY congested and under
construction,  probably has been under construction for about the last 800
years.  it is mostly truckers and they fly low...the big "opps" on my van
is from a trucker on I-81 near Wilkes Barre..

my suggestion, is the NJ turnpike to the last exit before Geo Wash bridge
and then get on the Palisaides parkway and then over the Tappen Zee bridge
and up from there.  or when I go skiing I take NJ turnpike to exit 18W and
then catch route 17 North to I-87 (NY thruway) this gets you into the same
area.. is faster but if your not careful easy to get lost, very poor
signage.

I ski at Windham near Oneonta,, trust me knowing where I'm going and all
the turns and it is still a good 7-8 hours from Baltimore.  lots of
slugging up some many mile long grades.  and it is likely to be 6-10
inches of snow that way.

well I'm right here in Baltimore if you need help, my number is on the
list

good luck
