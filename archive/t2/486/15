Subject: Part Number Needed

Greeetings,

'79 2.0 liter FI going into a '78 body

I need the part number for the accelerator pedal cable tube/housing. This is 
the black plastic covered sprial wire deal that goes from the rear conduit 
and through the upright cooling tin. Even though I have 2 both are 
bent/tweeked enough so that the end of the cable will not fit through the 
constriction(s). All I can find is cables and no housng. Or any ideas for a 
fix? My attempts at straightening have proved futile.

Thanks,
Brandt
