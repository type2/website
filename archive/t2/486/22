Subject: Re: [T2] Type2 Gas Mileage

I'm getting a consistent 18-21 (mixed driving) in my '69 Westi with a '71
dual port and '71 trans, all bone stock.  No exact numbers, but probably
around 30k on the rebuild.

 That is, when fuel is not draining out the side of the carb...

Amazing, too that our '01 Mazda MPV (one of the most fuel efficient vans on
the road today) gets only 5 mpg better than the ol' bus.  And my '97 Mazda
pickup pretty much equaled it at all times.  Oh well, so much for
"engineering marvels" over the past 40 years.

As another data point, I get around 20-22 on flat highways running 55 to 60
in my 71 deluxe.


What is really amazing is how I get better gas mileage in my Bus than I do
in the wifes '98 Pontiac transporter.
