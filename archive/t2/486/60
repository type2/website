Hiya Folks,

  We're here holed up and roughing it at the Embassy Suites just above
Baltimore, MD.  We had an itinerary change that took us to Maryland, so
far the drive has been one long easy uphill grade from S.C.  We've been
speeding along at sixty to sixty-five, with only a few "Oops! we're at
seventy" bursts.  This is mainly because we feel the bus is happiest at
the lower speeds.  Found that the big trucks first blow you outward and
then suck you back in, haven't driven a vehicle that does that in years.

  Going to brave the rest of the journey up the dreaded I81 corridor. 
Mostly since it is the most direct route from here to there.

  A very strange thing: the heat in the bus is roasting us.  If you looked
inside you'd see jettisoned coats and sweaters all about the bus.  We
are marveling over this.  Our gas milage is around twenty mile per
gallon.  We just stop around every two hundred mile and fill up with
premium.  No pinging.

  All in all a very wonderful trip so far.  Tomorrow the weather is going
to be a little uncertain but Im not worried about it.  We should arrive
at our destination: Clinton N.Y. in the early afternoon.

  I have printed all of the A.I.R.S. list that is pertinent to our trip. 
I signed up myself, a long time ago when the weather was warm and balmy.

Thank you everyone for your responses, Ill keep you posted.

Jennifer
