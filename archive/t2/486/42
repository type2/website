Dave, thanks..it looks like I'm missing #10 and #36.  Is one a bearing and one a sleeve or what, I can't tell.  I do have a bearing down there (very loose) so I may just be missing the sleeve, like Tom says.
Help in identifying these so I can call Depot would be great!
 
Can anyone else look at this and help me get part #'s and descriptions for 10 and 36
PS if the diagram is too small, it should enlarge with a click.
