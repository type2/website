Subject: Brake Job

Hi People,

Well, my rear brake job is dragging out a bit. I have the left one (the one
making noise) completely apart, and hope to re-assemble tomorrow. The notes
in the library are very relevant(more so than Bentley). I did NOT try to
remove the housing, it looks like it's been attached since hitler founded
VW. The roller bearings look ok, just a faint bluish discoloration, so I
left them in place. Everything else is in a pan of solvent.

On to my question for this evening...I expect to finish the left one in the
am, but I'm out of time to do the right rear. I know that in general, you do
brake jobs in pairs, but I need to take a short trip this weekend (not
optional) and the bus is my only ride. Can I get away with driving 200+
miles with one rear brake all new and the other old? Or will there be a lot
of differential braking action?

Thanks,
Rick
