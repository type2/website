Complete brake job? New rubber, shoes, cylinders?

If yes, replace the rubber line on the right side. Replace the shoes if you
can. Carry your replacement cylinder and tools to replace it at roadside.

The new parts are going to be nice and tight. The old parts will have
stretch and wear. It is very possible that after a few pushes on the pedal
you will blow out the old rubber line or pop the old cylinder seals.

The shoes themselves **shouldn't** make that much of a difference so long
as tehre is decent pad left on the "old" side. Just make sure you get both
sides adjusted so they catch at the same time. New shoes whould be better
though.

Your FRONT brakes do most of the STOPPING -- **but** uneven back brakes 
**WILL** act like "steering brakes" and swing you around worse than uneven
front brakes.

Drive slow and feel it out for a while before you get in a hurry to get
that 200 miles behind you. Leave early, drive slow.
