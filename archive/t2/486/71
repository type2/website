Chad always seems to be on the road and takes a while to get back to people
and/or ship parts. To learn more on chad/gobugs do a search in the
classified forums on thesamba.com.

I'll see if any of my contacts know if he is in town or on the road

Hey volks,

Can anyone help me with contact information for Chadd of GoBug.com?  I 
ordered some engine tin and have not been able to reach him.  I have 
his email address as gobug(-at-)yahoo.com and gobug(-at-)earthlink.net, mail to 
these addresses bounces back.

Thank you for any help you can provide,
