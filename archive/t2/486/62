Subject: help--contact information need

Hey volks,

Can anyone help me with contact information for Chadd of GoBug.com?  I 
ordered some engine tin and have not been able to reach him.  I have 
his email address as gobug(-at-)yahoo.com and gobug(-at-)earthlink.net, mail to 
these addresses bounces back.

Thank you for any help you can provide,
