Subject: sand blasting/paint prep & walnut media???

Hi,

I've been following the various conversations about painting and prep
and have a question.

I haven't seen anyone mention sand-blasting as a way to really clean
up an old bus/vanagon?  Is this a big no-no?

Has anyone used the walnut or corn cob blast media....I'm thinking of
trying this and want something that isn't silica based.  I'll wear a
mask but still prefer something organic.

My vanagon has a bit of surface rust, rust around 5 windows, a dent in
the sliding door and rear quarter wheel well and assorted dings.
Most of this was there when I got it from the PO.  I've dremeled a
fair amount of the rust around the windows and spots and primered with
a spray can to keep things from getting worse through the winter.
The vanagon has been repainted prior to this and many areas in the
front show significant crackle from a poor job.  I need to remove as
much paint as possible and prime for the new paint job.

I may simply swap out my sliding door (drivers door too, hinges are a
bit sprung and it sags plus has rust around window) if I can find
suitable replacements that only require light cleanup and paint.

I've heard sand blasting can create ripples in the metal if you aren't
careful.  I don't intend on removing all the paint but there are areas
in the front, the roof, the rear hatch that need to be taken down a
lot and grinding with sand paper on large areas will take forever.  


Sincerely,
