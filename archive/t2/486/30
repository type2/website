I've seen as high as 23 mpg at 55 mph on mixed (flat and hills) driving. In 
town it is around 20 mph. Stock 2.0 with F.I. with aftermarket exhaust and 
stock heater boxes. No EGR hooked up.

I'll comment on the Corvair transplant in a month or two. I have until Jan 
15th to get my bus moving and driveable. Wife is starting student teaching 
and I will be in charge of my own transportation (we currently work at the 
same library so we car pool).
