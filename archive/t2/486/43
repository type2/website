Subject: Re: [T2] steering column

I think you're right, it's number 36 in that hard to read diagram. If you
can't get a new one, Busted VW in Colorado is sure to have one for you for
not too much. I got a replacment steering column shaft with this part, the
nut and spring for like $15.

Dave, thanks..it looks like I'm missing #10 and #36.  Is one a bearing and
one a sleeve or what, I can't tell.  I do have a bearing down there (very
loose) so I may just be missing the sleeve, like Tom says.
Help in identifying these so I can call Depot would be great!

Can anyone else look at this and help me get part #'s and descriptions for
10 and 36
PS if the diagram is too small, it should enlarge with a click.
