Subject: re [T2] Loose shifter

More than likely it's your front shift rod bushing- it's amazing how many
buses have long since had them fall out).  They wear out and allow the front
of the shift rod to flop around.  They are cheap (BusDepot sells them for
$3.49 part #211711182); you should buy two- one to keep in the tool box or
help a stranded VW.

They are a bit of a pain to install as you have to pull the shifter which of
course means realigning it.  Be sure to put grease inside of it in the
grooves.

The chances of your shift rod and the "cup" that it sits in being worn out
aren't very high- while they do rub together, they are metal and don't move
enough to generate much heat.  Be sure to clean and regrease them when you
reassemble it though.
