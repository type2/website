Hey VWWESTY,

You know the rules, no griping to the list.
If you have troubles you should send a message to the admin. for help.
How could your message possibly be as long as your gripe?
You can try replying to the people who are helping you or who you want to
help.
Don't just trip out and give up.
Just my input. not sure what others think.

Darren
