Subject: Tires in storage?!

Hey guys,

    Definitely a "Friday" question here as it doesn't directly relate to
buses. Long story short, I had a 97 GrandAm. I loaned it to my
grandfather, and it was totalled. I've not got another 97 GrandAm (I
liked the car, i know how to work on it, etc), but it's a GT so it has
the nicer 16" tires. I had JUST purchased brand new tires for the
original 97 GrandAm, so it would seem ashame to junk the car with those
on it. Since they are the same overall exterior diameter, I figured I
would use the rims and tires from the original GrandAm until I wore them
out... and THEN put back, the GrandAm GT wheels and tires.

Which brings me finally to my question. I've noticed that whenever I've
parked a car (like in my garage for an extended period of time, a year or
two), or I've seen a car that's been sitting for a while, the tires begin
to crack and dry out. These tires that came on this 97 GT are fairly
expensive tires, about $130 dollars for a single tire. How can I store
them, so that they won't dry out or crack? I'd likely be keeping them in
my garage, or at the very least, a shed.


Thanks,

Todd
