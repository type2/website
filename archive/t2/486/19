Subject: What is this paint scheme?

It looks like it may be the same as my '70. If so, the top is 
mexicobeige, and the bottom is leuchtorange.

The paint code for mexicobeige is LE1M. The paint code for leuchtorange 
is L20B. When I bought some L20B orange Centari recently, the lable 
identified it as "brilliant orange".
