Subject: Loose shifter

Hi,
I have a problem with my 1971 bus shifter.  It became loose and started
to rotate around and would not shift gears.  I replaced the shifter, this
seemed to help for a little while.  Then the new shifter became loose and
would rotate and not shift.  I believe that the shift rod?, the place
where the ball of the shifter fits in to (cup?) is worn.  Does anyone
know where I can buy a new one of these or is my problem really something
else?  
Thanks
Joe Willy
