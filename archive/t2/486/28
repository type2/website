Subject: 79 FI won't start (easily) continues

Again, thanks to all for the help.

I think I have eliminated the major problems and I am now down to the 
minor.  My fuel pressure looks good 38-40 psi, the ecu is good (works 
in my other bus) and every vacuum connection I can find is good and 
tight.

After some lengthy cranking last night I got it to start and run.  Once 
it warmed up it runs fine.  I think I have a bad thermo-time switch or 
a bad ground.  I am going to try to get at it today and see what it is 
doing (I have the bentley manual procedure for testing this).  My 
current question is: do these things (the thermo-time switch) go bad or 
is it likely just a grounding issue?   I have seen a couple of sources 
for these so I guess that someone is replacing them.

Thanks again, I'll try to send an update after I have gotten to the 
switch.
