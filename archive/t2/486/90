Subject: Re: [T2] Friday bus sightings

There is also a commercial, I forget what its for, but its just a bunch of people who say I brake for this and I brake for that, one after the other.  One girl is standing behind a late dark green bay window with the hatch open and she says "I brake for animals", or something like that. You don't really see much of the bus, only enough of the body lines and shape to know what it is.  I just have no idea what the ad is for, maybe some type of financial service.
