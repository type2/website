I'm not quite sure what you have there Tom---
The unit I have worked great on the 2 thousand some odd steel
rivet's--my finger got real tired, but it was the only way to just hit
them and them alone on the aluminum sided trailer --

I did the side of Vanagon for a guy--and it sure made real fast work of
the seam rust--and it kept the silica sand focused just in the seam with
the proper adapter--
Took me all of 10 minutes for the L/H side--and it was all down right to
the bare metal--

Problem is with my 4" 3/4 horse Milwaukee grinder is it removes waaaay
to much metal beyond where the corroded area's are--same with my 6' or 3
" air grider---

I'm pretty happy with the unit I have--and for focused rust spot clean
up and paint prep you just can't beat it--

Later,

Terry

I bought one of those spot sandblasters, a red unit made in Italy, no? I
bought it for rust spots on my bus, particularly cleaning up under the
rusty windshield seal area. Problem was, it takes a long time to do
anything and only does a quarter sized spot, leaving it looking pitted.
I then tried a $17 Harbor Freight angle grinder with a wire wheel- what
a tool! Cleans things right up, I love it. It's my first choice. I still
have the blaster for backup for deeply pitted or unreachable places, but
I rarely use it. Tom
