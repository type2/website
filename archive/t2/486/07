I get 18 to 20mpg with our 75 bus (regular 7
passenger, not a westy), on the highway, at 65 to 75
mph, keeping up with traffic usually.  It has a 79 FI
engine, that is stock except for an aftermarket (RMMW)
exhaust system.
Don't know about town mileage as I don't put enough
miles on to check mileage.
