Subject: Re: [T2] Accelerator cable sleeve

Both of my tubes/sleeves are used and both are kinked where they pass 
through the tin or some rear part of the body. I will check on some part 
being removabel but I think my problems are with the damage and not a 
plastic plug. The kink is too tight for the cable end to pass through.

Regardless, I wouldn't mind a new sleve. One with no rust and junk build up. 
But Part #???

It appears that new cables don't come with this sleeve.

Thanks,
Brandt
