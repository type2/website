 I think the Cam you put in, it is your gas sucking monster,  if it's not
stock.stock...and stock, your mileage Will be less then it would have been
of not 100% stock.

My cam is not all that wild IMHO. Web Cam specs:

 .426 lift, 262 duration, 224 duration (-at-) .050. Specs from Web Cam.

Not certain what is stock but I did not think this was all that wild. This
cam was recommended by Boston Bob to assist in keeping head temps
reasonable. My gauge rarely goes over 350 mounted on #1 plug. I also run
solid lifters. Any other gas mileage thoughts guys?
