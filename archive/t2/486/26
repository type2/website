I am still not sure how much the auto tranny affects gas mileage, (had
this one 10 yrs would think I had it figured out by now) since a very
large percentage of my driving is stop and go city driving it throws
things off a bit,  I expect 16 or so around town, this is pretty
consistent.   on the road, depending on hills I seem to get about 18 up to
almost but never quite 20mpg
