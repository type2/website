I had a "cold start" problem like this on my '76 FI.  It started 
happening after I had a rebuilt engine installed.

In my case, the problem turned out to be a bad (almost non-existent, 
really) connection of the battery + strap on the solenoid (it was 
mis-installed long before I bought the bus when the PO replaced the 
solenoid; I guess the engine replacement work must have just jarred it 
loose.. the eye wasn't even over the post on the solenoid).  In the 
process of tracking down the problem, I also replaced my ratty original 
battery ground strap with a nice new insulated one.

Once the electrical problem was eliminated, my "cold start" problem 
went away completely.  I guess the poor connection was simply causing 
weak spark that was mitigated once the heads warmed up.

My suggestion would be to eliminate all electrical possibilities first 
(like ground and + strap).  I suspect the ground strap is more likely 
to go bad after 25 years than the thermo-time switch.
