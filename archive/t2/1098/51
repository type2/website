Subject: propane fittings ... 

I picked up a propane tank form a vanagon westy . it came sans valves and
fittings . anyone have a source for em? My tank has three inlets . one is
very small, the next two are the same size but one of em sort of has a lip
inside. Anyone know what valve's/fittings goes where?
