Subject: H4's & HID retrofit kit

Hey John, I'm trying to understand all this.

It sounds like you are suggesting that we use the H4 Headlight set from the
Depot, then get some HID bulbs retrofit kit? I just did a quick search for
kits, and it looks like there are a lot of different ones. Apparently you
need to know what the bulb housing is.any tips on that? Is this a plug and
play thing, or do you need to alter the wiring harness? Can you get them at
your FLAPS, or just mail order?

 

It also looks like you need to get a ballast? And for the HID to switch from
low to high beam it uses a solenoid? Am I looking at the right thing?

 

Ie how do you figure which bulb kit to get, or do you just get the Temp &
wattage you want, and then fabricate your own adaptor?
