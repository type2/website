I have not used his kits, but I have purchased heads and other parts 
from Jake and his work is top-notch.  He is extremely knowledgeable and 
I'd definitely trust one of his engines any time over anything I coddle 
together myself.  I spent a *lot* of time reading up on his work and 
have seen plenty of success stories related to his engines.  The only 
complaint I've heard is that he likes to talk up his stuff.  That said, 
he stands behind his work because he knows it's good :)
