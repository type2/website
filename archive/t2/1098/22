Subject: Re: [T2] Hard start with warm Engine

>So I have a 2000cc air-cooled bus. I installed dual solex 40/44 carbs.
Everything seems to be doing well. Cold start I have no problem starting,
Warm
start I have to turn over and over its takes awhile, but will start just
really hard. I replaced all ignition items except the coil. I did foul My
plugs awhile back and i'm thinking it may be over jetted, and it is flooding
the carbs when I turn it off, if that is even possible. Any Ideas... Thanks

I have a similar problem with dual weber 34 icts. I now do warm starts with my
foot lightly on the accelerator pedal. The other thing is that I have to crank
for a second or two after it first catches to make sure it keeps running.

I had a problem of flooding with the left carb after running which I solved by
installing bakelite spacers. It was nothing to do with jet sizes, just the
fuel in the fuel bowl boiling from residual engine heat and establishing a
siphon into the sump!
