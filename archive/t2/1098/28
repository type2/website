Hi David,

The first thing I would say is that when you changed the brake shoes,
you should have observed that all of the actuating components were
clean and in good operating condition. Assuming you are clear there,
be sure your parking brake is properly adjusted.

Having those basics out of the way, I can say that the primary reason
for brakes to start seizing after they have been working okay is that
on old rubber brake hoses, the inside of the hose swells, thereby
reducing the inside diameter of the hose and trapping the brake fluid
so it cannot pass through. Thus when you let your foot off the brake
pedal, the fluid in the brake slave cylinder cannot return through the
hose and the brake shoes remain engaged. So change the hoses and bleed
the lines again.

 When I drive over 50 miles my rear drum driverside brake locks up. It starts
 to smoke and I have to pull over and wait at least an hour before I can
drive
 again. I  just replaced the pads and the old ones were craked and looked as
if
 they had the same issue in the past.
 What can I do to fix this??
