Moving from Arizona to Oregon you will se a huge increase in humidity in the
air.

Carb icing is an issue in the PNW climate.   Maybe I should use the word
'fact' rather than issue.
The heat riser will warm up the air in the horizontal part of the manifold
tube.  It will do about diddley squat to affect icing at the carb itself.  So
what to do?
 You must install the pre heat hose from the air cleaner to draw warmed air
from by the head
and have a working flap on the air cleaner.

But still you still WILL HAVE CARB ICING, until the carb is warmed up.  sit on
your milk crate behind the bus and watch.   from time to time touch the air
cleaner or the pipe on top of the carb... as the hot air is drawn through, it
will warm them up and eventually warm up the carb and melt the ice.    But it
does not happen right away.  Ice will form, and ......  then it will melt.  It
takes a few minutes.   If you rev the motor you can see ice melt quicker.
Then you will have water droplets condensed on the carb.   Until it warms
more.

An iced carb will make the engine run badly and boggy and stall at idle.  Even
with all the pre-heat stuff in place if I let it idle to warm up I sometimes
put a block on the gas pedal to run at closer to 2K than idle, or it can stall
when warming up in the driveway.  Once it has warmed up the carb the stalling/
bogging issue goes away.

Good idea to have the thermostat in there, too.

Sorry I can't help about the running rich issue.  What kind of carb is it?

I was also getting tremendous carb icing - odd, as I blew through the heat
riser and it was totally clear.
