Perusing Terry's add on Samba does indeed reveal the order I just listed of
valves is corect in his picture, and Terry does sell good stuff and gets it to
you quick.  I would note however most online RV places want $18-25 for the
"manual fill" valve and $5 for the 80% tap, so his $51 is about $20 steep. 
The $54 for the outlet valve is about the same steep.  But you would know it
works, which is worth something to some people.  Like I said, a good local
place should be able to do the same or better, and you will know it works in
person.
