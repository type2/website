That is an amazingly cheap cost! Our Aussie busses came with them as
standard. There were two problems with mine when I got the bus. Firstly
a PO had replaced one of the globes with one of about double the
wattage! This was in addition to a pair of 100w driving lights. You have
to remember that all the power to the front comes up through one wire
that was probably marginal to begin with and also is being generated by
the stock 55A alternator.

The second problem was the alignment. The rear had sagged over time and
the lights were adjusted accordingly. So when the rear was fixed the
lights were pointing to the ground on high beam which made the first
nighttime trip exciting!
