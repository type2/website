Did the same. Generic H4 headlights coupled to Hella 500 driving lights 
(on high beam only). Added aux fuse panel in the engine compartment 
($8), added relays to everything. Used HD wiring from the battery to 
fuse panel, from fuse panel to front of vehicle, also for the relay 
circuits, etc. Am using one relay per light b/c the relays were cheap 
and I did not want to lose a light on a dark night to a faulty relay.

Stock wiring triggers relays that feed power to the headlights directly 
from that fuse panel. High beam triggers driving lights (with toggle 
switch to keep the driving lights off if wanted).

Adjusted properly we could see all sorts of deer we had never seen 
before along the rural highway we frequented to Grandma's house and 
back. Quickly added same driving lights to our Honda CR-V as well for 
the same reason. Ignorance was not bliss... VBG!

Standard 45/55W headlamps, 55W driving lights. This is on a '78 Westy 
which I am pretty sure has the larger 70AMP alternator.

Nice upgrades that make you safer.
