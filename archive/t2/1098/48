Subject: Re: [T2] weird starter issue

Just a couple of thoughts.
The TDI starter "may" have TWO small connectors, one solenoid and
one for glow plug direct circuit to assist in starting.  (depends on year
and actual model (engine code).  Make sure your solenoid wire (from
ignition switch is connected to the correct post.  "Usually" this is
the right side connector when staring at the end of the solenoid.
The other problem that happens on all late model water cooled starters
is the battery cable post is VERY close to the solenoid terminal and
can short when the cable is tightened.
Just guessing of course, but don't see much else that would be obvious.
I doubt that the conversion and old problems are related.
