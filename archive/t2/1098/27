I agree on the reliability of the 1776 cylinder wall thickness. You
can squeeze a few more cc's and get more torque for a bus application
by adding a stroker crank. Check How to Hot Rod VW Engines for the
recommendation on how much you can stroke without clearancing the
case. I'd also go with a counterweighted crankshaft. I had a 1776 in
my bus and the power would just start to kick in when RPM got too high
for a non-CW crank.

 Yes on keeping the type 1, but no on the aluminum case unless you are

 Don't get too carried away with the high performance if you want a reliable
 engine.  1776 would be about the largest you would want to go unless you
 have lots of money to spend.

 If you want larger than that, get a bus made for a type 4.
