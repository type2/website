While the 1.21 gigawatts would be handy for returning to fix all the  
errors I made
while rejuvenating our bus......

In reality, we took the 7mm wire directly from the relay in the  
engine compartment
(that ensures the aux battery is charged from the (standard)  
alternator) & ran that
to a 30map Bosch twin relay (one side for each 100w driving light).   
The relay is
triggered by the high beam circuit via a switch under the dash (in  
case I need to)
isolate the driving lights.

For Avocado Tom:	Yes, all of Tassie roads are country roads except  
for the
bits where the cities are!!

But they are the best country roads for running a bus on!!
