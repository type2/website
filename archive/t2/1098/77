Cured that problem on our bus by running a 7mm power cable (used by
stereo installers to power big amplifiers, etc) from the aux battery  
to a 30 amp
relay which is switched by the high beam circuit to turn the driving  
lights on.
Didn't bother with upgrading the globes to higher wattage units as  
the low
beam is quite good and the driving lights are there for high beam.

Had similar after installing driving lights and refitting headlamps  
after painting
the bus.  Saw lots of possums in the trees and bushes at the side of  
the road
until I found a country road to align everything properly!
