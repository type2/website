Subject: Re: CHEAP Bosch H4 Headlights

This an awesome deal from Bus Depot.  Two years ago I bought a
pair of the Bosch H4 lights at $38 each.  This satisfied customer
highly recommends the upgrade.


Free H4 headlights:
I could not dump my used (no-name brand) H4 lights in the trash.
They have good glass and reflectors, with beam cutoff for driving
on the right side of the road.  I will send you my used H4 lamps
for FREE.  All you'll need are two H4 bulbs (buy (-at-) Bus Depot) and
any bay-window bus.  ;-)
Pmail me your mailing address (USA) and I will ship them.
