to add.. you can nip the corner of the plate with a hack saw,, so you don't
get grinding sparks... just as another choice... then clean up the tank and
keep a good layer of paint on it.

also ,, that mud flap will help it from being gravel blasted going down the
hiway.

good points!   even a very small woooof or flame up can burn ,,, burns arn't
fun.

Play Safe!
