Wow.  I feel bad for you.

You didn't say what carb you are running.  I'm assuming a Solex,  34  or 
maybe a 31/32.  Could be an electric choke problem, broken, not opening all 
the way;  easy enough to check and adjust.  Or an idle mixture problem.  Try 
adjusting the idle mixture screw for highest RPMs, then back off just a tad 
by turn clockwise; then adjust the idle air flow screw above it to get the 
idle speed you want.  If it is still running too rich check for a 
restriction or blockage in your air intake systen.  With a  stock oil bath 
air filter a frequent culprit is the little lever on the side with the 
weighted handle.  It should open easily and fully when the engine is running 
at highway speed RPMs.  If not find out why and fix.

You also did not say anything about timing or the distributor you are 
running.  The symptoms you describe could be the result of retarded timing 
or failure to advance, because of a vacuum hose leak, something stuck, etc. 
Again, easy enough to check with a timing light.

Good luck.  Many seemingly big problems in reality are just one or two small 
ones.

Cheers,

John R.
