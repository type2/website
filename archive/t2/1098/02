Subject: type2.com website and email archives

I've put together a few things to help revamp the site a bit, and  
think it's ready to be thrown to the wolves for some testing.  I'm  
very open to feedback and opinions, so feel free to PM me on your  
thoughts.  This is not a finished project.

The email archive search now includes all emails as far back as 1993  
(maybe further?) This means that the original vanagon list, vintagebus  
list, and type2 list are all searchable now.  You can search them  
individually or all together, and boolean search terms are usable (I'm  
repeating myself a bit from a type2 post last week here.)  Even this  
is still under development,  since I am still working on getting the  
subject line to be printed in the search results list.  Aside from  
that though, it's completely usable.

There are no plans to modify the location or configuration of the  
original site, that I am aware of :)
