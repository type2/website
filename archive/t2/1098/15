Courtney is right you would be better off with a 1776 type 1 , get one  of 
the good aluminum cases and if you do things like a bolt on oil filter  
assembly and alternator and electronic ignition you would have the perfect  
engine for your bus a money to put gas in it.

If it  was me, I'd keep the VW based upright engine and bump it up to 
either 
a  1776cc or a 1914cc engine. The simplicity, room, and general lack of  
sophisticiation works in your favor as far as I'm concerned when it comes  
to 
reliability. I've often thought of going the reverse route and putting  a 
upright engine into my 77 Westy. They still have this setup in Europe.  
Save 
the hassle and buy some 90.5cc P&C's and a decent carb and  exhaust for 
more 
oomph. The 1776cc setup is pretty bulletproof IMHO. I've  built many HP 
engines up to 2276cc monsters and think the 1776 and 1914  should have been 
a 
factory  standard.
