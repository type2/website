Kevin,

I have found that permatex anti-seize works well. The compound contains 
copper and graphite in addition to oils and it also smells like trans oil 
only stronger. I guess it has some of the same high pressure additives. The 
copper and graphite should survive the temps on the exhaust bolts. There 
could be some water wash out problems over time.
