I've done it, and it worked and lasted until I could replace the entire 
assembly. (about a year)  but and it's a big BUT.  it was a PITA and a lot 
of work.
first you gotta take the entire thing out of there.
the gear was reassembled using a tooling resin (if I recall it was 
Devcon)mixed with steel wool and basically doubling the thickness ofthe 
gear by layering it on both sides of the roughed up gear.

it took a couple days of mostly waiting for things to dry.
