You need to remove the CV bolts to attach the boot, so no.  you can't 
replace both boots on the half shaft with only removing one CV.  I 
always take the CVs apart and clean the balls and ball cage.  It's good 
fun getting them all back together correctly the fist time or two.  Once 
reassembled I run a zip tie through the holes in the boot and CV to hold 
it together while I'm reinstalling.  It's good messy messy fun!
