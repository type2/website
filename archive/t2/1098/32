Subject: Re: [T2] Jake Raby type conversion kits

I too have not used one of these kits, but do have experience dealing with Jake.  I would not hesitate purchasing anything from Jake.  I bought a turn key type 4 2056cc for my 914.  I owned it for years. It was very reliable, I never had the do anything but regular maintenance.  I sold the car to a guy that just wanted the engine. Jake has a great reputation. He alwayed answered the phone and would was always willing to help or give advice.  Yes his stuff is expensive, but you get what you pay for. He doesn't cut any corners, he gives you the best. 
When I bought my engine I told him what I was going to use the car for, he picked the displacement, and all the components to work togther perfectly.  I did try to get him to build me a stock replacment motor and he wouldn't do it. He said I would be disappointed.  I was very happy that I took his advice and never regreted the money I spent.
Jake is a great guy and extremely knowledgable.
