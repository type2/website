Subject: Re: [T2] wiper motor repair

Yeah, I went through the broken gear with my Bus a bit over a year  
ago, swapped in the Bosch wiper motor from a Mk3 Golf instead of  
trying to repair broken plastic.  I borrowed the idea from the  
watercooled folks over on the Vortex...

Pros:
Bolted right up, mounting and shaft are functionally identical to the  
Bus unit
Low and High are about 1.5 times faster than the old motor

Cons:
Had to adapt the connector from the old motor, Golf uses a different  
plug
Make sure you don't get the SWF motor, has to be Bosch.
