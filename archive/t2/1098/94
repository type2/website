It is not one that VW or lots of other makers follow either Martin with the
main feed from the battery/starter to the fuseblock, nor for the supply to the
second battery on a late deluxe bay westy, so I wouldn't sweat it much, though
a nice 30A there or a fuseable link always is a good idea.  If it gets cut
into, you'll have a fuse, the wire for however long it lasts.  Of utmost more
importance with something like that is make sure folks if you do run an
unfused heavy wire, don't EVER run it close (I've seen them cable tied
directly to) a fuel line.  Or close to anything you don't want red hot if the
wire gets cut before it burns up (under carpet never a great idea for
instance.)

in my first email that this is what I have done. Someone pointed out that the
fuse on this wire should be close to the solenoid which is a good principle
but not one I have followed!
