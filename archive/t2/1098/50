That's really cool, Pete! It's interesting that you managed to stay in
view of the same group of cars throughout the time, especially
noticing driving a poor handling vehicle like a bay that you were able
to catch up on straight shots because the folks ahead of you didn't
know how to drive the right line.

I wonder if a Speedway lap is close enough to get your "Drag the Bays"
sticker over at

http://savethebays.org/

Even if not, they will send you a free Save the Bays sticker.
