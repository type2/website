The alternative is to run a wire from the +ve wire on the starter solenoid
which is the stock point to feed power to the front. I should have mentioned
in my first email that this is what I have done. Someone pointed out that the
fuse on this wire should be close to the solenoid which is a good principle
but not one I have followed!
