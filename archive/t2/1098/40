Subject: WW accel pedal lever

I had a problem with the same part on my '70. Mine had the lever come apart
from its spindle as the light turned green downtown on my way to work. I
made a new and better spindle with a trip to a good hardware store and some
contemplation. The spindle is only pressed in to the lever, so if there is
any slop in the arrangement, there is lateral force againt the ha ha press
fit. Mine was good enough to stay together across the Bay Bridge, although
that may have been more the bus' good influence than any inherent good
manners on the part of the part. I told WW about it, thinking they would
like to know they had some parts that were waiting to fail, and they did
send me a brand new lever instantly. Which was also a press fit at the point
of failure.

So I am still running the original, seeing nothing worthwhile in taking out
a fix that is stronger than the official replacement part. Nothing against
the vendor; WW treated me well. The bus turned 40 last week and the slop in
the pedal linkage prohibits using a part that cannot take a bit of
undesigned-for stress, what can I say?
