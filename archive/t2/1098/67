Take the bus to a coin car wash as often as possible (at least every 2
weeks) and hose the underside off. Drive it carefully home and let it
dry thoroughly.

I'm still getting rust but it's growing much more slowly than it did
in the GWB when I had that one.

I've recently bought an old Saab to drive as often as possible in the
winter in hopes of preserving the Guacamole Bus...
