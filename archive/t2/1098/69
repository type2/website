Subject: Re: [T2] CHEAP Bosch H4 Headlights

Ron .. you rock, and your timing is most excellent.  I've got Hella  
H4's on the Bus, but have been wanting to get rid of the crappy EMPI  
H4's on the wife's Cabriolet (same 7" rounds) without going back to  
sealed beams.  I've got good Osram bulbs in them, but they're still  
crappy EMPI H4's.

Ordered a set this morning on my way out the door to work.  Thank you!
