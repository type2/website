Hi all, 

Besides owning a '78 Westy, my daily driver is a '73 super beetle. I just go
back home after driving in the dark, and thought about the halogen lights
everyone has been talking about for the buses. If I change to halogen lights
for the beetle, do I need to run additional wiring for the halogens?

Thanks,
Bob

Did the same. Generic H4 headlights coupled to Hella 500 driving lights 
(on high beam only). Added aux fuse panel in the engine compartment 
($8), added relays to everything. Used HD wiring from the battery to 
fuse panel, from fuse panel to front of vehicle, also for the relay 
circuits, etc. Am using one relay per light b/c the relays were cheap 
and I did not want to lose a light on a dark night to a faulty relay.
