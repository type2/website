Subject: New Product - Fuel Tank Crossover Pipe Assy

Another shameless plug.........251-201-147 B

Airhead Parts/VWG has just finished in-house production on this repro. This
is a virtual USA Made reproduction copy of the ORIGINAL. Not a cheap looking
part with just two "funky" "make-do" nylon fittings and "quasi-rubber"
crossover hose that has been available elsewhere.  The fuel resistant tube
is thicker walled, but still very flexible and "formed" just like original.
Already test fitted and fits/works GREAT.  I'm gonna install one of these on
my 84 GL that so desperately needs one (& two grommets - Airhead/VWG makes
those too!). No more filling the tank 1/2 way to prevent gas spills and
fumes.

I might take a few of these to the up coming Buses By The Bridge next week.
