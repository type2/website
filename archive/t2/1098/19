Subject: Hard start with warm Engine

Hello folks,

So I have a 2000cc air-cooled bus. I installed dual solex 40/44 carbs.
Everything seems to be doing well. Cold start I have no problem starting, Warm
start I have to turn over and over its takes awhile, but will start just
really hard. I replaced all ignition items except the coil. I did foul My
plugs awhile back and i'm thinking it may be over jetted, and it is flooding
the carbs when I turn it off, if that is even possible. Any Ideas... Thanks

Steven
