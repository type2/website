Subject: Re: [T2] Tracing cirucuits - multimeter between negative

Hey Courtney,

Use your meter on amps or milliamps. Likely you will need a milliamp scale 
for a small leak. Be very careful not to power anything up while the meter 
is in place, or pooof!

Place the meter on which ever side of the battery is easier to get to. If 
the meter goes backwards, simply reverse the meter leads.

Now the funs starts, unplug circuits one at a time until the leak goes away. 
I would do this at the fuse box. Now trace from there.

Just trying to remember this again, my mind is leaving quickly at the age of 
56. :-) I want to trace a slow drain on my battery.
1) Do I put the multimeter set to volts or amps for checking a drain?
2) Do I put the leads between the negative terminal and the neg cable, or 
pos terminal and the pos cable??
3) Any other comments welcomed.
Thanks folks,
Courtney
