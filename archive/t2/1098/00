  Re progressive carbs and keeping it warm:  (and being cheap)
I ran a progressive carb off a junked Pinto on my 71 bus- bolted via an 
adaptor to the stock exhaust heated manifold. Ran fine, (Syracuse to N J 
weather) no worse milage, but power when you tromped on the gas was 
definitely better than the stock carb.  Choke was manual via a cable 
that ran to wall behind driver seat. It's still on the bus, left in the 
woods in 1983 when rear axle rotted out.  Due to clearance above carb 
being about 3" I installed a large plate around the throat which held a 
wide but not high air filter with another plate above it, held down by 6 
eyebolts each side that I could clip springs between.  A rebreather hose 
end was epoxied into a plate.
