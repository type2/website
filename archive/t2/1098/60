	Jamie would be correct.  If in doubt, get expert help.

	That fire + series of explosions may have been the famous 
mishap in the memorably named (if not correctly spelt) Mississauga, 
Ont.
	The LPG you can buy is a mixture of propane and butane.  The 
Spanish seaside camp was destroyed by a bursting road-tanker of a 
much rarer LPG, propene.  They all make good fuel-air explosives. 
The volume of gas from a leak is about 300 times the volume of liquid 
that leaked.  Then dilute that an order of magnitude to reach 
combustible fuel/air mixtures; add a spark, passing diesel vehicle, 
or other source of ignition, and you may get on TV  ... :-(
