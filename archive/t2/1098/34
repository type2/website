Subject: accelerator pedal linkage installed

So I called Wolfsburg west about their pedal linkage part #211721631A. It
broke about a week after installing. They quickly said they would send out a
replacement.

Meanwhile I did the following:

1.    I took the broken WW copy, and drilled the pivot pin hole out to <.

2.    I bought a clevis pin & some extra washers.

3.    I used this clevis pin to install.

4.    I used the washers to get a snug fit.

5.    I put a bit of grease in there to help with lubrication.



I am considering installing a spring under  the accelerator pedal itself,
although I dont think there was ever on there originally, but I think it
might give me a more responsive pedal feel.



I have posted some pics on the samba.
