	Jim's advice about purchasing would doubtless be tops.
	I will then chime in with my warnings to prevent slow leaks 
of LPG.  In the "right" mixture with air it becomes a much more 
destructive vapour-cloud explosive than the same weight of, say, 
dynamite or TNT.  Adding the fittings you buy to your LPG tank must 
be done with correct materials and leak-testing.  Get the right gear, 
and probably pay an expert to fit them.  Otherwise, not only your 
camper but also several others nearby could be suddenly demolished 
upon ignition of an LPG vapour cloud that you may not have smelled in 
time  ...
	Sorry to be such a gloom merchant on this theme, but quite a 
few vehicles have been destroyed (and boats, and areas of jungle in 
Viet Nam  ...) when LPG/air vapour clouds have ignited.  Even if no 
explosion occurs (it's not very reliable, as was discovered in the 
development of fuel-air explosive weapons in Viet Nam), a flash fire 
is another possibility  -  actually a more efficient way of killing, 
over a shorter range.
