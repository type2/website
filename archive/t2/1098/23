Yes on keeping the type 1, but no on the aluminum case unless you are 
willing to go to a lot of work to make sure that the case is machined 
correctly.  A web search will reveal a lot of horror stories about this.

Don't get too carried away with the high performance if you want a 
reliable engine.  1776 would be about the largest you would want to go 
unless you have lots of money to spend.

If you want larger than that, get a bus made for a type 4.
