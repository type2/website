I saw a HUGE difference going from sealed beam halogens to H4's. Even
with the crappy US market Silverstar bulbs.

Those were right after installing them on the GWB. The same ones are
now on the Guac (I've replaced the bulbs once.)

I paid more for them than Ron's selling the GOOD ones. Mine are "Autopal".
