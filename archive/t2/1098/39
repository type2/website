Subject: Re: [T2] curtain question

The year does matter...  late bays have  * I * shaped upper rods,, and the
lower 'rods' are flexible vinyl covered springs...

both 'rods' go thru the loops in the curtains..    there are no hooks..

the sliding door curtain only has the upper rod loop,,, there is nothing to
hold it down,
the front window curtain has snap domes
all the rest have 2 rods,, an upper, and a lower.   the sides are flexible
on the lower.. * I * shaped alum on the top
the rear door has upper and lower * I * shape alum rod

the early bay,, has rollers with loops and hooks sewn into the curtain for
the sliding door,, iirc.. the rest i dunno
