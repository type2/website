Subject: newbie/oldie

      Just a quick note to introduce myself to the list. I'm driving my 
third Vdub van/bus, an '82 Westy with about 130k on it. Previously I had an 
'82 Vanagon and, many years ago, a '68 bus.  My wife and I, a few years ago, 
spent three months camping in Europe in an '87 camper van with a fiberglass 
"bubble top" which seems peculiar to Europe since I've never seen one in the 
states. Seeing Europe in this way is absolutely the best way to do it, in 
every conceivable category, and great campgrounds proliferate. It's good to 
kibbitz on VW talk once again. Best, Art McGinn, Spokane
