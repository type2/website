Subject: Tracing cirucuits - multimeter between negative terminal and

Just trying to remember this again, my mind is leaving quickly at the age of 56. :-) I want to trace a slow drain on my battery. 
1) Do I put the multimeter set to volts or amps for checking a drain?
2) Do I put the leads between the negative terminal and the neg cable, or pos terminal and the pos cable??
3) Any other comments welcomed.
Thanks folks,
Courtney
