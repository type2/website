Subject: My rear drum brake is sticking when it gets hot and smoking

I have an 82 vanagon with 126k miles original parts and motor.

When I drive over 50 miles my rear drum driverside brake locks up. It starts
to smoke and I have to pull over and wait at least an hour before I can drive
again. I  just replaced the pads and the old ones were craked and looked as if
they had the same issue in the past.
What can I do to fix this??
