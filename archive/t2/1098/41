Subject: RE: [T2] accelerator pedal linkage installed

Have you driven a bus without this spring? Do you think you notice a
difference? Would you recommend them?

I figure the accelerator cable has a spring on the other end((-at-) the carb) but
a 2nd spring would help it slide better. Mine seems kind of stiff. I think I
should also pull my accelerator cable, and make sure it has plenty of lube
on it.
