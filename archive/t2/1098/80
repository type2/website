Subject: Re: [T2] H4's & HID retrofit kit

I have a friend who used this kit for his old Rabbit:

Once you have the H4 reflector, this is *almost* a plug&play install.
The only thing he added was a fat red wire from the battery with an
inline fuse.

BTW: The 6000K model is what he got and it's still a bit blue, but not bad.
