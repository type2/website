If it was me, I'd keep the VW based upright engine and bump it up to either 
a 1776cc or a 1914cc engine. The simplicity, room, and general lack of 
sophisticiation works in your favor as far as I'm concerned when it comes to 
reliability. I've often thought of going the reverse route and putting a 
upright engine into my 77 Westy. They still have this setup in Europe. Save 
the hassle and buy some 90.5cc P&C's and a decent carb and exhaust for more 
oomph. The 1776cc setup is pretty bulletproof IMHO. I've built many HP 
engines up to 2276cc monsters and think the 1776 and 1914 should have been a 
factory standard.
