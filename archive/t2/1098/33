Subject: accelerator pedal lever

Update, complaint & question

1-I had written into you guys about the pedal lever I tried to replace on my
bus. The original one had the holes on it oval out over time. This was
causing the pin that should rotate to catch every now and then. Made for
tricky accelerating, or stuck gas pedal.

 

2-A few of you suggested or showed me how you had repaired the pedal hinge
on your bus-which looked nice, but was not exactly the same problem I was
having.

 

3-I ordered a repair kit from Cip1, and it wasn't even close to fitting.

 

4-I ordered a replacement part from WW. This was closer looking to the
original, but the stem on it was about 1/8" shorter. So the retaining clip
that holds it on, just barely grabbed it. 

 

5-I still installed it. About a week later the pedal stopped acting
properly, so I assumed  that the retaining clip fell off. I waited for some
decent weather-today it is 34 degrees.

 

6-I took the pedal pan off, expecting to find a retaining clip on it, but it
turned out that the new part I put in had broken. The part # is 211721631A. 

 

7-Anyone know where or how to get a decent one of these?
