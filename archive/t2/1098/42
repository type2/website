You might want to try BustedBus. They should be able to get you OEM
replacement parts. I got a LOT of parts from Chris (I believe that's his name)
when I was sourcing parts for my Bus.

Help,I'm looking for a source for the hooks or what ever hold  the
westfalia curtains in their tracks.. I see that the front curtains are  held
up by
regular snaps like for a convertible top . My problem is all the  other
windows that have sliding curtains.
Thanks
