If the "Rock 'n Roll" anti-seize is good to 2500 deg, would that work on the
exhaust gasket nuts? The ones that hold that dumb donut gasket? These always
rust out on me, I've treid anti-seize, which doesn't seem to last too long.
I was told it isn't really worth the effort, as the muffler gets so hot,
that it burns off the anti-seize very quickly. But 2500 degrees.that sounds
like it could work.

Was writ:

"Putting antisieze on the threads will also prevent the theads from galling
- especially if high tightening torque is applied.

 

Just remember to put a light amount.

 

I have had really good luck with a ceramic based paste called Rock 'n Roll.

 

Use it on everything. Good for up to 2500 deg F."
