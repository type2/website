The correct flat head screws are great...if you use the correct
screwdriver. Many people try to get by with some skinny screwdriver that
doesn't fit the slot correctly. You have to fill the slot. I even found a
screwdriver set that has 2 with the correct blade - 1 long and 1 stubby.
That stubby one is great for working with the engine in the vehicle.

 Forget phillips, that's even worse than cheesehead. I go with 10mm head
 bolts, put em in with a ratchet.

 I kinda like the cheesehead screws. Troy's bus has phillips and they seem
 more prone to stripping. Now maybe a swap for good torx screws...
