Terry,

Arrrrgggh!  Can you give us a *real* name?

I would like some of this stuff, but if I go into AutoZone and say, "I 
need some GM sealer"  they are gonna look at me like I'm from Mars...or 
worse yet, from Venus!

Might work better at NAPA, but I generally can't get to one of those after 
work before they close.

Does it really say "GM" on it or is it from someone else?

Name, Name, Name!!!!


LOL!  

Cheers, dave
