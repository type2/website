Subject: Re: [T2] small holes in my heater boxes

Best fix is to braze sheet metal patches over the holes.  Doesn't look
OEM, but I have boxes I patched 100K+ miles ago that work fine.  Don't
forget the joints where the exhaust pipe goes into the box.  Tighten that
hole up and the box vibrates a lot less which stops holes from forming.
