When I first got my '77, the sliding door was frozen shut.  I couldn't get
it open for squat.  I finally managed to get it open enough to remove the
mechanism on the rear of the door.

It took using a torch to heat the thing to where I could get it apart.
Cleaned and lubed it and it's worked flawlessly since.
