Subject: Steering column to floor part??

What is this part?
http://busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=211415601B
I can't seem to locate it in the Bentley and I'm pretty sure the
steering column to floor area of my bus doesn't have one. 78 Westy 2.0
FI with replaced TRW steering box and drag link.
