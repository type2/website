Hi Volks,

Just over a year ago I pulled apart a 411 engine that had sat for 25  
years. It was a rebuilt bought from VW Canada that had been driven  
for a week before the vehicle was  totalled. It had been stored in a  
barn ever since.

The cheese-head screws were all well rusted into the tin. A big  
screwdriver turned with vice-grips would move about 1 in 5, but the  
rest were solid in place. PB-blaster was little help.

The answer for us was to heat them up with a propane torch and quench  
them with a candle. The wax wicked into the threads and they would  
then spin out with very little torque required. It worked like magic,  
and they ALL came out easily as a result.

We replaced them all with 10mm hex-head M6 bolts. They don't look  
stock, but they don't argue when it's time to get them off, either.

Whoever it was should be lined up against a wall and shot--dead, morto,

I had to use the impact driver on every one of them ( seemed like a
hunded of them.)

Then someone before you took that engine out, apart, and put it back  
together using type 1 engine screws. I
see it all the time.

You can just about know a type 4 engine has not been screwed with  
when you see it still has all its original
cheesehead screws.  When I see all straight slot screws, I cringe  
knowing it is a basketcase inside. Ususally
the case says GEX under the tin......


Happy trails,
