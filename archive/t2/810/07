my insurance (Metlife) also gives a discount if there is an "active" theft
deterrent system.  they physically checked my bus when I put in a hidden
start switch that has to be held down for the ignition to work to make
sure it met their requirements but they gave me the 5% discount, every
little bit helps.  although the only reason I think they might want my bus
is for the canoe on the roof........;8*(-at-)
