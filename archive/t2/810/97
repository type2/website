Subject: Defroster cable

Does anyone have a solution for replacing/repairing the cable
that controls whether heated air goes to the windshield or
foot vents?  This would be the cable that attaches to the
leftmost red heat lever. The defroster cable, the outer metal
sheath has broken. The cable for directing heat to the back
cabin area is broken, as well as it's outer sheath.  I remember
looking for these parts over 10 years ago and could not find them.
Can I just use some stiff wire as a replacement?
