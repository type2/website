Of course, more power costs more fuel since it is simple energy
conservation (physics definition, not government definition)

Now, if you drive your 1776 reasonably on the highway I doubt that you
would see a huge decrease, but if you use the extra power to cruise at 80
you will definitely see a drop!

On another avenue, what about compression ratio?  You _can_ increase
efficiency by running higher compression ratios.  Of course you have to
run premium gas, but what with the runup in gas prices this might not be
too hard of a hit.

Back when regular was 1.20 a gallon, premium was 1.40, a 17% difference.
Now with regular at 2.80, premium is 3.00, a 7% difference.

If the higher compression ratio yields better than 7% better mileage
(about 2 MPG) then it would be worth the extra cost of premium.

Food for thought...
