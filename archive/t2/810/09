Dan,

While I haven't tried any of this that I bought yet, it should work fine 
for heater boxes....the outside of the box should not ever see 1,000 
degrees.

I would *not* use JB weld for heater boxes.

I bought it to use on some small bumper parts that I intend to powder 
coat(400F).

Cheers, dave
