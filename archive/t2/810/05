Subject: Led Alarm Light

I would hate to lose my Zanderbus so I remove a short hose from the dizzy every night when parking.  The light is a great idea though.  I do worry about ignition being punched out so the light should stop that.  I'll do that I think.

Our Govt. insurance here in Manitoba has reduced insurance if you install a chip (?) which you have to use if you want the bus to start.  Far too expensive to install. Maybe can't even be done in such an old vehicle.
