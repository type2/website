Subject: small holes in my heater boxes

I have some small holes in the outer skins of my heater boxes on my 78
2.0L FI bus.  One is worse than the other, but I don't think replacement
is an option for the time being.  Can I patch the holes with something
like JB Weld or some other similar type product, or does the amount of
heat make sealing it like that difficult?  I certainly don't want that
stuff to start to cook and give off any fumes that could make it into the
passenger compartment.
