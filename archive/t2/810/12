<<Terry, 
Arrrrgggh! Can you give us a *real* name? >>

GM Assembly Adhesive


<<I would like some of this stuff, but if I go into AutoZone and say, "I
need some GM sealer" they are gonna look at me like I'm from Mars...or
worse yet, from Venus! 
Might work better at NAPA, but I generally can't get to one of those
after work before they close.>>

AH Ha !!!

It can't be bought at the "Zone" or at NAPA---Only Any Local GM ( Chevy,
Pontiac, Cadillac, Saturn, Buick ) dealer. 
 
<<Does it really say "GM" on it or is it from someone else? 
Name, Name, Name!!!!>>
