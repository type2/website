Subject: [T2] Source for front turn signal lights, '73-79?

The part I am looking to replace is the LIGHT FIXTURE.

This is the electrical part that the light bulbs plug
into.  It holds the front parking light and the turn
signal light.  One light fixture on each side, in the
front, below the windshield wipers.

Where can I buy these?  Brasil? Mexico? NLA? Junkyard?
