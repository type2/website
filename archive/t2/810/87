Subject: Re: [T2] Sliding door not shutting properly

Had similar problem with mine.  When I shut the door, it would scrap  
paint off the panel edge.  I haven't replaced it yet, but the nylon  
bush that sits behind the sliding 'hinge' is apparently the culprit.   
I have one now & will replace it before it gets painted this weekend.
