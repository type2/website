That's a first place to check. It is probably idling fine in gear
because the AT is slowing it down, but can't be good for the
transmission.

 Hello -

 I have an 81 Vanagon with FI and automatic transmission.  It idles
fine in drive, but when it's warm and I put it in park, it idles too
high.  As soon as I have it in gear, either drive or reverse, the idle
is fine.

 I'm thinking the Aux Air Regulator is probably stuck open.  Any opinions?
