Subject: heating controls ?? and full moon bus club still down?

Hi, just a few ??s. First I was trying to see if the heating was working in  the bus last night, I know that it worrked in the sprringn when i bought it, but couldn't figure out the controls. Thhere are the 2 red levers (heat) 2 blue levers (cold), but what positions do they have to be in to work (all the way up or down) then there are the 2 round vents on the dash which is for the outside air? or heat? then the vents at the footwells, which i believe is for outside air. Also there is a round button that pulls out at the drivers side pedestal , what is that for? Any help is apprreciated.
 
Also I was wonderring if anyone knew what was up with  thee  FMBC website. I am no longer getting the non-payment page, but a errror page. Was just wondering if I have to re-configure computer settings or if it's just not working...

thanx
 
peace,
Tracy
