Thanks, Carl. My tin was originally fastened by a mixture of about six 
different screw (and bolt) types; I replaced everything with new slot 
head cheeseheads purchased from a dealer. I'm not clear about Terry K's 
complaint; it is easier to get good torque on a stubborn fastener with 
a slot head screwdriver of the correct size (and a pair of pliers on 
the shaft) than with a Phillips head.
