Subject: Re: [T2] Where is the online l-jetronic manual again?

I used this one when i was converting my 83 T4 2.0 into my 73 westy:
http://www.conservatory.com/vw/manuals_nyx/L-Jetronic.html

I printed it out and even put it in little page slip/covers so it wouldn't
get greasy and never went anywhere without it :)

I found it to be very helpful, here another manual on the same site, L-jet
with the lambda sensor
http://www.conservatory.com/vw/manuals_nyx/L-JetronicWithLambda.html

and as i was looking found these other sites:
http://manuals.type4.org/ljet/introduction/ljet01.htm

http://www.angelfire.com/wa2/fits

and of course don't forget Bartniks info at the bottom of this page
http://type2.com/bartnik/tech1.htm


Good luck!
