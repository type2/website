Guys,

A *real* keyless entry(remote start) alarm system is really
not that expensive....and the ones I like come with a remote that works up 
to 3/4mile away...*AND* it tells you if someone is messing with your car.

Maybe $80-$140 or so complete with everything.

To me, it is kinda like buying a motorcycle helment...how much is your 
head worth....??

http://asianwolf.com/caralarms.htm  scroll down the alarm/starter
page for the cheaper models.

Yes, you will need to spend a little time figuring it out and installing 
it in a "theft proof way", but it is very rewarding to know that you are 
safer when it is done.

Works even better if you can keep your engine(battery) compartment locked
as well so that no one can get to the battery connections.

Cheers, dave

 my insurance (Metlife) also gives a discount if there is an "active" theft
 deterrent system.  they physically checked my bus when I put in a hidden
 start switch that has to be held down for the ignition to work to make
 sure it met their requirements but they gave me the 5% discount, every
 little bit helps.  although the only reason I think they might want my bus
