Subject: Re: [T2] Steering column to floor part??

I can vouch that this part is present on my 74 but is
not present on my 79 and would not fit on my 79....2
different bases at the bottom of the steering column.
It is indeed the plastic insulating ring that connects
the outer steering column to the cover that goes over
the shaft-to-steering box connector.  Greg
