Subject: Re: [T2] replacement tin screws

I agree about overtorquing them, but I've yet to strip one, I torque them 
with the sensitive torque wrench experience has built into my hands...I left 
Hippo Hands behind many years ago.    :-)
Those cheeseheads are one of my least favourite screws, followed closely by 
phillips.

Not a bad idea, but nix the ratchet.  The captive nuts in the tin can't
take that much torque, which is probably why VW used cheeseheads in the
first place.

People who are bucks up might want to consider allen head screws, along
with the appropriate ball-head Allen driver.  Lets you put good torque on
the screw even if you are misaligned.
