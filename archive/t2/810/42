Subject: Date of manufacture stamp?

Hey everybody. Has anyone else noticed that various VW parts have a little circle stamped on them somewhere? The circle has a line in the middle with numbers in both halves. I am pretty sure this stamp is to indicate the month and year of manufacture of the part. The wheels that came off my old 72 had 11/71 stamped on them, as does the oil cooler.

The reason I ask is that one of the date stamps has me scratching my head. The left side heat exchanger is stamped 9/71, which is right for the 72 model year. However, the right side HE is stamped 6/75. I'm confused because I thought I knew that the whole exhaust system was redone for the 74 model year. Both of these HE's were on the old 72 when I got it, and the right one looks identical to every picture I have seen of 72-74 HE's.

So here's my question: Did VW continue to use 72-74 style HE's on models sold outside US?
