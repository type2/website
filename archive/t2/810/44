Subject: FI intake runners

I was cleaning up some fuel injector system intake runners, about four pair, 
and I noticed there was a number embossed into each of the dual runners. 
Probably not noticeable with the FI installed, and definitely hard to read.

There were the single numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.  I doubt that they refer to 
the cylinder numbers.

Any answers??  No, I am not going to play the lottery with these numbers....
