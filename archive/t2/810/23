Subject: similiar high idle when warm problem

Hello - 
 
I have an 81 Vanagon with FI and automatic transmission.  It idles fine in drive, but when it's warm and I put it in park, it idles too high.  As soon as I have it in gear, either drive or reverse, the idle is fine.
 
I'm thinking the Aux Air Regulator is probably stuck open.  Any opinions?
 
Marc
