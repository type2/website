Subject: Bellhousing wanted

Does anyone have a diesel Vanagon bell housing and
flywheel they want to part with.  I blew one of my
wasserboxer engines and want to replace it with a CIS
1.8 I four engine I have.  I have a rebuilt (rancho)
83 (aircooled (content))Vanagon tranny and linkage I
want to connect to the I-four but I need an angled
bell housing.

Will trade for what ever you need aircooled,
wasserboxer, rabbit, jetta or cash.

Thanks
