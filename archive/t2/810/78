Subject: FMBC Site

From my understanding the site got attacked by a "bot" that tried to spam the
site or something to that matter. Anyways the site will be down till the
security problem is updated and fixed. I was told that it should (should being
the magic word here) by the end of this week. I hope it gets back up soon as I
am missing the site. By the way you can get your FMBC fix by joining the
FMBC-Chat group on yahoo. Cant remember the exact link but you can find it
rather easy by doing a yahoo groups search for "FMBC-chat" Hope everyone has a
beutiful day, CHAD
