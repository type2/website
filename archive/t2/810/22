Greg:

Your high idle problem may be caused by a faulty decel valve.  You can 
test this by clamping shut either of the large rubber hoses that lead 
to/from it, then seeing if the problem disappears.  That was the case 
with my '79.  I couldn't find a new decel valve so I took a rubber 
stopper and plugged up the inlet of the rubber S-boot between the 
throttle body and AFM.  Slipped the hose back over the stopper and it 
looks completely stock and no more high idle when warm.
