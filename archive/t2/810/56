Subject: RE: [T2] Tool I'd like to see...

At the suggestion of my engine builder I bought some feeler gauge stock from
McMaster-Carr. At only about a dollar each 12" piece buy a couple (for
spares) of each size around the setting you use for your valves. I set my
valves to 0.005" so I bought 3,4,5,6,7 thousandths gauges. This way I can
check the setting before I adjust and monitor the wear. It's sooooo much
easier to use without the weight of the handle I can't believe I didn't do
this before.

My poor feeler gauge is beat to crap. All bent up and such. I've been leary
of getting another because in 2 adjustment sessions it'll look no better.
