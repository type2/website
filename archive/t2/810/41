first with auto tranny the accel linkage needs to be checked.  since it
goes thru the tranny it is adjusted differently than a manual and is
adjusted first.
then adjust idle. remember the auto tranny engine idles about 100rpm
slower than a manual.

do this first before touching anything else. 90% of idle problems in an
auto tranny bus is in the accel linkage.
