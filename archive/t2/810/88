Subject: Re: [T2] Sliding door not shutting properly

Hello Tim

I was having problems with my sliding door, with the time the problem become 
worst and worst, at the end I found out that the "U" shape holder in the 
back of the door was complety dry I mean no grease at all after cleaning and 
regrease a 20 minutes job with the help of my 15 years old son (AKA future 
owner) the door perform like a charm so my advice is to clean, grease and 
recheck the system before anything else.
Good look
