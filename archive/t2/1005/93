Subject: Looking for pickup parts

Does anyone know where I can find a fuel filler neck for a 74-79  
single/doublecab?

The part number is 261-201-119 and the shape is more angled than the  
standard bus version.

Several people are telling me just to fit the bus version because  
this item is NLA. Has anyone does this and had long term success?
