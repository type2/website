Subject: FW: [T2] Rear License Plate Bracket - Update with Pics

Hey all,

Here are pics of my old lid (top), and new lid (bottom)

As you can see, my old lid had two holes, 1 1/4 inches apart (center to
center). Attached to these holes was a bracket to hold my standard US
license plate.

The new lid had two holes, 4 1/4 inches apart.
Plus, they are in the center of the lid. See here:

The emissions sticker on the back of the new lid mentions 1978 California
emissions standards.

Thoughts on this anyone?

Eric
