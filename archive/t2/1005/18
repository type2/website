Subject: Bentley manual for '73

	Being as how the best shop in my city has no Bentley manual 
for T2, and wants a ridiculous price to import one, I suppose I 
should chance my credit card details to the Mass. publisher.
	For a '73, the nearest I can find on their website is a '74, viz.

	Or am I overlooking a better item?
