CIP1 has them:

or

http://www2.cip1.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=VWC%2D211%2D401%2D263%2DA


for tops or bottoms.

You might need to get new clip(s) for them too. Just a warning... they
are a real PIA to get them in and out. Plan accordingly. WD-40 and
long pair of needle pliers is a big help.
