Subject: Studs vs bolts

Anyone care to conjecture as to why the Type IV engine has studs on the
intake and exhaust to the heads, rather than bolts?

Seems that the use of the studs makes it a lot hard to  replace the just
head since it appears that the injector tubes have to been removed from the
intake manifold to clear them from the head, and the exhaust is just a PITA.

Any reason why it would not be a good idea to use the proper size and grade
bolts, in lieu of studs on these points when replacing the head?
