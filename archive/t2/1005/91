Subject: "Magna-Gard"

Through a farm magazine, I got a flyer for
"Magna-Gard" which is a ceramic magnet small
enough to drop into the interior of an oil
filter, there to remain and be discarded with
the filter after, it is said, having collected
much small particles and saving your engine.
There is a website, kleenlube.com

I am, as always, skeptical, but wonder if 
any of you have experience with these.
