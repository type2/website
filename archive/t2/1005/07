I've used my 79 bay to haul some brick (in the middle) and then also to move
everything I own (in a few trips) across town, and some of those loads had
to be rather heavy and it handled it (suspension and power) without a
problem.  I think part of the problem is that people put car tires on their
bay's...that would seriously destroy your weight handling ability.

any idea if a bus could actually do what the video depicts (obviously it's
been down already) and come out without too many bruises?  It *looks* like
the bus handled it very well...
