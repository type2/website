I cut foil and bubble-wrap insulation to line the walls of my pop-top for winter camping, besides added insulation it really brightens things up for the evening card game.

We have a Mr. Heat (I think that is what it is called) and we fire it up for a few minutes every 45 minutes or so, really crank the heat up high and then shut it down.

This worked well up in the mountains east of Eugene while snowshoe camping, so did jumping in Cougar Hot Springs the next morning.
