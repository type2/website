I modified a bilge blower to fit the plastic fan widget that attaches to the
top of the engine compartment, after removing the dead fan motor from mine.

With a little work, it fit perfectly.  Unfortunately, I no longer have a bus
to try it out on. :O(

From those pics you can see how the original bits that held the motor to the
plate were used to mount the fan in the same position.

And the piece that I removed:

I still need to transfer my design for the plastic plate on the opposite
side of the blower housing (where the air intake was located originally)
into resin.  Haven't finalized the design, pending air flow studies and the
possibility of an air return into the passenger compartment.

I envisioned maybe placing a duct from the bilge fan housing to just behind
where the spare well is in the back as my own spare was mounted on the front
and there was no spare in the way.
