Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Tell us about YOUR heat

I had one of those gas heaters, but never used it - just sold it to a guy.
My heat used to suck until I got that auxillary fan that goes inline on your
duct system. Once I got that it, my defrosting time was cut by 3/4 and I
found that Zoey was warm and ready to roll (relatively speaking in a bitter
20 degree cold) in about 15 minutes.

It's a loud little bugger, but just getting that air FROM the engine to
where you need it makes all th difference in the world.

The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is Christians, who
acknowledge Jesus with their lips and walk out the door, and deny Him by
their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds
unbelievable.
