<<Whadya do about the condensation this causes due to the H20 being
produced? I have a caylitic also (nice, as the surface will never get
TOO hot) but it gets drippy inside....>>


Mike,

On the roll, with the stock heater blower's howling, there is none.

No drip's on the inside of the ride's.

If you would sit for an hour or so--yea, I can see if getting wet and
foggy inside.

I don't stop for an hour on the way to work---.

Keep moving with traffic at 70 plus , and you shouldn't see any London
Fog inside your vehicle----

I don't.
