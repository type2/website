This has been discussed a few times on the list this year.

They could be. Most were that way up to 1979 model year.  Around 10 years
ago, On 72-74 models, VW had a recall campaign where they replaced the
heater boxes/manifolds and the hoses (VW pn 211 255 387).  In some cases
they even came out to your house to do it.  But that campaign expired
several years ago.

The replacement hoses in question are no longer available from VW.  But
thanks to Jon Stiles, he has a step-by-step procedure on replacing them with
something equivalent at this link:
