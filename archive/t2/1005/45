Subject: Shredded Westy Canvas - How to replace?

Hi all:

Last weekend at the Nevada County Celtic Festival the bus and I had a 
wonderful time -- except for the storm squall which tore through the 
Sierra last Friday night.  I had plenty of towels on board form a recent 
camping trip (clean!) and plugged up all of the new rips in the 30 year 
old canvas.  Got through the rest of the weekend with duck tape but it's 
now time for the inevitable.

I want to order the canvas kit from Bus Depot or the like.  My questions 
basically are these:
How long will the Remove and Reinstall take.  Can I do it in a day?
How many helpers (and how much beer) do I need?
Any tutorials on line?  I am abut to check ratwell, any other ideas?
Caveats and warnings.  This stuff is expensive, I don't want to wreck it.

Thanks,

BEN
