Actually John, it doesn't explain it.

You said: "The Cali models have wider spaced holes that bolt up with a US
spec plate and don't require an adapter. 
... 
So in closing, you got a Cali engine lid for your Federal bus. You will need
two generic round plastic plugs that expand when the screws go in from the
front (your federal used square plastic plugs)."

If you look again, the holes aren't far enough apart for a standard US
plate. Plus, they are in the middle of the lid - even if they were far
enough apart, they are too low.

My old lid did not have any plastic plugs at all. The existing bracket was
bolted through the lid with nuts on the inside.

Hey Eric,

Did you get my previous reply yesterday? It explains it so I reposted it
below.
