Hi John,

Does your engine run good or can you hear something wrong? I am sure
you know what you are doing but are you sure that you are at the right
spot to adjust your valve?

Find TDC, pop off your valve cover and make sure you can rock both
valves. Then move your engine backwards 180 degrees. Now, adjust your
#2 valves.

I hope it is a simple mistake, and not a seat going out.

Good luck,

Max
