Subject: Re: [T2] Re: HVLP Turbine Paint Sprayer on Sale, tail lights

Believe me, I know that HF has good things and bad things, I always buy top
brand tools when I want them to last more than a year. I have a bench drill
press bought from HF back in '91, works like a charm and always has, for $38.
Also, my favorite forging hammer is from HF, bought in '86, it started out as a
2 1/2 pound cross pein hammer, its now 2.12 pounds (from dressing every few
years) and has gone through 4 handles, and I should have bought a dozen of
them, at $3.99 each. Its even better than my $70 Bloom rounding hammer!

Um, VW content....oh yeah, I installed a new right tail light bucket and lens
in my bus this afternoon, and the new lens/light looks MUCH dimmer than the old
one on the left, here is a pic;

I cleaned all of the contacts with a rifflers file before I put them back on,
and all of the lights work properly, I havent checked the ground for that side
yet, that might be it, just wanted to know if anyone else has had this problem
before with the new tail light buckets....

 To get a splash of reality when shopping that candy store, take a
 cruise over to Woodnet (http://www.forums.woodnet.net) and search up
 Harbor Freight. You'll find discussions about the "Gems" and "Turds"
 of the products they have.
 
 The roll away tool cabinet is reportedly a Gem. I consider the often
 $15 trim router a gem. Etc.
