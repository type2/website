Rob asked:


 I am looking at my 'new' '79 Westy, what is the enclosed cabinet to 
the right (side) of the cabinets behind the drivers seat? Does it open?

Do you have the Westy owners manual?

It is on the www.type2.com website under Bartno Tek on the left side [78 is the same as 79]:

Or you can buy a new 79 Westy manual:
