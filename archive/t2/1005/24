Subject: Re;Bentley Manual For '73

 RM,

I'd take a good look over at thesamba.com type 2 classified's or E-Bay.

Used manuals always pop up in these 2 locations, and always pretty
reasonably priced.

I'll have to take a look--I might have an extra one laying around that I
could sell you.

               << Being as how the best
shop in my city has no Bentley manual for T2, and wants a ridiculous
price to import one, I suppose I should chance my credit card details to
the Mass. publisher.
                For a '73, the nearest I
can find on their website is a '74, viz.

 Or am I overlooking a better item?
