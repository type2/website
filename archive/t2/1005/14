Subject: dashboard pics & overspray...

Does anyone have any pictures of what the dashboards should look like in a
'69? 

 

My dash has a small tach on it, I assume this is not original.

 

There is a small light next to the levers on the dashboard. It is just a
bare bulb, the cover for it is missing. I'm not sure if it is original, nor
do I know what it is supposed to do.

 

The levers on the dash, I believe the two on the right are for fresh air
vents. It seems like these are unable to go completely off. The other two
levers are for heat, right? I can move these, but what is the difference
between them.  One of them seems spring loaded, whenever I move it it
springs back.

 

Also the PO apparently got the whole dash covered in a light mist of paint.
I think he just didn't mask it correctly. I would like to clean it off. I
was going to try to use goof-off or something like that. The dash is not in
the best shape, it has some cracks in it etc. But I don't believe I can get
another-so I don't want to use anything on it if it will destroy it. What do
you guys use to clean paint off a dash without destroying it.

 

Last question this round.did the dash have a speaker mounted under it, and
if so how was it attached? The existing radio in my truck was wrecked beyond
use. I pulled it, and there was a speaker that had been screwed to the dash.
The screws went right through the dash into the speaker. It was obviously
not original, but I wasn't sure if this was a good spot to mount a speaker,
and what is the best way to mount it.

 

 

Thanks for any suggestions,
