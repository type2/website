Subject: A few questions about our '78

Well, it is running and we were able to drive it home from the farm - about
35 miles or so. I have just a few questions I am hoping someone could help
with.

First the easy ones. Someone in the buses life installed VDO gauges for Oil
Pressure, Temp, and I don't remember the other right now. My question is
this - Once warmed up what is a good range for the Oil Pressure to be? It
ran right around 60 psi for a while but by the end of our trip had dropped
to around 20 psi. Not knowing what to expect 20 psi seemed very very low.
Also, what should I expect the temp to run at - I know it can vary but at
what point to I freak out turn it off and pull over?

Now for the big question. The bus intermittently loses power - I haven't
pinpointed any pattern to this yet. We will be driving along just fine and
then nothing - the engine is till running and the lights are still on but no
response from the accelerator. It's like it isn't getting any fuel. So we
pull over - turn it off and usually it starts right back up and all is well.
It did this twice yesterday while driving short distances but didn't do it
at all on the 35 mile trip home. Any input would be wonderful.
