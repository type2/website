To get a splash of reality when shopping that candy store, take a
cruise over to Woodnet (http://www.forums.woodnet.net) and search up
Harbor Freight. You'll find discussions about the "Gems" and "Turds"
of the products they have.

The roll away tool cabinet is reportedly a Gem. I consider the often
$15 trim router a gem. Etc.
