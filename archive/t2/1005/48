Hi, I was going through my basement the other day, and forgot I have an
original westy "striped" tent complete.  I don't want to use it, but a fellow
VW "friend" said they are hard to get in such good condition, so if you are
interested, contact me off line: sydclarke(-at-)shaw.ca and we can "jaw" on the
particulars.  Thanks,  and a good Canadian Thanksgiving to you all.
