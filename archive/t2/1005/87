A couple of things come to mind, aside from the ground.

There are different wattage bulbs that fit the same socket. Make sure you're
comparing apples to apples.

Is the replacement DOT approved? Maybe the new lens is not as transparent,
or maybe the old one is faded. Maybe the old one is a non-DOT
lens.Crackingand crazing will often make the light appear brighter,
much like a dirty
windshield glares when driving into the sun.

Thanks for the tips on the HF tools... I'm checking out the site now.
