I'm just back to the list after a few years off. And I just drove my bus
('69 was a Riviera, now a transporter) today for the first time in almost a
year.  It's got a new transmission, engine bearings, pistons, cylinders,
heads, heater boxes, and lots of other stuff.  Just getting it started and
running has taken me about two weeks, not including the months of
disassembly/reassembly, but I finally got idling well enough that I wanted
to drive it around a bit. And it drives nice.  And the heat works. I'm a
happy man.  I put better than 100 pictures of the process on webpage.  They
are in chronological order over about 3 months, so you can see how easily
distracted I am.  It's one big page with almost no text, so it will take a
while to load, but there's some interesting stuff there.
