Subject: RE: [T2] Rear License Plate Bracket - Update with Pics

I bit the bullet this morning and drilled holes for my old bracket to go
back on.

In the end, it looks good. Still don't know what those weirdly placed holes
are for.

If you look again, the holes aren't far enough apart for a standard US
plate. Plus, they are in the middle of the lid - even if they were far
enough apart, they are too low.

My old lid did not have any plastic plugs at all. The existing bracket was
bolted through the lid with nuts on the inside.
