There were tachs, but if it isn't a close match for the speedometer it is
aftermarket.

That is probably the brake warning light, which lights up if there is an
imbalance in the brake system.  It normally has a red lens.

Different years work differently.  The heat levers work the left and right
heat exchangers.  I work mine together.

If air is leaking through the vents even when off, the seals in the air
door (behind the grille) are probably shot.

Be careful.  Goof-off will probably attack the dash better than it attacks
paint!  Test on a small unseen spot and wait a couple of days to see if
the solvent has a long-term effect.

There was an oval speaker under the center of the dash screwed down from
above.
