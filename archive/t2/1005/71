	This is an opportunity to point out that asbestos is 
sometimes best encapsulated in place, rather than mobilised.
	Asbestos is a classic illustration of chemical industry 
denial & dishonesty over a proven hazard.  After decades of stalling, 
lying, upcovering, and going bankrupt to evade liabilities, the 
industry producing asbestos has now been considerably cramped in its 
style.  But vague public awareness about lung cancer caused by 
breathing asbestos fibres has sometimes led to irrational 'oook  -  I 
want it out' reactions.  Mobilising the fibres/dust is, in itself, 
bad; only if it's thoroughly collected & disposed of should you do so.
	In many situations you can encapsulate asbestos in place, 
preventing any significant rate of release of fibres into the air. 
For example, roof shingles of asbestos cement (installed 4 - 5 
decades ago) can now be developing leaks.  They should be impregnated 
with low-viscosity acrylic paint (followed by a high-build acrylic, 
and then a top coat of normal acrylic).  This fixing in place is 
cheaper, and safer, than hiring labourers to rip off the shingles and 
chuck them down into a dumpster creating clouds of asbestos dust.
	I don't even know whether the  Rear Heater "accordion" tubes 
contain asbestos.  All I'm saying is that, if they do, please don't 
assume automatically that the thing to do is to remove it.  There may 
be materials that can fix it in place, more cheaply & safely.
