Indeed,

What I should have said is, "I have seen about 4 totally unique adapters for
Federal buses with differently spaced holes, none which fit a US spec
plate."

Looks like your new lid falls into one of those categories and may not be
from a California model. Or it may be from a Canadian or European model.
Curiously, did the either lid have a yellow emissions sticker? I would love
to add this to my emissions trivia.

These buses are very mysterious...

It is unfortunate that you drilled the holes, I have a couple of the wider
adapters sitting in my parts bin. Your later more specific description made
me take a second look.

Oh, and I love your plate!

Actually John, it doesn't explain it.

You said: "The Cali models have wider spaced holes that bolt up with a US
spec plate and don't require an adapter. 
... 
So in closing, you got a Cali engine lid for your Federal bus. You will need
two generic round plastic plugs that expand when the screws go in from the
front (your federal used square plastic plugs)."

If you look again, the holes aren't far enough apart for a standard US
plate. Plus, they are in the middle of the lid - even if they were far
enough apart, they are too low.

My old lid did not have any plastic plugs at all. The existing bracket was
bolted through the lid with nuts on the inside.

Hey Eric,

Did you get my previous reply yesterday? It explains it so I reposted it
below.
