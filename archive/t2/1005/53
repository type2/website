Hi, since it is Friday..A few years ago, my wife and I took our '74 Westy over
the Mountains to the West Coast of Vancouver Island, and I made sure she was
warm, with a complete Eider down bag.  She was content and warm.  Halfway
there, the snow got deeper and deeper, and temp had dropped.  When I came to
the first set of "twistys", at the top of the pass, I went to lift my foot to
use the clutch, but my boot was frozen to the floor mat!  Had to pull over to
the side of the road, and "rip" the frozen carpet and boot apart!  After that
I tapped boots to any song that came on the radio, while wife chuckled from
the warmth of the down bag!  Made it my main future "fix", and am still
working on it!
