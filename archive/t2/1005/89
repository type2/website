Subject: Re: [T2] Studs vs bolts

Possibly the chance of damaging the aluminum head as a result of trying to 
fit a misaligned bolt or from repeated removal and replacement of a steel 
bolt into an aluminum casting? Phil

 Anyone care to conjecture as to why the Type IV engine has studs on the
 intake and exhaust to the heads, rather than bolts?
