Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Tell us about YOUR heat

Actually most VW Buses and Vans really don't have a knock down , heating
system worth mentioning.
Bus or Vanagon.

The Vanagon throws heat outa the rear heater, and the front--but sure
isn't real toasty on the way to or on the way home fro work during the
winter.

Here's what I did that helped a bunch--same with my 74 type 2 Westy
which has a real tight and excellent functioning heating system--for
what it is.

When I go outside to start the vehicles I also fire up my Mr. Buddy
heater.

I have a cup of coffee, and by the time I get out there --it is really
warm, and
comfortable.

Same thing for the ride home.
10 minutes before I want to roll, I fire the vehicle up, light the Buddy
Heater and go back in till I think it's time to head home.

I'm plenty toasty, the Buddy heater is more than reasonable to buy, and
it works well in conjunction with whatever you have for a heater in your
Bus, or Van.

I have even used it in the rear portion of my Sportsmobile to suppliment
the heater.

Light it up, and hit the road.

The biggest problem is the space you have to heat in the vehicles this
large inside.
You need big BTU's and volume to get the job done efficiently in zero or
sub zero temps.
