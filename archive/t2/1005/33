I think I should have been clearer... We all know gas heaters are
great, but what about using the existing system?

Before I found the BA6 (at the junkyard, woot!) my plan was to use a
pair of blowers sucking air from the cabin and pushing it through the
HE's. I'm wondering if the boost is enough in sub-zero temps, or if I
really have to put the gas heater in the bus to keep it toasty at 12k
feet in January.
