Subject: JuMp Seat needed

Hi guys.
Although I haven't sent any emails I've been trying to
keep updated reading them from the list. With Spring
fever coming on hard here I was thinking I need a seat of
some sort for the extra kid :)
4 kids.. 1974 Westie. (2 adults)

I was thinking of temporarily taking out the fridge/stove
from behind the front passenger seat and installing one there.
I don't use the fridge or stove while camping. (for function I bbq
and have a small camp stove for use on picnic tables) and an electric
cooler which is super super efficient and movable to a picnic table too.

So. Anyone have something they want to sell?
Just a basic jump seat similar to the ones in the 73's, I believe (behind
the driver). Color doesn't matter.  If there is one close enough I would
rather buy one then try to fab one up (because of lack of tools).

Any ideas, something from something else that would work better?
