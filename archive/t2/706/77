Seann,

Can't really answer your question as I only have the "old" eastwood one.

The gun has to do exactly two things.

"Atomize" the powder(so it doesn't come out in big glops).
And put enough electrical charge on it so that it is sucked toward the 
powder coated piece.

I would guess that the details would be in the electrical part as the 
"atomizing" part is pretty simple.

I have however recenly gotten some powder that insists on trying to stay 
in the gun....went to do another color and the powder that I have used 
before comes out very nicely.

There is a difference in powder!

Once you start powder coating, you will love it....I finished a bunch of 
pieces in hi-temp silver for an airplane over the weekend...my buddy is an 
A&P mechanic and is doing a twin engine plane.

Please let us know how it works.

Cheers, dave
