Subject: Vanagon transmission interchange

Volks,

I am having some problems, whines, squeals and groans that I suspect are
the sign that my trans is dying in the '80 Vanagon.  I would love to hear,
if anyone knows, which years of vanagon trans will fit and the
advisability of flopping in different transmissions.  Mostly I'd love to
hear that the bell housing did not change between the air and water years
and that they did not stack up the gear ratios too too badly to use all
those extra horses.
