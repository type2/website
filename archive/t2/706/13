Subject: Re: [T2] steering coupler disc r&r

We replaced both the Steering Gear, as well as the
rubber coupler some time ago.  As far as the coupler
was concerned, it was easy to get at, since there are
only 2 screws holding the access plate (at the
drivers' feet, under carpet).  But replacing it was
tedius.  After removal, we needed to fabricate an
electrical grounding pig-tail to replace the damaged
original.  Otherwise, R/R is not difficult. 
   
My steering gear was wet with oil, as the bearing had
failed, and the torqued seal couldn't contain the
lube.  The replacement gear was ordered, arrived, and
the repair was scheduled.  So we got into the steering
gear not knowing of the coupler condition.  The
coupler condition was terrible.  It was a clear safety
hazard, as it was separated on one side, and tearing
on the other.  I was perhaps hundreds of miles away
from losing the ability to steer.
    
Remember, the steering coupler is rubber, and does not
conduct electricity.  The horn works by getting
grounded by depressing the horn button.  To maintain
the ground, you must have an electrical path from
upper steering column two-hole flange, around the
insulating coupler, to the two-hole flange connected
to the steering gear.
   
Don't know answers to your other questions.  Sorry.
