Subject: Water based, el-cheapo rust converters

My rust converter was whatever brand that AutoZone sold at the time. I tried the Mar-Hyde spray on version and it was a joke. It did not function well as a paint and within a week the rust was back. 

Tried this brush on stuff (and admittedly I did a better job of prepping the metal) and for whatever reason no rust now for 5+ years. Is white but turns black as it dries. I was told by a friend to be sure to top coat it with regular paint of it too will fail. 

Basically I use it like a primer. I remove just as much rust as I would have for just basic primer and then use this stuff. 

Treated the battery trays way back when (5+ years) and it's still holding. Then again it might be the metal impregnated filler I used to cover the pin holes. I dunno. I have not had any reappearing rust anywhere I used it. 

You knwo the whole rust deal is that you've got to get as much off as you can, convert any that might still be there in the voids of the metal, and then deny it oxygen. IF it could be cleaned and sealed well enough, paint would do this just just as well. I think the brush on style does a good job of covering the metal better than the spray on which gives a very thin coat and requires several coats to cover well. Each has it's purpose I'm sure.
