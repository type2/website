Hi Steve,

Mark Dearing went through this exact issue just last week when my 
parent's westy upchucked its fourth gear. You require a 1980-83.5 
aircooled tranny. Accept no substitutes.

Happy trails,

Volks,

I am having some problems, whines, squeals and groans that I suspect are
the sign that my trans is dying in the '80 Vanagon.  I would love to 
hear,
if anyone knows, which years of vanagon trans will fit and the
advisability of flopping in different transmissions.  Mostly I'd love to
hear that the bell housing did not change between the air and water 
years
and that they did not stack up the gear ratios too too badly to use all
those extra horses.
