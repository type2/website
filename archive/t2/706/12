Subject: Re: [T2] Pierburg carb defects?

What I have a problem with is being attacked or criticized for pointing out
that there is a problem with something because I'm not specifying what those
problems are. Just pointing out that there are problems with these items is
in fact helping, I do not have to be specific. At least now the rose-colored
glasses have the possibility of being taken off and the parts viewed as they
should be.

As I said before, I do not owe the customers of other companies customer
service on their parts.

Ask them what the problems are. Oh yeah, THEY DO NOT EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY
ARE! Or they do, and are selling them to you anyways, and yet I'm the bad
guy LOL.

I'll sell the same "brand" of carb for $70 cash to anyone that wants them,
no returns or exchanges allowed. The fact that my $70 carb will be defective
out-of-the-box and the buyer is being fleeced should not be mentioned,
because they are getting such a good deal! ;-) Normally these defective
carbs are not sold, and ACN eating these defects is why we are not as cheap
as other companies; but we don't stick it to the customer if there's a
problem.

It astounds me that people will line up to being ripped off, and this will
never change, even if you warn them beforehand.
