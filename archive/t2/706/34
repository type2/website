Subject: Pierburg carb defects?

   I agree with John.  You often get what you pay for and pay one way or
another.

   A few years ago (OK, more than a few), I worked in a FLAP.  We sold lots
of rebuilt and new parts including carbs.
   I do not recall getting enough defective starters, alts, etc... back to
note, however, we "never" sold a rebuilt carb that worked.  None of the
mechanics in town would even try to use them with out installing a rebuild
kit.  
   Why did we have them?  Because to get the best price from the supplier,
we had to carry the whole line of parts.  We put the carbs in the back of
the store room and warned everyone they were crap.  We spent a lot of time
sending the crap carbs back to the vender for a re rebuild.  The folks that
bought them spent a lot of time waiting for the parts to come back to them
the same as they were sent out.  In the end, we took the crap carbs back and
credited them to the purchase of a new carb.  This process cost us a lot of
time=money.
   If I was the owner, I'd just hide the crap carbs in the back.
