You won't get electrocuted by a 12 volt battery... I once got zapped by several put together in series making 96V. 

Baking soda + water. 1 part soda, 1 part water. Mix together and brush on with an old brush. Rpeat until the foaming stops. Then go back and rinse with plain water. 

Understand that acid may spalsh on you so wear old clothes and wash them afterwards (a shower wouldn't be a bad idea). I was trhe battery "officer" on a Navy ship. We wore heavy rubber gloves and a rubber apron. Eye protection was a requirement too. 

I would recommend doing this on the ground, and use this as an opportunity to clean your battery tray (wire brush if ncessary), coat in a rust neutralizer (I used a regular water based rust converter - brush on version, spray version was a joke) and then brush on paint. Spray is okay but from a rattle can it takes ALOT of coats to get the job done. 

Also I'd remove the clamps from the cables, ground strap (etc.) and clean them too. Mineral spirits will clean the junk off the wire insulation so that when you are done they will look new.
