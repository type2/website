I didn't notice that it was a gullwing.

Seems a bit like a
modification-for-the-sake-of-modification thing. 
That rod that is holding the door doesn't look
particularly strong.   I'm not big on hacking a
bus, but if I were going to modify the side door
it would be to put on splitty cargo doors.  I do
envy those.
