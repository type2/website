Subject: idle hunting

Hey folks, my 79 2.0 FI auto camper is just about
ready to be released from the shop.  The engine is
running sweet and quiet but not as smooth as I'd like.
 The idle is hunting just a tad when cold and warm. 
It varies +/- 25 rpm or so...not much but you can hear
it.  The engine has about 50 miles on crankshaft up
rebuild, new fuel pump, new points, new double relay,
new cold start valve, new thermo-time switch, new temp
sensor and new vacuum can.  The mechanic is going to
smoke the engine tomorrow to check for vacuum leaks
but I was wondering if any of you have had experience
with this minor hunting of idle and what might cause
it.  Thanks!  Greg
