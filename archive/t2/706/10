Subject: steering coupler disc r&r

Replacing the steering coupler disc is not addressed by Bentley or 
Muir, as far as I can tell.  Would someone who's done this job be 
willing to share the procedure, caveats, etc?  Also, are the couplers 
from BD or Bus-Boys inferior to oeveedub's, which costs twice as much?

Our '78's coupler doesn't look dangerous but is beginning to develop 
some hairline cracks, and we'd like the peace of mind of having a fresh 
part here before our trip.

thanks as always,
