Only one that I found.  30PICT-1 carburator on our '69 bug didn't fit on
the dual-port manifold.  Went to the wrecking yard and by pure chance
found a dual-port manifold center section that accepted the carb.  I've
been told that these are not common.

You can also get carb adapters and aftermarket center sections that are
drilled for both 30 and 34 carbs.

Of course, you'll need the cylinder tin.  You'll probably want to switch
to a doghouse cooler and that will need its own tin as well.
