They're canvas. Removeable. Roll 'em up and stow 'em.

I think the "story goes" that they bought it pretty much done like this at
BBB 2 or 3 years before this show where I took the pics. They added some
finishing mechanicals and the paint but didn't actually do most of the
mods. 

I think Britt G. talked to them about it and he retains info on odd buses
better than I. He may not be keeping track of the T2 list with his current
monthly CA to Ireland commute schedule though, may want to ask on the BSKA
list and pass any info back this way -- or point him to this thread and ask
him to chime in.

The gull wing would be cool if it used a couple of HIGH DOLLAR big gas
struts for support and had roll up canvas sides. It would make a nice foyer
if one didn't want to set up the big awning they have over it in the
photos. With the big awning and no sides it seems sort of pointless.

The thing is, I didn't get a good "way off" shot of the camp site from the
passenger side. If you could see all the "stuff" they have in there that
they've unloaded you'd know that this baja isn't intended for a lot of
weekend campouts. It's set up to get as far away from people as possible
and set up camp for a week at a time. That thing is PACKED when they're
moving.
