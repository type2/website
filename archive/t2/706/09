This is quite a good explination of what makes up the difference in
cost between some vendors. I suspect most t2ers would agree it's worth
the premium in this aspect. I fear that you are overlooking the tone
you took in the previous email when craig expressed concern about his
purchase of a much cheaper product.

I'm sorry, but blurting out that you know there is a defect in a
product that you are not willing to share with the common good of
knowledge is NOT participation. Taking the time and effort to make
sure your customers do not get crap is exceptional (especially in this
day and age), and in many cases well worth the extra cash. Even more
important when shipping to/from a vendor comes into play.

My bus recently turned 40k miles since purchasing an engine and
assorted parts from you at the beginning. I can attest to your claim
that you do sell quality parts, and will continue to support and
recommend your services to others. I can only suggest that this and
the other comments that you see as "attacks" are only viewpoints of
both current and prospective customers, that only want the best for
their bus.

I hope not, I'd like to know WTF is wrong with some products. As a
last thought, if there is some legal mumbo jumbo that prohibits your
disclosing the information I can understand the tight lips, but will
be very warry of any company that imposes that on it's vendors.
