I buy all my VW parts either from trusted local shops or from list
participants, _and_ I expect to pay a fair price for those parts and the
advice that generally goes with them. I do, however, have a problem with
the "My parts are better than their parts but the reason why is a
trade secret" concept.

If there is a difference between the "cheap" Pierbergs and the "good"
Pierbergs it would be good to know what it is, so that folks
can be sure thay are getting the "good" Pierberg for which they are
paying a premium.

If the difference is so minor that it cannot be revealed because
customers might buy "cheap" Pierburgs and fix the defect themselves,
then is the "good" Pierberg really worth a 40% premium?
