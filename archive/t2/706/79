Subject: Re:T2 baja bus

I'm surely mistaken, but my impression of camping with a bus was
supposed to be a minimalist thing for those who have tired of sleeping
on the ground under ripstop and unwilling to drive a 40 foot road
monster.

The baja bus concept presented and discussed here could be described
as either a gypsy caravan or everything including the kitchen sink.

What a hack job. That vehicle belongs at Burning Man or the bog at
Watkins Glen New York. This is what happens when you give a drunk a
sawzall and a wire welder (Hey, I resemble that remark!)

Don't forget what the old lady said when she kissed the cow.
