They are next to each other on the periodic table so each have subtle advantages.

Here are a few facts:

When the beetle was conceived the engine designer, Reimspiess, intended to use magnesium to achieve Hitler's mpg requirements and to achieve good front wheel traction by making the rear of the beetle was made as light as possible.

Another benefit: Mg was abundant in Germany before and during the war and every German was going to own one. Aluminum was heavily imported and recycled. 

During the war when production was converted to Kublewagens the cases were made from Al alloy for strength. After the war when beetle production was ramped up the first cases were Al just like the Kubelwagens but with increasing demand they switched back to the original Mg alloy design and the Hydro foundry in Kassel produced those cases for decades.

Back in that era the time required to cast and set Magnesium was much less than Aluminum and production numbers further required the switch.
