Thank you for your comments.

One thing I appreciate about the vendors that I do business with is that
they tell me which parts are better and, most importantly, why they are
better.  That makes me a lot more confident in my purchases from them.

John, you're under no obligation to help anyone, just a I'm under no
obligation to stop and help an aircooler who is broken down at the
side of the road.  I always stop, though, because I have the ability and
resources to help, and it is the right thing to do.
