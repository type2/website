this is a "hunting" problem common with 2L FI auto buses, there is a
simple work around, first of course check for vacuum leaks but I would
also suggest a resistor (trial and error, but start in the 25-50 ohm
range) wired between the temp sensor 2 and the engine.  usually will solve
the problem.

good luck
