Subject: Re: [T2] JuMp Seat needed

I made another jumpseat frame out of finish plywood using the left
side jumpseat as a template. Actually, I made one for each side since
the wood on the original was so rotted and moldy.

The one on the right side hasn't been completed or installed because
I've run out of time with my move to Colorado and such.

They're a very simple design, and quite sturdy if built correctly.
Don't be afraid to try to build your own. You may prefer them that
way.

Also, installing a jumpseat from another bus won't work because the
two sides are different, to fit the shape of the bulkheads. You'd have
to switch left and right, leaving the bare wood exposed instead of the
finished sides.
