John, 

I believe you're one of the better retailers out there. I would have
no qualms ordering from you.

BUT

This isn't the first time you've mentioned something, but refused to
provide any more information. In this case I can see why, but it is
still irritating to those of us that are just curious.

I'm obviously not in the market for one of the mentioned carbs. So
there's nothing to lose or gain for me here. Except the improvement of
the community as a whole. (If you come up with a cheap and easy fix
for the stupid leaky throttle bushings on my PDSITs, please let me
know! heh)

If you're afraid of the competition modifying the carbs to correct
whatever it is you currently correct, just say so. Nobody wants you to
dump a secret and lose money. But the intentionally vague reference to
an "out of the box" defect just irks folks. Saying something like this
would be better, "The things don't idle correctly. We modify the
carbs, with warranty, to provide the correct idle." You would be
telling us what you do without revealing a trade secret. (Everyone
note that I have no idea what is wrong with the factory carbs or what
is done. The above is just an example...)

Few of us have a machine shop at home to make whatever modifications
you make. And if CIP1 starts doing it, they're STILL not giving a
warranty, so I don't think you'd be losing anything by sharing with
the list as I've mentioned. But you'd definitely bank some respect by
doing so.

I still don't get where CIP1 uses "California" in their name. That and
the fact they sell GEX is enough reason to avoid them for me. heh

Just my 2c worth...
