The oeveedub dampener looks like the original "round" dampener, I *think*
(but the folks from bus depot and bus boys will surely correct me if I am
wrong) that the bus depot and bus boys dampeners are the "square"
dampeners.  The square dampener was original to the bug, the round one to
the bus.  The bolt holes are in the same place and the bug dampener fits
fine.  I have not mic'ed them to be sure that the thickeness is the same
nor have I spec'ed the rubber composition.  I *have* used the square
dampener in a bus and have not had any problems.

Replacement requires either two normal people, one under the bus to hold
the nut on the bottom and one to torque the bolt from on top, or one
person with 2-meter-long arms and three elbows.  Depending on year, there
are either cotter pins in the bolts or nylock nuts to prevent loosening.
If there are cotter pins, REPLACE THEM!!!! or buy new nylock nuts.  Make
sure the bolts go *down* so that if the nuts fall off depite your best
efforts, the bolts will still be held in by gravity. Note that the
steering shaft is an electrically active part of the horn circuit and that
the horn wire goes under one of the bolts... put it back on the same one
that it came off of!

OOK!
