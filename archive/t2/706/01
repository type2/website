I don't know how much this affects the fatality, but on my rebuild
they recessed one of the number three head studs further into the
case, which is supposed to relieve stress and prevent cracking.

Curiously enough I saw a vintage Beetle ad which stated one of the
benefits of the beetle engine was that the block was made of magnesium
instead of aluminum, claiming the magnesium to be superior to
aluminum.

Anyone have any idea of a possible scientific basis for this claim, or
was it just marketing hype?
