Subject: Powder Coating Equipment

Found a 60.00 Powder Coating rig in the Harbor Freight Catalogue.  My
experience with Harbor Freight has taught me to ask before purchase/buyer
beware.  Sometimes you get good stuff, sometimes you get stuff that gives
you nightmares.  I already have a design for building my own oven.  If I
don't set fire to the place and it works, I will let you all know.  For the
time being though, I'm curious if the range of quality diversity for powder
guns is as broad as it is for automotive paint rigs.  Any experienced volks
wanna chime in?

I would love to not have to pay market price for paying somebody to
powdercoat various bus parts I'm refurbishing.
