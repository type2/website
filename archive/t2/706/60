I own an auto repair shop, and we use only OEM or OES parts period.  
The cliche "you get what you pay for"  holds very true in my business.  
it applies to our labor rate as well.  While I had some customers 
complained I am too high (But at least 15% less than dealership labor 
rate), I tell them  do you want to come back to fix it again, or have 
it fixed right the first time?  Using high quality parts is a major 
part of this equation.   if they want to use a cheap $99 O-Reileys 
starter special, compared to a $250 OEM starter, I tell them you bring 
the part, I'll put it on, but there is no warranty on labor.  usually 
4-8 months later they are back with a bad reman paying me again to 
replace defective part.
