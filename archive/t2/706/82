Maybe camping with a "plain" bus is "supposed" to be minimalist, but with a 
properly fitted out camper, it doesn't need to be at all.

My ex & I used to go away every weekend, and take 4-6 week holidays in 
Tigger, and we'd carry bikes, hiking gear, chairs, table etc for when we 
were camped somewhere for a while.

The bikes would come out & be propped up against the bullbar, the gear from 
the back deck would go on the upper bunk and we'd be ready for camping, bed, 
stove, fridge, cutlery drawer, crockery cupboard, linen cupboard for the 
bedding, it has all the comforts of home ( why she called Tig " the mobile 
weekender" ;^), but she can still get a fair way into dirt tracks so we 
could camp on the banks of nice creeks we found & wake up to a babbling 
brook in the morning.

We DID get reminded one night that we shouldn't leave the washing up 'til 
the morning, though, we were woken up by a clattering outside, and when we 
shone the torch out the window a quoll ( small marsupial carnivore ) was 
TRYING to steal the frypan, problem was that it was about 3 times its size 
and it wasn't having much luck ;^)
