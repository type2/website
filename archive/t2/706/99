LOL.  I finally saw that on Sunday night, taped copy courtesy of the producer
'cuz I'm too broke for cable  In addition to Colin/Amskeptic and Patricia (the bus 
owner), I'm in it too -- the long-haired guy wearing all black .. on the hottest day 
of the summer, just my luck. :-\  The interview footage was taken at the Hawthorne
Lucky Lab, and some of "us Bus people" get together down there on Miser Monday 
evenings .. kind of a social evening, kind of a "support group".
