Subject: 4 year powdercoat test result

I can't remember if my powdercoating was done 4 or 5 years ago. I wanted to report to the list on the results. 

The items I am reporting on are stock VW wheels, in the weather 100% of that period. 

They have aged okay but they show some basic problems. 

One is that the sandblaster service was better at getting the crevice between the outer rim and inner hub cleaned out than the powdercoater was at getting powder in. I have some rust there. Minor. One lister suggested a bit of caulking to seal that. Match to color of wheel. 

Some rust at the lug nuts where the lugs busted the powder off when they were tightened. 

Lastly some rust at the edge of the holes that ventilate the brakes. Not enough powder applied. 

Color and gloss remain good. 

YMMV.
