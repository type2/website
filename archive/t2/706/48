Hi Ray,

He probably merged together the front of a 68-73 pop-top with the back 
of a 74-79 roof. I bet that takes a strong arm to lift, and I sure 
wouldn't want to have to re-install the canvas, either.

Personally, I wonder how many times he's broken something by dropping 
the gull-wing side door on it. Those things are WAY to heavy to be 
raising up like that.

Happy trails,
