Subject: Mirror fell out!

I was adjusting my mirror, and somehow twisted the whole mechanism causing
it to come out.  No matter how I insert it, twist it, play with it, it won't
stay in (okay get your minds out of the gutter!).

Is there a trick to this, or should I just bite the bullet and finally mount
one of those cool wide angle mirrors with the four lenses?

Thanks!
