Subject: Re: [T2] Pierburg carb defects?

I understand your point, but I do not say one thing and do another.

Those carbs have several problems we have identified. I'm not going to point
them out specifically because I do not want the other vendors using our
information on their carbs.

I do find it humorous that if someone tells you your house is on fire it's
of no use to you because they aren't specifically telling you which room.
