Subject: More Push Rods ??

Following the archived procedure for valve adjustments in the past has been relatively easy, but as of last night I am stumped.  When I go to adjust number 4 the push rod is extended and causes the rocker arm to push against the valve (intake).  The adjusting screw is actually removed.    I adjusted number 3 with no problems.  Rotated the engine and there it is.  Am I out of sync somehow????? Any Ideas?
