To add to Don's comments...

This is a group of DIYers that share information. The comments while helpful are simply out of step with the list and raise more questions than answers. I'm not suggesting how you should participate but I guarantee questions will be raised every time you make such a post and you will roll your eyes at the ceiling and the standoff will continue.

For the people who need a new carb, the news is helpful. For the person who has unknowingly bought a faulty carb, he is left with a lemon that might only require a simple fix.

You know what I think about that attitude? I'm not telling.

Please stop painting us as bad guys while extolling your virtuous nature. Unless I misread the exchanges, you did not offer to repair faulty carbs for money either. That would be helpful to everyone: the curious (future) customers and the needy (present).

I'm amazed how many people dislike this business on face value. They are great. You just have to learn to pick the good parts out from the bad ones. No vendor stocks it all.
