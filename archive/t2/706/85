Dear early 70s types,

Does anyone else find it bewildering getting the right shoes for bays 
from the early 70s? After several false starts I have finally located 
the right ones, but they weren't what any of the major suppliers 
recommended. My bus left the factory in early January 73, when there 
seems to have been a change of design. Although the catalogues all 
reckon my bus should take the later shoes (the last design used), I only 
made these fit by frantic drilling. Does anyone have an exact chassis 
number for when the handbrake bar changed from a vertical bar that 
presses on a pin, to the later horizontal bar that fits into slot on the 
shoes?

Stephen
