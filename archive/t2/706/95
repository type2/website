Subject: ISO: accel linkage pivot pin

well, busted bus didn't call me back, so here goes:

In search of an early bay accelerator linkage pivot pin.  finally wore mine
out on I-285 sunday morning.  coasted safely to a stop and stuck a
screwdriver in there and locked it down with vise-grips.  had to readjust
the cable end at the rear but that's it, got home fine if gingerly.

this is the pivot pin that holds the L-lever that the cable hooks to, to the
underside of the bus.  top end of the lever hooks to the accel pedal rod.

anyone have a parts bus handy??  if not, maybe you know which years would
fit?  have small stash of early parts to trade.

thanks in advance,
Will A.

PS. I am also very curious what are the pierburg defects.  I still welcome
the input as it helps to know there ARE defects.  Although, still looking to
find out what are the defects.
