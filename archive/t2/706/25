Subject: Embarrassing....

I have an embarrassing admission that I'm gonna reveal to my Bus driving
bretheren:
Though I've bloodied my knuckles and singed my skin a million times over;
though I've torn apart my engine and put it back together with varying degrees
of 'success'; though I've cursed and praised my beloved Karla and her
endearing idiosyncracies; though I've been given credit for mechanical genius
as well as (mostly) mechanical idiocy; though I've been left stranded on a
beer run but also faithfully transported up and down the Eastern Seaboard;
yea, through all of the good and the bad I have always, always sent any
electrical work to Silver Lake VWs. I mean, I fret and gnash teeth changing
the battery.
So.....how in the heck do I clean that crud off of the battery terminals
without electrocuting myself?
