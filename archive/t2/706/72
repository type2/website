Hello Guys   I even take it further in my shop  not only no warrenty, also if 
it is the wrong part and I have to put it back till you get the right part 
the cost is the same labor wise, also if it is the wrong part and ties up my 
lift till you get me the right part it is $50.00 per hour sitting on my lift,  I 
also increase my labor rate by $10.00 per hour.   Later and have fun  Mark
