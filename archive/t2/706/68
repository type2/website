Subject: Re: [T2] Pierburg carb defects?

the problem is that clearly some on this list feel I am obligated to answer
their questions, and I'm guessing some are pissed off if they were broken
down and you were to drive by (even if your dad was dying in the passenger
seat).

I get the distinct feeling from some on this list we are obligated to answer
their questions. That's bullocks. This list is about giving, some feel it's
about taking. If someone chooses not to give they should not be getting
shite about it.
