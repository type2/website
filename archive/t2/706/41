Yeah I did the same while working on the voltage regulator of my '66 Moostang (1st car). Welded my class ring to my finger and the hot terminal. I had to wiggle the ring back and forth until I broke the weld. Meanwhile the finger welding continued... Ouch! 

Don't even wear a wedding ring or watch anymore for reasons like this...
