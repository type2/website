Subject: single weber carb hook up + fuel pump location

Sorry,
I know I asked this yesterday, but I figured I would rephrase it and be more 
specific since I got no replies.
Does anyone have pictures or a diagram of a single weber carb hooked up?  
Mine is installed, but some of the hoses and wires are disconnected.  I just 
need to know where they go.  I thought it was posted on a website somewhere, 
but I can't find it.
Also, Is that the fuel pump that is on the lower passenger side of the 
flywheel?  Any pics/diagrams of where those hoses connect?
(I'm only familiar with f.i.)
Thanks,
Kyle
