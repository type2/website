The air from the cooling system is steady. Air from an exhaust leak is
pulsed. You will feel the difference.

I said the same thing when the guy told me that for my Z. The radiator
fan would be blowing air around the engine compartment! But he showed
me on his (that had a leak at #5) and it was easy to tell the
difference. You feel a TAPTAPTAP on the paper that you don't feel
anywhere else.
