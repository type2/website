Gess that's modification indeed.

Have you seen the engine compartment!!!!!

But I would like to have my top like that... Fill length... I would not
have to cut in the ceiling of my transporter... But I'm not going to
start that kind of project.... I'm like Nemo.. Why would you modify
something you like heh

Cheers

Patrick
