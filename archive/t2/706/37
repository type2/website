GREAT post Gerald. If I typed that much the guy in the next cubicle would wonder what I was doing... <griN!> My job is mechanical design, not typing. 

ANYHOW... Just wanted to add to be SURE to remove the battery for this. I have seen folks do this without removing the battery and all that acid and cleaning junk just pools under the battery or if you are lucky drains out under the battery. I know the battery gets wet each time it rains so in theory all that acid shoudl just rinse out, but it's worth the effort longterm. Each time I buy a used car I remove the battery for a bath, and I clean under the battery. If need be I sandblast/seal/paint the tray. Most suffer from total neglect.
