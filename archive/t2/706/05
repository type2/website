Subject: Re: [T2] Pierburg carb defects?

ok; how about we do quality control on our parts, and allow returns on carbs
and electrical items without question?

Why don't you jump over the "no returns on electrical or carburetor" stores?
Why do you allow this practice to continue without question? If a product is
defective, it's tough shit because it's a carburetor or an electrical
component? Gimme a break.

I'm under no obligation to help anyone figure out why they are not getting
what they think they are from another vendor.  I was just waiting for the
comments (then the attacks) to start, it was just a matter of time.

I'm done with this thread.
