my confession
-------------

one time I kept finding tight valves
and realized
after much puzzlement
that i had been turning the engine the wrong way
or had confused myself into thinking that that #4 was #3
or some such thing

maybe i was in a hurry?

i started over
and did it right
then everything was fine.


now, maybe you have a real problem.

but, if your engine ran fine
before you started the valve adjustment
it sure wouldn't hurt
to make sure.
