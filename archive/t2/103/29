Chris,

You specified all stock, so I am going to assume that you also have a
stock distributor.

On my 78 stock 2l, you time it at idle.  At idle there should be no
advance signal coming in from the manifold vacuum..at least there isn't on
mine.

In other words, at the specified idle rpm, you should be able to either
connect or disconnect the manifold vacuum line and see no change in the
timing.  Just off idle on mine, I begin to see advance signal from the
vacuum line.

This confused me at first because I came from a bug world where you either
static time or time with the vacuum disconnected.

Stumbles when cold? or only when warm?

It shouldn't jump around much on the timing light either...nice and steady
at a certain rpm.

Cheers, dave
