Volks:

After 4 phone calls and a check list longer than a cat's tail they are
running.  Not real well, but it should be enough to get them to my house
for a proper tune-up/diagnostics.

Thanks so much for all the help.  I'm not really sure what did the
trick, but I suspect it was "chopper"'s suggested loose head temp
sensor.

We'll see when they get here tomorrow...or I have to go and get them.

Thanks again. I'm sure the Busma will be returned to us all.
