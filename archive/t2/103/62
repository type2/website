While the Bus hitch is relatively new, I've been carrying a Vanagon version
of it for several years, so the solutions customers have used on them would
apply to the Bus one as well. While there is no off-the-shelf receiver
adapter available that I have found, several customers have reported having
local welders weld a receiver to the vertical plate for around $50-$70, with
good results.  Also, there is a Land Rover dealer that sells a "tow jaw and
pin assembly" for $39 that can be used to make the hitch accept U.S. style
tow balls (thus allowing you to use sizes other than the 2" ball that's
included). That item can be found at
