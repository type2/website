'Fraid I need more info for a diagnosis. The popping could well be
exhaust, probably is, but the loss of power probably is separate.
*Usually* in a VW, loss of power is ignition related.  If it loses power
and you let it cool and the power does not come back, then expect that
your points have slipped.  Reset the dwell and timing and you should be
fine.  If you check the dwell and timing and they are OK, then the problem
may be a dying coil/condensor.  This is almost certainly the problem if
you have plenty of power when the bus is cold, but it starts dying on you
after you drive it 5 minutes or so.

If you get the iginition working perfectly and still have no power, then
the problem my be more serious.  Check the compression in all four
cylinders.  Check the fuel pressure. Check the cylinder head temp sender
near #3.  The list of things it *could* be is long, but as I said earlier,
I'd need more information and the results of some tests.  The place I
would start looking, tho, is the ignition system.

Yup!  That will cause that! :-)

Hold a rag over the exhaust.  Tight.  If you can't kill the engine that
way, then you have holes in the exhaust.  This alone will cause those
annoying popping noises.  Unburned gas in the exhaust meets outside air
at the leak and auto-ignites and you get a pop.  If this is all it is,
then it is (sort of) not too serious.  You won't damage your engine
running a leaky exhaust, but it is annoying and you won't pass any
inspection.

Check!  I have not seen an aftermarket exhaust that will accept a
catalytic converter, and you need that to be legal in CA. Unfortunately,
for the next two years (until the bus reaches 25 years) you will need a
stock system.  Replacement parts from VW for the original system are no
longer available (NLA), which is OK, because VW always wanted a king's
ransom for the bits.  The exhaust system on your bus was used on buses
made from 1976-1978. Your options include:

head for a Pick Your Part;
e-mail busted bus (I think it's sales(-at-)bustedvw.com);
e-mail Nikki Elko (shrike3(-at-)earthlink.net).

If you were not in CA, I'd advise installing a '72-75 exhaust, less pieces
and cheaper, but that system has no provision for a cat.
