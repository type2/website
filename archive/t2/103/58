Subject: bus trailer hitch "receiver" adapter?


I just got a new european trailer hitch for my 79 bus from Bus Depot 
yesterday (thanks Ron!) and I'm wondering if anyone has found/fabricated a 
"receiver" style adapter for it yet??

Any FLAPS adapters already out there that fit with some minor tweaking?

Any templates on the web yet for something I can build and then bolt up?

Ron, any customer feedback yet on successful conversions?

Thanks,
