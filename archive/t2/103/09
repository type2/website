Hi Volks,

I have a defective sender on my Westfakia, and I expect I'll be dropping
engine and pulling tank this coming Easter weekend.

Currently I keep track of my fuel needs with a logbook. I use the log to
track gas mileage and I date each fill-up, oil change, valve adjustment and
detail major maintenance items. I've also added some diary entries for
significant trips and events, so it makes for a better read. I usually
target 200 miles per tank, but I start hunting for stations at 150 unless
I'm close to home. I always fill the tank very full.

I have swapped a tank without removing the engine, but I had to pull the
carbs and lower the rear hanger about an inch to get clearance across the
top of the engine. At the time the carbs needed to come off to be cleaned
anyway. I can't imagine that you could swap a sender unit without pulling
the tank or cutting a hole, there just isn't room. Disassembling FI just to
avoid an engine drop wouldn't be worth it.

While the engine is out, I'm going to repaint the engine compartment and
replace the tranny fluid, and get rubber gaskets onto the heater flex pipes
to replace the missing asbestos parts.... There is usually something to do
back there you've put off if you think about it.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
