Initially I did the same, except I used one of those little plastic mileage 
indicators with the moveable dials so you can set it to any mileage.  Got 
it at Poop Boys for a few dollars.  You could also do what I did later - 
install a Vanagon speedo and use the trip meter.  :-)  I can almost 
guarantee you that your sender is bad as my symptoms were identical to 
yours.  I've heard that it's possible to swap out the sender with the tank 
in place, without cutting through the floor!  If you're a contortionist 
maybe?  Not tried it though.  I removed my tank while the engine was out 
for a rebuild (and even then it was a dirty, PITA job).

I've put as much as 15.2 gallons in without running out, but I fill it 
until the fuel level is 2" below the cap.  I have to put the last 2 gallons 
or so in very slowly.

I think that's a great idea!
