thing can possibly come out without dropping the big window. But none of the
manuals say ANYTHING about dropping the window.  In point of fact they all
seem to say that one can remove the vent wing and frame WITHOUT touching the
main window.  That approach sure has not worked for me.

 I always remove the vent windows by dropping the main window. I did it this
way long before I got a Bentley.
So just for kicks, I looked in my 68-79 Bentley for info on removing the vent
window. Section 1 page 15, bottom right corner. It is a little vague but the
NOTE at the bottom is telling you that. But #3 makes it sound like they want
you to unbolt just the channel. I have never gotten the glass to drop far
enough that way. I leave the channel bolts alone and just remove the 2 at the
bottom of the glass.
After removing the door panel, it only takes about 3 minutes to pull a vent
window: Remove 2 bolts and drop window, pull down upper channel [watch for
loose clips], remove phillips screw at top, remove 10mm headed bolt at bottom,
slide vent out, lift vent out.
