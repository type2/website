No, actually it is 30 years. When they 1st tried to get the rolling exemption
passed, it failed at 25 years. They re-wrote it to have a 5 year moratorium on
73's which made it 30 years, and then it was passed. Starting in 2003, 1974
will be exempt. The 78 will have to wait til 2007......
But the tree-huggers are fighting the rolling exemption and want it stopped.
We will have to wait and see what comes of this.
