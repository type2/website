Subject: Putting a 71 T2 engine into a 73 van

I picked up a 73 panel van that needs an engine. For the time being and just 
being able to move it around, Im looking at putting an engine from a 71 bus 
into it. What clutch package should I use and how does one mount the engine 
in the front. Do you use the hanger from the 71 or 73? Or, do you have to 
make one? Email  me off list if you would prefer not to clog up the list.
