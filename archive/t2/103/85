 Hi I looked at the Pic & was wondering why won't it
also fit on later vanagons? I have an 81 & wonder if
it will work on my rear hatch.
Also do you have any pics of the rack with bicks
mounted on the rack?
Mike

I just received a shipment of Italian bike racks for
the 
Bay Window Buses.

These have not been available for many years, but I
had 
them special ordered 
and at a great price.
