Subject: Re: [T2] How to polish exterior trim?

Paul/List:

i have had positive results with 'Eagle One' Aluminum & Chrome Polish.  i
used nothing but an old, soft t-shirt to apply & remove the polish. this
stuff returned the mirror-like sheen to my 10" VW emblem on the nose of my
bus.

as for the heavy oxidation areas, i don't think there is much that can be
done other than replacing those sections. FWIW, i did purchase some
individual pieces of the beltline chrome from bustedbus.com for a reasonable
price. they were in great condition considering they were used.

HTH.
