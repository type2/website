Subject: fuel sender

to replace the fuel sender if you don't want to
pull the engine etc etc.

Go to a marine supply store and get a hatch kit.
the round ones have an insert that you can install in
a hole in your deck. the insert is threaded to accept
a hatch that is also threaded. the removeable hatch
has an O ring seal. The insert comes with a cardboard
template
for sizing the hole to cut in the bus's deck and
locates the hole locations for the machine screws.
As the deck is not flat like a boat's bulkhead you
will
need to seal the interface with calking or the type
of sticky putty that comes in a roll.

  This installation is flush to your bus's deck and
will not impact the decks functionality. If done with
some care it looks good.

You have approx 3 1/2" or better clearance between
the top of your tank and the deck so take care when
cuttin or drilling the deck that you go no further
past
the deck surface then you have to.

  I would remove the ground strap while changing out
your fuel sender. I also ran a fan to keep the air
moving through the bus while I did this. (the fan was
outside the back hatch not in the bus)..
  Gas fumes are tricky!
  The next time this level sender goes bad on you it's
easy to change the thing.
