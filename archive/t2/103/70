Subject: What's The Trick?

Hiya All,

The Duck goes in for a coat of paint on Monday.  So, this weekend I'm pulling 
out the windows and a bunch of other stuff.  Mostly this strip-down process 
has gone pretty well.  But I'm having a heckuva time with the front (on the 
passenger and driver doors) vent windows.  I've followed Bentley to the tee.  
The last step calls for one to pull the frame back toward the doorlock, tilt 
the frame to the inside of the vehicle and pull the frame up and away from 
the door being careful not to scratch the paint.  And that is EXACTLY what 
I've done but the vent frame will not come out of the door.  It will come 
quite a ways out (the adjusting frame on the bottom is all the way out), but 
not all the way.
Any ideas?

Mike
