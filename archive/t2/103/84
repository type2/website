Subject: Please Help, trouble with #2's spark plug angle

Hi,

I am having a rough time finding the right angle to install my spark 
plug in the #2 cylinder of my Type 2 Westy (type 4 engine I think).

Can anyone look at thiers and get back to me via email or advise if 
they know?

Had a whole day out there at -15C, lost my screw for the points 
below the adjuster for the distributor, so I had to take the distributor
out to remove the plate which took a 1/2 drive cheater bar to get off 
in this cold, then I lost the spark plug in the housing for the #2 spark
plug, two hours of fishing around for it with a flex magnet got that 
out.

So, I am very very tired.

PLEASE SOMEONE HELP ME, BY SIMPLY LOOKING AT YOUR 
OWN 1978 WESTY AND ADVISE ME OF THE ANGLE OF THAT 
PLUG!

Ohhh my aching frostbitten fingers.

Can't find it in the shop manual, hayes or muir.

With at least emotional warmth, your brother in VW's
