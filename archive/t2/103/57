Subject: VW curtain kit from Z

Hi,

I am considering  buying a curtain kit from 
http://www.zproducts.com/vw-curtainkit.cfm?cid=771 . Has anyone 
purchased curtains from these folk that would like to comment on the 
quality of the product? Does anyone know of an alternate source for 
pre-maid curtains to fit a bay window bus other than that listed 
above?

Thanks
