Subject: Re:metal in oil screen (was re failing bearings)

To CG et al:
I also have found thin nonmagnetic (aluminum?) flakes in the oilscreen
(thousands of miles ago)-but then it's got 233,000 miles on it!
By loose on the journal, do you mean it was spinning against the
backside(rodside)?  Also, if it's the rodbearing, why would the thin
material in the oilscreen appear to be aluminum, not bronze?  Can anyone
comment on the chemistry of finding out what's in the screen?
