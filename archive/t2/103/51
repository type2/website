Subject: Need 1600 piston/cylinder advice.

I'm in the process of breaking down and inspecting the 1600 engine that came
in my 71 bus. I've never had is running yet as I have never known the
condition of the engine.
 
It's a MX replacement engine and so far everything looks real good except. .
.
 
In one cylinder some H20 got in there and there is a very small area where
etching has occurred in the cylinder wall. The only ring that rides over
this area is the top most ring. The area is only about 2mm wide by 2cm long
but deep enough to be easily felt with your fingers. The rest of the piston
wall looks great with no signs of wear. In fact you can still the honing
marks in the cylinder wall. There is no evidence of blow-by but the etching
may have occurred since the engine was last run.
 
Only this one cylinder is so affected.
 
My questions are. . .
 
- Should I be concerned about this?
- If so, can a single cylinder be purchased without getting and entire set?
Where?
 
Any and all advice is appreciated.
