Subject: Ohio Bus Event May 2002

Hey All,
I haven't plugged our "Second Annual VW Buses 'n Boats Bash" event here in a while, and since it IS Friday and all:  The event is the Second Annual VW Buses 'n Boats Bash.  Date are May 17-20, 2002 just north of Cincinnati Ohio at Morgans Riverside Campground and Canoe Livery.  Highlights of the weekend include: Camping, an 8 mile canoe trip on the Nationally Designated Scenic Little Miami River, and LIVE MUSIC in the campground on Saturday night.  Oh yeah, and thanks to Snoopy, I now have the "secret" ingredients for the World Famous Full Moon Bus Club Breakfast buritos, so we'll be taking a stab at those on Saturday morning.  You can see all details at the event web site  http://www.geocities.com/buses_n_boats
or email me directly with any questions. 
Peace to All, and Have a great Weekend!
John Baker
