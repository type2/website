Hi Mike, Meredith, Volks;

This past fall I made a new set of front curtains for my bus; I had velcro
on the set before these but for this set I used rare earth magnets. You can
either sew them into pockets in the fabric or just use a glue gun.

They're available at hobby shops or Lee Valley hardware.

They stick like mad, and they leave no trace of their presence when not in
use.

Happy trails,
