Timing light essential
Fuel pressure before FI touble shoot.
The fuel pump relay runs off the ignition side of the starter so I would
look there first .
You have spark but Maybe you dont have fuel.
Put your hand on the pump while someone else turns stater , you should feel
it runing.
Good luck
Brian
