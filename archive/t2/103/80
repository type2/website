Bryan,

Don't want to take advantage of you tho... In my opinion, $150 is fair
(OK, maybe low, but the low end of fair :-) for a complete FI w/o fuel
pump.  You *should* be able to get at least $100 for the fuel pump
separately.  I really don't need the pump (I need the wiring harness, AFM,
air dist. box, runners to the heads, fuel rails and injectors).
