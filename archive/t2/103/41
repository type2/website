Subject: Michelin MX availability?

Hi guys,
Today someone slashed the left rear tire on my '79 Bus.  This Bus has
Michelin MX 185R14 tires which are basically in new condition, they don't
have a lot of miles on them.

I'd like to get a new MX to match but I'm not sure if they're still
available.  Tire Rack doesn't seem to have them, though they do have a
Michelin Agilis in that size.  I'm kind of iffy on mixing tread patterns.
Does anyone know if the MX is still available from Michelin?  If so, perhaps
I can have a local tire shop order it.
