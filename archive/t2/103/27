Subject: How to polish exterior trim?


I popped all the trim off my 69 Transporter the other day, figured to polish it up as best as I
could (it's in decent condition).  I've been using regular FLAPS metal polish on it applied with a
paper towel, plus the occasional rub with super fine steel wool, which does help a little to remove
oxidation bumps and marks, but I can't see that this method will ever give me the nice shine i'm
looking for...

Anybody have any tips?  I want to be able to see myself...

Thanks!
