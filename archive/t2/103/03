Do you lift the front of the bus?  The rear lifted that high means the
angle of the trans is quite different from that of the rolling engine,
so you could have interference with clutch release and the trans-shaft. 
If alone, it's hard to move the engine down as you insert!  On an early
bus, you can let down the trans so it's parallel to the ground when
pulling/inserting engine.
