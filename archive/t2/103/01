Re valve cover replacing:
   I noticed that the Heater box fatness in the T4 engine makes for more
difficult sliding of the cover wire- it's easy to displace the cover
while trying to pry up the wire.  Some gaskets seem thicker than others
and don't allow much of a seating lip depth.  You have to "feel" when
the cover is seated around the head, and then hold it there while
lifting the wire.  I use a piece of a wooden wedge cut from a 2x4
inserted into the gap above the cover and then use a long lever under
the wire to push it up.  Grease the center track of the wire, it really
helps.  As I recall, in my 71 I used a brake adjustor tool to pry up the
wire and a small claw hammer to pull it down.
