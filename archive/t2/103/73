Hey Chris

You might remember Debbie and I bought a sewing machine and material for
less than any source on the net and made our own, and I know YOU CAN DO IT
TOO!!!!

I had some original curtain rods for Hoss, but if I had to do it again,
instead of having the curtains on the track, I would do what I'm going to do
on my back curtain so it covers better and is fast and easy to remove for
driving.

0--------0     Grommets
[             ]      Curtains

A very crude drawing but it is the same concept of hanging padding in an
Elevator, eye grommets on the end of you cloth, and small post on both sides
of your widow.

This way you can hang it up in a seconds and remove it for better viewing
out the back or to LET THE SUN SHINE IN, come on every one, LET HE SUN SHINE
IN....ok....in the side windows!

This also keeps you from having to sew a pocket for the rod on you curtains!

If you have any other thoughts let me know!

See Ya!

Meredith
