Subject: Montreal Trip

Hello list,
    I am going to be in Montreal for a couple of weeks for my new job.
Unfortunately I will not be in my bus, I am flying in. Any locals that can
give me some info on must sees, eats, etc pmail me. If time permits, I would
like to meet some VW folks up there.

Thanks,
Jim
