....."I bought a sewing machine and material for
less than any source on the net and made our own, and I know YOU CAN DO IT
TOO!!!!".....

   Just about a year ago I made new curtains for our '71 and made it even a
little
easier with no sewing involved.  There is a product, made for use on
fabrics,  that looks like tape but really is glue.  At the edge of the
curtain you fold over
material, lay a length of this tape between the layers and then iron the
fabric.
The heat from the iron melts the glue and holds the pieces together.  I used
that
technique at each edge and to make the pockets for the curtain rods.  While
it's
not as strong as sewing, you don't have to waste time and materials learning
to use a sewing machine.
