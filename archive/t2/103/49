Well.....you are in for a long hard job. That is, if you mean the 1" wide trim
around the middle.
It is not polished aluminum. It is bright dip finish with a clear coat over
it.
1st you need to strip the clear coat off.
Then you need to rub off the bright dip.
Then you need to polish the bare aluminum.
Then you need to spray a clear coat on it to protect it.

What is bright dip, you ask?  This site tells about it:
