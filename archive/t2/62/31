Subject: Re: Drones and Disposable engines

Harking back to the thread on type4 engines in
military drones.
About 10 years ago, i went to a military tech
conference. They has several drone models. The U.S.
Nave and Army had sophisticated ones and the Israelis
had a cruder model that had been extensively tested in
combat conditions.

They all had small lawn mower-sized engines, built by
U.S. companies. A developer of one of the U.S. models
said one of the things they were trying to perfect was
a cheap, light engine that would perform well--but
wear out in a few hours. The reason: some of the
drones were meant to be throw-aways, because they
would follow enemy surface-to-air missile radar down
and destroy it--kamakazi. Even the survaillence drones
weren't expected to have a long life expectancy even
if they did make it back to base a couple times. Most
of the data the drones collected would be transmitted
back in "real time."

Hmmm, a cheap, one-year disposable engine (like
contact lenses and Kleenex) is an interesting concept
for buses. Some of you folks seem to pull yours at
least that often. ;-)
