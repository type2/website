Clark, Stan,

I don't understand.  I took the tour, which is very appropriate and
informative for troubleshooting fuel injection.  I also read Stan's post
on adjusting the idle mix via the AFM on fuel injection and on how to
break an engine in, once it is running.

Paulo's post, tho, starts:

> Today i've finally putted the engine of my 1969 bus....

I had always been told that buses thru 1971 had type 1 engines in them and
that buses thru '74 had carbs. I know my '67 has a carb on a type 1
engine.  I know the '68 and '71 I have fixed for Pat Flynn had carbs on
type 1 engines, I know Barry's '72 has dual carbs on a type 4 engine, and
I know Nikki's 73 has dual carbs on a type 4 engine, but I guess Paolo's
'69 has the fuel injection.  As usual, I have screwed up again.  Oh, well.
