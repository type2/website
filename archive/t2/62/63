Subject: Alcohol and Driving

It's not what it sounds like! Just a hypothetical question for the list:

Would it be possible to convert an air-cooled VW engine to run on 100%
ethanol? If it is possible, what would be involved? Would it work on carbs
or fuel injection, or both maybe? Change valve sizes, material,
lift/duartion, CR?  Hotter spark plugs? Anything else come to mind? Let's
assume that the supply of ethanol isn't a problem and that we're talking
about a small fleet, not a single vehicle.

I'm not looking for guaranteed info here, just educated guesses. This info
isn't for a real-world project, but rather a fictional one.

Thanks,
