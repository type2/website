Tim,

The implication of this sentence is that you have a carburetor on your
bus.  Do you?  If so, is it a single carb or a progressive carb mounted in
the center of the engine? With long (unheated) runners going out to the
heads?

If all this is true, then you are experiencing carburetor icing.  I live
over in northern Virginia and it was in the 50's here today, with high
humidity.  Perfect weather for carb icing.  There are two possible
solutions to your problem (three if you count moving to Arizona :).
Either head over to Peek Performance and buy the dual carbs that they have
for sale (used, as is), have them rebuilt and install them or head out to
a couple yards and try to scrounge the stock FI settup.

I fear that in our climate, that single carb is gonna ice as long as the
air temp is below 60 and the humidity is above ~50% (that would be... all
winter).  There may be a way to rig preheat on a Type 4 carb manifold, but
I don't know what it is.  Anyone?
