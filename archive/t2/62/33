In your original post you said you were all stock except for a Pertronix.  
Don't rule out the posibility that it is causing your problem.  I experienced a 
really wierd intermittent problem on my 73 (dying when cold) for a year and 
tried a LOT of different things to fix it.  I Finally removed the Pertronix and 
the problem is now gone.  Not saying this is your problem, but it is pretty 
easy (and cheap) to swap back in the points/condensor and check it out.
