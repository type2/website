Subject: Re: [T2] sub-cultures

I have actually taken this culture a step farther. i carry a few extra parts 
in my bus, like hubcaps and wiper arms and that kind of thing. sometimes 
i'll park by a bus and add on pieces that are missing, just to make up for 
the karma of people who are stealing pieces. what a nice surprise to have a 
"lost" hubcap find it's way home...
keep it real,
