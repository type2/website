Subject: Re: [T2] Plugging oil galley


I did the 2 behind the flywheel. I used 3/8" pipe thread plugs. They were
brass and used an allen/hex key to install. You will need a 3/8" pipe
thread tap, and the correct drill bit. Its a something 64ths. Ask when you
buy the tap, I also used some locktite. I chose pipe thread because it is
less likely to come undone. I also chose brass because it expands and
contracts at about the same rate as aluminum, or so I have been told. The
flaw could be that brass and aluminum don't exactly like each other too
much and I guess there could be a problem with electrolosis but this is not
a marine application so I don't think it will be a problem.
     In retrospect I don't know if I would do this on my next engine. I
have personally never heard of these plugs coming loose.  (ANYONE HERE?)
Also they were a lot thicker than I expected them to be. Also there are a
bunch more of these plugs all over the case and I dont see why they would
not be just as likely to fail. I would love to hear more about this subject
from experience not just theoretical speculation...

P.S. The possum that was removed from my house last week by animal control
reappeared last night...

Has anyone here put threaded plugs into the oil galleys on a T4 motor.
If so, what size plugs and how many?  I've got to pull the motor to
change some seals and would like to have the parts on hand first.

TIA,

Jim
