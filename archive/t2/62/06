Volks:

I pulled the generator pulley today and may have found the source of the
rumbling.  It seems the pulley is coming into contact with the face of
the generator before it will tighten up the belt.  That would explain
the scraping sound I've been hearing.

What part #'s fit the 38 amp generator?  Or is there supposed to be a
spacer or something in between the pulley and generator facing?

Thanks.
