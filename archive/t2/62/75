Subject: Re: [T2] Oil light flickers on new rebuild.

the pressure relief valve opens to bypass excessive pressure to the
crankcase, preventing your seals and oil cooler from blowing out.

they do NOT change the idle pressure at all, since it merely affects the
pressure at which oil is dumped back to the sump.

I have seen the oil pressure valve SEAT being mismachined (20% of NEW cases
have this problem), or worn on used cases, which a simple resurfacing
operation can repair better than new (you need to shim the spring by the
same amount as the material you removed BTW, to regain the spring tension).

We RENT and sell the tool, if you want to do this.
