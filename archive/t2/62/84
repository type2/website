> My new 71 Westy has an interesting quirk:  The transmission doesn't seem to completely disengage while in Neutral.  It is VERY subtle and I didn't notice it for about a week, but when the motor is running and it's in neutral if you let the clutch out it will very discretely try to inch forward. The ebrake holds it fine, and like I said it is not real noticeable, but definitely there.  So, does this sound like a linkage (coupling) problem or is the transmission possibly on its way out?  Please tell me its likely a linkage problem!!!

It's normal.  friction puts a little torque on the output shaft from the
rotating gears.
