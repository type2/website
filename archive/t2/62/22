first off a 73 engine would not be a 2liter engine but only 1.7 liter.  it
also would not be fuel injected but dual carbs.

it will fit however, sort of...would need a lot of parts from your
vanagon, not sure the carb accelerator linkage would fit...it would take
some cobbling to get things working, and then it would be even more
underpowered than it used to be.

also what kind of shape is the 73 engine in???  it could be a pile of
trouble waiting to drive you nuts too!!

now I used a 1.7 in my van as a "keep it running" while I rebuilt my 2
liter engine right.  but my bus is my only set of wheels.
