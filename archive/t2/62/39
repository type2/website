A Friend, Joe Burch at Corvair Corner had a Helicopter develeped as a
disposablr by Bell Helicopter with a Corvair Engine in it. We hovered it
on the training wheels in Texas Stadium parking lot a few times but we
were all afraid to cut it loose from the training wheels. "What goes up
must come down".
