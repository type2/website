Well, once you can get an engine to survive for an hour of operation, a
hundred hours isn't much more money or effort.  However, if you want to
have assurance that it will perform for 20 hours, you had better design
for at least 10 times that life.

Frankly, there are plenty of cheap off-the-shelf piston engines that will
do the job nicely, from Limbach aircraft engines (which look suspiciously
like a type IV) to type I conversions, to Briggs and Onan industrial
engines.  Yes, they have longer lives than specified, but why spend $$$
redesigning engines for less life?
