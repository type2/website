Subject: No Brake Lights - '78

Hello.

On the way to work this AM, I was informed by a kind motorist that my brake 
lights do not work.

When I got to the parking lot at my office, I saw that all the fuses are 
A-OK.

I checked Bart-no-tek and Ness-tek , archives, and type2 library.  No luck.

What are the possible causes of an immedialte loss of both brake lights.  
Fuses are good.

TIA
Barry
