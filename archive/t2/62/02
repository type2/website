Subject: Re: [T2] where is this oil coming from?

You going to have to clean than engine and everything around it (spray
engine cleaner works good).
Then you're going to have to lay down under it and what to see what
happens and where the oil is coming from.
#1, Check the oil sender.
#2. Check your valve covers.
Thats all I can advise you on the 1600......... I don't have one so I can
only direct you towards the simple things.
