Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Drones and Disposable engines

Our government considers HUM Vs as disposable at a cost of $70,000 each.
I've talked with national guard folks and they say that the HUM Vs are an
absolute itch to repair.
Roto Way (think that is it) sold a home built helicopter kit that used a
modified Johnson Outboard engine and they also manufactured the
forerunner (1968) of the weed eater engines and offered Gasoline Skill
Saws, Gasoline Drills, Gasoline Rotary Hammers but they didn't sell well
because they were so nasty to operate. Not to mention they were
expensive.
You'd have to be pretty old (even older than me) to remember the brand
names on Military drone engines used in WW II, but most of them also
manufactured pumps, fans, mowers, tillers and other products for
consumers. Military tanks has auxiliary air cooled engines to run
heaters, ventilators and a few other accessories that they didn't want
clogging up the engine compartments. 
Some of the original GO Cart racers scored some of these surplus engines
and they were real screamers but represented a limited area of
competition at 20-60 cui displacement. That evolved as you know to
Homelite and other smaller more available engines.
Chinese made line trimmers (like Weed Eaters) are so cheap now that its
cheaper to throw them and buy a new one than to replace a carburetor.
Emission regulations (I've been told) are so rigid in Tokyo that engines
with over 60K on them are pulled, replaced and the 60K engines are
shipped over to the US.
Any of that make any sense?
