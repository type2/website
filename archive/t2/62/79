Subject: Re: [T2] torque wrench

I know Sears used to do this, and I would be very suprized if they stopped.
Might take a month or more. 

Think about a socket with a bar welded to it and a certain weight hanging
in the right proportion per foot to create your own calibration check. Or
my favorite. Clamp a bolt in a vice bolted to a sturdy bench. Put the
proper socket on the wrench. Get a scales to stand on. Put it directly
under the handle. Stand on it. Measure the length of the wrench from the
center of the swivel pin in the handle to the center of the bolt. Consider:
1 pound at one foot = 1 foot pound. 1 foot at two feet = 2 foot pounds.
With no weight on wrench check scale weight. Apply force to wrench 'till it
clicks and read scale at the click. Subtract from initial reading to note
force applied. Multply force applied X wrench length in feet = actual foot
pounds torque. Compare to wrench setting. Do this at several wrench
settings to get a feel for the wrench. 

If you don't use a calibrated scale, you still ain't calibrated, but much
more important is repeatability. You want every series of fasteners to have
matching torque every bit as much as being reasonably near spec. 

But if you know the wrench since new and it has not been abused, don't
worry about it, unless the ore it's steel was made of was dreadged up from
the Sea of China. If you have a better quality tool and use it properly and
are not mounting engines on an airliner then simple home calibration is all
you need.
