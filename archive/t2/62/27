Ok I am ready to put the new motor and tranny together. The inside of the
bell housing is filthy.
1. I am gonna clean it with WD40 and paper towels. Next I plan to replace
the throw out bearing with my new one.

2. Should I pack the flanges of the new throw out bearing with grease ??? I
also wonder how much grease I should put on the splines of the tranny shaft
??? Just a little, right ????

3. Is there any sequence I should think about with regard to the clutch
slave cylinder when I insert the unit (tranny & motor) into the van? I have
been unable to obtain a new rubber boot that goes on the slave cylinder so I
would like to put this (attaching the slave cyl) off till I can find a boot?

Thanks to anyone who responds in advance !!!
