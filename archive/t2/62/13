Subject: Re: [T2] Plugging oil galley

I've got more than just a pasing interest in this.
What would the process of taping the galleries be called so I can scan
the archives?
I've got a newly rebuilt TYPE IV engine on my bench and I'd like to make
this modification while its on the bench.
I was surprised that it wasn't mentioned in Tom Wilsons book or other
repair manuals I've got.
