I find that this happens only when it's cold (and tranny fluid is 
thick).  After the bus has been running awhile and is fully warmed up, 
there should not be any noticeable movement of the bus.  The friction left 
at this point should barely be enough to rotate the mass of the wheels (if 
the bus was off the ground, for instance) and certainly not enough to cause 
the bus to move forward on level ground.  If in doubt, I would first change 
the fluid in the tranny and make sure it's filled with the correct stuff - 
GL4 (right?) 75W90 gear oil, preferably synthetic, and if that doesn't 
solve the problem then think about clutch/pilot bearing problems.  If it's 
the pilot bearing, there may be some squeaking and/or binding and/or 
vibration associated with the forward movement so be on the lookout.
