Subject: vacuum leak fixed/future head bolt issue

hanks for everyone's input on my vacuum leak a week or two ago. It has been 
fixed and here is what happened. Turns out it was at the intake manifold 
above #2 (1600dp, 71 westy). Right at the boot. Luckily enough, turns out 
the clamp was just coming apart and the manifold was actually seperating! It 
sounded as if it was running on 3 cylinders. So with another clamp (from 
another manifold), one that would tighten, Julie sounds great now. I was all 
ready to have to drop the engine and try to fix all that. I still have never 
dropped an engine myself - looking forward to it when necessary. So put that 
in the list of possible diagnostic issues - check the clamps on the manifold 
boots and save some time!
On another note, I will drop the engine in the next 6 months or so in order 
to fix a problem that has gone on a long time. My head bolts are always 
loose upon valve adjustment and one day I'll have to tighten them. Is it 
just a matter of unscrewing them, putting loc-tite on, and screwing them 
back in? What is the proper distance to screw them in? Someone mentioned 
case-savers which I don't really know about - do I need them?
