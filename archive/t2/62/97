Subject: Re: [T2] torque wrench


Last Sears Torque wrench I bought was way back when they were fully
guaranteed, when I was a DIYer. I started the shop with it. I was putting
175 lbs on a fastener when it went cachunk (200lb max wrench). This was 6
or 7 years ago. I take it to Sears. They say no way. I said guaranteed for
life. They said no way.

Weeks later, I do a favor for a client, got to talking and I told him the
wrench story. He says, "Gimme that wrench and let me talk to Sears." He
takes it in, gets me a new wrench. I guess he just pissed and moaned better
than me. Sears is now like Harbor Freight, et al. Most of the tools are
junk. But if your very selective, a few of the tools are good quality. 

I'm still using the Sears wrench, but next time it breaks, I'll replace it
with an S-K or Snap-On.
