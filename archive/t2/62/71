David:
Brazilian Vw's are sometimes made to run on 100% ethanol.
BTW, this is different than methanol, which is what race cars use. Ethanol is
grain alcohol.
I'm sure there are engine modifications needed to optimize the ethanol. Jet
changes and timing at least. Maybe compression ratio.
Find the VW do Brasil site and get the specs.
