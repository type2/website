Subject: Info needed

I am new to this list and I'm glad I found it.

I own a 1982 vanagon that has lost it's engine. I need to know if a 1973
camper/bus westfalia 2.0L engine will fit my vanagon. . I can get the engine
for $500 and it has been recently rebuilt.

My husband is a truck driver and has no time to work on it so I am going to,
as I have been waiting 18 mos for him to get at it. I love my van and want
it running again.
