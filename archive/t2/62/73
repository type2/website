Subject: Re: [T2] Oil light flickers on new rebuild.

Thanks for all the replies. I got a lot!

Someone mentioned putting heavier springs into the oil pressure relief valve
and the oil pressure control valve.
I see no point in a heavier spring on the pressure relief valve as that
might starve the bearings.
A heavier spring in the control valve *might* keep the oil pressure up at
idle, but I am not clear on this. I am looking at the Bentley and still need
some help.

TIA,
