p.s. - hit & run UPDATE:  this past weekend, the owner of the pickup that
hit my bus was ARRESTED and CHARGED with hit & run.  however, on a bad note,
the police are working hard to determine if the perp actually HAS auto
insurance.  if he does, then i get my bus fixed.  if he doesn't, i'll have
to take him to small claims court.  i also suspect that if he does not have
auto insurance that additional charges will be brought against him.
