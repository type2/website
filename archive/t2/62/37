Subject: 85' Vanagon Westy For sale in MD

A good friend of mine who doesnt have e-mail access asked me to post this,
I have seen the van and can vouch for all of the following:

Clean inside and out, Tan w/Tan interior, Weekender(no sink or stove),
230,000 on original engine. Runs very well, no oil or coolant leaks,
doesn't burn oil or smoke. 123-137lbs. compression all around. Many spare
parts, has AC but is not hooked up. My friend is the second owner and can't
afford the van as he has too many cars already. PO took great care of this
van. Always had the phosphate free coolant and regular oil changes. Top is
in great shape. Call for more details.

$3,000

Call Pete Appell    410-279-0210
Van is in Edgewater, MD  (near Annapolis)
