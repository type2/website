Subject: generic cd in a bus question 

i think i remember a conversation i had when getting my cassette deck
together. i think i was told compact disc players needed to be parallel to
the floor for them to work properly. given the angle of the hole in the
dash, a cd player would never work in a bus.  do cd players work at that
angle?  - steve
