Gee, reminds me of the time I visited a friend with a steep paved
driveway- Took along the plastic ramps with the waffle bottom (kinder to
asphalt)-Tried to level the Westy by driving onto the ramps and one
slipped out (coated asphalt) and shot across the road!  We cut pieces of
old carpet with the carpet upside down under the ramps and that worked. 
Me, I'd jack up the rear wheel by the lower shock mount, then let it
down onto the tire lying flat under it.
