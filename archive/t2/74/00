Subject: bead breakers (that's bead...)

Gentlepersons-
                      Gotta thin the herd of spare wheels to a more managable
pile of just rims...I've got a few "spoons" for removing tires, but some
have been on for years and the bead is as stiff as the rim on some of
them. Anybody know of a site with plans for a DIY bead breaker (man-
ual). BTW, anybody interested in a few tube-type Dunlop Gold Seals ?-)
