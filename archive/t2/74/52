Subject: loose valve seat

To the list,
I have since pulled my heads (that were rebuilt 4000 miles ago)on my '73 Bus
(1.7l) and discovered that the intake valve on #1 cylinder dropped its seat,
jammed the valve open and gouged the top of my piston.
	Questions:
		1. Why the intake and not the exhaust seat? Is this common?
		2. The seat really trashed the pocket it sits in. Is this fixable/worth
fixing?
		3. My piston has a gouge were the valve hit it. Should I be concerened
about the
               connecting rod and/or the crank? Can I check without
splitting the case?
		4. If the head is trash, what are my options? Can I replace the one head
or do I
               need to do it in pairs? Are their different kinds of 1.7
heads?

Thanks for any input,
