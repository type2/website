Subject: Xmas spirit late

I was given a nice part and am finally getting around to posting my free item.  Had to find
something worthwhile for someone.

FREE elephant ear driver's side mirror.  Never Used. Fits 67 earlier buses.   Don't know how
much earlier though.  First pmail that is willing to pay postage gets it.

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
