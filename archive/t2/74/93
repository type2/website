Hello,
 Welcome to the list and to the world of bus ownership. The reason you see
allot about repairing them is because busses are 23-34 years old. you cant
own an old vehicle and not work on it.
If you maintain your bus well, on schedule ,using quality parts, and
repairing it correctly you will get years and miles of enjoyment.  I
frequently drove 3000 miles between oil changes with no problems.
Buy a Bentley manual, This is very important. The list is here for questions
as well.

congrats and good luck
