Yep, yep, and yep.  I cut the valve stem off.

but consider:  the bottle jack was used when I got it in the '60's; the 
hydraulic fluid was zippo - gone - da nada and I filled it back up with 30 
weight motor oil (no hydraulic jack fluid in the cupboard).  The tire was/is 
super dry rotted with the tread peeling off like chunks of shoe leather.  My 
oldest, most dry rottenest tire, and THAT'S saying a lot!!  And the rim was 
the most rusty one I had.

I figure the tire was age-welded to the bead.  Perhaps a pliable rubber tire 
might have come off.

Heck, it was just an experiment that I tried, after I tried to break a bead 
by running over the tire/wheel; putting a heavy board on the tire (just at 
the bead) and driving over the board; by jacking the tire/wheel with the 
weight of the VW bus over it.

Gotta love it ! !
