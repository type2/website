I respond:  Yep.  I tried this with a 3 ton bottle jack, between two 
young_close_growing trees.  Did not work.  The bottle jack gave up, and the 
trees bent.

I ask:  Does anyone have a 6-8 ton bottle jack and two strong trees I can 
borrow??  Hopefully, local; I could not afford the USPS costs.

I add:  TGIF
