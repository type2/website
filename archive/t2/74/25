Subject: SOLEX carbs  in a '72 camper

OK, I have some time on my hands here at work (is it obvious??) and I 
started looking at a manual entitled 'SOLEX - Selection and Tuning of the 
Carburetor'

Wow, neat pictures!!

Question:  what SOLEX carburetor comes standard on the '72 bus/camper, and 
what years VW bus can this be found on??  (Sorry, still at work, and the '72 
is rusting quietly at home.)

Oh, yes, if you (me, that is) take one apart, is it easy to put back 
together??  I have two extra carburetors from a '70, one intact and one with 
the choke thing taken apart.  If these are the same as on the '72, I would 
plan to clean them up and replace the ones I have on the '72.

Hey, guys and gals, it IS friday!! Loosen up.

BTW, I saw a '68 in a mechanics back yard that has an extended/longer rear 
view mirror.  It is screwed onto the overhead vice twisted in (completely 
stock).  If you have an early camper and cannot see out the rear window 
because your rear has dropped with age (or are sitting tall in the saddle 
because you are 6'4"), this mirror will let you see out the back.

I used a similar one on my '78, and it worked beautifully.  I don't know 
what it would cost, but if it is excellent condition, I would go back for it 
for someone who could use it.  I have ENOUGH junk in the house. The wife's 
philosophy is 'if you haven't worn the clothes in the past 20 years, get rid 
of it; if you are not going to use the VW part in the next 5 years, get rid 
of it!!'

(((  But honey, I'm going to get back down to 165 lbs, so can wear that 
cowboy vest with the fringes and spangles; and I do need to get that third 
set of tires, just in case . . . .  ))
