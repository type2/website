Hmmm... that's interesting because I (and others) have posted this info 
many times before.

In a nutshell, the 6-rib trans (091) and bellhousing are 1" longer than the 
3 and 5 rib (002) transaxles.  1/2" is in the bellhousing and 1/2" is in 
the trans itself.  If you use the earlier bellhousing with the 091 trans, 
you can squeeze it into an earlier bus by utilizing (completely, I might 
add) the built-in flexibility of the engine and tranny mounts.  Just 
barely.  But you'll have to use your '74 flywheel, clutch and starter with 
the '74 bellhousing.  And the top of your gearshift will be a bit further 
back.  If you want to use all of the later parts, well... has anyone 
actually done that?  I don't see how it could work without serious 
modifications.
