Subject: Re: [T2] back up blues

The switch is on the nosecone of the trans.
Go to the coil on the fan housing.Look on the positive side for a black wire.
Follow it to the left [drivers side] and you will find an in-line fuse holder
laying in a clip. That is the fuse for the back-up lights.

Don't forget its a automatic gearbox and right hand drive. I will play hunt 
the fuse tomorrow . Thanks for your help.Mel
