i think i remember a conversation i had when getting my cassette deck
together. i think i was told compact disc players needed to be parallel
to the floor for them to work properly.

Stevo,
Mine is at the same angle as the dash, plays great, skips sometimes,
but its more due to the stiff front end than the angle.  I think there
is issue if it's vertical.
