even more of a concern is that you want to put this in an auto tranny
bus.  there are significant differences between the buses, it can and has

the auto tranny body does not have anything for the clutch, the shift mech
is different. even the accelerator linkages are different.  also I believe
there are slight differences in the tranny mount.
