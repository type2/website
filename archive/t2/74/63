Subject: Re: [T2] flywheel seal

I wanted to clarify somethings as i read my post. The seal is listed as
an O-ring for flywheel (021 105 279) not seal. Installed as I put it in
it was resting against the washers (which I'm sure caused the bind,
thanks steve) The problem is what is actually supposed to go in that
little groove on the inside of the flywheel? the o-ring i was sent
looked a lot like graphite (same color) and was not like rubber,
flattened out then stayed that way.
