Maybe you could set up some little flare (flame) system whereby those gasoline
vapors would just burn at the rear of the bus. Sorta like they have those flare
flames at oil refineries? Get some good heat out of it in the winter time?
Just kidding of course. Just fix the damn hoses and make it work right. Don't
you think if it could have been made simpler VW would have made it so at the
factory and saved themselves the $20 times 300,000 per year? That $600,000 would
have made a nice Christmas bonus for a couple of bean counters!

hoses.
