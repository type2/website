I think exhaust is more common, but the damage is pretty much the same

probably would cost more than a decent head.

see if the rod, piston move freely, if you didn't run it long it probably
is not damaged.  clean the top of the piston, clean up rough edges of
gouge if it is less than half the debth of the piston metal and there are
no cracks the piston is probably reusable

you can do one head.


now Doc Tim would insist on a complete rebuild and I would schedule a
major overhaul at some point, but you probably can easily get many
thousand miles out of a patch job.  heck I did the same thing to mine and
replaced just one piston and cly, and the head without even removing the
engine, then drove it for two more years 20k+ miles before getting it all
together for a complete rebuild

of course YMMV
