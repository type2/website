Subject: Charcoal Filter Necessary?

Hi Folks,

I'm in the process of getting my Bus ('79 Westy) back running now that the 
engine is finished, and I was wondering about the Activated Charcoal Filter. 
  As I recall, it was installed to reduce emissions from the gas tank, and 
may also have been involved in engine emissions as well.  I'd like to leave 
it off, as it takes up lots of space, adds several hoses to my very "hosey" 
engine (Cali-spec 2.0 FI), and all the old Buses seem to run fine without 
one.

My biggest concern is about fumes from the gas tank.  Ideally, the breather 
tubes go from the top of the tank, up to the intake vents, and down to the 
charcoal filter, where the fumes get drawn into the engine, burned, and 
exhausted.  If the charcoal filter is gone, those fumes will vent directly 
into the engine compartment, where they will get drawn into the heating 
system or build up to dangerous (combustible) levels.

I suppose I could just plug the tubes, but I'm concerned about giving the 
gas tank enough breathing.  Should I worry?  Can I leave the filter off and 
be okay?  Should I put it back on like VW had it?  Is it REALLY necessary 
for my engine?

Thanks for any help or suggestions.
