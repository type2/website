Subject: Fuel pump

Hi all

I'm replacing my fuel lines today and came up with this question.

(It's a 76 Bus, 2 liter fuel injection, with the dreaded two barrel carb.)
My electric fuel pump rattles like a can of spray paint, though I have never
had fuel delivery problems, nor does it leak.  It is sort of loud, and the
fix for that (when I had a radio) was to turn up the radio.

Is this something I should address now?  Can I leave it alone for a while?
Do I have to get a VW fuel pump to replace it, or can I get a "generic" one
of the same psi?  What is the psi?

Thanks for your help.
