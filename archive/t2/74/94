Hi Trudell,

Well, when nothing's wrong a lot of people don't have much to discuss on the
list, they just get out and drive. And when something is wrong, then people
tend to ask a lot of questions. That tends to skew the list towards making
things look a lot worse than they really are.

The best defense is a good offense. Listen to your bus carefully. Tend to it
regularly, and use quality components. Get the bentley,, *and* a Haynes
manual, and a Muir book (the compleat idiots guide...) too. The Haynes has
some procedures and pictures that the Bentley doesn't... For instance my
Haynes has much better images of the late baywindow brake drums, whereas the
Bentley's brake section only pictures the early bay. And while the Muir book
is less technically correct, the book makes excellent reading even when you
don't have a breakdown to tend to.

Reliability is a function of how well maintained the vehicle is divided by
how it is used plus the environment it is operated in. If maintenance is
managed proportionately with the workload and environmental impact the
vehicle is subjected to then your bus should keep hauling you for many happy
years to come.

Happy trails,
