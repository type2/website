If you go to http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~desileag/VWAction/clubs.swf
you will find the VW Action show 'Best Erection' club challenge page.
The idea is to build the 'best' totem pole/statue/sculpture with old panels,
nuts and bolts and cordless drills.

Most clubs tackle this when a few beers have been consumed and it is a good
laugh. I am sure if you email VW Action organisers at
desileag(-at-)globalnet.co.uk they could send you some pics.

VW Action is my favourite show. A look at the site will show you that it is
a little out of the ordinary. Fun is the order of the day and we always book
the Monday following off work to recover!!
