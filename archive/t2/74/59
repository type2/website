I would like to see a picture of this setup if
you wouldnt mind! 

------------------------------------------------
I headed down to the local exhaust shop with the
breather and 
carb 
(rubber gasket) in hand.  In ten minutes the guys were
able to cut to 
length 
and flare out the carb end to make a custom stack.
