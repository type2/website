you can pick up the sliding windows brand new in the uk as fitted to the 
Brazilian type 2 . They only fit vans that where originally fitted with 
windows ( not converted panel vans ) BTW as the drivers side area in my van 
is rather scratched you can swap it with me !!            Right hand drive 
get it.                                            Seriously I remember 
reading some where you can polish out scratches with a fine polish has any 
body got any experience of this?
