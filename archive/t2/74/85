Subject: Bay Window...  uh, Window  -more

Sorry, I forgot to include that I'll also be looking for the side windows
very soon.  I have vent windows, and wish to have just solid glass.  I have
seen sliding windows in these locations before, but not just solid glass.
Is this going to be swap meet or junk yard stuff?  I don't know about anyone
else, but it is hard to find one useful part on the VW's in this area.
(Dallas, TX metro)

Thanks again!
