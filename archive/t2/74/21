Subject: Re: [VB] Whats this wire? (BN4 Heater)

Talking about BN-4s, I was thinking I should get one going and put it in a 
bus while I have some time.    Mine the fuel pump is dead (surprise).  What 
was that sources for buying modern fuel pumps for the eberspacher?  Was it 
from espar, the modern incarnation of eberspacher?

definately before installing the heater (if it is out) test it on a bench.   
I did this hooking ground to ground and positive to positive.  Two wires have 
to have electricity to start the heater.  one is always on, one you turn it 
on .   Then what happened is my blower motor blew, but it did not sucks gas 
out of the gas can.   er, I would have to look at the heater again to be more 
specific on which wire is what.   there is the wiring diagram on the web at 
one of those obsolete VW document sites

 OK folks,
 Got a Bn4 and I dont know what one wire is.  Coming off of the fuel pump 
there is a red wire that goes to a bolt on the bracket, at this braket the 
wire has a "y" and becomes 2 wires, one wire goesi nto the body of the 
heater, the other eone is hanging loos with no connectoer on the end.  WHERE 
DOES THIS WIRE GO???  Anticipating heat, John Baker
