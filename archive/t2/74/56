Adam,

The connections for the dual circuit warning light are as follows:

Terminal      Wire         From

K             Red          brake switches
15            Black        fuse block
31            Brown        ground

On '78/9 buses there is a fourth wire:

61            White/Green  Switch behind parking brake handle
