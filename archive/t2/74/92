Subject: NEEDED: Sliding Door Retainer Rear Bracket

I'm in need of a sliding door retainer rear bracket for a 71 bus (its =
mounted to the side of the bus and has the latch that holds the sliding =
door open, not the part on the door itself).  Would prefer a cheap used =
one but new is ok too.  Just needs to have good threaded holes for the =
sliding door track cover attachment and the inside screw mount.  Can be =
missing the rubber bumpers and the retainer catch.

Anyone got one? Thanks,

Hal Landvoigt
