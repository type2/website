Subject: Bead Breaker - Anyone ever done this?

One method for breaking beads on tires as used by my dad was to
1. LET ALL THE AIR OUT by removing the valve core
2. position the rim/tire just right in front of the front tire from a
vehicle still having all four wheels
The wheel must be flat on the ground and off to the side of the car
the wheel is positioned such that the outside edge of the driving tire
is just inside the apex of the wheel rim
3. SLOWLY drive the car onto the tire
4. If positioned correctly, the bead will pop loose and you'll be ready
to take it all apart.

Warning, if the tire on the ground is not positioned properly and you
drive too fast, it will snap up and hit the side of the car.
Sometimes on difficult tires, I stood on the outside of the tire and
added a little leverage.  It was just enough to keep it from rising.

Picture someone doing this for the first time, not having the correct
placement or speed down, Bubba standing on the outside of the worked on
tire, when it flips up launching Bubba up and over the car and into the
neighbors next door swiming pool.

Be careful
