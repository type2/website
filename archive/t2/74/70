Hiya Jason,

Your description of the function of the emissions (E-Can:  Emissions 
Canister) system is basically correct.  However there is one very important 
factor you overlooked.  This is NOT a passive system for trapping hydrocarbon 
vapors.  Rather, the system actively draws off vapors from the tank via the 
suction created by the cooling fan.  This is the reason for those hoses.  
Whenever I am asked why the car smells like raw gas I look at the E-Can 
system first.  In 99% of the cases it has been either removed or disabled.  
If you remove the E-Can and its hoses you are asking for long term problems.  

Consider that the evaporation point (temperature) for gasoline is very low.  
This accounts for the presence of hydrocarbon vapors in relatively low 
ambient temperatures.  But just wait for a warm day!  The vapors given off by 
your tank can rise to dangerously high levels.  Dangerous both in terms of 
health (hydrocarbons are a known carcinogen) and fire risk.  Now if you rig 
up some other way of eliminating these fumes from the passenger cabin (they 
will get there) or the engine compartment without the use of the E-Can you 
will be dumping a raw pollutant into the outside atmosphere.  

Are you sure you want to go this route simply for the sake of eliminating a 
couple of hoses?  And, for what it's worth, that E-Can should be replaced 
every 40,000 miles.  Replacements are still available via your local VW 
dealer.
