Subject: Whats this wire? (BN4 Heater)

OK folks,
Got a Bn4 and I dont know what one wire is.  Coming off of the fuel pump there is a red wire that goes to a bolt on the bracket, at this braket the wire has a "y" and becomes 2 wires, one wire goesi nto the body of the heater, the other eone is hanging loos with no connectoer on the end.  WHERE DOES THIS WIRE GO???  Anticipating heat, John Baker
