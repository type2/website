Yeah, I'm looking at the picture now and that's a good point.  I did
pull it off and replace my shifter and if I remember, the stop plate
only stops it side to side (x axis), not front back.  The slots in the
bracket allow you to move the whole thing back and forth.

I am going to assume here, so I could be wrong, but if you stay out of
the extreme front and back of the slotted holes on the bracket (to avoid
any wierd binding), you'll probably be good.  Then I guess it'd just be
how far forward or backward you want your shifter to sit comfortably
(and not hit the e-brake).
