sure.  your favorite bottle or scissor jack, a board, a pair of gloves and
goggles, and something heavy.  (the bus and stock jack will do in a pinch,
particularly if you dont care about damaging the sidewall of the tire.)

set the tire down, put the jack (and board, if you dont want to tear the
rubber) on the side of the tire as close to the bead as possible, and run
the jack up to your heavy object.

All warnings apply here of course!

Be sure to pull the valve stem core, of course.

If you get it right (it can be quirky, but it does work..) it will
compress the tire sideways, and eventually pop the bead.  Flip the tire
and do the other side.

later...david
