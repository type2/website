I guess what I should have said was it was originally a 2 liter  fuel
injected motor, but then some dumba$$ went and changed it to the 2 barrel
progressive, a generic one at that(no names or good part numbers, anyway).

The present fuel pump  is mounted just below the gas tank, is square, and
has no numbers on it, so I have no clue what the pressure is.  The carb
doesn't flood or anything, and Bentley says it should be 35psi.  That's a
bit much for a carb I would think.

I guess I'll just leave it for now, since it still runs.

Thanks you guys.
