Okay, I'm just finding out how hard it is to find a windshield for my '70.
Mine is okay, just one little chip, but I want to find one that does not
have that frosted edge thing going on...  I think it is ugly and very
distracting.  Anyone know where I can find such a piece of glass?

Many thanks as always!
