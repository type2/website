Subject: more loose valve seats

To the list:

I was just thinking... If I just dropped an intake seat on #1, what are the
chances that it will happen with another valve? Can this be checked? Could
the other seats be good for now but come loose in say another 500 miles?
Should I sell my VW and buy a small block Chevy?!?
