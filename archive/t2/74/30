just pull off the cap that holds the stickshift down, put a good amount
of grease in the ball joint and put it back together.  Be sure to get
the plate aligned correctly so you're stickshift has the correct throw
(look in the bentley, it's really easy).

It's smooth like butter on mine after I did this :)

...and yes, that rattle is extremely annoying!

later,
Mike
