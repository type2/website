Hi All,

These are the noises "Rattle,humm,grumble,growl" that
my shift linkage makes at various RPM ranges.  I was
wondering if any VW sages had such advice on repairing
this most annoying/maddening racket.  Of all the
issues this bus has, this one is the only one I can't
live with much longer :-)

Items that have been replaced: the tranny is a year
old (German Transaxle rebuild--too noisy), the shift
coupler is two years old, the bushings are about a
year and a half old and were replaced by a VW mechanic
when he installed the first transaxle (did I mention
German Transaxle kinda sucks in my experience), the
shifter and spring/plate are about nine months old. 
All parts are from Rocky Mountain.

Please help me quiet the old girl before I lose the
few remaining marbles I have :-)

Thanks!
