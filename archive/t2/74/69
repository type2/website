Subject: Re: [T2] flywheel seal

The o-ring you write about does belong in the little groove inside the lip on
the flywheel. Be sure to check the groove for
the old seal carefully. You should also have a seal pressed into the engine
case. Make sure you use a good seal for the
case as a cheap FLAPS one leaked terrible on me. You may want to take the
time to check your end play now. Do that before you install the seals. It's
not hard and if  your local to Mystic, CT you can borrow end play tool.
