Subject: My thought's on the CD player posts

  One thing I love about this list is that everyone is so willing to 
offer their ideas and opinions.  Here's my thoughts on the CD player and 
Bus audio in general: a Holy topic for me.  Unless you've already cut 
your dash, I recommend getting one of the nice vintagevibes type radio 
heads (they have RCA inputs for cd changers) and for a nominal fee, get 
a decent mp3 player.  I've seen the portables as cheap as 40 bucks, 
although for a bit more you can get a nicer one and stay under a hundred 
bucks.
 
  Now that we've come to the mp3 player, let me explain what I plan on 
doing.  The portables are meant to be used with headphones, however, 
with a rca to mini Y cable, you can connect it to your radio.  Now, 
where to put the thing?  I'm not sure about the later Buses, but 68-72 
have masonite gloveboxes.  So, make a hole on the radio side to fit your 
cable through, and you have music!  The best part is, unless you have 
the glove box open, u don't see it. You can disconnect the mp3 player 
easily to download different songs anytime you want.  And with 
Musicmatch, it's super easy to make mp3s from your cds.

  Hope that was a helpful suggestion.  

Happy Trails,
James :0)
