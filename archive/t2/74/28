Subject: Re: [T2] SOLEX carbs  in a '72 camper

I didn't keep the original dual solex carbs on my 72camper very long, but if
I remember right they were 34pict2 on the left and 34pict3 on the right and
are different from each other AND the carb on a 70 bus (which should be a
single carb stock). I have some pics if you need them.

Also last time I visited our friend Snoopy I fell in love with his panoramic
rearview mirrow from JC Whitney. They are about 17 bucks for the 17 inch
wide model and very cool. You can see out all the windows and see all the
passengers in your bus. I strongly reccomend it.

 I can take pics of the 68/69 rearview mirrow if anybody needs these.

Happy New Year!
