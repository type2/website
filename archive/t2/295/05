start by putting the parking brake on & take the bus out of gear.
disconnect the primary coil wire (one from coil to distributor cap).
Take a wrench & turn the alternator nut & see if the engine turns. it
should, if not something else is amiss. If you can turn it by hand you
can count on a good starter being able to turn it.
