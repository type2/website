Subject: Muir Starter Rely in the UK

OK

I've replaced Ashleys regulator (I know diagnosis by replacement is bad but
it was made of rust held together by 3 different colours of paint so I
think 25 quid well spent for a new Bosh one !), checked there is no short
draining the battery, cleaned and tightened the connections - he now starts
as well as he ever has done. 5 seconds or so of turning over followed by a
slightly grudging vroom. This still seems like an age on dark and wet
nights.

So time to fit one of those nice relay things as per the Muir book, BUT the
one in the drawing looks like it came from a model T Ford. I checked and
there aren't any around here. I do remember someone does a kit, or at least
a relay suitable fro the job. I think it can be ordered from Bus Depot. But
I'm in the UK so I think there might be a closer supplier if I know what to
ask for.

So, what do I ask for and does any UK listee know where I can get the parts
?

The wiring doesn't bother me, I just need to get a relay that will do the
job and be weatherproof in this rather exposed position. If it comes on a
kit with wires on and everything my cup would runeth over.

Thanks
