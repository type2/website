I asked them if they were going to do a bay version as well, they said they 
would have it a in a couple of weeks or so!  here's the email trail:

Since it's gone live, I've read on several forums how much people want a bay 
version. So, I will be modifying it in the next couples of weeks to include 
several 'Bay' option.

Thanks for your interest!
