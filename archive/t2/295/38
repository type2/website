Many thanks:  We are going to try a "universal" type of seal that is
carried
at a couple of stores here in Phoenix--I have used them before for rubber
on
my Fridolin,and the cost is around $1.50 a foot--Not a bad savings
!--Especially when my friend who needs the seal is low on cash--uj

If you can find any year vanagon in a wrecking yard the rear hatch seal
will work on your early bus.
It drags on the hinges as the door reaches full top but it seals good.
