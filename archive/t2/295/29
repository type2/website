Lucky You,
Orange county CA is the home to just a who's who of the VW aftermarket 
industry.
Gene Berg, Kymco, BFY, Fat Performance, and the list goes ON and ON and 
ON.  You could spend more than a day hitting them all.  I know from 
experience, since I hit a bunch of them with a bug-head friend who was over 
here from Singapore.  You'd a thought he died and went to heaven.
