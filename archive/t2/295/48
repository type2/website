Subject: Re: [T2] split conversion?

Friend of mine came across a free split window...In exactly that price
condition. No engine, no trans, etc. but stashed in a garage in Brooklyn
for many years so rust isn't so bad from the floor up, but underneath,
(including but not limited to the frame) quite the prey of the tin worm.
He asked me if I wanted it, but without the indoor space to keep it, I
passed. BUT ! He does and ridden and driven my loaf, he is seriously con-
sidering taking the body from the split and putting it on a 72-79 under-
carraige. Now he's a Navy trained welder with equipment...So I assume
he could do the actual work, but...Has anyone actually done this before?
Any sites with info? He's pretty serious...Ran an old Healey for years with
a Chevy engine and trans and a Ford nine inch rear so he aint scared of
the work.
