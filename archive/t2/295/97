Subject: RE: [VB] Vacuum Can Question

Tom, the following information was given by Gary Gibson and I checked it out
myself and found it to be true for almost all of the 205 distributors:

VAC can Wells RV1001, $17 part.  It drops in and fits perfectly.
This is a German made Bosch part.  It has the Bosch emblem stamped on
the can.  I was really pissed when the vacuum advance on this
distributor failed last year as it is a great distributor.  I did not
expect to find a replacement vacuum advance can at all, especially a not
a new one for less than $20!    Gary Gibson

I have a vacuum can that came off a 71 bus distributor. According to
www.oldvolkshome.com the can should be a 07 092.  How do I know if this is the
right vacuum can or not?  Are other vacuum cans interchangeable for a 71 bus
DP1600?

The only number on the can is 853 stamped on the vacuum arm.




Enjoy your day!
