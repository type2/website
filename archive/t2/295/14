This makes sence, but I'm not sure how useful it is, unless you have
the engine really nice & balanced so therefore you would want the
flywheel & clutch assy to be balanced as well.

Was the flywheel resurfaced? if so that might throw out any condition
that the set was balanced. Since it appears you are not sure if the
flywheel is balanced I don't know if I would worry about it. I would
be more worried about the condition of the wear surface on the
flywheel. Now would be a great time to have that resurfaced (if need
be).

No idea what these mean, but if the place & clutch are balanced I
really don't see how aligning it a particular way would make any
difference. The balancing we are talking about here is radial. As the
flywheel spins no portion is "pulling" more than the other & it can
rotate without having to overcome this constant acceleration of this
one heavy/light spot.

I don't think you would see much of an improvement, but it's your
time/money. If you would feel better then go ahead & do it. Better to
make sure than to have that hanging on the back of your mind. I
wouldn't worry about it, but then again I have welded up a cylinder
flange so I can drive my bus to work the next day :)

YES. This is very important. There are a few different ways to check
endplay. Search the web. I don't have the link handy but someone has
instructions on how to build a measuring device out of some metal & a
feeler gauge. Very simple & cheap. BTW, the tool in question is a
dial indicator. A very nice addition to your tool set. lots of useful
things you can do with it.

I think the person who painted my bus w/ a paint brush, could have at
least picked a better color....oh, wait. you mean about the flywheel,
sorry. :)
