Pull the starter out and bench test it.  Lay it down behind the bus.
Test your battery with an UNDER LOAD battery tester.  Battery good?
Okay.  Hook up jumper cables to the battery.  Connect the positive to
the spade connector which the starter wire from the ignition connects to.
Touch the negative clamp to the mount of the starter.  Does the gear
move out and spin?  If not, then the starter is inoperative--go back to
the FLAPS and scream.  If it does work fine on the "bench," check
the voltage at the starter wire from the ignition.  Low?  Then install
a hot start relay--explanation and instructions are in the Type2 Library.
If the starter wire voltage is up to snuff (and even if it isn't), remove and
clean all battery connections--at both ends of the battery cables.
Also remove and clean the ground strap between the transmission and
the frame.  I've found that a cordless Dremel(tm) with a wire brush
does an excellent job of cleaning electrical connections.

That should take care of it.
