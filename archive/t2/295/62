> CHILD'S COT FOR FRONT OF BUS - JUST $35
 -snip-
> Perry's page at http://www.john-perry.com/vw/cot.html if you don't know what
this is. A Westfalia camper has brackets screwed into the door jams that the
poles sit on.   If you don't have a Westfalia, you'll have to find some
brackets from a junked Westy or just fabricate something. The $35 price
includes the canvas (white) and the poles. The included poles are the style
used in '74-75, which means they are one-piece poles (they do not retract for
storage like the original '76-79 ones did) but will fit thru 1979.
> According to John's page, these poles are 1" shorter than the original
'69-73 poles, so to use them on those years you might have to fabricate a
spacer, or simply relocate your brackets slightly lower so they're in the same
location as on the later busses.  (Of course the canvas is the same in all
cases, only the poles differ.)

 A little error here:
74/75 are 1" LONGER than 68-73.
68-73 are 56 1/4"
74-75 are 57 1/4"
The brackets are lower on the A and B pillars on 74 to 79.
