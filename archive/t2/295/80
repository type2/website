In the dry, dirt roads in Nevada are usually either concrete-hard or
covered in flour-like dust.  Either is doable by a bus.  Make sure your
engine seals are good or you will have a dust-choked engine bay.  Some
savvy dust operators run a hose from the air cleaner intake up to the
intake scoop to make sure that cleaner air gets to the engine.

Add a bit of rain (it doesn't take much) and the surface turns into a
grease-like substance that is extremely slippary.  Add a bit more and you
get a quagmire.  In short, don't venture off the pavement in Nevada if it
has rained in the last week. You won't get far, and the locals will curse
you for months every time they bump over the hardened evidence of your
passage

Gravel roads can be murder on tires.  If you check vehicles of the locals
you will find at least two spare tires in each.  Follow their example!
