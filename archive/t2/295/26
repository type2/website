Subject: [T2] RE: Replacing bars in westy luggage rack

I think you could probably make replacements from 3/8" or 1/2" EMT
electrical conduit, the kind that Homeless Despot or any electrical supply
house carries.  Find something of suitable radius (like the edge of an old
cable reel, maybe?) to serve as a form to bend the conduit around to get the
right "bow", flatten and bend the ends and pop rivet into place on the
fiberglass housing, same as the originals.  Come to think of it, mine are
kinda rusted, too.  I painted them, but it's only a matter of time before
they'll go away for good, so I may try this myself.

Hi all,

When I bought our 71 westy the luggage rack bars had rusted away and are now
non-existent.  Do any of you have any idea's for replacments?  It would be
nice to use that area for trips.

Thanks!!
