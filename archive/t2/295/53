I the Porsche 911 world the thought of wrapping the headers was never a
consideration. A slightly different approach is taken to achieve similar
results:

It's basically a metal shield that mounts between the heatexchangers and the
valve covers/heads, reflecting some of the radiant heat. I'm sure something
similar could be cooked up for the Type-4 engine, if you so desired.
