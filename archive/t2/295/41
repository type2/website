Subject: couple new questions - alignment and tranny

thanks to those who directed me towards info on distributors (I forgot to
thank you earlier)

I have a couple new questions:

clutch/tranny:
I put a new clutch in with a new bowdoin tube... the new tube seemed a tiny
bit longer than the original but I bought it from a vw shop so put it on
anyway... it seems to work okay but sometimes the cable seems to bind: when
I push the clutch all the way in after some heavy driving (freeway stop and
go for example) the engine engages the tranny (usually only in 1st gear) and
I have to jerk the stick out to avoid killing the engine or kissing the car
in front of me... also, sometimes the clutch seems to release clost to the
floor sometimes it releases up high. I've tightened the wing nut twice and
both times this seemed to fix the problem... but it seems loose again... is
this a normal kinda thing? I also put a new cable in so I was thinking maybe
stretch and general working parts in together may require another
adjustment... also, the whole van shudders a bit (ya know, that jerky
forward motion) at very low RPM's in low gears... I've been told that could
be indidicative of loose mounting bolts but they are all good and tight...
I've also noticed the stick shifts around in third gear when I open and let
off the throttle - it never kicks out, just shifts back and forth... and
mostly in third gear - sometimes in second... any ideas?

alignment:
both back wheels are toed-out quite a bit... front wheels seem okay... I had
new tires put on about eight months ago... I have new shocks but haven't
done anything with them... besides shocks are just dampeners and not the
meat of suspension right?I was thinking of taking it in for a four-wheel
alignment but I'm short on cash and was wondering if there's anything I can
do

thanks!

Bill
