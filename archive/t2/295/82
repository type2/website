Subject: Re: [T2] How do Retractable Seatbelts Lock?

I acquired 2 rear seat Jetta shoulder belts for my 70 bus front. There were
2 ball bearing dohickeys that made the belts totally unworkable, so I had to
pull them out. I had to pop the plastic covers off to do this, but of course
I didn't go anywhere near the homicidal permanent springs.  Now, the belts
lock as soon as you pull on them quickly, but are free at all other times. I
guess the ball bearings were to sense moving off vertical or something,
because I could not get them to release the belts. They slid right out
though, and I could put them back in, if I could find the suckers.  The
belts appear to be safe without them, although I hate to second guess the VW
gods. Tom

As long as the seat belt retractable portion is 100% straight up and down,
