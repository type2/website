Pat,

Wups!...ok someone on the list knows what it is called and where to find 
it...I can't imagine how to dig it out of the archived posts though.

I think it was an ex-navy electrician on the list who used to use it in 
the navy(against sea-water/air corrosion).

You might have good luck at the home improvements centers(larger ones) 
with stuff that they put on regular electrical connectors.

Dielectric grease...Oh!! the stuff you put on your spark plug wire boots!

If that is what you are wanting, then the local flaps...it's ugly stuf 
tho!

Whoa!  I just went and looked at the site you mentioned....this is *NOT*
what I thought you wanted.  This stuff is like water and is used to 
*improve* the connection.  I have some of this that I paid better than 
gold prices for.  

Probably any of the electronics stores...fry's, jdr microdevices and some 
ofthe others...sorry, I have had mine for probably 6-7 years and don't 
remember where i got it...but it works good!

Shoot, call them up and ask them!


Cheers, dave
