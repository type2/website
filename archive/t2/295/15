Old Yellar has a problem, I think my Ignition switch
has given up, it started out by the swtich not
returning to the run position after starting. Shortly
after that it blew fuze #10, which cut off power to
the fuel gage, turn signals and dropped power to the
alternator(Glows with engine running) light and the
oil light. Replaced fuze every thing worked for a few
seconds then happened all over. Am I correct ? Phil
