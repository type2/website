Yes, I'm sure.  Technically you're right, 64-71 and 72-79 list different VW
part numbers. But despite this distinction in part number, the actual seals
are virtually identical.  In fact, many vendors (i.e. Just Kampers) don't
list the 193C at all, and just list the 193E for both applications.  I list
the 193C on the website just for the convenience of people who have found
that number on another site and do a part number search.
