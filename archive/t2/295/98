You are right....I did say "I can see an argument for not wrapping the 
headers near their point of attachment to the heads. The reasons are 
explained below. That same argument extrapolates to not wrapping the 
headers at all, or minimally and only out toward the point of attachment to 
the next exhaust element downstream."
..............I guess I thought it would be obvious to everyone. Well, the 
main worry is wrapping the headers might result in damage to the heads 
themselves.  I'll explain....the heads are made of aluminum alloy and it 
melts around 600 degrees Celsius. Header wrap keeps exhaust gas heat in the 
metal of the stainless steel header, in contact with that aluminum alloy by 
way of a copper gasket. If wrapping the header brings its temperature up 
(of the metal inside the wrap), it would tend to transmit some of that heat 
by conduction to the copper gaskets and hence to the metal of the aluminum 
alloy head, approaching and risking a meltdown of that structure. Race car 
builders mention that their headers only last for one race, and they tend 
to melt when they are wrapped. That is pretty hot.....about 1,500 degrees. 
I'm not sure how hot my wrapped VW headers will get, on an 8 hour run in 
the mountains during some summer trip, and I don't want to find out the 
hard way that they melted the head ports in the process of self 
destructing. The point is...it's experimental.

.........A secondary reason is that the header itself might warp and erode 
at those (as yet undetermined) high temperatures.

.........A tertiary reason is that the radiant heat from the unwrapped 
headers will tend to hasten the warmup phase of the engine after cold 
starts. That would tend to bring the engine to its most efficient operating 
temperature sooner, which I see as desirable.

That about covers it. Thanks for the question.


>Where did you get your wrap and how expensive was it?

.........I got it at a local stock car shop, near a major raceway that 
handles events like the NASCAR nationals, in Norwalk, Ohio. Don't remember 
exact price but it was expensive. All they do is sell parts and supplies to 
people who bring their cars to Norwalk, from all over the USA.
I still have about half the roll.

Wish I hadn't wrapped them.
