You don't need a 9-ft door unless you want to drive in with the top popped up.  :)  I had my garage built with 10' ceilings and two 9'x16' doors so I could drive my highroof bus in and raise it on jackstands.  There is plenty of room to do this and my bus is a good 12" taller than a Westy.

IMO, build the garage with 10' ceilings and 8' doors.  The 10' ceiling is nice for handling 8' lumber and should allow enough room to pop the top inside the garage if necessary.  8' doors are plenty tall for you to drive your Westy in and the garage door openers will not cost you an arm and a leg like they did me.  Genie offers an extension kit that will allow their standard garage door opener to open an 8' door, but for a 9' door you have to go with a much more expensive opener.  Mine cost $400 (ouch) but my bus could not fit underneath an 8' door so it was a necessity.
