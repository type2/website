Ron, are you sure about this part number?
On your 68+ listing, you list 68-79 as all being the same.
I believe 64 to 71 is the same, but 72-79 is different :

Rear Cargo Hatch Seal, Genuine VW !! 68-79 Bus
$89.95  211 829 193E

But if you go to 50-67 listing, then you show the correct part #:

Rear Cargo Hatch Seal, 64-71 Bus Genuine VW
$89.95  211 829 193C
