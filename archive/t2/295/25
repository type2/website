Subject: 73 Bus Question

I had this happen to me on my mostly 73.  It ended up being the electrical
portion of the ignition switch. It can replaced easily without removing the
steering wheel, contrary to Bentley.. I even got the part from Advance Auto.
All you need to do to replace the switch (from memory, so feel free to add in
your .02)  Remove the screws under the top steering wheel mount to the dash.
remove the small screw towards the back of the ignition cylinder and the
switch will pull out. Then just rewire and reassemble.  The replacement switch
has an extra wire for an accessory position that our bus does not use in the
US.  I just cut and taped off this wire.

Hope this helps..

Peace Brother,
