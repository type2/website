My Beetle had a nice pull switch that was OEM VW. I think it may have come 
from a Westy camper from the early 70's. In the Westy I believe it 
controlled the rear dome light? On my Beetle I used it for a switch to 
control an aux reverse light as my Beetle had none. Looked nice, worked 
nice. I was a newbie and making the OEM reverse lights work was beyond me. 
Simple system in retrospect.

If you find the part# would you pass it to me. I have to find the same 
critter.
