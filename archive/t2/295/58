Hello,

Just to add my worthless $0.02 worth, I live in
Wilmington NC and I have found a high concentration of
baywindow buses in Wrightsville Beach. I was fishing
at the bridge down there and counted at least 5 or 6
different busses regulary going in and out of the
area. For an area that is just a few miles long, that
is alot of buses. ANy how, have a great day!
