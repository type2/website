Subject: Exhaust header wrap reconsidered (long)

Earlier this year, when I rebuilt my 76 type4 engine, I wrapped both 
exhaust headers before buttoning up the engine and putting it back in the 
car. I reasoned that the radiant energy from the hot headers would add to 
the temperature of the oil, and I was interested in a cooler-running 
engine. Also, I reasoned that the heat would do more good in the heat 
exchangers, perhaps improving the functioning of the heating system. And 
being in a "do it now" mode, I just made it happen.   Well, it runs pretty 
well now, and nothing bad has happened yet that I can see. But, I haven't 
tested it on any long trips or for an extended period.

I can see an argument for not wrapping the headers near their point of 
attachment to the heads.
The reasons are explained below. That same argument extrapolates to not 
wrapping the headers at all, or minimally and only out toward the point of 
attachment to the next exhaust element downstream.

I have decided to remove the header wrap material, starting nearest the 
attachment at the head. Depending on how that goes, I'll extend that 
removal, perhaps taking it all off. Reports to follow.

I researched the header wrapping in the type 2 archives. Perhaps others 
might be interested:

water cooled engine race car experience and melting manifolds in race cars.

manifold itself being damaged. He isn't specific about how that damage 
might take place. He might have been talking about the port in the head.

On 3/18/01   GMBulley_at_aol_dot_com   wrapped his headers and advocates 
it, mentioning no ill effects. He had his bus for sale at the time.

16 Jan 2002 03:00:04  "George Lyle" <glyle_at_pon.type2_dot_com> indicated 
that wrapping headers will increase the rate of internal corrosion, and 
will raise the metal temperature toward that of the contained exhaust gases.

<soineydg_at_mail_dot_milwaukee.k12.wi_dot_us> supports the consensus of 
increased rate of header corrosion. He hasn't tried it.

mikeprather_at_att_dot_net   02 May 2002 03:07:21  asks about header wrap 
and expresses concern, but offers no experience.

The following more comprehensive argument seems to me to have a flaw in the 
basic physics explaining condensation. Water condenses on cold surfaces, 
and hot surfaces encourage evaporation:

.... Re: Exhaust Wrap Good Idea? This wrap(thermal barrier) works so well 
at keeping heat in, that when your engine is shut off the inside of the 
muffler/header/manifold(whatever is wrapped) stays hot for quit some time. 
During this time condensation rears it's ugly head and since it stays 
warmer longer more water is produced. In short any of the "thermal wrapped" 
exhaust pieces RUST from the inside out! At 11:29 AM 5/3/00 -0500, Sami

I'm sure there are people on the list that have experimented with header 
wrap in air cooled VW engines, and can be specific about the problems that 
resulted. Please post directly to me if you like, or to the list if you 
think this might interest anyone else. Either way, I'll summarize whatever 
comes back.

High oil temperature is something about which many people seem concerned, 
and wrapping the headers has been discussed in relation to lowering those 
oil temperatures.
