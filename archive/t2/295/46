Hi Chris,

This is a big job. It took me about 100 man/hrs of work to install a 
late-bay (74-79) top onto a 79 transporter body. It could be done by a 
professional welder/bodyshop in about half that time. Have a look at:

www.pottsfamily.ca/westfakia and check out the "Westfakia Creation 
Gallery".

The main issue is with the double bed, it makes the hole in the roof a 
LOT larger. And the roof gets heavier in the process as well.

But since my bus now sleeps 5, I'm certainly not going to talk you out 
of it.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
