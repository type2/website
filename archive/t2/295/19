Hiya VWStuff,

Pardon me for dispensing unwanted advice.  But I'm gonna do it anyway.  I'm 
sure that you can find some low prices for that seal.  But remember that low 
prices often go hand-in-hand with low quality.  And that rear cargo hatch 
seal is critical.  An ill fitting or low quality seal will allow carbon 
monoxide to enter the passenger cabin.  Need I go further?
Your best price for a good seal will most likely be found by doing a little 
talking to Ron Salmon.  There's too much to risk here just for the sake of 
the lowest price.
