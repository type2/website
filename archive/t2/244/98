Subject: Re: [T2] Old brake fluid

Thanks to everyone for the replies.

I checked through all my old receipts for repair history. I still have the
1978 red warranty & maintenance booklet from the original owner and it
appears the brake fluid was replaced at 30k miles (I'm up to 60k miles now).

As some of you know my bus has had a spotty running history since 1982 and
looking through the non-dealer receipts I can't find any mention of any
brake work. I replaced the original pads and rotors back in April so I think
the brake fluid is way beyond it's usefulness. It looks clear to me but I
bet looking at new fluid will prove otherwise.

I read the Bentley and the library article but some details were left out

How much DOT fluid do I need to buy to replace the whole system?

Is the Mighty-vac the easiest way to do it?  Can someone describe the steps
to me?
