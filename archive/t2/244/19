I couldnt agree more. I stated this once, but let me say that the bus sat 
for about 2 months without starting it, and when I tried it turned over like 
I hadnt been away from it. Thats saying alot when it's a 1776 with high 
compression.

I had even sat out in it some evenings using the lights and what not. Plus I 
have a clock which is a slow drain all the time.

Speaking of bus clocks, anyone know the correct way to adjust them? Mine has 
an adjustment that has a plus and minus on it. So do i adjust towards plus 
when losing time, or minus?

Mine was a junkyard find. I will tell you this: Just hooking a clock that 
had been sitting for 15+ years (yes this junkyard is like that you should 
see it, VW encased in the forest that grew around it, do you know of 
SWEDES?) , to a battery didnt make it go. I had to take it apart and start 
the mechanism while hooked to current, then install it.
