Subject: Re: [T2] 78-79 tranny

Now THIS makes sense!!! I have had people tell me about the higher gear
ratio of the later bus tranny's and how they are good for the highway, etc.
I just couldn't understand how they are going to give you more umph on those
hills. Talk about climbing hills...My old '65 could climb absolutely
anything in 2nd gear...But good thing no one was behind me and in a hurry.

 1. Correct. 78-79 are identical.
 2. Late bay  trannies are good for at LEAST 300000 miles, probably more
 like 500000.
 3. They are same for bus as for camper.
 4. There is no perfect answer to this question. 78-79 trannies have a
 higher final drive ratio, which is better for high speed on the flats
 but much worse on hills. On the way back from Everybus 2001, my 1.7L
 with 73 tranny was outrunning the 2L's with later trannies on the hills,
 because of its lower final ratio.
