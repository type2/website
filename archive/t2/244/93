=========================>
Richard you will get several replies from your post, I am sure.

I will jump ahead on one thought for you.
You are in Austin. It is pretty dry there, although you will have cool 
night into warm day swings during several time frames of the year.

That will promote condensation within enclosed areas which might be covered 
or enclosed without breather relief. That philosophy of thinking is an 
often used mandate for space heaters in motor enclosures, control boxes, etc.

For our bus brake fluid systems, this might not apply to such a degree.
Our brake fluid system is comprised of a small "open" volume to "contained 
fluid volume" ratio,
with little allowable room for moisture to form.

I am of the opinion that changing out the brake fluid is something to be 
done when you feel up to it every couple to three years, or so.

For you in Austin, I don't think it is necessary to schedule the job 
religiously and without tolerance for being able to put it off a bit in 
order to co-schedule when other bus works might be going on.

As for me, I worry about my brake fluid about as much as I worry about my 
transmission fluid.
I check it for level, and don't worry much beyond that.
If I do a brake job, I purge the system and put all new fluid in.
That is about my only self imposed rule on the matter.

BTW
Was it you that had some dog house tin and stuff for my increasing my 
cooling sizes in my '70?
If so, I am up for getting with you now that the temps are dropping.
What kind of beer do I drag over?
