Subject: Re: [T2] Old brake fluid

Brake fluid is hydroscopic.  THis means that it sucks the moisture right 
outta the air and adds it to the brake fluid.  Changing it removes the 
water. This becomes a problem in two ways. 1.) It tends to corrode the 
brake hardware. 2.) It lowers the boiling point of the brake fluid. 
I'll leave the first item to your imagination, the second tends to make 
for scary moments when descending a long grade.

$5.00 worth of brake fluid is cheap insurance.
