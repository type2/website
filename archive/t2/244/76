Subject: Battery tray replacement alternative

Granted it's not as good as a welded job, but what I did was chisel out the
old, rotten trays, leaving a small (maybe 3/4") lip, which I de-rusted
pretty well with wire brushes, rust killer and dirty looks.  Then I made a
cardboard template and had sheet metal plates made up at a welding class
(don't know the gage, but good stock, much heavier than what came out.  They
had it on hand.) and epoxied it back in.  The ledge gave a good seat for the
new plates, the fit was very snug (a good template + a little filing) and
the epoxy did the rest.   Paint it, bolt down a battery hold down tray after
painting and that's it.  Still looks good (a couple of years ago) and is
very solid.

No welding, just elbow grease.  If anyone wants a copy of the template,
pmail me and I'll copy it onto good stiff paper and mail it to you (sorry,
no CAD file available for this one).
