Howdy All!

I'm hoping y'all can help me out so I can drive the Westy at night.  =
Monday night I went out to drive her and my headlights wouldn't come on. =
 All of the front, side, and rear lights work, just no headlights.  When =
I activate the dimmer switch, the brights come on and I hear the relays =
clicking in the fuse box but the lights go back off when I release the =
dimmer switch.  Also, the windshield wipers don't work unless I hold the =
dimmer switch in at a certain spot.

What I have done so far:  I have checked the fuses and everything is =
good.  I have tried a different light switch (on the dash), dimmer =
switch, and wiper switch.  None of these did any good.  Does anyone have =
any other suggestions?  In case you didn't notice the title, my Westy is =
an 82 air-cooled. =20

I'm planning on going to BNNTA.  I should be there Saturday before noon. =
 If you want to check out my wierd problem, come over and say howdy.  My =
Westy is blue with the South African grill.  I'll be towing a red =
trailer with a Vespa.

Thanks in advance,
Erich Elmer
