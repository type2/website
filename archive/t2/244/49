This is incorrect. I suppose you mean to be referring to Bosch part numbers,
rather than VW part numbers. Many Mexican or Brazilian VW part numbers start
with the same numbers as German ones. And many have the _identical_ part
number, because many parts sold by VW/Gemany or VWoA are actually made in
Mexico or Brazil.

It would be a mistake to assume that just because a parts supplier uses the
VW part numbers, you are always going to get German, or even genuine VW
parts.  The only way to assure that is to buy your parts from the VW dealer
(and even then the parts will often be Mexican or Brazilian).  Aftermarket
suppliers, including myself and EVERYONE else who uses VW numbers, use them
for identification or reference, not because every part is necessarily made
by VW.  In many cases, the part is not even available from VW or from
Germany anymore, at any price. Most vendors are pretty up front about the
fact that not every part they sell is a German or a VW product.  My site,
for example, states right on the first page that "all references on this
site to "Volkswagen", "VW", or specific VW  models are for descriptive
purposes or applicational information only, and are not intended to imply
that the part is manufactured by Volkswagen unless specifically stated."

That said, I do try to ship the best quality part I can. In most cases I
ship parts from the OEM suppliers to Volkswagen (Bosch, Lobro,
Kolbenschmidt, Febi, Beru, etc.)  If I can't find a quality part here in the
U.S., I look for it abroad.  But there are still many cases where the OEM
part simply isn't available (or is so expensive that it is not a realistic
option), so I ship the best decent quality substitute I can get.

Are all of the parts comparable to what came on your VW when new?
Absolutely not.  In many cases, even the new "genuine VW" part (if available
at all) is noticably inferior to what they supplied 25 years ago (even if
still the best currently available).  And in other cases, a somewhat
inferior aftermarket product is simply all that can be had.  The harsh truth
is that when dealing with parts for old busses, parts unavailability,
backorders, and substitutions happen.  It's unavoidable.  And it simply
isn't possible to notify everyone every single time it happens, because it
happens so often these days.  On any given day there may be 20 different
parts that have to be backordered or substituted due to unavailability
problems.  On another day it might be a different 20 parts.  This is,
unfortunately, the nature of the business.

So it kind of comes down to an issue of trust. You have to trust the
supplier you are dealing with to be "in your corner," care about quality,
and not take backorders, substitutions, etc. lightly.  Did they really try
every available source before substituting or backordering, or did they just
try the easiest sources?  (And for that matter, what resources do they have
when it comes to finding your part? Do they just deal with one or two
wholesalers, or 20 or 30?  Do they import parts themselves, or just buy from
U.S. sources?) Are they concerned about quality, or just shipping the
cheapest thing they can find?  Are they bus enthusiasts themselves, or out
to make a quick buck?  My philosophy has always been that I won't sell
anything that I wouldn't put on my own bus. So if you get a part from me
that is less than OEM quality, you can generally rest assured that this is
because a better part simply was not available (at least at that time) for
anywhere near the same price, or I'd have sent it.  For example, I ship
genuine VW windshield seals, whereas everyone else ships aftermarket ones
for the same price (which wholesale for much less, and can be easily
obtained in the U.S. rather than having to be imported). But does this mean
you'll _never_ get an aftermarket windshield seal from the Bus Depot?  No.
On rare occasions, when the genuine seals are backordered at VW and simply
can't be had, I have no choice but to ship an aftermarket one for lack of
anything else to provide.  But the other 99% of the time, I'm shipping a
better seal for the same price, so in the end your odds are much better
dealing with me.

Of course, even though I'm tooting my own horn, I can't claim to be the only
parts vendor who thinks this way.  There are certainly other very reputable
and dedicated bus parts vendors out there.  They are the ones who in it for
the long haul, and will still be around busting their butts to find obscure
parts for your bus long after others have moved on to more lucrative
opportunities.  So choose your parts supplier carefully.  Because ultimately
your bus's health depends on both his ability and his desire to get you the
best parts he can, and at a fair price, not just today but in the future as
well.
