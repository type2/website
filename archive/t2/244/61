For the short term, I think the grommets are good but, as Bob says they do
allow liquid to remain and in the long term they might be a rust source.
If the paint around the hole is undisturbed (and it probably will be) a
little liquid buildup won't damage anything.

I think that VW put them there to limit the amount of air (and dust)
sucked into the engine bay.
