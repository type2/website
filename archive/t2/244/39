I have no idea about the part number, sorry. But I can help you
identifing the tranny.

First of all a 1970 tranny is the one that has only one end bolted to
the chassis of the bus. You must support the other end when you take the
engine out. If the tranny is a 1972-1979 type then it has two extra
boltopenings in the top at the side where the engine is attached.

Identifing the type:
Under the tranny there is a serial number stamped into the body of the
tranny. It is stamped on the edge on the drivers side of the tranny. The
number should read something like: CA 123 456. The letter says what type
of tranny it is. The CA is the most common one on 1968-1971 buses. There
are some other types, like original replacement trannies, or those with
mountain ratio, limited slip diferential and such. They have a different
letter.

Later trannies (1972-1979) have the manufacturing date stamped into them
(instead of a serial number). It reads as follows: CE 14 05 7. This
would be (14th of may 1977).

I hope this info helps. If you find another letter than 'CA' I can look
up the transmissiontype for you.
