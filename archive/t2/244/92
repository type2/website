Hi all!

As I was driving this morning in South Florida, near Miramar, on I-75, (g=
oing south, I believe), I passed this beautiful mid-seventies Tan Westy, =
with Florida plates...It was in superb shape!
It had a Hot VW's sticker on the passenger side window...I waved to him, =
and he waved back (startled, no doubt, by a white '02 Beetle driver wavin=
g)...I just wondered if it was anyone on this list.

As he pulled off to further his journey, and I drove east on the Palmetto=
, he waved again...Neat!
