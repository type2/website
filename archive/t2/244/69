Thanks to all...

I fixed in in 30 seconds. Popped open the distrib, as
per George's advice, to check the points. The rotor
had somehow spun itself up enough to come out of the
notch in the shaft. It was spinning erratically, of
course, making the bus run horribly. I'm amazed I got
it to safe haven at all.

I pushed the rotor back down and bus fired right up.
Add that to the list of "bus won't go" problems.

I haven't had the distributor open for weeks--since he
last tune up and I've never heard of that happening
before.

Just to be sure it won't happen again, i'm buying a
new rotor and cap.

I'm glad i checked the points first, otherwise I would
have been pumping gas and switching filters, etc.

tnx again.
