Please help,

   71 Dormi with type 1 engine. Been having trouble with dying at idle. Runs OK at power, (surges) but dyes at idle clutch in. Anyway started looking for vacuum leaks and found a bad line at the booster. Replaced but low and behold, pedal goes to the floor. Past post say master cylinder, does this sound right? Pedal goes to the floor and idiot light comes on with bus off and key on. I'm pretty sure this is the problem and my fuel tank crap is messing with the carb, but I guess I'm just looking for some reassurance.  Pretty frustarated about the whole brake thing. OK Mr Dolan I wont drive it.
