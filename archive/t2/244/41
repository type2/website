Uhm, my technical English is not that good that I know what a 'throwout
bearing sleeve' is. Is that what Bentley calls the "clutch release
bearing" (CRB) on page 17 of section 6? If you are then probably the
1971 tranny is pretty unique yes. I think the old CRB was only used
until 1970 (had to replace it once on my 1970 policevan, it was hard to
get). If I remember well the parts manual said "until chassisnr 2102 300
000" meaning 'until the end of modelyaer 1970".

Oh well, every modelyear of the T2 is quite unique, especially the first
6 years, you can tell them apart by only looking at the outside.
