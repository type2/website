stopped on the way back from the colorado bus club meeting last night 
to assist a broke down new camper. 00 or 01 didnt ask..  so  the new 
breaks down  as well as  the old.  where she was broke  down the 
nearest phone was miles away and she didnt have a clue how to guide a 
tow in to where she was as she  was not local...this  is the kind of  
thing AIRS is for.  got her started  back up and followed here to where 
she was trying to go.  when i  looked at  a  map she  was  actually 
less than a  mile from her destination in a straight  line, two by 
road. she will be seeing vw shop on warrentee issue today.  the starter 
has a bad spot.  I didnt even  know there were  houses in that area.
