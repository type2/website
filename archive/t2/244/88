Yes, this is up-to-date advice. Mercedes to this day recommends changing it
every two years, preferably in the spring.

Brake fluid is hygroscopic. This means it absorbs moisture. It pulls it right
out of the air! The water settles into the lowest point: the wheel cylinders.
This causes 2 problems. One is rust pits in the cylinder and the seals start
leaking. The other is worse, water boils at 212F. Dot 4+ [MB brake fluid]
boils at 500F. Using your brakes going down a mountain with water in the fluid
will cause NO brakes!
