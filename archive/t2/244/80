If Compufire doesn't make a points replacement unit for vacuum-advance =
Bosch dizzies, Pertronix does. My '79 has been running a Pertronix =
Ignitor in its stock vacuum/centrifugal-advance dizzy for 5+ years now, =
without problems.

I think that you have to specify that the Ignitor is to be used with =
vacuum-advance distributor or they'll sell you the version for the 009.

Simple points replacement electronic ignition modules really should sell =
for about $40 instead of $70 or so. As simple as they are, they can't be =
that expensive to manufacture. I'm glad to see a little competition from =
Magfire.

Compufire doesn't make a system for 80-83 Type IV engines.
My distributor ate one that the FLAPS said worked.
I told Compufire where to stick their unit when I returned it for
warranty .............. I quote:
"Can you see a garbage can from where you're sitting?, throw it in
there."
That is just as good as a Chinese or Taiwan Warranty
...................... Buyer Beware.
