Ok, we pulled the valve cover. With the rocker arms removed, it appears =
that the intake valve of number one is sticking out an extra 3/16 of an =
inch indicating that possibly the a valve seat has sunk into the head, =
and the intake valve is hanging open. Is this a likely cause for the =
problem?
