Sorry about the word wrap!!!!

Please help,

   71 Dormi with type 1 engine. Been having trouble 

with dying at idle. Runs OK at power, (surges) but

 dies at idle clutch in. Anyway started looking for 

vacuum leaks and found a bad line at the booster. 

Replaced but low and behold, pedal goes to the floor.

 Past post say master cylinder, does this sound right?

 Pedal goes to the floor and idiot light comes on with 

bus off and key on. I'm pretty sure this is the problem 

and my fuel tank crap is messing with the carb, but I

 guess I'm just looking for some reassurance.  Pretty 

frustarated about the whole brake thing. 
OK Mr Dolan I wont drive it.
