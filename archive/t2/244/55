Hey everyone,

I was just thinkin back to a 69 Van I used to have.
I don't have it anymore ...sadly.
The question i have is if anyone could tell me what was wrong with it =
before it left me.
This was back in 1992 when i wasn't into fixing things.
Anyway it would start good and when i would accelerate up to about =
40-50mph
the power would suddenly die. i would pull over and it would start again =
up to that speed
again and the power would die. i had no clues back then but it ended up =
at some minister
of some hippy churches farm.i sure miss that old girl.
is this something simple i could have fixed?i'm thinkin about trying to =
get her back now..
after all these years.slim chance but ya never know.

Darren
