Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS request

Regardless of whether the lady knew the bus had trouble when she left, how 
can anybody justify continuing a long trip in such a fashion once it is 
known that there is trouble?  Should anybody really expect other people to 
look out for them when they are taking measures like this?  This is why I 
don't much like the AIRS list.  I mean, if somebody with a decent VW with no 
known trouble breaks down, then sure, I'd like to help them once.  But 
having trouble hundreds of miles from the destination means you stop and get 
it fixed, and probably pay for it.  I can't get much charitable feeling for 
somebody who is driving on old clunker bus across the country when they 
could have bought a 92 Toyota for the same amount, I mean, come on, this 
life ain't Disney World!  Love your bus, but be realistic.  I'll save my 
charity for the starving people in the third world.  Of course I am glad she 
made it where she was going okay.  FC
