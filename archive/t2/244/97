Another method for bodywork has surfaced. I have no direct experience with 
it but I hear good things.

There are now epoxy type adhesives for bodywork. You GLUE in panels versus 
welding them in. Something to try with non-important things like battery 
trays and such. Not sure I would glue hinges to a door or rocker panels on 
a convertible though.... <grin!>
