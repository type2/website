I have seen it to where the little 'dogs' at the base of the distributor
come up off the distributor drive shaft as well.. same effect. This can be
due to the bracket that holds the dizzy in place not allowing it to sit deep
enough.
The VWs' pantheon of gods include Kokopele, the trickster. Pay attention to
the little things.. They are the ones that make you feel the silliest when
you finally catch on.
