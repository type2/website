German production VW numbers begin with "0", Brazilian begin with "9". 
That's how you know. That first no. is the code for the country supervising 
the manufacturing process, and is the indication of who's specifications 
are in play. To advertise for sale a German specification part, then send a 
non-German specification part is quite frankly, a step beyond deception. 
It's a flat out lie. In other words, fraud.

Anyone can rebuild a Bosch part anywhere they want with whatever procedures 
or specs or lack thereof they want. Many FLAPS will call these "Bosch 
Rebuilds". Bosch Corp. remanufactured electrical rotating parts sold in the 
USA are rebuilt in a Bosch Corp. facility in the USA under Bosch Corp. 
procedures and specifications. It's apples and oranges, folks.

As a Bosch Corporation Authorized Parts Specialist, I receive info every 
week or two from Bosch Corp. giving particulars about their manufacturing 
locations, procedures and quality control. Bosch Corp. does no rebuilding 
at all. Their process is remanufacturing. A Bosch Remanufactured part meets 
NEW specifications, and will last every bit as long as new. In fact, in 
those cases where they run short on cores, if you order a Remanufactured 
part you get what Bosch calls a NewMan part, which is in fact a brand new 
part at the remanufactured price in the unique Bosch Corp. ReMan packaging.
