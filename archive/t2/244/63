Greetings to the list. We have list member Giles Clement and his brother =

Anson at my home garage in Provo after they found my name on the AIRS=20
directory. The number one cylinder on their 78 bus shows no pressure on=20
a compression test, and a leak down test  shows no pressure in the=20
cylinder with the air intermittently coming out of both intake and=20
exhaust ports as the engine is jogged. Air continually leaked through=20
the crankcase. At 60 mph, there was some activity in the cylinder but=20
not much. This was tested by pulling the spark plug wire as the vehicle=20
was moving, and noticing a change in performance.

Our best guess would be that the piston has broken rings, but oil usage=20
is not excessive... half quart in a hundred miles.

Based upon this info, any suggestions as to how to proceed from here=20
would be appreciated. Ideas on what the problem is caused by would be=20
appreciated. Also, any ideas on how to patch the vehicle so that Giles=20
can make it home to New York would also be a help.

What other tests can we perform to further isolate the problem?

Thanks for any help.
