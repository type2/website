Just 2 months ago, I removed those rubber "nipples", if you will, from both 
rear trays of NewBus when I painted the trays.
Although having them in the drain holes kept NewBus more original,
the rubber grommet part of the nipple that secured them to the tray holes 
acted as a raised point that prevented all of the water from freely flowing 
out and off of the trays.

Just having plain open holes will actually allow for better pan draining, 
in my opinion.
