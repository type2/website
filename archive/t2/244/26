Oh wise list,

The tranny in my 1970 bus probably could use a good rebuild, but I'm not
sure it is original. The engine appears a rebuilt Super Beetle. The tranny
part number is 002-301-103A.

Can anyone tell me anything about this 3-rub tranny so I order the right
parts or rebuild?

Many thanks,

John Rogers
