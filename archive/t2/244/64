Richard,

Air out of the crankcase is the most important part....lots of air?
Leak down shows what percentage of loss?

Leak down/compression on other cylinders??


If so, then broken rings, holed piston maybe.  

1/2 quart in 100 miles is bad.  1/2 quart in 1,000 miles is good...di you 
miss a zero there?

What does the spark plug look like?....lots of info to be found 
there....oily???  Destroyed?


Cheers ,dave
