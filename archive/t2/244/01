The 79 engines use Vanagon Heads.
Your heads are deep port heads.
If your heads are good you can cut them to 94 mm and install them.
I tend to think that the motor mounts are somewhat different, I've got a
79 GE case and its definitely different on the motor mount than the
Vanagon engine but it might be the same for 75-79.
Check the parts at Bus Depot or Bus Boys and see if the mounts are the
same.
