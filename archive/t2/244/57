So why did VW put them there?  I think the idea was that the grommets would allow the water to wick out via capillary action; without them you have 
a hole through which more water and dirt can enter.  Not absolutely sure of that, but generally I try to replace the plugs when I can.  You can often 
find reasonably non-dried ones in junkyard cars.
