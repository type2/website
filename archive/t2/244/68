Richard,

I believe that would be the dreaded valve seat drop.

Never had it or saw it myself.

Who knows what is floating around in the chamber at this
point.  Make sure it is not a bent or broken push rod....unlikely
but possible.

My opinion would be that the engine/head *has* to come off.

Gonna be a long weekend unless you have someone handy in town that
would have another head *and* the piston/cylinder is not hurt.

Cheers ,dave

With the rocker arms removed, it appears that the 
intake valve of number one is sticking 
out an extra 3/16 of an inch indicating that possibly 
the a valve seat has sunk into the head, 
and the intake valve is hanging open. Is this a likely cause for the problem?
