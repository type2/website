Either your points aren't closing or they aren't opening or they are 
defective.  Turn engine 'til points are closed. Turn key on. Take a 
screwdriver and manually open the points. Spark? If yes, turn motor 'til 
points are open. Recheck gap. No spark? Check to ensure that the braided 
wire inside the distributor is intact.  If not, fix it.
