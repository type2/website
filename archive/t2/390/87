the usual tar mats from a FLAPS can be used or a product called "Noise
Killer"  by Rockford Fosgate- anyone ever hear of this or use it?  It is
a spray on product.
RockfordFosgate has a website, and a phone 800-366-2349 >>

www.partsexpress.com

has it for about ten bucks a 16 oz. can (one door)...How much is the
Rockford-Fosgate stuff ?
I'd also bet that 3-M probaly has it in their line too. R-F probably doesn't
make it but just has their label on someone's can...
