Subject: need help with wiring... 78 FI

Hi, I have pulled the engine and replaced it.  I thought I did a wonderful job
of marking everything, putting it in baggies, marking it... anyway. Motor in,
gas in, one wire melted....

So where do the wires go?  I am having a problem with the coil wires and the
wires that go to the oil sender unit.....

I have a Haynes and the diagram is microscopic....  I looked on the
library.... found the diagram...  but that doesn't work for me....

If anyone has a FI bus and would be will to tell me where the wires goes in
the engine compartment  I would be forever in your debt....

a little frustrated....  got the injector , coldstart, etc done,  having
problems with the single or double wires.....
