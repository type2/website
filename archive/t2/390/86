<< James,
After reading your posting, just for grins I did a search on electric
die grinder's--
There is a whole bunch for sale-Harbor Freight to mention one of the
purveyors. >>

I'm afraid I've worked with H-F equipment too often (some even mine-
mea culpa) to recommend almost anything that has a motor or is go-
ing to be in constant use...There's a reason the stuff's cheap and it
can't just be the exchange rates...'Sides, if it fails, who ya gonna call?
Sending it back - if there's a warranty - is time consuming and if out
of warranty, who's got parts? My buddy bought two 4 1/2  inch grind-
ers for less than my Milwaukee and burnt both out just trying to cut
up sheet metal...The tools didn't outlast the discs...YMMV but I really
doubt it...
