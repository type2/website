right I think it is marketing too, but it also probably more means that it
doesn't breakdown like conventional oils...

I was only relating my experience with Pennzoil Performax 5W-50 and Mobil1
15W50 nothing should be extrapolated from my single set of experiences.

now I did run a time temp test some years ago between a Sunoco premium
20-40 and Pennzoil Performax 5W50.  this was under essentially identical
weather conditions and about 150 miles including city, interstate and
rural roads and I found the temps were for all intents and purposes
identical.   maybe a hair lower for the synthetics but not statistically
significant.
