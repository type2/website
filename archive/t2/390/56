Subject: no spark

Hi!  I am so frustrated!!!   78 westy.  Had wiring problems after an install
of the engine. Thanks to the list I have replaced the faulty wiring (my fault
in the install).    Now I have no spark from the coil.

I have 12v on both sides of the coil.  I installed a new set of points and
gapped them at 16 thousand. (old ones looked fine still no spark, when turned
over.  I disconnected the condenser. still no spark when turned over.  I
disconnected the points inside the distributor and manually grounded the
terminal inside the distributor and SPARK!  Yea, that eliminates the coil,
correct?


So the problem is in the points/ distributor/ condenser right???  any
suggestions on what to do next?

thanks

dan
