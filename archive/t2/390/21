Subject: Re: [T2] what oil

John I understand your logic just fine, and indeed it appears to make sense,
but the fly in the ointment to me is the vast superiority of modern oils,
and the fact that technology marches on. The engine was designed in the mid
30's and since then multiviscosity oils have become the norm, and it gets
harder and harder to find a single weight oil. Based on the info I get all
the time from the maniacs on cal-look.com who regularly run 150HP plus
engines around the streets of SoCal, I run multi-viscosity synthetic. I also
run it in my highly abused XS1100 Yamaha murdercycle where it seems to allow
better shifting as the bike uses a common oil supply for the tranny and
engine. Just more food for thought.

I've gone back to using straight WD-30 for my Type I engine after previously
using Mobil 1 15-50.

I changed after thinking about the engineering of the engine, particularly
the pressure relief valve, which causes thick oil to bypass the oil cooler.
