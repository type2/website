Subject: Re: [T2] AFM adjustment of spring tension-how?

quoth Al Brase: (re how to adjustg the AFM spring, in response to a
query about adjusting the CO emissions when the airscrew in the AFM did
not reduce it far enough)-
 That's simple, tighter makes it leaner (more air volume for the same
 electrical signal).
Whoa- let's see if I get this-a given air volume (throttle opening
relative to gas pedal push) opens the flap in the afm against spring
tension....and the resistance read on the wiper arm by the "brain" tells
the injectors how much gas to give relative to the perceived air
volume.  So if the spring weakens over many years, it will let the flap
open FURTHER than normal, and the resistance is higher and the brain is
fooled into assuming you have a higher air flow than is reality- and
lets more gas through the injectors.  
     So the general richness observed in my still functioning 240,000
mile FI system (based on blackness in exhaust pipe) -suggests the spring
in the AFM is a bit pooped - how do you know how much to tighten the
spring- is there a table anywhere relating spring tension to ACTUAL
opening of the flap or the resistance it represents?  Like our lungs,
air is pulled through the AFM- How does this sound-can a variable shop
vac be hooked to the throttle side, and the resistance be measured
against a given volume/time .  I envision setting the seconds it takes
to fill a garbage bag of known dimensions in X time using the setting on
the vac control- ie, what is the resistance setting on a good AFM to
fill a 4 or 6 cubic foot bag in say, 20 seconds??   Another way wouold
be to measure the resistance of a good AFM in a vehicle at a given RPM,
or perhaps, a given exhaust volume in X time??  BTW, in NJ, they check
old cars with the engine at idle- and I thought the AFM Flap/resistance
circuit was uninvolved at idle, letting air bleed by...and a a high
reading is likely more due to leaks of fuel into the air post AFM??
