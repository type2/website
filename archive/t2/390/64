Subject: it runs (formerly no spark)

Well, after listening to Mr. Watson, I hotwired the bus and off it went,
choking and puking all the way...

Thanks for the help, I would still be scratching my head if it weren't for the
list!

Now all the follow up stuff, leaking valve cover gaskets, new ignition switch
or wiring....   But it runs!

YAHOO!
