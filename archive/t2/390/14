I removed the stock heat system many years ago and use an aux for all heat
but I removed the heater boxes and use a plain J pipe on my 78 2 liter and
have had no problems with the engine because of this.   be sure to leave
the two small pieces of tin above the push rod tubes between the cyl, and
you must block offf the two small ducts from the bottom of the fan housing 

only real hazzard I see is that your pushrod tubes are exposed so if you
drive off road a lot or on gravel roads you might want to make up some
sort of guard, also I disconnected the thermostat because I was not
confident it would still work as intended since it would then be exposed
to the air flow under the bus.

of course as always YMMV
