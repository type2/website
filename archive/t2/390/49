Subject: Re: [T2] AFM adjustment of spring tension-how?

Your post uses the word "resistance" in a way that it's not clear exactly
what you're talking about.  There's the (mechanical) resistance of the
spring to the opening of the air vane, and then there's the (electrical)
resistance of the strip inside the AFM to current flow, which resistance is
dependent on the position of the air vane and the corresponding point of
contact between the wiper arm and the track.  I don't know if the engine's
demand for more air - which implies more mechanical resistance as the spring
resists the opening of the air vane - translates directly into more
electrical resistance as the wiper arm moves.

But, Al's correct that, over time, the spring weakens, resulting in a
general "too rich" situation that can't be adjusted out using the regular
idle mixture control.  And no, the AFM flap/resistance circuit is *not*
uninvolved when the engine is idling.  The minute you start the engine the
air vane moves from its "resting" position to a position corresponding the
the engine's air demand, be this "idle" or "wide open throttle."

In this situation you need to tighten the spring to provide more mechanical
resistance to the swing of the air vane until the electrical resistance,
whatever that is, is "correct" for the arm's position.  The only way to do
this "in situ" is to monitor the exhaust as you change the position of the
spring (engine idling) until the exhaust CO is "correct."   This calls for
either an O2 sensor which you monitor or, better, an exhaust gas analyzer.
And, be warned, when you remove the plastic cover on the AFM to start
messing with the spring you typically introduce an air leak through the AFM
itself so it sometimes takes several trys (adjust with cover off, check with
cover on) until you get it right.
