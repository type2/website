Subject: Sound dampening body panels -a link

While browsing the satellite TV newsgroup, I came upon a discussion of
audio/component racks, and found this-for those putting in a stereo in
the van or wishing to dampen panel resonances....

-for a disc. on using tar sheets: 
http://tnt-audio.com/clinica/dampere.html
the usual tar mats from a FLAPS can be used or a product called "Noise
Killer"  by Rockford Fosgate- anyone ever hear of this or use it?  It is
a spray on product.
RockfordFosgate has a website, and a phone 800-366-2349
