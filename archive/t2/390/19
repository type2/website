Kevin  - CT currently has no inspection program at all as they are 
converting over to private garage inspections.  If your bus was last 
registered in CT, you don't even have to bring it to dmv to register 
it.  Just bring paperwork.  I just did this on my 60dc project, but 
since I bought it in new york, they needed to do a vin check.  I got it 
running, and got brake lights to work, drove it down to hamden dmv with 
rotted out heater boxes and a very loud exhaust, and in two minutes, 
the vin check was complete,  so I parked it, and walked inside.    
forty minutes and few dollars later, I was fully tagged and legal.  
I've heard by next fall, they'll have safety inspections fully running 
again.

I've also heard of running j-tubes, and I think jc whitney sells them 
for $15 a set (I may be going this route myself)

let me know how it works out
