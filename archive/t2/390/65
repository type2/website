It is incorrect because it is.  I mean exactly what I said at WOT in an L-jet system with the WOT switch the air vane position doesn't do jack.  The duration of the injection pulses at WOT is according to a FIXED constant, the position of the AFM doesn't matter one iota, injection is controlled under those circumstances as base injection (a function of engine rpm) and the preset WOT constant, with the other regular modifiers, engine temp etc.  And FWIW at WOT under load (about the only time you are at WOT) the AFM will most likely be wide open as well, excepting following instantaneous drastic reductions in load or perhaps if you were trying some flat out downhill WOT runs.

Sure it does my point is I don't know how much those movements on the bottom end matter or how much they are filtered out and injection duration is a function of rpm.  I don't know, I said I didn't know.

Yeah with late 1960's technology.  The L-jet system on air cooled T4's was optimized in the heady days when they thought stoichiometric would be OK for an air cooled car.  It wasn't, in a relative sense they tend to run lean, this is stated in a few Bosch books, billions of VW&P/Euro Car tech articles over the years, and I believe in the "How to tune your Bosch FI" manual as well.  It pays from a cooling perspective, a power perspective, and a longetivity perspective to have something slightly richer, particularly to garantee the the thing doesn't go lean somewhere in it's operating envelope where you didn't tune it which is entirely likely.  In a water cooled engine with infinite cooling capacity or on a system with O2 feedback, who cares, in a stressed to the cooling envelope 2.0 in a Vanagon, you'd better care.

YMMV
