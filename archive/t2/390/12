Subject: Fabricating an Exhaust System

Hello compadres-
       I have a 1975 Transporter that has a rusted out aftermarket exhaust
system and needs to be replaced - heat exchangers, muffler, etc....I'm low on
cash, and I heard that you might be able to do without the heat exchangers and
it would be fine to just run some sort of pipe between the exhaust manifold
and
the muffler, bypassing the heat exchanger. 
      
       Then I heard that it wasn't a good idea.  Has anyone ever done this? 
Is it possible?  Whats the cheapest way to get my exhaust system working (and
pass inspection)?  Does anyone have any heaterboxes laying around?

Thanks
