Subject: Re: [T2] Removing front turn signals

If the signals are riveted in, a drill will make short work of the rivets.
They can be screwed or riveted back in, no problemo.

Richard,

When I took mine off, they had phillips head screws holding them in.

You might look up under the inside panel and see if they are
embeded bolts with nuts on the back side.

Cheers, dave
