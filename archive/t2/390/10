well at least according to Mobil, the synthetics always flow at the lower
number and always lubricate at the higher number and do not change
apparent viscosity as temperatures change.

my experience with synthetics is that there is an ever so slight thinning
as the oil gets above 220degrees based on the combination of readings from
my oil preasure and temp guages
