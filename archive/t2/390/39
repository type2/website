Subject: it runs! but noisy!

First, thanks to those who sent the URL's for the vacuum hose diagrams. 
I got my 79 camper running today. (GE engine).  It fires right up but
sounds as if it has a head leak or an exhaust leak.  I'm the first to
say I don't know a lot about hydraulic lifters so I'm wondering if my
lifters may not be adjusted properly.  

I bled the lifters but noticed that some had leaked down before I got
the valves adjusted.  Those I turned in two turns.  The ones that had
not leaked down I turned in a half turn.  I lapped the cylinders to the
heads and upon list advice did not put the gaskets between the heads and
the cylinders.  Does anyone have any speculation as to where this noise
might be coming from?  I left the bottom tin pieces off so I can get to
the bolts from the heat exchangers to the heads and they're all tight. 
Right now, it won't idle by itself yet so I can't get back to the engine
to track down the noise.  Any thoughts?  TIA, Greg
