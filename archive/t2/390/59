Subject: no spark more information

I went down and manually opened the points while the distributor is in the car
= spark.  I had my wife turn it over and = no spark....  I just tried it
again, if I open the points with a screwdriver = spark.

what do you think?  I am at a loss.  Sorry to be a pest on the list, but I
need some help, this one has me stumped.

Only thing I can figure is that the starter is hooked up wrong and there is
not enough juice to cause the spark....  I am stretching here...  I did have a
concern about where one of the wires that goes though the tin toward the
starter went.  The bus has a starter with an attached solenoid and then it has
what appears to be a second solenoid mounted on the tin.  What is that?
Currently the wire in a sheath from the FI/ motor harness is attached to the
starter solenoid.

thanks
