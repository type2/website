Subject: GL4, GL5 a new twist

Hello Volks

I already check the archives but I could not find the answer to the following
question.
I asked a friend of mine who owns a lubricant shop,for severals years
now,about the discusion of the GL4 and GL5 in VW trannys due to the bronze
synchors, and he told me that a solution could be to use monograde 50 motor
oil in the gearbox instead of the transmission oil that does not meet the GL4
specs, he also said that the 50 weith in motor oils is equivalent to the 90 in
transmissions oil, this was the solution that the people who own Mack trucks
in my country take and now they are running deisel motor oil in their
transmissions too, I also remember that my minicooper also use the same oil
for the engine an the tranny.
Anyone thogths about that ?
