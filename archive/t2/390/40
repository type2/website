I understand your working on rear shocks?  Unless the 72 is different than the
73-74, then the Lower shock bolt should pull out of the mount as soon as the nut
is off.
Is the nut against the shock,, or is the head of the bolt?  

If it has seized in the lower bracket... heat should work, but I would try
Liquid wrench first. 
If you decide to hammer on it... leave the nut on as long as you can,,so the end
doesn't mushroom,,, 
Will the bolt spin at all?
