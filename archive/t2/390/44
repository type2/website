Subject: L43 grey black

I need to do a little paint repair on the metal part of the dash that is
closest to the window. This is the piece I'm talking about:

I did a color test and the paint is not black; it's slightly grey or
charcoal in color

Does anyone know if L43 Grey Black is what was used to paint this part?
