Subject: RE: [T2] Battery/Alternator voltage

Probably it means that your meter or your VR is slightly off. Probably not a
big deal...maybe try another meter.

I've read that the battery should read 12.6V when the engine is off and
13.5-14.5V when the alternator is charging it. What does it mean when it
reads as high as 15V while charging?
