It probably means that your regulator is hyperactive.  But I'd 
double-check the reading with a different voltmeter to make sure 
it's really that high.  Do you have the stock mechanical regulator 
or a newer electronic one?

>I've read that the battery should read 12.6V when the engine is 
off and 13.5-14.5V when the alternator is charging it. What does 
it mean when it reads as high as 15V while charging?
