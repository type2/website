Subject: wire ?

I am in the process of installing a 2.0l in our 72 bus but in the wire 
harness for the engine compartment there are three wires in question. The harness 
splits and heads towards the left of the engine comp. and the heavy black goes 
to the coil as I can see in bentley + or - side doesnt say but where that wire 
exits the harness there is a heavy brown wire, a small blue wire and a small 
white wire with a green stripe where are these suppose to go or what for. 
thanks for any help. Dylan
