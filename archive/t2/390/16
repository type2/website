I think that Mobil is using  a little marketing magic here.  If the
viscosity did not change, the viscosity would not be the conventional
numbers that they are using.  It would be something weird like 30W20
indicating a flat viscosity/ temperature curve.

The viscosimeter doesn't lie, and if the synthetic oil has a viscosity
index of, say, 10W50, it would have to have a viscosity/temperature curve
similar to a petroleum oil of the same index (Castrol used to make a
petroleum 10W50, IIRC).  Outside of the cold and hot test
temperatures, the curves may differ, but we try not to run our engines in
those conditions if we can avoid it.
