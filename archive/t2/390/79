Subject: die grinder

I have done a lot of welding on my 73 Westfalia and now have a lot of 
grinding to do, much of it in tight spots where my angle grinder won`t reach 
or would gouge more of the surrounding metal than the weld itself.  I have 
an air die grinder and other great air tools, but at the moment, I have no 
electrical outlet for running my compressor.  Also, my 6hp (probably an 
overrated hp) compressor has a hard time keeping up with the constant 
grinding I have had to do.  I am basically looking for an electric die 
grinder if something like that exists.  I have a Dremel, but it is pretty 
small and would probably burn out if subjected to the miles of lumpy weld 
beads that I would use it on.  Has anyone out there heard of an electric die 
ginder?  Something like an air die grinder only electric.  Any help is 
always appreciated.  Thanks, James.
