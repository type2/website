Subject: Broke down in Weed

I just got a call from Eric Eckles.  He was heading down Hwy 5 near the 
town of Weed in Northern California and spun the splines in one of his 
rear drums.  He is currently at the rest stop across the Hwy from the 
Weed airport.
If anybody is near him and has a drum for a 68-70 bus he would sure 
appreciate it.  He can be reached on his cell at 360 421-9298
