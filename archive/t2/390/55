Well, since I said the *air vane* moves according to engine demand,
including WOT, I can't see how the statement can be declared "incorrect."
Are you saying that when the throttle is fully open the air vane *doesn't*
move from its position of "something less than wide open throttle?"

Read any of the manuals concerning these systems and they all specify the
procedure for adjusting idle mixture, and the correct parameters.  The idle
mixture was "factory set" in that the adjustment screw was hidden by a
tamper-proof plug, undoubtedly designed to keep shade-tree hammer mechanics
from fiddling with something they knew nothing about.  Having adjusted the
idle mixture with the top of the AFM off I know that the air van moves in
response to these adjustments.

Why do you say that?  The whole system is trying to keep the air/fuel ratio
right at the point that *all* the fuel delivered can be burned in the
available air.
