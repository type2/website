Subject: Lower shock bolt 72 bus

Hi Folks,

Got my new shocks today.  Had no trouble removing the top bolt but can
not remove the bottom one.  That is to say, I removed the nut off the
bolt but can not get the bolt to come out.  Is this bolt threaded
through the shock mount or can I just put some heat on it and give it a
few taps?

Craig
