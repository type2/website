Hi,

Look at the coil and figure out which side is negative (-) and plug 
the condenser wire (to dizzy) into that side. I cannot think of 
anything else that goes on that side.  The wire (usually black) from 
the front of the bus goes to the positive side of the coil. I am not 
sure what color wire goes to the oil pressure switch but if you look 
under the dash and see what color wire goes to the oil light then 
that is it. That is all I can tell you from memory.

Chris
