Pretty cool, but before I get my hack-saw out
I'll wait to see what other volks do for a more
permanent mounting configuration.  Also it=20
seems that it would make more sense to cut the
apron on the seam (if that's even possible.)

I take it that, in UK speak, dynamo =3D generator?

What's a quid?
