Living in Niagara Falls, I get checked every time i go over.  It's not 
random selection, it's obvious prejudice towards my van, because they 
don't stop me in my plymouth...  Anyway, i've learned some things about 
customs officials.  The westy spare tire compartment baffles them.  They 
know it opens, but they can't figure out how, so instead of looking 
stupid, they just pass over it.  Also, the spare tire well in the rear 
closet of my westy is safe.  I accidentally forgot about a bottle of 
scotch i had in there, and they didn't find it, because they didn't know 
it was there...

The best part about it is when they come up empty handed :-P
