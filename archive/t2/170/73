OK, so I should have used a capital "L" (el) instead of a lowercase one since a 
lower case "l" looks like a capital "I" (eye) in some fonts.  But I really did 
refer to it correctly.

D-Jet FI is no more difficult to trouble-shoot and maintain than "L"-jet.  It's 
just a question of which system you want to master.  But as I mentioned 
earlier, L-Jet is a more modern, more advanced system than d-Jet.  I suppose if 
I didn't know either of them and was ready to learn, I'd choose L-Jet.
