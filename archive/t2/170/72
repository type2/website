Subject: Tires- Conti's available again at Tirerack.com

Just noticed that tirerack is carrying a 185/14
reinforced continental that some may want to
consider.  I know that some of you prefer this
teutonic brand.  I cannot link to the Conti
Contact as it does not have a separate hyperlink
at this time but try this:

http://www.tirerack.com/tires/Compare1.jsp?startIndex=0&width=185%2F&ratio=0&diameter=14&search=true&pagelen=20&pagenum=1&pagemark=1

Specs are here:
http://www.tirerack.com/tires/Spec.jsp?make=Continental&model=Contact+CR21

At $50 tire, it is one of the most affordable
tires available.

Peace and blessings,
