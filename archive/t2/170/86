Sure sounds like you have a vacuum leak downstream of the air flow meter 
(AFM). That metal flap you're playing with is the AFM. Remove the big 
rubber duct it is connected to and make sure it isn't cracked on the 
backside. Verify the clamps are tight. Check the intake runner boots as 
well. Clamp them if they turn freely. Make sure the brake booster hose is 
hooked up and not holed or cracked. Then check also the hoses for the idle 
air bypass and the breather hose that connects to the big rubber duct. 
Verify the intake manifold bolts are tight. When you seal all the 
downstream air leaks then the metal flap will open as required to start and 
run. You then must have the mixture adjusted with a co meter.

Get a Bentley before going further if you don't already have one and want a 
chance to understand the system and it's components.

Good luck,
