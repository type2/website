Subject: Engine start help re-visited

I posted a couple days ago asking how to test start an engine in a bus with no ignition switch and unknown wiring. Thanks for all your guys' help (Matt roberds, steve dolan, Ronnie, and many others which I am now forgetting) I grounded everything, then I put the hot wire from the battery on the + side of the coil, also ran the hot battery wire to the big terminal on the starter solenoid. Ran a wire from the small solenoid terminal (ignition switch terminal) and when I touched this wire to the hot side of the battery it should start, right?! Well, it did turn over but I could only get one turn of the engine at a time. I electrify the ignition wire and I get one "Whooomp" as the engine turn over, then another "Whooomp" as it turns over again, but it won't turn fast enough to get the engine to start.  The bus is a 66 Kombi, the engine is a 1600 DP.  As per the advice found in the Type2 Library, I put a 6 volt flywheel on the 12 volt engine so I didn't have to grind or replace bel!
l-housing. The starter is still 6 volt but according to the Library, when 12 volts is applied to a 6 volt starter it should turn faster, right? The engine DOES turn freely by hand and the engine ran when it was pulled from a bug a few months ago. The battery I am using DOES have a full charge (charged it myself). So, Is the starter possibly getting tired and just doesn't have the "Umpf" to get the engine turning over fast enough, or is there something else I am missing?
