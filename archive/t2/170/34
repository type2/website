Subject: 2 battery with one voltmeter - update/suggestions/feedback wanted. 

Hello again,

Ok, after absorbing some of this data, I think I am ready to go out and find 
the needed tools/parts to make this happen.

Right now I have the aux battery connected, using the Hella relay busdepot 
sells. I have the VDO voltmeter and wiring kit they sell also. The cd 
player/fan/misc things to connect.

When I now need, I think, is a distribution block for all of said 
electronics to feed from. Some nice heavy gauge power wire to run from the 
main battery over to the main switch, and possibly nothing else.

The switch itself to I guess. Class C switch, or a spdt or whatever it was 
called.

The way I understand all of this, I will be running a large gauge power wire 
from each pos terminal of the batteries to the switch. The switch will give 
me the option between battery a and battery b, as well as possibly 
neither(?) The main out from the switch will be a heavy gauge power wire to 
the distribution block, which will then branch off and give power to the 
misc electronics as well as the gauge itself.

Now the VDO gauge has two pos and two neg. I know where to ground it. Its 
own wiring directions say to run the top pos connection to a light switch 
connection on the fuse box - this one is easy, so the light on the gauge 
turns on, right? Then there is the bottom pos connection on the gauge, which 
I guess I could run over to the distribution block. By default then, 
whatever battery the switch is on, is sending power to the distribution 
block and making the gauge read that particular battery.

I know where to get the distribution block, just a high end car stereo place 
should have it, which is where I can get some decent power wires also. But 
where do I get this Class C switch that I need? Orchard supply hardware, 
something like that?

thanks for any corrections, tips, suggestions, or tomfoolery you can shed on 
the subject. I just hope all of the experienced electricians aren't shaking 
their heads in disbelief yet. =)
