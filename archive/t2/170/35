Subject: Downtown San Diego

Hi Folks,

I recently moved to downtown San Diego, with my well-kept
chrome-yellow/white 77' Westy.  A few days later as I was walking near 10th
Av., I got something of a shock as my Bus drove by headed for the on-ramp to
I-5/163!  A double-take and closer examination as it passed revealed that it
wasn't mine after all, but pretty much a dead ringer.  I've seen it several
times since, around quitting time in the same area.  I always look closely
to make sure it's definitely not mine. Just wondering if the owner was on
this forum...if he sees "his" bus being driven away downtown, it's probably
just me!
