What have you heard that's good regarding GEX rebuilds?

Get Tom Wilson's book "How to Rebuild Your Volkswagen Air-cooled Engine."
Widely available, fairly cheap (it's paperback) and it covers the subject
thoroughly.

Advice: if you have the tools and the skill, measure all parts carefully
(e.g., rod journals, etc.) and make sure they're in spec.  Why put parts
that are past the wear limits back into the engine?  If you don't have the
tools and skills, take all parts to a machine shop for measuring.

More advice: you can't do a *comprehensive* rebuild cheaper than you can buy
a decent rebuild from a vendor.  You can build it better, just not cheaper.
Unless you want the simple pleasure of saying "I rebuilt this engine" you
might be better off buying a long block and doing the removal/install
yourself.  You *can* save some money this way.
