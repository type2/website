Sure.  No problem.  Two choices as I see it:

1.  Use a Bosch d-Jet from either a VW type IV car or a 70-74 Porsche 914 1.7.  
The 914 1.7 systems show up on eBay periodicall (as well as some of the 914 
classified pages) for $75 - $200 depending on completeness and condition.  Just 
make damned sure you get a d-Jet FI distributor because the system will not 
work without one.

2.  Simply use a bus l-Jet FI system.  While I don't know much about the l-Jet 
systems (I'm a d-Jet man myself), I don't see any particular problems with 
using the l-Jet on a 1.7 motor.  It is a more advanced system than the d-Jet 
and should work just fine.  The only change I might consider with this setup is 
to use injectors from a 1.7 or 1.8 application in place of the 2.0 injectors.

With either solution, don't forget you'll need a fuel tank from a fuel injected 
bus so you have the fuel return tap on it.  You'll also need to tap your 
cylinder head above #3 for a head temp sensor.  Other than than, it's just a 
question of hooking the FI wiring harness into your electrical and finding a 
place to mount the various sensors.
