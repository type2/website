Subject: Campers for sale in NH

Hey there Volks,

Since it's friday...

While surfing the 'net I saw these campers for sale in NH.

http://www.4evr4-vw-aircl-allvans.com/vehicles.htm

Prices range from $2300 (81 V'gon) to $4600 (77 Westy). They also
have a 65 camper for $4950, and a couple of other busses too (78
westy, 68 panel van, misc. V'gons).

I've got no connection to the seller. I haven't seen the buses, so I
can't help with descriptions/condition. I just figured that if
someone in New England was in the market for a bus, these might be
worth a look-see.

Later...
