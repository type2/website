Subject: VW Classic, SaveTheBays, Tires

Greetings list -

VW Classic:

We have a car-a-bus of (so far) 3 busses and a 'vert going to the VW Classic 
from the So. Cal. Burbank/Glendale area. Anyone interested in joining - 
please pmail.

SaveTheBays:

Hopefully, the print shop will come through, and we'll have some free "Save 
The Bays" window (or bumper) stickers for you folks with Bay Windows. See: 
www.SaveTheBays.org for a picture of the stickers.

Tires:

I've put a set of Cheng Shin UE-168 (205R14C's) on Itch, and can't recommend 
them enough. $80 out the door at my local tire shop. The tough part is 
asking for them. See: http://www.maxxis-reifen.de/seiten/pkw/ue168.htm or 
www.maxxis.com (under "light trucks") for more. Come see these at the 
Classic!

That will be all. Carry on.

Mike & Itch
"Save the Bays!"
