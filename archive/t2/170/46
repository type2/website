Subject: VDO Wiring Blues

Hey y'all,

I've had a VDO oil temp gauge sitting around my house for two years now.  A
buddy of mine who is a VW guru installed the sender in the oil sump of my
'78 champagne edition campmobile.  Today, on a splendid sunny afternoon, I
undertook the challenge of interpreting the VDO instructions.  After
everything was hooked up I made the following observations.  First off, the
light on the gauge works great, wired into a switched slot on the fuse
block.  Secondly, whenever I turn the key on the needle deflects all the way
to the right.  This occurs whether I wire to the fuse block or directly from
the battery.  It also occurs regardless of whether or not the sender wire is
attached to the "S" pole.  The ground is obviously working or no current
would go at all.  Has anyone else encountered this problem and found the
path around it?  This question has arisen before in the archives however the
explanations given fail to answer my specific question.  Where do your
temp/pressure gauges get there current from?  Thanks as always and warm
regards.
