Hi All,

Just wondering (not that I have any choice), what's the odds on a =
relatively inexperienced mechanic (done a bit over the years, but no =
serious unassisted reconstructions) with the appropriate Bentleys, =
getting ALL the parts out of a '79  DC in a usable form a week or so =
with occaisional assistance from a more experienced friend?

Just had to shift my 2 DCs from where they've been sitting, but I can =
only store one, now. My plan WAS to pull a few parts and panels off the =
'75 shell (no mechanicals) & send the remains to the tip (where it was =
originally going to go when I got it), and store the complete '79 until =
I could get it home to start the lonnggg restoration process, but when =
we got them down to my friend's place & I looked under the '79, it's =
ROTTEN, no chance of recovering it.

Going to do another comparison in the cold light of day, today, but I'm =
pretty sure that last night's analysis will stand.

Therefore, I need to strip ALL the parts out of/off the  '79 & cut up =
the remains within the next week or two, to prevent problems for my =
friend, am I'm getting a tad pensive, on the way out the door to start.

A REALLY convincing, "sure, no worries" might do wonders for me at this =
time. ;^)

Thanking you in anticipation.

Regards,
