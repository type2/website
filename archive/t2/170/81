Subject: Re: [T2] fresh air vent pollen trapper

well yah that's a great suggestion. earlier in the day i went to home depot
and looked at the forced air/filter stuff. almost pulled the trigger on one
item, but i panned thinking i'd contact 3M and see what they have that'd
stand up to moisture. a friend of mine told me driving rain can get into
the open flaps in the nose; that in fact there are weep holes down behind
the kick panels for such moisture. this is all a big question mark to me
since i thought that moisture behind kick panels came from rusted out lower
windshields. and his holes in the chassis might be aftermarket.
digressing...

so i'm holding off on stuffing the area behind the flaps just yet because
the potential for breathing something wet and moldy in the winter is there.
little more web searching here. oh welp, something to do while my type4
heads are at rimco. anyways, i'll report if i find anything if there's
interest.   - steve
