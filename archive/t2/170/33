Subject: One more Pilot Bearing ?...


Well I took my beloved 1/4"
wood chisel to it and it did the job.
A min. later whats left of the old beairing is out. OR IS IT?

With much care I put the new bearing into the cavity that is located behind the flywheel. Then I grease it and pick up the flywheel. When I look at the flywheel I see what appears to be the remains of another sleave or pilot bearing.

I popped it out easy enough, but what is it?

One more ?
With the flywheel removed should the oil be able to leak out? I thoght maybe the o-ring
on the flywheel completes the seal but just thought I would check to be sure.

Thanks for all the e-mails and help.

Jason
