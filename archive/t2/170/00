Yes, if this hypothesis works out, that would certainly be something  for
Joe and anyone else removing torsion leaves to do.  Too early to tell yet,
tho.  I have flopped 4-5 beams and of those I had to flop the leaves
2-3 times as well (rust or new beam) and I had not run into this problem,
altho it has been in the back of my mind as something to worry about.

My theory (hypothesis actually, it's not a theory until it *passes* a
couple tests :-) is that you need to flip the bars end for end.  The
divots for the set screws need to remain in the same orientation, but if
you slide the set out, flip it end for end and slide it back in, the
center divot will still point back and down, the end divots will still
point up and forward.  The twist on the set will be in the other
direction, however.

Yup, that is about what I do.  I have a big Phillips screwdrive that I use
as an alignment tool and slide the leaves back and forth 'til it drops in
the divot.

One final thought before I head out the door and off to the beach for the
weekend (fun in the sun... mowing grass and doing plumbing and electrical
repairs on my folks house :-), I know that the rear torsion bars come in
different "flavors."  The passenger buses got weaker, springier bars than
the Westies and panels.  I have never heard that there were year or model
differences in the front torsion leaves and I can't think of why there
should be.  The weight of the driver does not change whatever the year or
model of the bus, so why change the springs under him/her?  at the same
time, I don't *know* that and don't have access to the fiche that would
tell for sure. Anyone out there want to look and see if there is more than
one part number for front torsion leaves?  If so, what applications,
models, etc.?
