Subject: Re: [T2] Removable apron on later bays

IF I was going to do this to my '78 Westy here is how I would do it.

I would cut the panel at the seam at both ends. I would weld a steel "cap" 
on the bus where these seams were.

I would also weld a small metal cap on both ends of the panel removed.

I would leave enough of these "caps" or "flanges" exposed so that could use 
several stainless steel 10mm head, 6mm shank bolts (ala OEM VW) to bolt the 
removable panel to the bus. I'd use nylon lock nuts on the other end of 
those bolts. From the outside it would be stock, from the inside of the 
engine compartment or underneath the conversion would be visible.

My concerns would be losing any torsional rigidity of the vehicle body and 
crash worthiness.

The question I would want to think about and discuss - - - why did VW 
eliminate the removable panel in the first place? Cheaper? Figured the Type 
IV engine would seldom require removal?

Did the Mexican or Brazilian baywindow busses have a removable panel or not 
at the end of the their production run?
