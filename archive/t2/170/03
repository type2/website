Subject: Recycled T2

On my desk I have a little black Beetle model, one of those produced as
part of a VW recycling scheme. I think they were made from the bumpers of
Golf's (Rabbits to those on the rough side of the pond).

Now I've also got a New Beetle (clear red, made from taillights ?) and have
seen a Golf (Rabbit) and a Eurovan (VW equivalent of the Ford Transit van)
but didn't grab them while I had the chance.

Did they do a Type 2 ? Splitty or Bay - I'm not worried, I just fancy one
to compliment the bugs.

Also, any web sites out there showing the full range & history of these ?
