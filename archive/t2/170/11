Subject: 72 Westfalia 2liter

I am fairly new to air cooled vw's and recently purchased my first
project. I picked up a 72 westfalia with a ?GEX? 2liter rebuild (yes ive
heard the good and the bad regarding these particular rebuilds). Cylinders
1, 2, and 4 are fine but cylinder 3 is firing at 70lbs which means time
for a rebuild. Are there any good books that specialize in the 2liters for
the beginner?? any other advice concerning rebuilding the engine would
help considering i have never rebuilt an engine before.

Oregon 72 Westy
