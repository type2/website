Hey, it's friday, so i thought i'd toss out a line and see what i got...

I'm going to Vermont next weekend, and i was wondering if anyone from 
there could point me in the direction of any good VW junkyards or places 
that sell VWs or anything else that might be interesting to do while i'm 
up there cruising around...  

Thanks...
