Subject: Re: Bentley

    My Bentley has given me over 20 years of good service.  I retired it
this past spring so it can relax and live the good life any well worn book
deserves.  It now resides on a shelf in my bedroom where it can live out the
rest of it's life in ease.  I do visit it once in a while, especially when I
want to use it's color wiring schematics.  They are soooo much easier to use
than the ones in my new, young Bentley. :-)
    Have a great weekend folks!
