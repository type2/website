Craig:

Hey brotha! I just spent all day fixing vacuum leaks
too (on the 78 L-Jet).  My BIG leak was the brake
booster line just before the one way valve.  The tubing
is like a black polyethyelene type with some kind of
"tar/mastic" material in the barb to seal.  I replaced
the 'soft stuff" the the handymans other secret weapon
(3 wraps of electrical tape) that sealed it up great.  

Other leaks: 
-EGR (egr is removed on this bus) valve was not plugged
and was ceased at the half way mark.  Created a stopper
gasket. 
-Vacuum TEE (deceleration valve, brake booster,
manifold).
-Secondary air regulator 90.  All fixed up really
tight!

But I've still got the warm engine missing thing goin
here.  I havent replaced the sensor, but I did short it
to ground like the archive said and it did not help
either.
