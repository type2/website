Subject: working bus sighting

Several times now I have seen a real working bus in the parking lot of
a law office near the Chevy Chase Bank on University Ave in Wheaton,
MD.  Yesterday I stopped to talk to the owner.  He was a very cool guy
named Jim.  The bus in question was a '71 panel van.  It was in really
good shape and is in daily use to transport Jim's big ass lawn mower and
gardening equipment.  I think he's had it since '84 and does all his own
work.  If he is the list, I'd like to say Hello.
