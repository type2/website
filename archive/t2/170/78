Disassembly is always easier than assembly.
Here's some hints.

1. Use the right tools - nothing will mess up a part worse than the wrong 
tool used to take it off.  Match screwdrivers to the size screw.  Use 
sockets and end wrenches, leave the crescent wrenches in the tool box.

2. Get a stack of tags with wire attached to them.  You can then label the 
part, make any notes necessary and then wire the tag to the parts.

3. Replace bolts and nuts back into holes as you remove the part.  That way 
you aren't fishing around for the right nut or bolt when it goes back together.

4. If you can't screw a bolt back into the removed part, wire the bolt to 
the part.

5. A 2 lb sledge hammer and a 3" chisel works great for cutting out body 
panels.  I cut the entire floor out of a couple of jaguars using that method.

6. Don't forget to wear the safety glasses when hammering away.  Ear plugs 
help a lot too.

7. When removing wires, tag each wire with info where it was 
connected.  That will prevent a future post "does anyone know where to hook 
up the red wire?"


You should be able to strip the DC in one or two long days.  Much easier 
with another set of hands to help with the heavy parts.  The hardest part 
about stripping, isn't the taking off the parts, but having the right tools 
and then putting the parts away when done.

Good luck
