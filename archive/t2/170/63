The apron would be useful...  All you have to do is give a slight turn on
the jack and it slides out.  I know because that was how we removed my
engine when I had the rear apron cut off due to an accident.  We thought
about attempting this operation then but my campout was coming up and I
hadn't driven my bus in months due to this accident.    Had to do this with
a 1600 with dual carbs also.

And you could also go the full width of the opening for the apron and make
the cut at the raised ridge on the exterior.
