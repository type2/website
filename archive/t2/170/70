Subject: Re: [T2] AC Conversion to new "Freon"

I converted my M-B about 2 years ago. Now if they control unit hadn't
gone shot I would still have good cooling. Pretty much all there is to
it is to have the system evacuated by a prof (don't wanna let those
hydrocarbons out anymore). Then you put the special adapters on the
low & high pressure ports. After that you put some r134a oil in the
system then charge w/ something like 2-3 cans of 134a. Works great.
But now that I write this, I assume the bay's a/c doesn't work? if it
does why bother. Also if the system has been opened the receiver/dryer
very well might be crapola. you might have to replace this part when
changing over.
