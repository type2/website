Subject: Re: [T2] AC Conversion to new "Freon"



Dave 34 articles in the archive if you search for "freon", but the one I 
was thinking about is in the library under 

Air Conditioned Bus by David Schwarze

I have heard more on this...maybe on the vintagvw list though.

My vote is for freeze-12 I think.  I have heard that it cools better than 
R134.

Good luck, dave
