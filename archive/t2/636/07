Subject: Re: [T2] Left rear shock....

Hey all, my Bentley is on the loose somewhere in my garage Muir didn't help
much.  This is in relation to a 78 Transporter we just picked up.  Since I
picked it up , I have noticed a knocking noise from the rear when going over
larger dips or bumps.  I got it up on jacks last night and found that the
bolt attaching the shock absorber did not seem to be in all the way.  I
tried to tighten in but its not wanting to go anywhere and I am afraid to
put too much pressure on it.  It's pretty scary though realizing how I was
driving it. Should I be able to really ratchet down on this or are there other items I
should look into?

The upper bolt is long. It goes thru the frame rail. In the fuel tank cavity, there are 2 weld nuts
[one on each side] for the upper shock bolts. Either the bolt threads are stripped (unlikely) or the weld nut
has a problem (highly likely). 1st I would try to remove the bolt and see if it is damaged.
If the threads are OK, them you have a problem. You need to remove the access panel across the gas tank to get
to the nut. You cannot replace the weld nut. You could possibly find a longer bolt and add a 2nd nut lock nut,
but 2 things are wrong with this:
1) if you want to change shocks later, you will need to remove the gas tank panel to get to the nut
2) the rear corner of the gas tank is about 1" away, too long a bolt will puncture the tank....

Your other option is to remove the shock completely and drive the bus without it.
