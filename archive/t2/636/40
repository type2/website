Subject: RE: [T2] Left rear shock.... [UPDATE]

Got the shock off this afternoon and there's good news.  The bolt still has
all the threads and the weld nut is just fine.  I am going to look at a set
up shocks to replace in the rear for now.  Seems it was just the bolt not
being tight.  Once I took weight off the bolt it came right out, as
suspected by Jason.  Updated picks (-at-)
