Subject: RE: [T2]oil filler cap seal

Whoah there is a seal in there? I never noticed. Are you talking about the 
filler neck where the plastic meets the metal? Or where the plastic cap 
meets the filler neck.

I am confused.

Do you see it here? If it is the cap gasket(A) you can cut one out of stock 
cork.

Good Luck,

hey mike by the busboys link provided and looking at B it is between the B and the metal tube goes up inside there but i dont see it pictured there?

I didnt think about trying to use cork gasket that might work>? i have plenty of that if i can cut it to the right diameter?

if you take the plastic off B and turn up side down there is a ring that goes in there like a little rubber ring?

my pushrod seal jerry rigged theory worked for abit but has broken since i added oil and accidentally turned the whole piece when unscrewing the cap so now its leaking again.

hope that made since?

peace and love

chris
