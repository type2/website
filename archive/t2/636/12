Subject: Fw: '80 air-cooled power loss

I have a 1980 air-cooled vanagon w/ 2.0 F.I. non-calif. model, M/T
Items recently replaced:

fuel tank
fuel pump
fuel filter
replaced breather/vacuum lines
charged battery/cleaned connections
checked timing - 7.5 btdc
plugs look good - gap .028
air filter
cap & rotor look good
brakes all around
new clutch master & slave cylinder
replaced intake boot - afm to throttle body

symptoms:
van idles and starts up great, revs up really good and returns to idle. Engine
sounds good and runs good, no missing.
When I drive the van and put the engine under load I have to really rev it up
to move.  Under low and mid range
rpm it bucks and coughs, but at high range rpm it drives really well.  Is this
more likely an ignition problem or
a vacuum problem.  I've looked repeatedly for any missing vacuum lines and
leaks.  Timing retards when I rev up motor.
Runs great when sitting, runs poor when driving.
Where should I be looking?

thanks, Jamie Foust
