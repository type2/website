Steve,

I would say most likely you need to adjust your idle speed screw and
possibly the choke.  Look at the Bentley procedure for carb adjustment. it
sounds like the choke is working because that gives it a fast idle in the
beginning. however when the choke element warms up it will move the "fast
idle cam" so the idle speed screw (the one attached to the accel cable
lever) drops to a lower spot on the cam.  Screw in the idle speed screw
until you can maintain an idle.  (spec is 925-950 warmed up)

If the carb is very worn it can have vacuum leaks and I usually compensate
by turning out the idle mixture screw a turn or so to richen the idle mix.
this also runs the risk of fouling plugs too if you go too far, it is a last
resort.

you should be able to check the timing with a gun but if it runs at first it
is most likely idle speed related.

good luck and keep us posted
