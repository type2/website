I'm really curious about it because over the years I've obviously had oil drip out. Ever since I cleaned and detailed the engine there's hardly been any so it must have been a slow drip over 25 years.

One thing I will mention is that ever since I located the flat rubber gasket that goes instead the filler cap itself I've not had the yellow boogers appear even after driving short trips in cold/wet weather.
