On second thought, belay that I-10/20 suggestion... I'm seconding Troy!
Having driven the Interstates out west at 55-60 I would definitely prefer
a road with a slower pace.  The "freeway flyer" trans will *allow* higher
speeds, but that does not improve the brakes or handling of a splittie!
45-55 is just *smarter* no matter what the power available.

BTW... speaking of handling...  and since Gord *will* have the cash...
make damn sure that bus is wearing load range C/D tires, eh?

OOK!
