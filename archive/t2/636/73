Yup,, the Best one I own is a 7mm,, 6pt... that is for bleeder screws!
Then again,, I really like that 6pt set,,,
I nearly bought a 6pt  to fit my rear axle nuts,, but they wanted $60 for the
wrench,, and I got the socket, drive bar, and handle extension for $40....

Jamie ,,, never seen a million dollars, but some one has that much.... Rivers
