something to think about. Phil

So what exactly does all that mean? Mixture? Pressure? Fix?

I dont have the power i need on the hills thats for sure like i had with the secondary from the weber.

Not sure if the choke plate bushing broken in the left hand carb choke flat could be the problem or not?

I didnt think it would bother it after it was warmed and the flap was open the whole time?

Honestly if i dont have it on there right for whatever reason i wil try again tomorrow/

It seemed to not leak like that again till the pushrod seal that i jerry rigged in there kept it from coming out(oil).

that oil filler cap has always gave me problems should of gotten  new one along time ago.

I thought by replacing the ring that it would seal it off but if that isnt the case then maybe it is forcing out there for whatever reason?

FOr a long while its kinda been a little wet there but not seems to pour out.

Once again i can however turn the whole piece trying to take off the cap?

I didnt think it was suppose to move at all if it was on the notch correctly so i wil check once more to see if i have it on wrong?

Doesnt look damaged up in the tube>? From upside down.

peace and love
