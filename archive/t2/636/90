Chad...
It's not at the top or the middle..it's at the bottom.  Your problem happens when the bottom of the tube moves around.  Turn the key on and move the bottom of the tube around, your horn will honk.  Assure that the black plastic collar at the bottom of the steering column tube is  attached properly.  The tube may even be too far down or too high.  There is a notch around the inside of that collar and the tube bottom must rest on that notch.  Also, the collar must rest well into the metal part of the floor.  Make sure this metal part is not bent up, this will cause the collar and tube to be in the wrong position.  Also, there is a rubber ring that goes around the tube at the bottom but this shouldn't be related to your problem but couldn't hurt to have it on properly.  Check Ratwell's site for a fiche picture.
 
While you're on it, check the spade connector at the bottom of the tube.  The connector can be a beeotch to put back on while the whole thing is together.  The best thing to do is take it all off, solder a wire to the spade, shrink tube it, and then you have a wire hanging down to connect to instead of having to try to connect a wire to the very bottom of the tube- which is hell to get to.
 
I've been to hell and back finding the same problem and this is what worked for me.
hth!
