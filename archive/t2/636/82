Subject: Re: [T2]oil filler cap seal

I guess my face is painted red I can't find the other
filler neck to check, as soon as I can find something
to verify this with, I'll post it. We have a "fix Yer
Bus" meeting this weekend (camp out and work on all
broken buses). I'll have some to compare with, to see
if any of them have seals on them. Phil
