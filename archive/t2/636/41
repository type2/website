Subject: RE: [T2] Toolkit for bus pickup trip.

Greg,

I think the suggestion of shipping tools ahead is the best would suggest 
bringing a dwell meter/tach as well as a carb synchro. if dual carbs 
(especially with the altitude change), belts, pulleys w/shims, some wire and 
elec. connectors, hoses, cluctch/accelerator cables, wheel and drum removal 
tools (long down hills over Rockys, be prepared in case of brake 
failure/overheating) may be a bit extreme but this time of year it would 
suck to get stuck out in the middle of nowhere, 12v electric blanket just in 
case (no heat remember), valve adjusting tools/gaskets, OIL, again extreme 
but maybe an emergency jump start battery (can drive for a little while with 
this hooked up), fuel filter, plus tools to change all of this stuff, I 
would also check the drive axles before I took off, if the need to be 
replaced, easier to do it in CA than in SD or somewhere, parts are more 
available. Haven't gotten the chance to do this myself but it is a very long 
trip and I would like to be prepared for anything, parts are most important 
since they can be hard to find at your general auto parts store. A little 
forethought and planning will prevent a lot of headaches and cost, however 
if it is adventure they are looking for take a winning smile, a good 
attiude, a lot of good music, definatly a camera/film, sit back and enjoy 
the experience for all it's worth. Honestly, wish I had the time to do 
something like that myself. Good luck.
