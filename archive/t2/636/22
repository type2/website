Subject: [T2]oil filler cap seal

can someone tell me what size the seal is that goes inside the tube for the oil filler cap .
 
i am talking about when you take pliars to the metal clamp and pull the whole thing off the plastic part up inside the black plastic there is suppose to be a seal that goes there?
 
i found that the large size pushrod tube seal will fit it but is to fat and want let the oil filler cap go all the way down correctly on the metal sooooooo what can i use here>?
its causing oil to sling out everywhere and i even tried sealent but that doesnt hold but a day course thats without any kind of seal at all and just sealent.
 
its a small ring looks just like a pushrod seal but thinner.
peace and love
