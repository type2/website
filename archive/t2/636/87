I think the dipstick senders are worthwhile - very cheap insurance. 
They are as accurate as any other automotive temp gauge (and way
easier to install).  Just be sure to test it in boiling water every
once in a while to make sure its calibrated.  I had one that was not
even close to turning the light on (-at-) 227 F.

You should definitely get an oil pressure gauge.  Then you can
dedicate the oil light to the dipstick sender.

As for the light coming on often and being a source of worry - bottom
line is when the light comes on you are near 227 F (assuming you
calibrate).  You decide what action to take.  I usually slow down,
which sometimes means grabbing 3rd and driving slower.  I have found
if I operate the bus within the limits it was designed for and not
drive it like its a Honda, the light never comes on.

The thing I DONT like about the dipstick sender - it sucks for
checking oil.  I keep the original dipstick in the engine compartment
and still use it for checking oil.
