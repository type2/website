hey chris, the fact that the filler piece turns might be your problem.
Look at the metal piece. notice that notch (there might be 2 I don't
remember). There is a matching piece on the inside of the plastic
fillter part. it has to be rotated correctly before it will slide down
all the way. Your problem might simply be it's not pushed down all the
way.
