Subject: Left rear shock....

Hey all, my Bentley is on the loose somewhere in my garage Muir didn't help
much.  This is in relation to a 78 Transporter we just picked up.  Since I
picked it up , I have noticed a knocking noise from the rear when going over
larger dips or bumps.  I got it up on jacks last night and found that the
bolt attaching the shock absorber did not seem to be in all the way.  I
tried to tighten in but its not wanting to go anywhere and I am afraid to
put too much pressure on it.  It's pretty scary though realizing how I was
driving it. Pics are at

Should I be able to really ratchet down on this or are there other items I
should look into?

Thanks,
