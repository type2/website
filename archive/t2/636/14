Subject: diesel init

ooops, the other morning I was afraid I wouldn't have enough gas to go the 30 miles to the closest open gas station and so I poured a can of fuel in that was sitting around and about the time the can was empty I noticed it smelled an awful lot like diesel. I'm happy to report that my bus did drive on what I guestimate as a 50/50 gas/diesel mix though very gutless. I've since added about 15 gallons of regular unleaded fuel and it runs much better though it still stalls and coughs a bit if I'm trying to pull power with low revs. I haven't even bothered to check my plugs or fuel filter yet as there doesn't seem to be much problem although I can still smell the diesel a bit. Is there anything else I should check or be aware of?
