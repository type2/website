Subject: RE: [T2] Sorry...another seatbelt question

Zach, the main problem that we ran into with this was finding a seatbelt
that was long enough to mount on the floor and still make it through the car
seat.  Don't get me wrong, I could get it latched, but it left the buckle
smack in the middle of the car seat for my daughter to set her back on.  :(
Now with Cameron, when he was in a rear facing seat it was not an issue
because the seat itself is separate.  This issue will arise though once they
move to the forward facing seats.  My work around was not clean, but was
safe and effective.  I took a heavy duty L bracket, mounted it to the seat
belt hold in the floor.  Then I attached the seat belt to the top of that.
This allowed the buckle to move over about 4 inches to the side to keep from
being in the middle of the seat.  Hope this helps.

 

Later
