You might try a larg(er) plumbing supply house for something that big...
Industrial valves and fittings use that size and larger... It might not be
as pretty as a Snap-On wrench but it'll sure get the job done. I've picked
up few at house sales and such including a few large box wrenches with
a flat end made for hammering...
