Greg,
    The first thing to do is check with the airline and see if he'll
be able to get any kind of toolbox on the airplane.  I work as an
aircraft mechanic and years ago when the company sent me on a road
trip I almost had to leave my tools behind because the airline I was
traveling on wouldn't let me take them on the plane, not even as
checked baggage.  I appealed to the Captain of the flight, explained
the situation, and he let my toolbox ride in the cockpit as a
professional courtesy to me.  In this post 9/11 world I don't know
what might happen to your Dad's tools or parts
