Jamie,

I'm with Dave Bolen... timing should advance when your rev!

I would check the following based on your symptoms:

Buy a vacuum gauge, attach it to the manifold vacuum port (between
cylinders 1&3 on the air distribution box)  It ought to read at least 15"
at idle, lower as you open the throttle, rising to near 25" as you close
the throttle)

Attach the vacuum gauge to the ported vacuum port (at the front of the
throttle body) and check vacuum (near 0" at idle, rising to ~10-15" as you
open the throttle)

Be sure that the vacuum advance line is attached to the ported vacuum port
and that the vacuum retard line is attached to the manifold vacuum port.

Replace the coil with a known-good spare.

Replace spark plug wires and plugs with known-good spares.

Your problem definitely sounds like spark is not smooth, although the
vacuum advance/retard being reversed will cause similar problems.

OOK!
