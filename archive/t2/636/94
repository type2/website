  1975 Westy Campmobile 4-spd w/1974 parts bus. This is a project that I 
nearly completed and then fell ill; I cannot finish it.

The engine had new P&C 2500 miles before I got it, but one head had a 
stripped exhaust stud. I removed that head and found a crack, so I 
checked the other and it was cracked as well. I bought core heads and 
had a compelte rebuild on those, CC'd them and mounted them. The engine 
now needs to be installed. The engine had been comverted to Weber 2-bbl. 
progressive, so I bought another engine (2.0 L) with *all* FI parts. 
Then I bought the parts bus wdual single throats, so all three types of 
carburetion are avaialble for the clever Type-2 "project finisher" :-) 
Also have type 50 and dual advance dizzys. The two spare engines were 
represented as running, but I have no documentation of those facts. I 
have a new engine tin perimeter seal.

Interior is complete and in gd. cond. but was removed for cleaning and 
needs to be re-bolted in place. The tent top is completely rotted, but 
is in place. I have purchased a complete new seal kit for the top. Front 
beam was replaced by an absolutely perfect used one. This is a good 
solid bus.

Transmission is good, as is running gear. Bus has normal rusty rockers, 
and there is a body dent above the battery area. Of course, the bottom 
of the battery compartment is rusty and partly gone. Windows and doors 
all complete and work well. Parts bus has good tranny and running gear, 
but significant body damage to the front driver's side.

Email for any details I didn't cover. No time for showing unless yu are 
in the immediate area.
