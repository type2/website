Hi type 2ers



Throw the tools you want to bring in a 5 gallon bucket that you can get
from the home depot. Make sure you get the lid too. Bring it to the
airport with a role of Duct Tape and when they inspect it. Tape it all
up. I have done this for the past 3 years going to Mexico to build
houses. The buckets can hold a lot with creative packing.

Good luck,



Max
