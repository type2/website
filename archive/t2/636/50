 Jamie,

 I'm with Dave Bolen... timing should advance when your rev!

 I would check the following based on your symptoms:

 Buy a vacuum gauge, attach it to the manifold vacuum port (between
cylinders 1&3 on the air distribution box)  It ought to read at least 15"
at idle, lower as you open the throttle, rising to near 25" as you close
the throttle)

Attach the vacuum gauge to the ported vacuum port (at the front of the
throttle body) and check vacuum (near 0" at idle, rising to ~10-15" as you
open the throttle)

 Be sure that the vacuum advance line is attached to the ported vacuum port
and that the vacuum retard line is attached to the manifold vacuum port.

 Your problem definitely sounds like spark is not smooth, although the
vacuum advance/retard being reversed will cause similar problems.

Well...... I am a little lost here. He said he had "a 1980 air-cooled vanagon w/ 2.0 F.I. non-calif. model,
M/T" and "checked timing - 7.5 btdc".

That would mean he had a Vanagon Federal 1980-1983 * 2000

Note: This Distributor also fits Type 4 (412) 1974
Distributor: VW 022-905-205S, Bosch 0231 170 093
Note: VW 021-905-205P, Bosch 022-905-205S, 0231 168 005
Vacuum Can: 07 060
Timing Set At:: 7.5deg BTDC (-at-) 850-950 rpm (Man Trans), 900-1000 rpm (Auto Trans) w/strobe, vacuum hose
connected. (Bentley Table on Page 28.3 incorrectly states with hose disconnected).
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 8-12deg Adv (-at-) 7.9 In. Hg; Centrifugal: 9-14deg (-at-) 1600 rpm, 21-25deg (-at-) 3400 rpm

This is the same dizzy as a mid 76 to 78 and 79 Fed bus.

He should not have a dual vacuum dizzy.
