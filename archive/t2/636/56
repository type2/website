Subject: Gene Berg Dipstick on type4 engine?

Hi,

I understand the value of gauges and used to be a real gauge freak.  In 
fact, I couldn't keep my eyes off them on long trips.  Since this bus 
purchase was geared toward slowing life down and seeing the scenery, 
I'm wary of starting another gauge binge.  I may end up with an oil 
pressure gauge, since they're usually pleasantly boring and maybe less 
wildly inaccurate than some.

I recently read about the Gene Berg oil temp dipstick which flashes a 
dash light at 227 degrees or so.  I see he makes a version for the type 
4 engine.  The archives on this mainly apply to early engines.  Has 
anyone used one with a late bus?  I'm wondering if the hotter running 
type 4 engine will cause it to flash too often and become a 
distraction.  Also, would there be any problem in wiring it to one of 
the unused dash lights (i.e. CAT or EGR)?

thanks,
joe and rachel
