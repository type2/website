hey chris, the fact that the filler piece turns might be your problem.
Look at the metal piece. notice that notch (there might be 2 I don't
remember). There is a matching piece on the inside of the plastic
fillter part. it has to be rotated correctly before it will slide down
all the way. Your problem might simply be it's not pushed down all the
way.


you know jason, mike and richard all might have a point there....

i have been having problems out of this one for quiet sometime no matter what i do could it just be simply worn out? hmmmm... i have tried putting it on several diffrent ways as far as the way it sets on there~!~

its always been a pain and leaked ...

i seen the notch though and figured it was right but maybe i will give it another shot.

i was told there was a seal in there somewheres but after mikes post and relooking over the bus boys diagram i just thought hmmm maybe not then... so thought i would continue my search on this...

thanks you all.. will try it tomorrow and see what happens going out of town here shortly in the beetle so wont worry with it till tomorrow..

peace and love

chris
