Subject: RE: [T2] Toolkit for bus pickup trip.

I would like to add a note in here.  We recently brought our 63 DC back from
Carson City, NV to Aurora, CO.  After a look at some topographical maps etc,
we decided to take US40.  The main reason for this was that the top speed of
the DC was roughly 55mph to 60mph.  The speed limit on US40 is 45mph to 55
mph most of the time.  For those who are not sure, US40 basically breaks
away from I80 just East of Salt Lake City and drops down into the West side
of Denver.  There are a few grades and switch backs but overall it's a very
pretty drive and since others aren't flying by you at 80+mph while your
putting along, it's a little bit more secure....In my eyes anyhow.  :)  Even
though US40 does not go the full distance of this trip, every little bit
counts.  Just my .02

Later,
