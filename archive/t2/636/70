I REALLY recommend wiring it to an alternative dash light. If I have low oil pressure, I wanna know. If I have high oil temps then I can deal with that too (doesn't require immediate engine shut down in rush hour traffic like the low oil pressure). 

It is simply a ground. Wire a light like this. 12 volts+ to the light then to the dipstick. If you use an LED, use the right resistor in series with the LED.
