Subject: horn shorting

my horn blares anytime I give some downward pressure on the steering wheel, which actuaaly happens everytime I spin the wheel. The problem is not at the horn ring because I can disconnect the wire from the top end and it'll still go off leading me to believe that the wire is bare at some point. I'd love to think that I can just tie a string to the end and pull it through, find the bare spot, wrap it with electrical tape and pull it back through again. I've never done this before and I'm pretty nervous about pulling that wire through either the top or the bottom. Does anybody have any sagely advice about my horn wire?
