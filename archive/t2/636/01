Subject: Hard Starts, Strange Idle - FIXED!

Hi Folks,

Well, as we all suspect when a 2.0 FI Bus is idling strange, it was a vacuum 
leak.  The hose from the S-hose to the Decel Valve had split at the end and 
was leaking, despite the fact that it was pushed on tightly.  A 99-cent hose 
clamp and 2 minutes later, my engine idles fine and starts just like it's 
supposed to.

Thanks to all who DIDN'T post -- I should have gotten this on my own if I 
had been more thorough in my checking.  Moral of the story: double-check ALL 
your vacuum hoses, even if you're "sure" they're all fine.

Best,

Hi

In my opinion, even if your timing is off it
would not be effecting the idle problem you're
having. The manual I have will do you a lot
of good in no time. Later
