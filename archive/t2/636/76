Subject: In search of scissors style hinges for poptop of 1979 Westy

Hello,
I have recently just purchased a 1979 Westy camper that has damaged hinges
(The rear scissors style hingers I believe were on the Westy campers from
1974-1979.) In other words, I can't close the poptop. I have looked all over
the net, and haven't found any leads. Does anyone have any idea were I could
find these hinges? Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks!
Brian
