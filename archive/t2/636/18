I had an experience recently in August when I flew to NC to drive a friend's
bus to a few Dead shows.  Went to the airport with a full set of combo
wrenches wrapped in a towel and packed in my carry on, no dice, but I was
able to go back and check them.  this was wrenches only.  I can't guarantee
they will let you on but if you take the minimum possible you might get
lucky.

May be easier to ship a box ahead (insured of course).

be sure to send a trip report!! good luck,
