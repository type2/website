Most FLAPS and FNHS(Friendly Neighborhood Hardware Store) should have many 
sizes of O-Rings available take your filler neck in there with you. I will 
check it out when I get home if nobody has the size by then. Sounds like I 
might have missed a seal. ;)
Thanks for the heads up if you find it before me let me know.

Later,
