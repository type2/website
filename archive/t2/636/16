No problem, just keeping refilling with gasoline. I once did this on purpose to get my nearly empty VW Beetle to the gas station. I knew I would run out of gas so I poured anything that was flammable in the gas tank - paint thinner, lacquer thinner, kerosene, diesel, gas - everything. Gutless, smoked, but was fine after a full tank of gasoline was run through it.
