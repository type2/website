Today I am looking for a good used or e new one brake fluid reservoir for a
1970 Westy, the kind that is located behind the driver kick panel cilinder
shaped with a 12mm external diameter hose conecction.
If any one have one unused in the spares and want to negociate just let me
 know.

The 69/70 round upper reservoir is a piece of junk. It gets wafer thin and crumbles when you
touch it. You are better off using a 71-74 bus upper reservoir. Even thought it is square, it is
made of better, longer lasting material. It mounts behind the drivers seat but you can move it to the front.
Here is what one looks like:  http://www.thesamba.com/vw/classifieds/detail.php?id=112784
