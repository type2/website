Subject: Re: [T2] Delays shipping parts to Canada via Postal mail

That is good information,, but if you are shipping to Canada,,,

ASK the Canadian what they want BEFORE assuming !

It CAN costs an extreme amount of extra costs shipping via UPS

Unless I was in a big hurry,, I <personally> would advise to wait for the
Canadian Border Services Agency office to correct the problems.

It looks as if that only effects WESTERN Canada,, so *I* may not be effected
