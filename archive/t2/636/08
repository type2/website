hmmm, under those circumstances it might be worth purchasing a set of
tools when he gets there, take only the odd or expensive tools.   now I
will say that as a wheelchair user I have a tool kit I carry with me to
perform "personal ride repairs" I have flown several times since 9/11 and
have not had problems taking it as checked baggage, but I haven't flown
international with em.

almost might be worth renting a car on way and driving out there and
leaving it
