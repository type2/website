Chris,

Iginition timing should always and everywhere be set to match the
*distributor*!  Which reminds me, I still have not written up the long
post on distributors that I promised a bit back.... soon, volks, soon :-(

At any rate, in the short term, pull your distributor, look for the
numbers on the side of the can, go to the type2 library and see what the
timing specs are for that distributor.  Then set the timing to the specs.
