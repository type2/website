Don't waste the time.  Bite the bullet, and drop the engine.  At a minimum,
you'll need to torque ALL nuts on both heads--gradually, back and forth from
head to head--as per the instructions in the Bentley Manual.  Pulling heads
and cylinders may unearth additional problems, that it would be better to
discover in your workshop, than on the road the hard way.
