Readjust the valves on the heads that got retorqued. They may be too tight 
and holding the valve open.

If anyone adjusted the valves while the head was loose, they would be too 
tight once the heads were torqued.

don't forget to torque the other head too.

Did you JUST torque the nuts under the valve cover or did you torque ALL of 
the head bolts (the ones under the cylinder tin).

I would torque ALL of them so that you did not pull the ones you just 
torqued after a few heat cycles (it's possible, not for sure). They will be 
doing their job + the work the top row (under the tin) is supposed to be 
doing too.
