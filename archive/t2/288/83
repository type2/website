Subject: Carb part question

I'm in the process of rebuilding the carbs on my 73 Transporter ( 34
PDSIT-2/3 and 34 PICT-3). And I'm curious as to what the part named "Idle
mixture enrichment" (number 2, Bentley page 22, section 3) does. When I got
my left bank carb, the 34 PDSIT-2/3, I noticed that two of the screws on the
side opposite the removable cover plate had falled out. They were laying
right next to it in the sludge on top of the carb body. So what is this
part, and can I just put the screws back into their holes and call it good,
or should I replace the whole unit? Any help is appreciated!
Danke~
