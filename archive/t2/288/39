Subject: Re:More starter problems 

The starter on my 76 Westy began acting the same way last week, after 26 
years of faultless service. I replaced the entire unit with a new one 
the  next day and it now works fine. Sounds like you could take your 
starter apart and rebuild it somehow, but new ones are available for around 
$142, if you want to have it on the road for sure in a few hours.   Doyt in

OK, now I am really confused. I have now been able to
spin the starter with a screwdriver. I have also
checked voltage .snip........
