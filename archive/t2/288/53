The Corvair national club CORSA has started a list called vv-talk to 
compliment the main list. Anything goes on the vv-talk list except flame 
wars and anyone that tolerates chat on the main list is now generally 
subscribed to the talk list as well.

They are just as "militant" about Corvair stuff not being appropriate on 
the talk list as the main list is about non-Corvair stuff on the main list. 
Funny really.

Ont he talk list anything has been deemed fair game as long as it is in 
decent taste - topics so far have ranged from politics, religion, jobs, 
etc. We also ask questions about other vehicle makes and brands. No 
archives are kept.
