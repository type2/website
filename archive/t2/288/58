Subject: Camshaft Identification

I bought a camshaft off a list member as I'm gathering parts for a 2.0 solid
lifter rebuild.
I'm trying to determine whether a camshaft is Solid or Hydraulic.
It is NOS in a Blue VW Box still with dry cosmoline on it. The sticker on
the box reads
021 109 021 J   Camshaft G
and the numbers on the camshaft are
021 109 111 B   with  a "zero" on the inner teeth

He and I are both pretty sure it's solid, but can we make that assumption or
should I measure lift
with a caliper and try to compare to known readings from a hydraulic
camshaft? If so, what are the measurable differences?

The question came up because my case is a canadian rebuild designed for a
code CV motor replacement
1980 Vanagon. The cam that came out of that reads 021 109 111 C with a
"zero" on the inner teeth.
I was expecting the ID prefix to begin with 022 since this was originally a
replacement for a hydraulic motor.
On the other hand, maybe all canadian rebuilds had solid setups. I do not
know. Or maybe "021" and "022" no longer
has anything to do with the grind, but for NOS cams 021 always means solid
and 022 means hydraulic?.

Any comments? Thanks.
