This  how they work Courtney---

You just can't really pull on them and think they will lock up---

They are designed to prevent the person behind them from going flying
upon impact---not just a tug--

If they are locking if you really rapidly yank on them--their working.

So I installed the 3 point retracting belts into my 70 bug so my
daughter would be a little safer, but they don't seem to 'lock up'
unless I really pull them out quickly and even then only about half the
time. Is this normal ? I believe they have some sort of locking up
mechanism that requires hard deceleration to come into play?? They are
out of a 73 bug, and installed just like the factory did.
Thanks,
Courtney
