.........don't value the motor too highly, or spend much time with engine 
issues. They can be rebuilt somehow, eventually, by somebody, fairly 
easily.  The really expensive and potentially deadly systems are rust in 
the front axle beam and steering box; rust under the front windshield 
(figure over $500, and requires a body man to deal with those compound 
curves and close tolerances, so the windshield fits; rust under the door 
bottom edges and the bottom edge of the sliding door and its lower track; 
and a messed-up nose panel (can't buy replacements easily).  If it has a 
good tranny/clutch, brakes, and rear suspension, and good glass and 
door/window seals, you are way ahead. Look for leaking gasoline lines, 
corroded brake lines, and evidence of body work after a severe collision. 
Bent unibodies are expensive to straighten out.

...........hire a local VW bus enthusiast to go with you. Find out who 
fixes buses locally and get acquainted, and take him/her along.

...........if it runs at all, buy the beast based on all the items I just 
mentioned (above).  $500 is cheap for a running bus that hasn't been 
wrecked and can be safely driven and fixed in stages by a motivated owner.

 >..........snip............................

.............getting into reverse may take going up into first, back to 
neutral, then push the lever :downward" and sweep it smoothly into reverse 
instead of second. Sometimes it takes 3 tries and I've been doing it for 26 
years. Don't pass on the bus based on getting this cranky shift pattern to 
work perfectly. It was tough to get working right when they were new.Make 
sure the bus can be put in neutral, so you can move it out of the garage 
and flatbed it home, at least.
................and be as careful about looking for a good title as you are 
about looking for rust and mechanical issues. She has to show you that she 
owns the bus, and there are no liens on it or no storage fees due the 
rental property owners. If her son owns the bus, he has to transfer the 
title to you.  Don't give her any money until she can offer you a clean and 
clear transferrable title! She can't sell what she doesn't own, and you 
can't buy from an absent owner without at least some kind of power of 
attorney being involved.


 >Backseat Drivers Wanted TM ;-)
 >...snip............I can have
 >some fun with and get (most) of my money back out of later...

...........be careful of getting involved in passing out money for a stolen 
bus, a wrecked bus, or a bus that can't be titled for some reason. Make her 
prove the title and check the stamped VIN number with whatever appears on 
the title, and get a notary public to witness any transactions involving 
title and money. Buses are usually very fixable, but you may not be able to 
fix a bad title.  Doyt Echelberger   76 Westy in Ohio, USA
