Subject: Looking for front VW rubber mats for a 70 bug

I have a standard and a deluxe 70 bug. The standard has nice rubber mats up
front with the no's 111 863 712B on the passenger side, and 111 863 711C on
the drivers side. I can't find any from ANY vendors. Anybody seen them for
sale new or used?
Thanks,
Courtney
