Subject: Re: [T2] Pertronix report

I (unlike Dolan, who apparently loves to set dwell) put the pertronix
in my bus a few months ago. Love the results. My dwell was also high,
but I thought about it. So, the only reason you don't want a higher
than necessary dwell is so your points don't burn up, right? Well, w/
the elec ignition there are no points. Hopefully all we end up doing
is give the coil a slightly longer time to build up a larger magnetic
field to collapse & give us a better spark at the plug. Haven't
worried about it since.
