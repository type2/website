Subject: Searching for small Riviera style pop-up

Hi folks,

I've been searching for a Riviera style pop-up assembly for my 71 bus and
it's been tough trying to find one.  I thought I'd post to this list for
some help.  I'm looking for the smaller pop-up assembly that covers the
sunroof opening only...not the full size pop-up.  Canvas isn't mandatory
since they are available through different retail outlets.  I'm just
searching for the fiberglass top and hardware mainly.  Any help would be
greatly appreciated.

Have a great weekend!
