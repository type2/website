Subject: long term resident

Just wanted to let everyone know that the burnout I dragged home to try to get his 77 bus running is moving into his sixth week of residency in my driveway.

He shows up after dark on foot/bike/buddy's split window to sleep and heads to school early in the morning. The bus is filling with pizza boxes/hippy literature slowly. 

A few times he said he met a guy from CB Performance (near us) who was gonna come over and dial it in, never showed. Said he lost the phone number. I said "why don't you call CB's and ask for Aaron?"

He did give us a clay bowl he made in art class.

So it's kinda funny, he's in my prefered work spot, but I'm giving him a break as his mental capacities are reduced from what he was born with, and I figure the longer the bus sits in my yard, the better chance I have of owning my first pop-top.

Why don't I work on it and get it running?

a. he has no money for parts. (running a burnt 009)
b. he hasn't been reading the bentley/muir books I gave him.
c. he has no tools/work ethic.
d. the bus has been deteriorating under his stewardship

Just thought the list needed a good friday bus saga. Perhaps I'll update weekly with humorous anecdotes and "Davisms".

Later,

Billy
