Richard,

I called them at one time on the fact that the dwell seemed to be set 
high and I couldn't get it to change by moving it around.  They said that 
it would not make any difference and should be right where it was.

Something having to do with the way it works(electronically).


Never had any trouble either(type1 engine).

If it drives good and the timing is right on,....leave it!

Cheers, dave
