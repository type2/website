Take it to a local rebuilder and get an estimate.

A starter is a starter in principle. If you work on one starter you will be 
able to work on another.

Your starter may simply need brushes, or bushings, or something small like 
that which is $5-$10 type parts.

I've rebuild many starters for cheap, cheap, cheap never to have another 
problem.
