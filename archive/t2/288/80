This is reassuring although I have no idea what those folks at Ken's Buggy
Barn are talking about now.

After the good results from driving it around I was suspecting that the
ideal range of 49-51 was matched to the physical properties of the points
and that another value for the pertronix may not matter.

So the dwell varies based on tiny differences in manufacturing that unit?
Mine is around 53/54.

BTW, I found this very good article on how the kettering system works:
