Subject: GEX :-(

My friend Trey bought a pretty nice 1971 Westy with a rebuilt engine a few 
months back, and only told me of the engine being a GEX rebuild after the 
buy was finalized.
Well, he has struggled with this and that on the engine ever since, and now 
after only 4K miles on the engine has decided to break it down for a deep 
look-see.

The engine is a disaster.
It looks to be a classic example to confirm GEX stories that I have seen 
posted by others earlier.

The heads appear to have been weld repaired by a first week welding student.

More later,

Bob Perring
