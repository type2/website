This is one of the ten or so items I've been meaning to post that arrived in
our big European container. I know I promised a complete list but I just
haven't had time to put it together.  Will try to get to it ASAP.

This is the first I've been able to get the Hella ones in a very long time.
You don't have to rush to order them today - I would guess I have a few week
supply even if we get a huge rush on them.  But if I were you I would order
them soon, as they really are nicer quality, and I couldn't say how long the
next backorder might last. (Could be a few weeks, could be a year, or I
could never get them again; you never know with stuff like this.)  If you're
not sure if you need these, it's worth checking now, while nice replacements
are available. If you remove your tail lenses you can easily tell if your
present housings are crumbling. (If they're original it's very likely that
they are.)

The part number for these complete Hella assemblies is  211 945 241RK  and
they're $39.95 each.  They can be ordered online at
