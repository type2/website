Russ,

I'm assuming the original poster was thinking like me - in other words, thinking of a way to run the A/C with the engine off.  A 110V electric motor of sufficient size should be able to drive the compressor while parked (at a campground, with electricity say) if the mechanical problems could be eliminated (like how to easily switch the compressor drive over to the electric motor from the engine and vice versa).

But not for a mechanical device like an A/C compressor.  The inductive load of the  driving motor is not a concern since there is (presumably) plenty of power available for it (again, assuming 110V source).  Fortunately, electric motors make their maximum torque at or near 0 rpm and are thus well-suited to handle any startup requirements of the compressor, assuming they can also turn it at a reasonable rpm.

I think it's do-able, and some day I will make a serious effort to get it working.  I already acquired a 220V (oops) 3/4hp motor at a swap meet for experimentation, but I think it is likely too small.
