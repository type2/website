Subject: 78 Bus Trans problems, CV questions

Hi All,

Transmission and CV woes. Here goes:

First about the transmission.. My bus pops out of second under load (i.e. up a
hill, or trying to accelerate quickly). I'm thinking that my transmission is
toast, but I thought I would ask the list whether this could be anything in
the linkage, etc. I've noticed that I do not need to press down on the stick
to get it into reverse, so I am holding out a little hope. Please let me know
your opinions. If not, I am in the market for a good used trans for the '78. I
am in the Los Angeles area. If I can't get a good used one, I guess I should
get the Rancho rebuild from Bus Depot?

Next, CV joints.. One set of CV's (German) went bad after 6 months. Is anyone
aware of a plastic CV boot that is more durable than the rubber OEM?

I found this web site http://www.mecatech.com/products/index.htm which has a
neat boot you can stretch over the CV so you don't need to remove the CV to
put it on. (It's wild! look at the pictures. That must be the VW equivalent of
giving birth ;-) Anyway, I'm thinking of it more for the benefit that if the
material is that stretchy maybe it is longer lasting. Opinions?

Thanks much,

Mark
