You should be able to roll the engine over with a wrench to see if it is 
free. Do not have the ignition on of course.

I've had stuck starters to free up if I had the starter turned on with the 
key in the starter position and whacked it with a hammer at the same time.

Don't get run over!!! Tranny in neutral, E-brake on, helper with foot on 
brake pedal.

You may have a bad spot on the commutator.
