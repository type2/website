Yes and it is yours - where are you? Cost of postage.

It's going to be tough to send though - they are VERY thin. I give it a 1 
in 10 chance or arriving intact.

A glass shop (commercial grade - not the hardware store) can cut a 
duplicate and temper it for you for about the same cost as a used one sent 
to you I'll bet.
