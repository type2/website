Subject: Wanted: Rear bus cooling tin for 1600 dual port in a 70 bus,

Hello, does anyone have this piece of tin to sell me? The rear tin for a
1600 block with doghouse cooler, to fit to the firewall on my 70 bus? Also,
if anyone has one around and a digital camera, I'd appreciate a picture so I
can know what it looks like and whether I can fab something to replace it if
necessary with a sheet of heavy rubber or something similar. Any suggestions
welcomed.

Also, does anyone have a pair of dual manifolds to mount two 30mm stock
carbs to single port heads?     Tom
