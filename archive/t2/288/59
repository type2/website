Subject: 72 MSRP invioce-trade offer

Hello,

Posted this earier but didn't work so here goes again.

I have an original 1972 window sticker from an orange and white 
Westfalia.(VIN# 2322215480)  I would like to trade it for a 1978 Better 
Homes and Gardens ad "Home is where your bus is." A long shot I know.

Or if someone could send me a scan of this ad that would be great. I'll also 
send a photo of my window sticker to anyone interested.

Thanks,
Brandt
78 Sagegreen Westfalia (Vegas Bus)
79 Sagegreen Westfalia (Rusty Bus)
