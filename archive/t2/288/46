Chris:

Keeping your throttle wide open probably doesn't help; that's the technique
to use with a flooded engine when you want to give the engine more air to
burn the excess fuel.  A cold engine needs *more* fuel (i.e. a rich mixture)
to get itself started.

There's 3 devices explicitly involved in the "cold start" situation: the
thermo-time switch/cold start valve setup, the Temp Sensor I and the Temp
Sensor II.  These 3 things would be the first items to check.  Too, if you
have a vacuum leak somewhere the excess air it's providing can lean out your
mixture, causing hard starts in cold situations.
