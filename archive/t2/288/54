Subject: 72 Window Sticker trade offer

Hello list,

I have an original window sticker from a 1972 Westfalia bus VIN# 2322215480 
(importer's suggested retail price of $4423.50) The bus was orange and 
white, sold in Utah. Anyone on the list?

The sticker is in decent shape. I would be willing to trade it for the one 
page 1978 ad "Home is where your bus is" of a green Westfalia that I think 
appeared in Better Homes and Gardens. Or if anyone would scan the ad for me 
that would be great. I could also email a photo of the window sticker if 
anyone is interested.

Thanks a million,
Brandt
78 Sagegreen Westfalia (Vegas Bus)
79 Sagegreen Westfalia (Rusty Bus)
