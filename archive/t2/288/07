I have proof.  I put my bus on a chassis dyno and did pulls with and without the A/C on.  The difference was 1-2hp or about 1.5hp average.  BUT this also included the increased drag from the alternator so the compressor drag was probably close to 1hp.  The amount and type of refrigerant in the system will also make a difference - I was using 134a at the time.

I don't know that much about large electric motors, but if a 2hp motor really puts out 2hp, my personal opinion is that it would have no trouble turning a rotary compressor.  Just make sure the motor is rated for continuous duty.
