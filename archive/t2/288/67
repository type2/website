Subject: Mizer propane injection question 

Hello List,

I know this is part of a recurring thread. I tried to
find the answer in the archives but I couldn't. I have
see a propane injection system that is recently been
put on everyone's favorite auction sight that I am not
supposed to mention. This system is made to inject a
small ammount of propane in the air streem of a fi/
carb settup. The name of the system is "Mizer system".
It claims not be be a "Bullydog" or a "Powershot"
system. It is a system that claimes to increase MPG,
increase the octane level, and make the engine run
cooler. IT is listed for $250. If you go to Eb(-at-)ymotors
and type in propane, you will see it. Go there and
take a look at their product claims. For those that
know, does this system sound legimate? Will it really
lower the combustion temp/ head temps? Are these
claims realistic? I am eyeballing it for my 914 2L. I
would rater install a system that increased MPG,
decreased emmisions, and decreased temps rather than a
system that caused a gain in HP. I have already
figured out what tanks to use and the placement of
them if this system sounds feasibleexcluding the price
tag.I just wanted an opinion on this product. FYI, I
am not promoting this product nor do I have any
affilation with the seller. Thanks and have a great
day!
