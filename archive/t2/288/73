Subject: 82 Vanagon Oil Filler Grommet Source

Hi All:

I am looking for a source for the oil filler grommet, VW part #
070-119-953C for an 82 Vanagon air cooled 2.0L. This gormmet seals the
tin around the oil filler tube. Camelback VW original stated that this
was available, but when I order could not deliver so I believe it is no
longer available in the VW system. I have checked the usual sources (Bus
Depot, Bus Boys, CIP) but have had no luck. Any ideas?

Regards,
