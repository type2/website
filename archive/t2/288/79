I believe you have a 79 Cal version GE, correct?

This means you have the 039 905 205C electronic ignition dist, correct?

If this is the case, then you may have a couple of problems. This dist is a
dual vacuum unit dizzy. It times at 5 after WITH vacuum retard working and
connected.
1) Does the Dell carbs offer a manifold vacuum port to run retard?
2) Does the Dell carbs offer ported vacuum to run vacuum advance?
If you cannot answer yes to both, do NOT time it to factory specs. They do not
apply anymore.
If you do not have retard vacuum, time it at 7.5 BTDC.
If you do not have ported vacuum to go to the vacuum advance, still time it at
7.5 BTDC but you will have low power without vacuum advance.......
