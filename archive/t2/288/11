Subject: FW: [T2] More starter problems

Sounds likely,

Starters will burn out easily especially if they are old. Please be careful
trying to start your bus with a screwdriver under the bus. This is
dangerous, you could drive over yourself. You can pull the starter easily
and bench test it in a matter of minutes. We don't well parts for Vanagons
but MLI in Denver Probably does. 303-657-9690. These SR19X rebuilt starters
are not cheap ((-at-)$200.00). Good luck. Try whacking it with a wrench a little
that sometimes helps.
