Subject: Pmail about my Mini's?

Whoever sent me the p-mail in reply to my list comment about Mini's etc.
(you commented on my Fiat 500 and Mini's for sale, and were curious to see a
pic of my Innocenti):
I got the dreaded Windows "blue screen of death" immediately after reading
your message, and lost your name and message once it rebooted.
Not that there I had anything particularly exciting to say in reply; it's
just that I didn't want you to think I was rudely ignoring you...
