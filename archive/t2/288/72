How about having a second compressor and motor mounted under the rear seat
(in a Westy)? Wouldn't this be easier. A used Sanden (spelling?) rotary
compressor from a late Vanagon can be had cheap (I got one for around
$30), so mostly the installation would be the cost of the valves
(Granger), hose and the motor/compressor mounts. No reason to fool with
the stock setup. And given the space we lack, much easier to service the
belts and anything else.

Of course if you are in a camp with 110, then why not just have an AC that
you mount out of the window like Stan at
http://williamwareagency.com/forsale/stanvan/ac_unit.htm (warning lots of
pictures so slow).

Just my two cents worth.
