19 Volts?!?

Bad solenoid. When you apply 12v to it:
the coil builds a magnetic field and pulls the plunger towards the cable
posts. The plunger is mounted to a pivot that moves the drive towards the ring
gear. The other end of the plunger hits a spring-loaded disc that then
contacts the head of the upper battery cable bolt and the head of the bolt
going to the braided starter wire. Every time the disc make contact, lots of
amps pass thru this connection. This will eat away the heads of the bolts, eat
away the disc, and cause a build-up of corrosion.

This should be the wire going to the double relay to run the fuel pump when
the starter is engaged.

Replace the solenoid. [not a cylinoid :)]
