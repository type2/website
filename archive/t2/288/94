Hey, Ben, don't know if you noticed, but someone suggested dropping
the matter.

There's nothing wrong with complaining in a public forum.

Ron Salmon has kindly pointed out that if I was disappointed, that's
because I didn't read the fine print, just like I don't have a habit
of reading software EULA. My fault. End of matter.

On a more "amusing note", my engine swap would have been finished
today, if I had not forgotten the fan spacer. Now, I have to wait
until next weekend to pull the alternator, bracket and fan out again.
Grrrr.
