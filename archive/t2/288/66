Hello David,

This is exactly what I was considering doing. I am
going to my local vw junkyard where I know there is a
complete bus a/c settup. There I can look at how the
compressor is connected and if it has a belt
tensioning adjustment. In theroy, I was thinking to
modify the tension system so that when tensioned one
way, the belt to the engine would be tight and when
tensioned the other way, the belt from the electric
motor would be tight much like the belt driven systems
used in riding mowers. Thats just what is bouncing
around in my head. I would really have to study the
compressor mounting system to come up with any kind of
feasible modfication. Any how, thanks for your replies
to my post. I am learning alot. IT is much
appreciated.

Have a great day!
