Looks like a big job requiring yet another tool.

Guess I will seal things up and get moving on the other work.

I know where I can get an inspection pass for this vehicle anyways if
they see me trying and an oil leak is not an inspection issue.

I have to take off tin to get at the back of the fan to work it all off.

A friend made me the bentley style tool for the job.

Cheers,

Alan
