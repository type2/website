hmmmmmm haven't seen it but haven't looked at as many engine as you have
either

I am an engineer and I would have to disagree with you here, the hyd don't
slam against the seats the rattling is all in the lifter not on the
valves.  and to knock the seats loose you would have to be hitting them
the other way anyway so that trend probably has another cause.. I doubt
that any VW engine running normally could/would knock a seat loose.
especially if the seat has been seated properly.

(mine have heavy duty diesel engine valve seats and have all been peened
in place)
