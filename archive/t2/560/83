Subject: '78 Westfalia 

Would Like to sell my green '78 Westfalia.  It is complete, but does not run,
and needs lots of tlc.  Body is decent, small amounts of rust in usual places,
and windshield needs replaced.  This bus has been sitting since '96 or '97.  I
personally have had it for about a year, and just don't have time for it.
Make me an offer.  Anyone interested...please email me off-list.
Pete
