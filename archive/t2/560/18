you can see this in a hyd lifter engine too, have seen and noted it before
my rebuild.

who said anything about not "Looking" at it.

probably wouldn't know what I was looking at if I did, you build
thousands, I've built "1" engine...and had help at that

what would I do with 2,000 more RPM, don't max rev it now and with an auto
tranny it wouldn't know how to handle that many extra RPM.

> by 50 degrees with no other changes made to a n otherwise bone stock

??? is that head temp or oil temp or some other measurement.  my oil temps
stay below 230F on all but the hottest days and then I slow down until the
engine cools down to what temp I want. generally can cruise at 55-60 in
95+ temps, hotter than that and I tend to stay home in the A/C..and where
I live only a fool drives faster than 65MPH max.

I've heard nothing but good things about your engines.

cost/benefit,  do the benefits to me out weigh the costs, and that is a
case by case determination by the user.  the cost of valve adjustments in
my time and energy exceed the value gained IMO.  besides isn't a hyd
valves better than putting off adjusting a solid valve....which I
unfortuneatly would probably do because I hate the job so much.
