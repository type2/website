I am sure many would appreciate them, and I am always open to being
convinced I'm wrong.  wouldn't be the first time

I have other things I would rather be doing, like spending time with my
family.

what can you see (average person not skill machinist) looking at your
valves while adjusting that I cannot see with the hdy.  I do remove the
covers at least once a year and check for things loose etc.

I don't have a dyno, I have gone about 70,000 miles on this engine rebuild
and have not had to adjust the valves at all (except the one that broke)

cryogenic enhancement?????   don't got that.

no argument, and I have full set of guages and try to keep engine temp
consisitent and low...

but how many of us mere mortals have cryogenic treatment of parts (hmmm
what would doc tim say about non DM methods)  my hyd valve train has been
that stable.

what's wrong with the camshaft choice,. these are workhorse vehicles not
show cars, at least that is how they were designed anyway

I put a new cam in mine when rebuilt and it was stock
