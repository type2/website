Subject: RE: [T2] What is best program to make a website?

For a short time I had a business doing web design, so I learned at the 
beginning of the Internet Age. :)

If you have the bread, FrontPage is super easy.

If you want to learn code there's a wide vareity of apps. I personally use 
CoffeeCup HTML.

CoffeeCup also makes a pretty decent WYSIWYG (like FrontPage). Check them 
out at http://www.coffeecup.com . They have free trials of all their 
software.
