Hello to you all

You can always use Photoshop and Imageready if you want something easy....
Use Photoshop CS and imageready CS (version 8). They are really improved than
Version 7. You can at the same time, retouch your pictures, place text and
make butons really functional....
1- make the layout and retouch pictures in photoshop...
2- open the file in Imageready (comes with Photoshop) and you can make buttons
with rollovers (mouse in, mouse over, mouse click, etc....)
3- export images and html code and if you want you can import all in
Macromedia Dreamweaver.....
They have samples very usefull to leaarn....

This is one easy way that I teach to my students at the begining of a Web
design course.....
If you need any help, don't hesitate.....
