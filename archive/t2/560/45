Subject: RE: [T2] Synthetic gear oil okay?

Make sure that the oil is GL4. I'm suspicious about oils that are both
GL4 and GL5 rated. GL5 is corrosive to the brass synchronizers in the
transmission. Of course, I don't know how long it will take GL5 to eat
the sychronizers.

Redline makes a synthetic that's GL4

By the way Mobil 1 synthetic gear oil is GL5 and is not recommended for
VW trannies. Mobil told me that when I called their 800 number.

 Hi,

I am going to change my transmission fluid this weekend, just because I
do not know the history of when if ever it has been replaced. I looked
in the archives and it seems that others agree that it is a good idea to
change it, even if it is not stated in the Bentley to do so at regular
intervals. Do you all still agree? Is there anything I need to know or
helpful hints.

My main question is it okay to use Valvoline 80/90 synthetic gear oil?
What are GL#'s I see mentioned in the archive posts? Are there pros or
cons to synthetic gear oil?

Thanks

Meg
