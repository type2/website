I'm getting around 14mpg here, some surface street, some 60mph freeway 
driving.

My bus is a 1971 w/ 1776, mild cam, dual Kadrons and an SVDA 
distributor, set to 42 degrees (-at-) 3800rpm per instructions. I'm running 
points. I swear that before I began tinkering with this engine I clocked 
19mpg. At the moment I am in a deep funk about this. Gonna go over 
everything with a fine-toothed comb this weekend: valves, timing, look 
for carb leaks, AFM, and anything else I can get my little rodent paws on.
