but he was specific to the Valvoline

I talked to an engineer at Mobil and he said not to use it in a Bus
transmission as it is corrosive to yellow metal alloys.  I had used it with
good results (smoother shifting) in my 82 BMW R65.  However, I sold it
before I put many more miles on it so don't know about yellow metal
corrosion or even if the R65 tranny had them
