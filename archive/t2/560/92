I created BusDepot.com (the html and graphics, not the database or jsp
content) using Namo WebEditor. 

I also used Front Page recently, because the Quaker school that my 6
year old daughter goes to asked me to create a simple website for them
and this was the only software they had. If you go to
http://www.unitedfriendsschool.org/ you can see the result. This was a
"quick-and-dirty" job that I slapped together in about an hour, but it
gives you an idea of what you can create almost instantly if you're
familiar with Microsoft user interfaces and have an image editor such as
Photoshop. (Incidentally, the little girl pictured on the Summer Camp
page is my daughter.)  

Namo and Front Page have virtually identical "beginner-friendly"
interfaces, so if you can use one you can use either. And both are
Windows-only. Between the two I found Front Page to be more buggy,
slightly less intuitive, and lacking a few of the more advanced
capabilities that Namo has. On a few occasions Front Page mistranslated
the HTML and I had to manually edit the html tags to fix it. In fact on
the Friends School website you'll notice a few poorly aligned headers
and paragraphs resulting from Front Page's "so-so" automatic translation
to html.  But it was sufficient if not perfect. You could certainly
create a decent basic website with either product, but I think Namo is
the better WYSIWYG web editor.
