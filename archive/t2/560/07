So, if you didn't have the spring in the lifters, because they were solid,
you could say that you have NEVER had a problem with the van..

Those lifters are the worst thing that VW did to these engines. It was done
for ONE reason, and that was lack of sales because people were too lazy to
adjust their valves.

The lifters don't just cause lifter issues, they promote head issues and are
the root of all evil.

On my updated site I will plots of all the engines we have torn down, and
what failed in them since around 1996... wait till you see what engines
failed the worst, and with the same issues... The numbers are repetitive and
also amazing!

Then, no one will wonder what I base my opinion on concerning these lifters!

the lifter that failed was a broken spring in the lifter,, only problem I
have had with hyd lifters in the 12 years I've owned this van..
