Subject: Re: [T2] What is best program to make a website?

I use Fireworks to work with my images (adjust size color compression, very
very handy) and to make javascripts, and Dreamweaver.  You can see my pages
here:

On this page, I use javascript mouseovers that I created with Fireworks to
make this page work:

These software programs aver very good.  I use both PC and MAC versions.
