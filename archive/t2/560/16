the older Subaru's had a similar problem, my Father in laws rattled like
crazy when first started up, probably for the same reason, a flat engine
design

probably a bunch, but if the lifter doesn't quiet down pretty quick you
check, besides mine is a daily driver, rarely have much rattle as it
doesn't get to sit too long

I don't particularly mind fiddling one piece at a time, just hate having
to do over something I had already done..  and I agree that driving a 20+
year old car can sometimes be an adventure, had my share.
