The instructions that John (aircooled.net) e-mailed me about the SVDA 
timing say,
      <begin quote>
"To verify the correct operation of the SVDA, the timing should be

A) 7.5 at idle
B) 32 Total Advance (hose disconnected)(-at-) 3500 RPM.
C) 42-45 Total Advance (hose connected)(-at-) 3500 RPM.

If the A and B timing settings vary, go with the B setting (at 3500 RPM) 
to set your timing. Full centrifugal advance is more important then the 
idle timing."
     <end quote>

By "AFM" I meant air-fuel mixture -- tweaking the mixture screws on the 
carbs. Sorry -- did I use "AFM" incorrectly?

I could use a pointer to a bunch of pictures of what spark plugs should 
look like when the mixture is correct. Is there such a thing on the web?
