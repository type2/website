Years ago I read about gasoline vapor induction systems/manifolds that
were patented in the early part of the 20th century...when cars were
just getting going.

I bought copies of patent applications/blueprints of some of these and
the idea is basically to use exhaust heat and vacuum to vaporize gas
in a manifold so that when the valve opens much less gas has much more
surface area and is combusted more fully.

The results are touted as higher horsepower and much higher mileage.

I think some of these designs were bought up by Ford and others and
never manufactured.  Some reasoning said they weren't safe because of
the proximity of gas vapor to ignition sources external of the engine.
 
Anyone looked into this?  My 2.0L is FI so it probably wouldn't work
but I'm wondering about converting a traditionally carberated engine.

$2.00+/gal is too much.
