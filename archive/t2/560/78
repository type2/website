Subject: PST Spring Campout this weekend in GA

At the bus show in Charlotte this past weekend a couple of people
asked me if Peach State Transporters were still having campouts
because I have not been posting info about them to the bus lists
for a while...

Well, we are and as a matter of fact our next campout just happens
to be this weekend.  The campout is being held at the Flint River
Outdoor Center near Thomaston, GA.  There will be canoeing and
kayaking on Saturday and the river should be nice & swift due to
all the recent rain, but hopefully not near flooding stage as it was
last year (where a 4hr float only took about an hour & a half!).

I'll get there Friday night after work and anyone else that wants to
join us is welcome.  If you want more information about
the Flint River Outdoor Center, their website is
at 
<http://www.flintriverfun.com/home.htm>http://www.flintriverfun.com/home.htm .
We usually camp on the east side of the river in
the riverside campsites.

I look forward to seeing everyone that can make
it there May 21-23.
