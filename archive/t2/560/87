Subject: RE: [T2] What is best program to make a website?

I used to design websites for a corporation and we used FrontPage for little
while, then we finally switched over to Dreamweaver, which is far better. The
learning curve on Dreamweaver is a little larger, but well worth it. FrontPage
is easy to use for beginners though. I use Dreamweaver for my person site.
Dreamweaver has a fully functional free demo on their site. Macromedia.com
