Subject: Re: gasoline vapor induction? was water injection & Re:Strange

I just found this reference to a vehicle built by Greenpeace:

http://www.earthisland.org/eijournal/new_articles.cfm?articleID=313&journalID=50

| Frustrated by the auto industry's failure to produce more than a 10 percent increase in fuel efficiency over the past quarter century, Greenpeace London [ (44) 171 865-8100] issued a challenge. Last August, it debuted its own car, the Twingo SmILE (Small, Intelligent, Light, Efficient), a two-cylinder, four-stroke, 360cc gasoline-powered car that gets 75-88 mpg.

I then found greenpeace's actual pages on this at:

they made some suspension and tire changes and exchanged the 4
cylinder for a supercharged 2 cylinder....not terribly advanced stuff.

From their specs doing a metric conversion
I get....3.3 L/100 km + .87 U.S. gals/62.14 miles or
71.43 miles/1 gal....(it's late here...please don't abuse me if my
math is wrong).
