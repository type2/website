Subject: Re: [T2] Hydraulic lifters - mistake to replace?

I think it is almost funny that these lifters are called "hydraulic
lifters".  They are a terrible design.  What other vehicle can you let sit
for a few days and then the lifter rattles like crazy for a while until it
was pumped up.  I wonder how many owners of these vw's drove a vehicle with
a more substantial problem only to think it was a noisy lifter.

At least in my experiences, hydraulic lifters were not an adjust once and
walk away kinda deal.  Still needed checked now and then..occasionally one
lifter would clatter and i would either pull that lifter and pump it, or set
lash to zero or .006 for a while to pump it back up and then
readjust..................

I have worked on at least a dozen vans with hydraulic lifters in the last
few years.......NONE of them had the lifters adjusted right, folks had
swapped if systems, carbs, jets, etc to try to get them to run right and it
was right under the valve cover............the first thing you adjust when
tuning any aircooled vw in my opinion.

In the few motors i have built, i must say the hydraulic cams really take a
beating.  They wear out a lot quicker than one would think i suppose due to
that constant pressure, or over tension depending on how they were adjusted.

I drive the aircooled cars because i do not mind fiddling with
them...........one piece at a time.  To think that i can not and drive a 20+
year old car is not realistic, regardless of the condition of the car.
