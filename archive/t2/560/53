I think you are on the right track by checking everything, but if you
have one of the SVDA's from aircooled.net I was told to time them
vacuum hooked up at 7.5 degrees BTDC, what instructions did you time
these to?

also you shouldn't have an AFM w/ carbs, this might be your problem
(hehe). BTW what do the plugs look like? do you think you might have
the kads setup way to rich?
