I have an original screw jack and it works fine.  In fact, it one of the
easiest jacks I've used.  One thing that is important is to keep the jack
screw greased, as it can cause trouble if it dries out.

A real sticking point with old buses is the jack points.  They are prone
to rust or to damage done by the bus rolling when it is jacked up.  You
absolutely have to block the opposite wheel whenever jacking up a corner
of the bus!  The jack is not made to stop fore-aft motion!
