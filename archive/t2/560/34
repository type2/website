Subject: RE: [T2] Hydraulic lifters - mistake to r... 

Bob,

I want to thank you. The last go around on this "evil subject" I was 
convinced that I would never use those "heathen lifters" (oops I meant 
Hydraulic). Minister Raby had convinced me that never was I to use those. 
Now I have changed my mind again. I would like to compare the engine tear 
down information, to be posted later, to the engines that Chris(aka 
Vanagonman) has had to fix, to the PO history of abuse, to look at one thing 
in particular:

Were the Valves adjusted correctly, periodically checked, ever given second 
thought, before they FUBARed the CAM?


Jake,

I would like to thank you and look foward to your update. You have made me 
rethink my future engine build over and have provided some serious debates 
to going stock. Currently I live in Mooreville, NC "Race City USA" aka 
Nascar Capitol of the World. I do not claim that I am in any way shape or 
form and advocate of Nascar. I have seen enough left turns in my life that I 
would rather not watch someone else do it really fast over and over and over 
again. Around here they may not know what a right turn is but engines and 
"cryogenics" they do. I started checking with some of the local race shops 
and the concensous is that everthing tested has had amasing results. They 
even do Golf Clubs here.


I would imagine that you both believe that the following is true:

Anything worth doing is worth doing right.

Thanks,

Michael Knight
