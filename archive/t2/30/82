Jake, Doc, list:
Doc Ric really had 2 questions here, compression ratio being the main one.
What is really important is that the c/r not be set too high. Opinion varies and
expected gasoline quality would determine this (though recent drive reports from
Mexico indicate this is less of a problem than it used to be).
The maximum c/r would be somewhere in the 7.5/1 area and if you are close,
better make sure you are accurate. Many would prefer a number more like 6.9-7.0.

I  am of the belief that higher compression is free power, but of course it
comes at the slight cost of shorter engine life.
A few minutes spent with your machinist and you can either have him cc your
heads or explain how.
Second  was your statement about balancing. You really need to balance the rods
end for end (IOW even out all the big end weights and all the small end weights
and then recheck the big ends). Many years ago I worked in a high performance
machine shop and balanced many rods. They use a special rig with rollers and a
counter balance, but I'm sure you could rig up something with knife blades and a
gram (dealers') scale.
Balancing the reciprocating parts (pistons and rods)  only will give you the
best return on investment, if you are on a tight budget. I'd guess a shop would
do it for about $50 or so.
Higher quality pistons like Mahles and NPR's were almost always perfect from the
factory.
