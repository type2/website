Check your clutch cable, if its not that then there will be tons of info on
shifting problems in the list archives.

I own a 1972 bus and it doesnt want to shift while im driving but it goes
into gear pretty well when parked and shut off. sometimes when i get it into
reverse it gets stuck in gear and when i push the clutch in all the way it
is still in reverse and moving until i turn the key off. is this a clutch or
transmission problem and how could i check to make sure. any help is greatly
appreciated
thanx brayn
