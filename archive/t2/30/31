Subject: Junk Yards OBX NC

Hello.

May I ask, are there any 'junk yards' or private stashes along the Outer 
Banks, North Carolina?

I expect to be cruising there this weekend, with a brief stop over at 
Williamsburg VA and/or Virginia Beach VA.

Last Xmas I did spot a mini yard behind a repair shop along the road, but 
there MUST be a few more hidden spots out there.

Thanks.
