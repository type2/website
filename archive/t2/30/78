What, you mean you will tear it down and do it later??? Should always be
verified. Deck heights should be matched. Combustion chambers should be
matched for volume. Good money spent to have your machinist do this.

Most certainly. Also, the rods should be balanced end to end and total
weight. I would also spent the money for the machinist to do this. Also,
the crank and flywheel should be independantly balanced, then bolted
together and finish balanced as a unit. If all this is done right, that
motor will idle and run so smooth it will put a smile on your face every
time you fire it up for the next 100k, assuming maintenance by inspection.
And balance as well the valve springs, meaning their pressures at both
installed height and at lift height.

Balance = harmony = efficientcy = longevity = best cost per mile,
regardless the cost, which is value. Leave all this out and what you have
is GEX. It will cost only some 10% more in time/money to have a balanced
assembly. This is pays off bigtime in results.
