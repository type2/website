Yup denser is better as far as the intake charge is concerned. But if a carb
isnt provided with some heat and a center mounted carb on an aircooled would
not get much on its own, the venturi of the carb would make the air so cold
that it would 'ice' up. I'll leave the gory details to George, but think
Bertolli principle, in fact it dosnt have to be really cold, a cool humid
day would do it.
