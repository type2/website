The 009 has a reasonable advance curve for the earlier T-I motors, however,
it simply will not work decently with the T-IV, which needs a wider curve.
Buy a stock distributor and you will get your money back in better
drivability, better gas milage and the motor will last longer. In this
case, cheap does not mean inexpensive.
