I argue with the doc as much as anyone, but I had this done to my 2liter
when it was rebuilt and I can vouch for his observation,  however it is a

costs, I think VW allowed 9 grams out before a rebuild and 4-5 grams at
rebuild...I found that a good compromise from perfectly on$$$$ and way off
was at 1gram, so I had my pieces and entire assembly balanced at
1gram..(didn't do the flywheel because I don't have one (auto
tranny) added about $100 to the cost of the job
