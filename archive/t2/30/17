Hi Volks,

There's a carabus being planned as a fall colours tour of the "Backbone of
Ontario" that I thought might be of interest to some type2 members. There
are six buses attending, and more are welcome.  We're starting at
Rattlesnake Point Conservation area at 8:30 AM, weather permitting. With the
leaves in full autumn glory up here, it should be a good trip, and the
scenery and small towns on the route will make for some great pictures.

The "Backbone of Ontario" is actually the Niagara Escarpment, it runs from
Niagara Falls all the way up the Bruce Peninsula to Tobermorey. Bring a CB
radio or Walky-talky if you have one, the Carabus will be communicating on
channel 14. 

Let Jamie or I know via P-Mail if you're interested or want more details.
Check http://www.hrca.on.ca/rattle.html for more details on where we're
meeting, and a look at the scenery and colours to look forward to.

Happy trails,

I am pretty busy at this time of year,, But I thought it would be cool to
drive
the Vw for a small tour of Southern Ontario

I plan on starting at Rattlesnake lookout, small entry cost
http://www.hrca.on.ca/rattle.html
as they open at 08:30

Then driving along the Niagara Escarpment, catching some scenery etc.
It seems to work great if you pack a lunch that can be eaten while driving,
or a
short stop to prepare it co-ordinated with a pee break or gas stop ,, or
both

We might make it as far away from the start as Wiarton, or Collingwood,,,

Some folks might take the tour, then scream home for the night,, some might
decide to campout,, or what ever.

I would plan on cooking dinner at a campsite, a campfire,, some BS'n,, and
talk
about sunday's plan... breakfast,, and make it home for lunch via the scenic
route

So.. If your up for a impromptu country drive,, along some secondary roads,,
I
am purposely going to avoid the traverses up and down the actual escarpment
this
time! .....
Let me know that you plan on coming

If you have a map of ontario,, look at the Bruce trail, and see if there are
any
points of interest along the way you might want to see or do!

weather permitting,, I am not going if it is raining
