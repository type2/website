Yep,in fact the engine was so hard to get to that when
Rod(the previous owner) bought it it was running on 3
cylinders because the army guys couldn't get to
sparkplug no.3.
It came from an Engineers Battalion & some of the guys
there had hidden it in their stores & they used it as
a golf cart:-)
Fortunately for me, only a few months after Rod had
the engine rebuilt his father had to hand in his
licence because of old age & he also gained another
car from another relative.
Basically he had 4 cars & only needed 2.
He had to take his fathers car to stop him from
driving & the bus had cancer around the windscreen so
it went off to the dump stripped of the all the decent
parts,& believe me...there's a heap of them.
It's sad that there was no one interested in taking
the entire vehicle off his hands at the time.
The engine actually has only done 40,000kms(25,000
miles) when the bus went to scrap so although it's
been lying idle for a couple of years it should run
well.

Yuk!
I don't want to imagine either what it looked like or
the repair bill.
I hope you didn't encounter an insurance company that
sees the word "write-off" stamped all over any car
more than 5 years old.
