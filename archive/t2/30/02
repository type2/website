Good question, personally I would not adjust the lifters if all I did was 
tubes, unless I also replaced lifters and push rods. "oil vice air" means 
there is air in the lifters instead of oil. After the engine is started the 
lifters fill with oil as the air bleeds out of the lifters. "Vice" is a word 
used in place of "in place of" or instead. Sorry for the confusion with words.
