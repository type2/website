Hello List!  

I'm new here, have been lurking for about a week.  My Volkswagen affliction 
is obviously out of control, I now have 4!  The new ones are both 82 
Westfalias, one was a theft recovery and is pretty beat up and the other had 
a fire in the engine compartment.  I own two water-cooled vanagons so this 
will be something new for me. So I will have lots of questions in the coming 
months. 

My first question is; should I stay with the stock engine or are there any 
viable engine conversions?  A mechanic I know says 82s are plagued with 
problems and are difficult to make pass the smog check required here in 
California.  (but he doesn't like my water-cooled vans either)!  I would 
appreciate any comments you might have on this.

TIA & Peace!

Loretta
