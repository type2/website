Anyway the engine developed an oil leak on the left side and the oil light began to flash on and off.  Basically, I figured that destroying the camshaft cracked my engine block.  =(

don't assume this is true...very likely the damage is far less

GET A NEW MECHANIC.  anyone making that kind of offer without taking a
good look at the engine is someone I don't want touching my engine.

yes it "MAY" work if the engines are of the same type.

what I did when I needed to get my van on the road while fixing my main
engine.
  I hit the junkyards until I found a usable engine, nursed it along until
I could get my main engine rebuilt 

DON'T be conned by glitzy ads in the VW magazines most of them especially
GEX are not worth wasting your money on.

good luck
