You are darn right the cables get hot when you are
continuously cranking your bus. I put my Vortex sealed
battery in my 74 bus and tried in vain to start it. I
didn't realize that the ground strap was touching the
side of the battery case and the strap melted a hole
right through the sealed case of my battery. That
battery is now dead as a door-nail. I am just glad it
was still under warranty. I might try and replace
these cables with somthing like you mentioned. Good
Idea! Well, I just thougth I would give my $0.015
worth.
