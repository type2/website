Subject: timing: static vs......

Just a quick question:

   I'm somewhat new to VW's and have managed to learn and revive my Westy 
(Automopadamus) back to great (NO incredible) health on my own with help 
from here and other sources. I remember someone giving me advice on setting 
the timing earlier this year. I remember him saying, "you want 32 degrees 
advance.." Well, after getting to know my bus inside and out, that's just 
not possible with the 009 and having a setting of 7.5 BTDC. At that setting 
the 009 only goes to 28 degrees. So, I've always had 7.5 BTDC static timing.
    Today I got to thinking about the advice given to me earlier in the 
year. "Set the timing at 32 degrees at full advance...." I know if I do 
this, the static timing goes to 11 ish.
   I figure if anyone knows, someone has to know here. What's everyone elses 
take on this???


Thanks,
  Carl   '73 Westy
  Automopadamus
   Port Townsend, WA.
