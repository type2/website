Subject: ? on my 71 Westy

To the list, 


 Thank you to all this a great resource

I just bought a 71 Westy to replace my 72 (-at-) 3K+ to rebuild it was time to go 
back to a the 71. This is my 4th bus over the 28 yr. but I have some 
questions on this one.

Does anyone know if Westfalia (in 71) put out a camper with the spare mounted 
on the front?  This one that I have has a bumper type trier mount for the 
spare. The mattress in the back covers the well for the trier, it looks to be 
a stock Westy upholstery job.

It also has two cover of sheet metal that run the outboard sides of the 
middle of the bus center is not cover. This is something I have not seen 
before, any feedback on this one.

As far as I can tell it was bought in Southern, CA and has not left the 
state. I cannot find a bite of rust anywhere, that more than I can say for 
the 72.
