Hmmm...the real choice here is between oxyacetylene fusion welding and
brazing, since most brazing is done with oxyacetylene as heat. I have a
feeling you don't have access to a MIG or TIG setup, and you definitely
don't want to try this with a stick welder.

If your neighbor's real good at sheet-metal welding, I'd go that way.
