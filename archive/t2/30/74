Subject: I need equivalent color for 71 Westy [Chianti Red]

Hello,

I just bought a 71 westy with pretty much original equipments in it and I
love it!!!

The paint inside is almost like new and out side needs painting. I went to
http://www.wolfsburgwest.com/colors/7172bus.htm and it lists Chianti Red
only red color for that year. I went to local paintshop and they could not
pull that particular color out of their computer system because the original
is lacquer based and California no longer allows lacquer based paints. So, I
am desperate trying to find out what the formula for that original color is
or at least the most similar color to Chianti Red. Does anyone have any
idea? For now, I went to the paintshop and had a swatch brought out and
found a similar color as the original paint inside, but I have a worry that
the inside color, after 30 years, may not show the true original color and I
might end up with totally different color bus. I am painting two tone, red
bottom and pastel white top... Your help will be greatly appreciated. My
email is nyblues99(-at-)yahoo.com.

Thanks!!!
