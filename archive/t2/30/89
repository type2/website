Subject: Re: [T2] snow and ice....

Hi Carl,

Here in Aspen, where we have snow and ice for several months a year, I've 
found a few things which may help:

1. Good tires -- I had a crappy set of passenger tires (wrong load range) on 
my 79 Westy, and while I was able to go okay on flat roads, hills were too 
much for them.  I got a set of LT off-road tires, and there was little I 
couldn't get thru.  In addition, I found that the Bus will slide, but it 
will slide very predictably.  No additional weight in front is necessary.

2. Set your carb for altitude -- If you set it for 5,000 feet it will run a 
little rich above that (8k here in Aspen), and a little lean below that.  
However, if you set it for sea level, it will run WAY too rich (unusable) up 
here.  Also, it will run WAY too lean at sea level if it's set for altitude. 
  It's probably best to run 2 different carbs and change them partway on 
your way.

3. Good heat -- It can only get so good with and aircooled engine, but you 
can supplement it with a catalytic heater, an electric heater, or lots of 
blankets.  Make sure your seals are good to avoid drafts.

4. Good engine cooling -- It's not as critical in the winter, but 
high-altitude air is less dense and therefore less efficient at cooling.  
I've regularly seen 250+ oil temps on long climbs (maybe that's why my 
engine needs rebuilding now...), so I expect your engine wil run a little 
hotter.

That's about all I can think of for now.  Good luck finding a place to go, 
and perhaps we'll see you on the slopes!

Take care,
Jason
