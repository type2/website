Subject: shifting problem

I own a 1972 bus and it doesnt want to shift while im driving but it goes 
into gear pretty well when parked and shut off. sometimes when i get it into 
reverse it gets stuck in gear and when i push the clutch in all the way it 
is still in reverse and moving until i turn the key off. is this a clutch or 
transmission problem and how could i check to make sure. any help is greatly 
appreciated
thanx brayn
