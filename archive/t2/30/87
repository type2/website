If anybody has anything else for buses and campers they are going to throw
it out just because they don't have room to store it... I have a big empty
storage building here in Charlotte, NC!!!!

I would also like to thank Karl von Salzen for the free things he has given
me for my bus. He is truly generous and I would love to be able to give
spare parts away for free too (if I had any)!!

Volks,
I need to make space in the garage so everything must go and go fast.  I
have a 1800 type IV engine that Im giving away.  The engine is basically in
boxes but everything is there.  All the engine tin, hardware etc.  The
engine has a single carb and the smog pump assesmbly is long gone.  I think
the motor is out of a 74.  The valve seats look bad but the heads look
pretty decent and probably are salvageable or at least good for a core.
Heat exchangers are in great shape.

Please let me know if your interested and we can set up a time to meet up.
I also still have my 78 Westfalia project bus for sale for only $500
bucks!!!  Excellent body.  No serious rust.  Motor has had recent service
but is currently not running.  Hate to sell but need money fast!  Please
pass the word.  several have shown interest but nobody has passed over the
green so its up for grabs.  Dont miss out!

Thanks,
Chad

78 Champange Edition
78 Westy Deluxe (for sale $500)
