IMHO, MIG is the only way to go.  Regular gas welding, as well as brazing,
puts way too much heat into the metal, and you can pretty much count on it
warping and making a big mess of things.  I would also be concerned about
the longevity of a brazed repair in the area you are talking about, due to
vibration and stress, and the fact that you are talking about a butt joint
with no overlap.  You are going to have to remove all of the flammmable
material (window channels, glass, etc.) in this area before welding, no
matter which method is used.  Most auto body shops have MIG equipment and
could do the welding for you. You could save $ by removing and re-installing
the the window channels & such.
