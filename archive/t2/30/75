Subject: 71 Westy needs a lot of power on brakes...is it the brake servo problem?

Hi,

I have 71 Westy and the brake pedal needs a lot of pressure. I've driven
many type 1 over the years, but this is my first bus, and it certainly
requires more pressure than the type 1. The seller told me the bus needs a
lot of pressure on the brake and that is normal. The seller did not know too
much about the bus and I am now thinking maybe something is wrong with the
brake servo. I checked out the price for rebuild servo and it is around
$250. Is there brake servo rebuild kit I can buy and work on it? Also, do
you think the problem is the brake servo or maybe something else?

Thanks!
