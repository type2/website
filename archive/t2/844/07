Hi Chad,

Could be a bad ground from the transmission to the chassis. Might  
also be a bad ignition switch.

Check both of the above before you risk another starter.


Happy trails,

a split second that is. She immediatley dies with a slight electrical  
pop
sound towrds the end but not a bad pop . Then No lights, nothing. I  
check the
fuses they are fine. I think battery must off come loose or  
something. So I
jump out check the connections seem fine I tighten them up a little  
still no
lights. So I check the fuses with a test light no power to the fuse  
box mmmmmm
so I decided to clen the terminals and make sure they were good and
connecting. Finally get lights. I am thinking oh yeah I am headed  
home now.
Jump in and turn the switch nothing. Lights come on but no starter.  
So I jump
out and try using the jumper wire I have so I can start the bus from  
the rear
its just attached to the starter and I keep a wire nut on it. I touch  
it to
the battery and it sounds like the starter gear is spinning but not  
popping
out. So I decide to give the starter a whack. hewn I did this the  
starter
started whirling around again and it wouldnt quit. So I disconected the
ground. When I reconnected it it didnt do anything. So I tried the  
key nothing
but when I tried the wire it did the same thing. Wouldnt quit till I  
got the
ground off. So I am guessing my starter died and that was the pop I  
heard and
the battery might have caused the short to begin with..... I already  
have a
starter and I am gonna go out there tomorrow after work and replace it.
Anybody have any different ideas on what it could be.....
