I second the motion for keeping Tommy Chong from Splitty to Bay Buses.

I really like the character he plays on That 70's Show (Have you seen  
the great VW Buses on that show!)...funny stuff!

This is even more funny...our organic grocer looks exactly like Tommy  
Chong, only with shorter hair.

Crazy world!
