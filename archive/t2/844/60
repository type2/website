Just as a warning, Webasto has a terrible site that offers really lousy
information.

For the Webasto BueHeat Air Top 2000, around $1700 installed by my local
Dodge dealer and $1250 for the raw unit. They produce 7000 btu/h at full and
3100 btu/h on low setting and best of all only burn .06 gal/h at full and
.03 gal/h of fuel at low! More than enough to heat a Typ2.

I found one company online that is selling the AirTop 2000 for $836 as a
diesel model but I am pretty sure they are interchangeable. I am sure they
would honor that price for a gas model.

powered)

Below is an interesting story on the engine pre-heaters and their positive
effect on pollution!

My brother is installing one in his 06 Dodge Mega Cab Cummins to preheat his
engine and cab. I am going to try and follow  that install closely, despite
the fact it is in a Diesel and he will probably have the dealer install it
for him.
