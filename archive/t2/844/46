Thank you George.

This brings me right back to my original question:  Why doesn't anybody make 
a repro steering unit for our early bays?  They could even update it from a 
peg to a roller.  I assume VW upgraded the box for reliability.

No, the later box uses different mounting holes and the "neck" is larger,
so it won't fit on an early Bay.  This has been discussed before and the
consensus is that modifying to allow use of a later box is prohibative.

Makes me be very gentle to my existing box!
