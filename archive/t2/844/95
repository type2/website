Tom,

Time the engine based on the distributor, not the stock engine spec. 5
deg ATDC would be appropriate for a dual vacuum distributor with both
advance and retard vacuum.

When I'm using an 009 (single carb 34PICT3 on a 1600dp) I time it at
about 32 degrees BTDC at 3000rpm.

You could upgrade to a single vacuum advance distributor, but only if
your carb has the correct vacuum porting - which is why the 009's are
popular - because a lot of those non-stock carbs have different (or
no) vacuum porting.

Unfortunately, due to the nature of the beast, the flat spot is there to
stay.

Of course any of the list vets will correct me if I'm wrong.

peace
jules
