I didn't do any math.  I realize the alternator does not turn as 
fast as the stock one, but at 3,800rpm on the freeway (where I 
spend the vast majority of my time in the bus) it has plenty of 
rpm to put out close to the rated 90 amps.  The voltage drops at 
idle but I really don't care about that.

Also, it is not a smog pump setup but an aftermarket A/C pulley 
setup for a Porsche 912.  The outer drive pully is significantly 
larger in diameter than the bus smog pump pulley.
