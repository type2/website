Subject: Re: [T2] TRW Steering Box

Just what George Lyle said - mounting holes and neck, et al.  Some
modification would be needed.  I've seen three Bays with the 73-later box.
Didn't say it would be pretty or easy.

And as to why VW never upgraded the internals to the better worm and roller
for the 68-72 Bay - it's called money and there isn't really a big enough
market (5 years plus attrition) to tool up and make.  The 73-79
undercarriage was at the same time redesigned a bit beefier for the 5MPH
Bumper/Crash Specs and I imagine the box design was redone to accomodate.
Planned obsolesence is what my late father called it.

Doug Hufnagel, the owner/founder of Bus Boys seriously looked at reproducing
the box over a decade ago and after finding out the costs of casting the
housing, casting and machining the internals was gonna run into several
hundred thousand bucks, it was prudently decided to spend several thousand
to cast, machine and harden brand new pegs for their rebuilding program.
That's the wink link in these boxes and after a few 100K on many Bay
Windows, the most cost effective.  Wormshafts are the next wink link, but
they can be usually remachined in a cost effective manner to work almost as
good as new.  Good cores are the challenge as these beasts are getting
older.
