Subject: Fuel filler elbow (or, I hate Type IV AFC engines)

Yet another reason why I prefer splitties/early Bays (or, diesel
Vanagons):

On our 77 Westy, how in the heck to I gain access to the fuel filler
elbow?

I have a bad feeling it involves pulling off the charcoal canister, air
cleaner, and whatever else to remove the access panel.

Yes, I should buy a Bentley for this Bus.
