Subject: Re: [T2] Things that stink

So I got off work today and walked out to the bus and got started. Got the
starter out and the new one in in less than 20 minutes.   Thats a record for
me. Took the battery to get tested. The local FLAPS said its fine and even
gave it a charge for me. Get back to the bus install the battery and
nothing. I get red and green lights when I turn the key but when I go to
start her nothing.  Nothing at all. The lights don't dim no clicks nothing
no change. So I jump out and use the trusty wire and touch it to the + side
of the battery and she comes to life fine.... So what now? I don't think its
the switch cause it works fine turning the ignition system on. The last
switch I had go out wouldn't even do that. So what do ya ll think. Maybe a
bad starter still. I have had brand spanking new parts be bad straight out
the box before. Maybe the switch but how do I test that? I guess its time to
pull out the idiots guide and the Bentley and start reading.
