Subject: Re: [T2] 72' bus 1700 distributor and carb set up

Hey Thomas. I have a '72 bus that had the same carb-dizzy combo. There
is a vaccuum port on the rear (RIR) of the carb. Ift should havea
little rubber nipple of some kind on it. It provides a weak vaccuum
signal, but it does send one. I got a SVDA from aircooled.net before
busdepot.com started selling them. I don't know what the difference is
between the BD and ACN versions, though Richard Atwell has some dizzy
advance curve charts on his website (ratwell.com) that might help you.
Beyond the 009 flat-spot issue, you may have additional problems from a
lack or preheated air entering the air cleaner. One last thing, from
the emails and research I did, I found that when the carb and dizzy are
changed, often times the thermostat and cooling flaps are pulled out
too. They were pulled out of mine.

Nice to be back on the list. Hapy was garaged in the Fall, but he's
gonna be a daily-driver again as soon as I sell my Jetta. It'll be nice
to pilot the bus again.

The engine has been changed from the dual carbs to a single progressive
Weber (model unknown) and a 009 distributor with electronic ignition in
it (all changes done before I got the thing). I have been looking thru
the achieves and can't seem to find and answer to a simple flat spot
question for this engine. 
Since the dual carbs are gone, what distributor do I need to fix this.
Does it need to be vacuum advanced? Is the carb set up for a vacuum
(don't remember a port for it off the top of my head)?
