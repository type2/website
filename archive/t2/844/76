Anyone seen the movie trailer for the upcoming Pixar movie, "Cars"?  It
includes a sleepy Type II bus next to a jeep.  The bus tells the jeep that
the traffic light they are both at blinks slower each time...  The jeeps
response, "the 60's weren't very good to you were they?"  It appears that
the bus may have a good roll in this film.
