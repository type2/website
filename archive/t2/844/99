Hi volks,

Here's a new question on the same theme....

How many HP does it consume to spin a higher-rated alternator? Is  
there a known Amp-per-HP ratio???

A basic rule of physics tells me that there's no such thing as a free  
lunch. So what's it do to throttle response when you add an extra 20A  
of elctrical capacity?

Happy trails,
