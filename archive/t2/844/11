Subject: And speaking of alternators...

Has anyone had one rewound by a shop to output more than the stock 55/70
amps? 

How high can one go in the stock casting?

Has anyone *CLEANLY* mounted a higher output alternator from another
vehicle in the stock location?

Dual batteries, too much stereo, 1.5Farad cap, plans for carputer. Twisted
minds want to know.
