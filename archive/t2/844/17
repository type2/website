It's been a few years since I replace mine on my 75
bus, but it wasn't as bad as I expected it to be.  I
had written it up at the time (it was before I had a
digital camera so I didn't include any pictures), so
it is probably in the archives somewhere, along with
other folks' renditions of the process.
