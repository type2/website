Subject: propex heater progress, was: Re: [T2]  bn4, bn6

webasto sounds real nice.  isn't it a little more expensive than the 
propex solution?  in hindsight it might have been easier for me to go 
that route than the hard way since my bus didn't originally have a 
propane tank.

A year ago, I bought a propex heatsource 1800EX propane furnace from 
Karl Mullendore for something like $630--I think the price has gone up 
since then due to exchange rate fluctuation.  I am just now getting all 
the pieces together on the install.  this is on an early bay so I had to 
cut off a side belly pan (sawzall) and install a later model propane 
tank (thanks Tedebare).  finally got the sandblasted and painted tank 
hung yesterday.  today I installed an aux fusebox in the rear-facing 
seat base where the propex is roughed in.  (also wired up an amp and sub 
so finally have some philzone over the road din). 

Looking for a good source for a dual-stage regulator that can be 
adjusted to 37 mbar (~14" W.C.).

I plan to wire the aux fusebox to run on either main or aux battery 
power.  does anybody have any suggestions (or links) on wiring the aux 
battery relay (I have the Bosch kit but lost the instructions).  is an 
isolator recommended or would the relay be sufficient.  if you have the 
know-how I would appreciate any advice.

I am looking forward to having heat, although I don't need it in Georgia 
most of the time, I probably will need it in the high sierras where I'm 
moving next month.
