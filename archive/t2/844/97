Subject: The mystery Single Cab

My buddy is looking at a really nice single cab. A 71 to be exact. However
it has wide-5 wheels and drum brakes!

I inspected the booster plate on the beam and it appears as though nothing
has ever been bolted to it.

Was there a drum brake option? Was this a special model? It was built in
11/70 which places it squarely in the 71 production range.

Mystery Mystery...
