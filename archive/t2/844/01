Subject: Re: [T2] BA6 in a Baywindow

ok ok ok, I was wrong.

sorry.

MY 76 didnt come with one (any) and the BA6 that I bought was off of a 
Vanagon.

Maybe that made it a little more tricky, im not sure.

I know that my current Vanagon has a BA6 and its awesome.

I don't know how I lived without one and fraknly, I wouldn't get back in a 
baywindow again unless I found one with it already installed and working. 
(im a wuss, and drive my van year round. yes, even when I lived in 
Minneapolis.)
