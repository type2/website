Actually "Worm & Peg" Steering Boxes are what was originally installed on
the 68-72 Bay Window.  You can use the 73-79 Worm & Roller, but a bit of
modifying is needed I believe.  Upgrading to the later Pittman Arm is one
thing you have to do (the output shaft is larger).

Check with Walter at Bus Boys.  I believe they were the only ones to offer
new 73-79 boxes, but that was awhile back.  Or get a fresh rebuilt from
them.
