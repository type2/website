Our 76 started (pardon to pun) to be difficult to start ie. had to  
put really put
pressure on the key to get it to fire the starter.  Stripped the  
column down,
pulled the switch out, dismantled the electrical switch, cleaned all  
the contacts,
reassembled the electrical switch, put everything back together & she  
starts
fine again with no pressure required on the key.
It is the original switch/key cylinder, but I don't know how many kms  
is on her.
