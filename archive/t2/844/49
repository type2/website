I'm not convinced that alternator will hold up in that location.  
Air in 
that region is being strongly sucked into the main fan, which is 
why I 
think VW chose to feed the air into the stock alt from the rear 
and out 
the front (of the alternator).  I chose to do this instead:

Not as clean but I'm fairly certain it won't overheat.
