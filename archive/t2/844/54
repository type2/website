If you'll look at the fan on both your installation and the one on shoptalk
you may note that it is twisted so that when spinning clockwise it draws
air through the alternator, from the rear to the front. It's not trying to
"steal air" from the cooling fan intake and is, in fact, assisted by the
motor cooling fan being nearby.

If one already has the A/C setup and pully an install like yours would be
best. If not...

Also, I noted something else in your pictures. Are you running that
alternator as a separate unit for the aux battery alone? If not (if it is
now your only source of charging) why do you still have the belt on the
original alternator? That's just a HP thief if it isn't being used.
