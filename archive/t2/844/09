Subject: Battery light  woes | Continued

 	Well, I just got done installing a new Bosch rebuilt 55amp
alternator along with the new (but incorrectly sized) alternator cooling
boot.  For now I have just gooped up some silicon around the boot until I
figure out something more permanent.  Enough of it fits that it should be ok
for the time being.  Looks like we probably don't have the larger, later
model one to work with anymore :(
	In any case, no love on the battery light still.  I have checked the
battery light and it's ok.  I am getting about 12.3 volts at the battery
throughout the rpm range, including idle.  With a new alternator now in
place (something I wanted to have done anyhow) and a voltage regulator that
is good, I'll be pulling every charging-system related wire off in the next
day or so and cleaning them.
	We'll see how it goes.....
