If all you need is glass - any commercial glass place can cut glass to
size and send it off to be tempered. I replaced all of my flat glass
with tinted glass (tinting is in the glass as opposed to tinting film on
the inside of the glass).

On the other hand, you might be able to buy a used window unit for spare
parts.... Check with Busted Bus...
