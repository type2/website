	The third alternator is a rebuilt Bosch 50 amp.  This is as good as
it gets right when it comes to stock yes?  I got this one from Busted Bus so
I could go and pick it up locally.
	Yes, this is the vehicle that had the battery which switched
polarity.  It wasn't because I hooked up the jumpers backwards though.

I missed the part about where he got the 3 alternators from.

Where did they come from?

Is this the vehicle that had the battery reverse
direction?
