Subject: Finally installing Konis and Hankooks, one question

Listees, it's been a loooong time since I put the KYBs on 
"Gottdammerung," my '74 Riviera, and I'm trying to mount the Koni's I 
got from Ron.
But I find the mounting ends of the Koni shocks are wider than the KYBs 
leaving a shorter length of the lower bolt to fasten the nut.
Problem is that there seems to be a shoulder on the steering knuckle or 
lower bolt (or it's a spacer put on when the KYBs were mounted and now 
rusted in place) decreasing the length of the bolt available for the 
nut. Anyone have recent exposure to this or know if there is a shoulder 
on that lower bolt?

Thanks from the humid South!
