Richard,

Just went to a campout a couple of weekends ago in the bus...carrying
4 people and gear....two of the people were.....large.....

We got to taling about it as it was *up* a lot of hills and I had
to downshift a lot.  The last 5 miles were done on dirt roads at about 
20mph.

We figured we were at close to 1200-1500 lbs of people/stuff....and that 
was before I remembered that the A/C system alone probably added another
200 lbs.

I drove it to work twice after that and then filled up.

Gas mileage was 18.5mpg...I was thrilled cause I had really pushed it up 
and down the hills going and coming....and yes, I had the petal to the 
metal. Guys, I have *never* babied a VW engine...I have rebuilt waaaay too 
many of them.  I just took a T1 engine apart that I rebuilt in 1996.  I 
had about 56,000 *very* abused hard miles on it and it really did look 
good....except for the cam gear that got loose...1,000 miles after I 
turboed it.

When I checked my leak down, it wasn't bad at all...less than 1% or so, 
but my compression seemed really bad, therefore, my conclusion that the
CR on the heads was really low.

Cheers, dave

  Compression numbers were in the low 120's iirc. I did a leak down test on it
  one day and every cylinder had a poor seal. I told the owner it would never
  get average bus mileage until it was rebuilt properly. I couldn't tell how
  good the ring seal was because so much air was escaping thru the valves.

  So, I wonder what kind of compression ratio that George ended up with?
