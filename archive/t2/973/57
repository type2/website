Subject: What size fuel line?

It's time to replace my fuel line.  Last time I used US sizes because I didn't
know any better.  I have a 73 bus with  dual Weber 34 ICT carbs.  I also have
an Eberspacher BN4 and I'm wondering what size line I need for that.

Bus Depot carries 5mm and 7mm sizes and I think this is what I need.  I can
find this locally as well.  I was looking at R. Atwell's pages and he had
measured 5.5 and 7mm on a 72 bus.  Would 5mm be close enough?

Also, what fuel filters would I need to accommodate metric sizes?

One last question:  While I'm playing with the hoses, is there any way to
adpat the stock 73 air filter to fit on the shorter 34 ICT w/ shorter intake
manifolds?  I prefer this setup as it allows me to hook my PCV hose, etc.

Thanks for the help.
