This lower level of efficiency is a common problem with budget rebuilds.

I saw a rebuild from another budget rebuilder (JCS) and it only got  
12mpg at 1300 miles after installation. The rebuilder assured the  
owner the numbers would improve as the engine broke in but they  
didn't. After a lot of expensive to install CDI etc the mileage only  
improved to 14mpg.

Compression numbers were in the low 120's iirc. I did a leak down  
test on it one day and every cylinder had a poor seal. I told the  
owner it would never get average bus mileage until it was rebuilt  
properly. I couldn't tell how good the ring seal was because so much  
air was escaping thru the valves.

Dave, what is the gas mileage with your engine?

I think they are following Boston Bob's advice:

http://www.bostonengine.com/articles/todaysfuels.html

"So how do we prevent overheating? Never put the gas pedal to the  
metal on the hills,  especially on those hot summer days. Lowering  
the compression ratio is essential!  Without doing this the engine  
will easily be pushed to the point of pre-ignition.  Always running  
the best octane fuel is necessary as well".

I've seen them as low as 110psi before first run. If you load up a  
cylinder with oil just like you find after assembly but before firing  
you should see abnormally high readings but when they are this low to  
begin with, the engine will never run as well as the factory build did.
