Subject: RE: [T2] oil pressure?

As a FYI:

On Type 1 engines (68-71) oil pressure becomes a problem if you are running
a remote external full-flow oil filter. You have to install a thermostat
bypass valve so the oil pressure won't blow the oil filter seal or blow the
oil filter apart (as me how I know). The oil is too thick at low temps and
the thermostat opens up after 170 degrees allowing the oil to circulate.
