I think that you're being a bit overcautious here.  Yes, if you are in the
backcountry you might have a hike, but the normal park roads are
well-travelled and patrolled.

Wintertime is a definite must.  My wife and I went there in summer on a
motorcycle and just about cooked even though we were out of the valley by
10:00AM!
