Yeah, and what's a couple of ft-lbs between friends?

 There are valid uses for them, but I wish to slap in my $.02 
on whether they're needed for fastening road wheels.

 .They're disc brakes.  I claim it follows that the things the 
pads squeeze are discs.  I might go so far as to allow 'disks', but 
that's all the different terms needed for them.

 To cite a figure e.g 94 ft-lb is typical German thoroughness. 
Out here in the real Kiwi world, and I suspect nearly all the real 
world, if the threads are lubricated to minimise spurious friction, 
just tighten the nuts with a typical leverage such as will probably 
be used by whoever has to undo those nuts.  I slap on a small gob of 
graphite grease.  Remember it may be not yourself but your wife who 
has to loosen them on a dark night in the rain instead of being 
unable to loosen them and having to call for help.
 Tightening to an even torque, in "opposite" pairs, in at 
least 2 rounds of tightening, will do, won't it?
