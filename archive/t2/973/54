Are you talking about "torque sticks" that are used with an impact wrench?
If so, they aren't really to be trusted.  They aren't all that accurate to
begin with and, since each impact wrench is different, the torque sticks
have to be specifically designed for the impact wrench.  Use the wrong set
of sticks and the torque value will be way off.

George  <--who just stands 6" down the handle of the wrench to torque his
wheels.
