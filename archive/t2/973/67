Subject: Kingman to Laughlin, then up to Death Valley??

My wife and I will be heading west along old Route 66 then up to Laughlin and have never done this trip before. We'll be in our new Mazda 3 Sport, and I have some questions.

1) Where have people stayed in Laughlin that was reasonably priced (up to 90 bucks a night) that was nice?

2) After leaving there we'd like to drive through Death Valley on our way back North to B.C. Can someone suggest a Death Valley route and a place to stay after Death Valley that is in a northerly or north-west direction generally? One of the small towns? Any specific hotels or motels that are good? We don't know which roads to take out of Death Valley, perhaps the 190 out to Keeler or Lone Pine with a suitable hotel??

Any help would be most appreciated, I kind of like to have a destination lined up for the end of each day, instead of playing hotel-motel roulette.

Many thanks in advance,
Courtney
