hey guys  we saw this a bunch with the bosch points that had the white  
rubbing block . 01 011 part number  I have been using the bosch points 01  030 that 
have the brown rubbing block and the black and white lead wire. these  points 
have a stronger spring also. For what it is worth these are the points of  
choice for the formula vee racers as there isn't anything worse than not  
finishing a race caused by cheap points or anything else cheap for that matter  
breaking  .These same guys will rev their motors up to 6800 rpm when  running wide 
open down the straight .  later  mark  d
