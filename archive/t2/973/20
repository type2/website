My odometer hasn't worked since I bought the bus seven or eight years ago.  So you're better off than me!  Cheers...KR

I have the same observation with the speedometer as well with the same tire.
However, my odometer is 2 tenths of a mile short when I test at check post
along side the interstate.  That is only an observation never tested beyond a
casual glance at the odometer.  When you are in a bus and going uphill and see
one of those radar signs and you are able to make the speed limit it is cause
for a smile.
