You do NOT need to replace the rear studs. ALL you
need are 20 alloy wheel nuts.

The bay studs are the same as Vanagon studs.

 I have 10 Vanagon OEM studs for the rears.
 
 I have been told the correct procedure is to "press
 out" the existing studs
 and then fit in the Vanagon OEM studs, which will
 accomodate the Alloys.
  The owner of the tire store was not too familiar
 with the process.  I
 couldn't find any description in the archives, other
 than the need for the
 longer studs on the back and that the fronts would
 be OK.
 
 Can anyone describe the process so I can relate it
 to the garage and watch
 over my bus?  How much torque on the studs/nuts for
 Vanagon Alloys on a
 Baywindow Westy?
