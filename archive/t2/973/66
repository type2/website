The Federal model owners manuals also give 75mph as the max but the  
actual maximum would be around 100mph if you multiply 5400rpm * tire  
height / gear ratio etc.

Given that error amount, I know I can still push my bus past the end  
of the speedo on a long steep downhill which again is greater than  
75mph in the owner's manual.
