	The assumption that a speedo's error is always in the one 
direction apparently need not be always correct.  I can readily 
believe Peter's figures, because an engineering prof cobber of mine, 
and myself, both found that our good specimens of the Nissan C20 
Vanette 1500cc would indicate 90 mph (no wind, genuine flat).  We 
never had an independent way of checking this  -  hard to engage help 
of police radar for such a purpose on a public highway, and no GPS 
'speedos' in those days  -  but we could not believe this admittedly 
excellent pushrod 9:1 motor could push that box thru the air at quite 
that rate.
	 I don't know how Nissan arranged this, but that model did 
appear to 'stretch' fast at the high end, while being if anything 
slightly slow down around 30 mi/h.
	This 'stretching at high speeds' method of hype is more 
subtle than the Chrysler stunt c.1951  -  simply mark the speedo 
boldly up to 180 mph to insinuate that the car can do something like 
that speed.
