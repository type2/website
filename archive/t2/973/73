Subject: oil pressure?

Hi, I have a question again. In the mornings when I start my '77 westy 
the oil pressure is at 70 PSI. After about 5 min. it goes down to 60 PSI 
and once it's warmed up it stays at 55 PSI (at around 3000rpm) at idle 
(once it's warm) it stays at 25 PSI. Is 70 PSI too high? If it is what 
can be done to correct it?
Thanks in advance!
Bernie,
Fort Langley, B.C.
