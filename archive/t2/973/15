They are AVP heads, an undetermined no. of miles ~ 180K on vehicle when I got it. I had the heads rebuilt 3K miles ago, one new valve installed, new seats were not installed at that time.  So... I don't know too much. There could have been issues before I got it, the seats may have been pressed with inadequate interference fit.  I did drive it up to Calgary from San Diego (1600 miles) before I rebuilt the engine, with out any engine troubles (no gauges at the time).

I do not drive the Van hard, 60-65 on flat highway, no wind, is fast enough. I had it in second gear going through the Rockies a few times trying to be gentle and humble.

But how many miles were on those heads? What do you know about them?
