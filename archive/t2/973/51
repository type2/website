Subject: Re: [T2] tires/speedo

If my speedo is accurate, my stock '79 Cali. emissioned  kombi can achieve
around 90 mph. on the flats. I know this can't be, because the computer cuts
out the ignition at a pre-determined RPM thereby limiting the speed to,
according to the owner's manual, 75 mph.

Here in Alameda, the speed limit on almost every street is 25mph, and there
is an over-abundance of those active speed limit signs that display your
speed. At the radar speed of 25 mph my speedo reports 29 mph. I have stock
wheels and the correct tire, worn to about 20% of remaining tread. I think
my speedo is highly optimistic.

I'll soon be switching to a 15" wheel and tire combo, and at that time will
have the speedo calibrated and report back to the list.
