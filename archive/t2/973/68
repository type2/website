Can someone suggest a Death Valley route and a place to stay after Death Valley that is in a northerly or north-west direction generally? One of the small towns? Any specific hotels or motels that are good? We don't know which roads to take out of Death Valley, perhaps the 190 out to Keeler or Lone Pine with a suitable hotel??

my suggestion for Death Valley is to give yourself a full day, come in
from the South thru the town of Shoshone on route 178..
  drive North on the only road thru Death Valley North to the Grapevine
Ranger station turning NE on route 267 via "Scottys Castle" to NV route
and then North to either Goldfield or Tonopah where there are places to
stay. make sure to have a full tank of gas leaeving Shoshone.  take your
time and enjoy the Valley
