I've always heeded the advice that lubricating the threads either a) makes it too easy to over torque the nuts making it more difficult to remove them later or b) help to loosen them while driving.

I've removed wheels for a couple of new cars and the threads were also dry.

Once I found a decent "gorilla" wrench, I can easily undo 94.ft.lbs now.
