Subject: RE: [T2] tires/speedo

Yeah, I've got another speedometer I got out of a donor bus.  But haven't taken the time to put it in.  I would like to know how many miles the bus has on it.  Odometer says 85,000 and change.  I bet it's over 300k in reality. 

Say, what model Jetta's were the retractable seat belts a bolt in replacement for a late bay?  I've got to get on that.  Thanks....KR
