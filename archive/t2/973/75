Subject: Re: [T2] oil pressure?

what oil weight?  what are the ambient temps outside in the mornings?
i may have missed previous emails,  is the engine stock?  without
knowing the oil in the engine and temps i don't know if this normal.
of course i'm still a novice.  during the winter last year w/ temps
near freezing i don't recall seeing pressure quite that high.  might
have been close though.  i was running mobil 1 15w50 syn.
