If your rebuild happens to have an AMC head, then you'll get this  
step cut which was machined at factory in Spain. If you get a VW head  
then you don't get the step cut unless the previous rebuilder had  
done it. And then it's entirely possible to get an engine with one of  
each head like Dave Bolen's AVP engine.
