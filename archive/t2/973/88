Hi Mike,

I met a guy at a bus campout who kept a grease pencil on the  
dashboard to write the odometer numbers on the windshield at every  
fill-up and oil change. Seemed like a good idea at the time.

I used the pencil-and-paper method for about a year and a half; the  
gauge just wasn't working well on the bottom half of the tank. I  
changed the sender three times and it never got better.  A logbook  
worked great until the speedo cable broke in Erie PA on the way to  
EB2003. Then I had to start measuring distances on road maps and to  
plan gas stops for the remaining 650 miles of the trip. (Jamie Rivers  
recommends using a wrist watch... fill up every 3 hours and you have  
nothing to worry about.

Mark Dearing brought a spare cable to EveryBus for me and I was in  
better shape on the return trip. At EB2004 I bought a replacement  
gauge at the swap meet and since then there hasn't been a problem.

Happy Trails,
