Hi Bill -

Sorry, won't be getting up to St Louis way on this trip, too much crazy and
wet weather on the way back to So Cal.  Wanted to get up into Illinois and
Kansas City, MO to see friends, etc., but got tired of swimming on the
interstate by the time I got to Paducah, KY last night ;-)  Why don't you
folks send some of this damn moisture to So Cal - we're only 13 inches
behind out there and Grifffith Park is burning up ;-)

Had rain for the first two days (Fri/Sat) of Circle Yer Wagens in
Sevierville, TN, but that didn't keep a HUGE crowd away this year.  Got to
see Ted Finesman and several other Vanagon/Type2/VintageBus List Members.

Coming to you live from a campground in Carthage, MO tonight (the first
decent Wi-Fi signal in several days).......
