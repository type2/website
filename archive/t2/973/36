Subject: Vanagon Alloys on a Bay

I got word today my order of Continental Vancos is in!  Ready to mount them
on Vanagon Alloys, then on the '79 Aardvark and head out to Buses by the
Beach next week!

I have 10 Vanagon OEM studs for the rears.

I have been told the correct procedure is to "press out" the existing studs
and then fit in the Vanagon OEM studs, which will accomodate the Alloys.
 The owner of the tire store was not too familiar with the process.  I
couldn't find any description in the archives, other than the need for the
longer studs on the back and that the fronts would be OK.

Can anyone describe the process so I can relate it to the garage and watch
over my bus?  How much torque on the studs/nuts for Vanagon Alloys on a
Baywindow Westy?

Thanks for any info.
