Martin,

No, because when I had the CHT wired up and laying in the seat for a test 
and ran 75mph down the interstate on a 95 degree day at 75mph, it never 
ran over 350.....and that up and down interstate type hills whereis the 
camping trip had some steeper hills.

The day we did the camping drive , it was near 75(absolutely gorgeous 
spring day) so I wasn't worried about it.

In other VW's that I own(Type 1 engines) that are fully instrumented, I 
can barely get the oil temps up to 180 unless I run 4,000 rpm for a long 
while, or the air temps are over about 90F....wups...unless it is the 
turboed 68 bug...you get on boost enough times, it will get warmed up 
rather well...but temps come right back down when you are not on boost.

Cheers, dave
