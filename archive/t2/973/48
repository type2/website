	I assume the 'retractable' is what Kiwis call 'inertial'  -
universal on new vehicles for the past decade or so.  The belt will
reel out at slow rates, but locks up when jerked.  Sounds very
 >attractive ...

Robert,

I believe you kiwis have the advantage of being able to purchase 
"webbing grabber" inertia reel seatbelts not available (aftermarket) 
to mere Aussies. These have the advantages of inertia reel belts but 
do not let out as much belt in a collision. Check out the following:

dogandlemon.com/media/Safety%20PDF/A%20Tragic%20Lack%20of%20Restraint.pdf

"If webbing-grabbers are so effective,
why doesn't the government make
them compulsory when older cars'
seatbelts wear out? In New Zealand,
that's exactly what has happened;
webbing-grabber seatbelts are a compulsory
upgrade for many vehicles
when the existing belts fail the national
Warrant of Fitness safety check."

Cheers,

Martin.
