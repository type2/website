Can someone suggest a Death Valley route and a place to stay after Death Valley that is in a northerly or north-west direction generally? One of the small towns? Any specific hotels or motels that are good? We don't know which roads to take out of Death Valley, perhaps the 190 out to Keeler or Lone Pine with a suitable hotel??

My preference would be to go east to Beatty and then north on US95.  You
can stay in Beatty or up the road in Goldfield or Tonopah.  Goldfield and
Tonopah are both turn-of-the-century mining towns.  Between Death Valley
and Beatty you can also visit the ghosts towns of Bullfrog and Rhyolite.

This part of Nevada is a far cry from the Vegas and Reno glitz.  You'll
see a bit of neon, but the primary attraction of this route is the
magnificent desolation.  If you want to camp, just pull a reasonable
distance away from the road and camp!

The other advantage of this route over the route up US395 is that you
avoid four high mountain passes.
