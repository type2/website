This is a big job for the average tire store. The hub has to come off which means removal of the castle nut at the back (253 ft.lbs).

The old studs would have to be pressed out of the hub and the new ones pressed in. The studs have tapered splines on them to hold them in place.

The lug nuts for the steel wheels get 123 ft.lbs. in the rear. It seem like a lot but that's what Bentley says.

For the alloys with the cone shaped lug nuts isn't the torque much less? 80-90 ft. lbs that someone can confirm?
