Subject: Air ratchet

I broke down and did the right thing yesterday -- got a six hp 
compressor at Sears. It came with some tools, most of which I can't 
imagine ever using (like an air hammer). But I wondered if there's 
anything on a bus for which an air ratchet would ever be appropriate? 
Anyone use one of these regularly?
