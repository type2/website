Subject: New busser introducing himself and vacuum advance

Hello VWers,
I recently bought a 1971 bus and have been monitoring that list and related 
activities for quite some time. This is a terrific ressource ! Thanks all.

I bought the van at Thanksgiving in Minnesota. It took my wife and I 62 
hours total to bring it home : southern california. After 2360 miles through 
some snow, lots of sidewind and 10 states crossed we made it. Cruising speed 
was ~60mph on the speedo. Overall mileage : 19.7mpg.

Anyway... I observed that there is no vacuum advance on my distributor, even 
though the stock 1600cc dp from 1971 is supposed to have vacuum advanced 
timing.

What kind of loss/benefit can be expected from this ? I have seen several 
1600 engines (thanks ebay) that seen to not have vacuum lines connected to 
the distributor. Is that due to poorely educated repairman or is there no 
benifit to vacuum advance ? Can the advance timing be added to the 
distrubutor or do I need to purchase a new one ?

My engine runs well at highway speed, I guess it is around 3500rpm. It 
hesitates a lot and has little power in the lower rpms.  I was wondering if 
these things are in relation.
