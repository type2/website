Subject: relay revisited

I went to RS and got a generic (cheap, 4-pole) relay so that I can get 
enough juice to my horn(s).  Right now the air horn is hooked up and it 
WORKS.  I will get a splittie dimmer switch from BD so that I can 
switch between the stock horn and the air horn.  The stock horn quit 
working and so I took it out and adjusted it on the bench per Bentley 
and it worked great, but it would not work when wired back into the 
bus.  It turns out that the horn wires were getting just under 12 
volts, hence the relay.

Thanks to all that replied with suggestions.
