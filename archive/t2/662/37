13.5 at idle with no load is OK (after a short rev to excite the alternator
if your light doesn't go out as soon as you start the vehicle -- that was
another thread here).

It SHOULD be 13.8 at idle.

You should NOT have to rev the engine to get it to 13.5.

When revving you should see a bit over 14 volts As high as around 14.5.

It should never drop below 12.8 even with a load. Especially not with just
the headlights. With headlights, radio, AND wipers you could drop below
charging voltage, but that's the only time it should happen.

I would suspect a weak alternator here. Possibly a bad VR but that would be
a "neat" failure in an electronic VR. An electro-mechanical one might fail
in a "provide one volt less than I should" fashion.

Before digging through the wiring I would see if someone in the area has a
spare alternator/VR in their parts bucket you could swap in for a one day
test. It'll take a few hours but tracing all the lighting related wiring
could take days.
