Connie,

Hmmm....maybe think of it this way...

A pretty bus the won't move on it's own power, or an ugly bus that can go 
anywhere.....

My wife and I have had this discussion...cosmetics generally comes last 
for me!

This is one ofthose situation where I *would* baby the engine...no 70mph 
in that one, just cruise along where it sounds and feels right(and you 
feel comfortable).


Cheers, dave
