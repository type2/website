Subject: Re: [T2] Headlight Switch or wiring causing Power Drain

Have you tried swapping bulbs? Maybe remove both headlight bulbs and
see if you still get the drain?

Also check the side marker lights and taillights. The wiring back
there is really exposed and there could be corrosion on the contacts
causing it to act as a resistor.
