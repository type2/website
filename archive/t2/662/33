Jason,


Pleeeease go back thru the archives and look at the discussion on battery 
cables.  If ya want it to last "forever", then do *not* get the leaded 
type cables, but the newer "lighter" clamp type...just go look at any 
"modern" car to see what I mean.

I have one on my negative side(with *two* ground connections tothe frame) 
and one on the positive side....they cost a little more, but I guarantee 
they are worth it!

Cheers, dave
