I would tend to agree with, especially the part about having the 
conversations archived.

This has to be the case!  I think IRC would be quite easy and yes it 
works on any platform, but it requires the Richard be there to answer 
the question's most of the time.  In an effort to let Richard answer 
questions durinng the time of his choosing, I wonder if maybe an online 
forum would not be easier.  This way no one would miss out simply 
because they were not present during the IRC conversation.  I would be 
more than happy to donate my time and setup/manage/archive an online 
board if we think this is the way to go.
