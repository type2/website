That would be their colortune product. You screw it in and watch the flame
color on their special glow plug.

This is going to offend the people that own the Gunson CO tester but they
are total junk in my opinion. Searching the archives:

It is possible to get it to "work" but the chance of your tuning effort
resulting in a smog pass is no where guaranteed.

The problem with these units are twofold:

- the technology is unsound. Similar type used in the Heathkit units on eBay
that disappoint everyone who buys one. See this directory listing for more
info on how they work:

- when sniffing the exhaust, the pulses at idle suck in the outside air and
lean out the reading. The car maybe in perfect tune but will show
excessively lean. At higher rpms the unit is in danger of damage.

The money would be better spent on shop labor of putting it towards accurate
equipment. I don't own a Gunson but after watching someone use it on a D-Jet
914 and doing some research I decided it was a dud given how well an FI bus
keeps it's idle mixture setting.

For $350 you can tune like the pros (although at this price point, HC and
NOx readings are still out of reach):

I was lucky enough to get the bung welded in for free. This section is
stainless steel, so we used a stainless bung and rod. I have no idea how
much a muffler shop would charge for this service.

For this particular application this u-bend is about the only saving grace
of the 75-78 US exhaust setup.
