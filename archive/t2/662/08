Subject: Chat about Richard Atwell's restoration 

Note: Richard hasn't agreed to this yet, but he seems persuadable.

As anyone who has spent time leafing through pages of Richard Atwell's 
website knows (www.ratwell.com), he has documented his restoration in 
great photographic detail. It may be the best photographically detailed 
restoration there has ever been or that there ever will be. 
Unfortunately, the wealth of detail only begets questions. How did he 
do this? How did he do that? How did he get from the rusty-looking hub 
in one picture to the shiny hub in the next?

I've proposed to Richard that we do an online question-and-answer 
session during which anyone with questions can put them to Richard and 
he'll answer them. When it's all done, he can edit the whole thing 
around the corners and post it as an FAQ addendum to his site.

When I proposed this, Richard started talking irc channel chat, which 
came out "blah, blah, blah" when I read it. But I'm willing to learn. I 
thought maybe we could just do it on the list (couldn't cost any more 
bandwidth than the perennial "what kind of oil do you use?" thread).

So who's interested in doing this? And can you handle irc chat? Or does 
going that route exclude too many people?

Moderators? What's your pleasure?
