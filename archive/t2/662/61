I don't think so. While staring at this situation I ran a tap down one 
of the rockers that felt a little tight, and I don't even own a M9 tap. 
It was an M10 -- unless I am going quietly insane.

There may be M9 swivel foot adjusters out there, but I am attracted to 
the simplicity of the Gene Berg type, which requires no modification 
(grinding) of the rocker arm.
