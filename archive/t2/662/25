Subject: Headlight Switch or wiring causing Power Drain

As it turns out, neither my battery, not my Alternaor or regulator are
bad.  I had the battery tested at Advance and it tested good.  Then they
wheeled out the machine for the alternator and it tested good at 13.5
volts *until* I turned on the headlights.  Then, there was a setady
voltage decline, immediatley to 12.5 and varying there for the few minutes
that it was tested.

That leads me to think it is either the headlight switch, or, the wiring
to the headlights.

Does anybody have any ideas on what to test first?  Should I try swapping
the headlight switch from my 78 to the 73 to see if that corrects the
problem?  Should I look for dosey wiring?

Anybody have any ideas?

Thanks,
