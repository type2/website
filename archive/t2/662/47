Subject: how long will my motor likely last  then?

Since the milage talk I've been wondering when I would
have to pop for a new motor.  I have a 79 automatic
Champagn Westy from California which had an engine
rebuild about 121,000 miles ago.  I've since put a ton
of money into new ball joints, starter, gear shift
innards, fuel lines (of course), tranny rebuild,
shocks, throttle cable, etc. etc.  all done by my
local mechanics.  It's my daily driver and I travel up
and down Vancouver Island every two weeks over a
couple of minor mountains keeping speeds between 50
and 60 mph (except on the Alberni Mountain where I
can't get above 20mph).  

I need a paint job and a new tent top but am afraid to
go for it in case I'm going to need a motor rebuild
instead.  

I would welcome any information/wisdom re how much I
can expect from this motor.  I've only owned "Muriel"
for  a year and a half so I can't say if it's the
original motor.  
Thanks and I love everyone here!
