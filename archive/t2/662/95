Subject: Hard Starting - Update 4

Hi Folks,

Having a semi-reliable Bus as one's only transportation makes the 
repair-maintain-restore equation much harder: you can't take parts off your 
Bus to bring down to the FLAPS when your Bus is running, and you can't take 
your Bus to get parts when it's not running.  Fortunately, there's a FLAPS I 
can ride my bicycle to...

Anyway, I replaced the battery cable with a fresh one, after 3 tries at 
getting the right length.  It turned the starter much better, until the 
starter or the ignition switch or the hot-start relay stuck and the starter 
kept running.  Key off, starter still running, getting slower.  Ran back and 
whacked the glowing-red ground-side clamp off the battery.  Let everything 
cool down, went inside, had a cup of tea.  Yikes!

Went back out and replaced the old/crusty ground-side clamp with a new 
spare; hooked up the battery; Zero volts.  Unhooked the battery, checked 
hot-start relay underneath the Bus.  Eureka!  The hot-start relay terminals 
were green with corrosion, and the plastic case was heat-deformed.

Since the engine was cold (and the hot-start relay not as necessary), I took 
the relay out of the system, got a jump from my roommate's car, and got the 
engine running -- until I took the jumper cables off, then it died.  After 
that, it cranked very slowly, and never fired again.  With the jumper cables 
unhooked, the voltmeter still showed 0 volts.

So, I probably killed the battery with the stuck relay.  I'll try a new 
relay and a well-charged battery and see what luck I have.
