Subject: Re: [T2] Air ratchet

I use mine occasionally. It's a trade-off between setup time and the
time you save doing it with a manual ratchet. Also have to consider
accessability of the nuts and bolts you are working on. I found it
helped immensely on CV joints. Anything repetitive like that where you
have several of the same size you need to pull quickly. For next
spring I'm going to put my compressor in one of the dog houses the
previous resident left behind so it is always ready to use.

 I broke down and did the right thing yesterday -- got a six hp
 compressor at Sears. It came with some tools, most of which I can't
 imagine ever using (like an air hammer). But I wondered if there's
 anything on a bus for which an air ratchet would ever be appropriate?
 Anyone use one of these regularly?
