Subject: Re: [T2] Chat about Richard Atwell's restoration

I think that as long as we post questions here, Richard can answer
them, they'll be in the archives, and he can add more info to the FAQ
as he sees repeated questions.

Richard: The time you spend documenting your work and answering
questions both here and at The Samba must be insane. You can't have
any time to actually DRIVE your bus! ;-)

Thanks!
