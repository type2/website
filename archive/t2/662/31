Subject: Hard Starting - Update 3

Hi Folks,

The Hard Starting saga continues!  This morning it was rainy and 50 degrees, 
so I went out and tried to fire up the Bus, and it started on the first try! 
  The last 5 mornings I've tried, the air temp has been below 50 (sometimes 
as low as 25F), and the engine has been sluggish to start.

So, my current theory is that the colder temps make the battery weaker and 
the 15W-50 oil thicker, and the combination of the two produces a no-start 
condition -- slow starter pushing thick oil just can't quite spin fast 
enough to kick it over.

Step 1, replace 15W-50 oil with 5W-30 oil for the cold months (plus this 
helps warm up faster).
Step 2, replace old (original) battery cables with new ones.
Step 3, be rid of this starting problem FOREVER!
Hey, I can dream, right?  I'll keep y'all posted...

Best,
