Connie,

If those are original miles, conventional wisdom would place you on 
borrowed time. Someone with an eye for these things might be able to 
tell you whether it's a 2nd (or more) motor by looking for signs of 
work.

Even so, no matter what you have in your bus (or any car out of 
warranty, for that matter), your engine could last a few more years or 
go belly up tomorrow morning. Figure out what it will cost you to 
replace your engine (based on how much work, if any, you are willing to 
do yourself) and what your resources are for  emergency repairs.

Then decide how much of a gambler you are. Since you have no way of 
knowing when your engine will need replacement, no matter 
who/what/where/how, you may or may not want to delay other purchases.

But you mention a paint job: it's a nice idea to have your paint done 
in one place and redo your engine in another and then bring them all 
together for bliss.
