Multiple explanation marks!

Is there something that we men are doing, some way that we are 
behaving, that warrants gender discrimination? I'll bet you dollars to 
doughnuts that you aren't going to be discussing pillowfights in 
undergarments inside Westies. So what's up?

I'd hate to think this list could devolve such that I would feel the 
need to start a special list for men over 50 who are bowlegged, 
slightly overweight, and hold doctorates!
