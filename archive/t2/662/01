I found my own answer. The German company that makes these synchrometers
provides a listing of adapters and recommends #45 for "Type 2 Transporter,
Type 4, 411".

The adapter (haven't seen it actually) mounts the synchometer on the carb so
you can tune hands free. They actually recommend you buy two and mount them
but I'm going to cheap out this time and spend $0.

The unit I borrowed was the SK cone style and I was able to swap it for the
BK style which happens to have a flat bottom and completely covers the PDSIT
choke opening. It's not hands free but seals (as tested on the carb with a
vacuum source).

They also sell a universal $4 flat top adapter for the cone but it's not
hands free either.

I lucked out and managed to find these locally at Pierce Manifolds as well.
See their accessories page.
