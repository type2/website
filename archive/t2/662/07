Let me clarify (it's early, and I haven't had my tea yet)...

I have not seen very many ACVWs on the road *in Denver*.  Around 
Thanksgiving time, I posted about an ACVW shop I drove by in Pine, CO 
(which people seem to think is called "Pine Beetles" ... anyway, Pine 
is not that far away from Denver).  If you can confirm the name of this 
shop, you might want to give them a call and ask them about their 
experience with old ACVWs and regulatory compliance.
