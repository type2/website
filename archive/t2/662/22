Hi,

Thanks for the advice. I should have prefaced the email by stating
that I've already replaced the fuel lines, fuel filter, plugs and
wires, cleaned all the electrical contacts I could easily access. The
gas tank was dry when I purchased the bus and I repeatedly ran gas
through the tank and an old filter to get any loose particulate matter
in the tank filtered out.

Another important item, the carb is recently rebuilt, it came included
with the bus but was never installed (she used to have a webber DCNF
non-progressive). The new (old) manifold is from the junkyard but i
spent some prep time here and thoroughly cleaned the heat riser. The
winters are cold here and I'd previously read of the importance of
warming the gas/fuel mixture on cold days.

Finally, any tips on an aftermarket air filter to fit the 34PICT3? I
don't have the oilbath aircleaner. Also,  does a '71 have a facility
for preheated intake air?

Thanks again
jules
