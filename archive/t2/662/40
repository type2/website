Subject: Hoses for BN2

I got a glow pug from German supply.

I can't seem to get the fuel pump working.  The documentation I got 
shows two wires going to the pump, but this one has only one binding 
post.  Would a generic fuel pump (i.e., Facet) work in its place?

Where does one get hoses/fittings to replace the ones that have turned 
to dust?  Do I fabricate something from off-the-shelf parts?

I still haven't decided for sure where to mount this thing.  It has a 
draining pipe (to gravity) that I would like to route into the fuel 
tank somehow, which means I would have to mount it above the fuel tank, 
unless I want to drain to waste (i.e., the road).

I sure I hope I can get this to work.
