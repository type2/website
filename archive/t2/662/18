I live in Englewood, Co, which is a suburb of Denver. I agree that the
collecter plates are the way to go. I usually put those on cars that I
intend to keep for very long. As far as emmisions tests go, its not
all that bad. In most areas you can go to the independant 1982 and
older emmisions places which are not as strict as the state run places
for new cars. I think there are a couple of local areas that have all
of the emmisions in one place, I think Boulder is set up that way. To
pass emmisions I usually just do a really good tuneup and take a try
at it, usually that works. With a 009 distributor I usually have to
back off the timing a bit. Out of about 15 acvw's I have registered
here, only two have failed the test. One was my very first bus which
ended up having a dropping seat on #3 exhaust. The other was my
current '71 which the last owner forgot to tell me had a non-stock
cam.
hope that helps,
Tyler
