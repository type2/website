I have two yards on the island and so far so good. 
Both are mostly VW (I swear there are more Westies per
square mile in Victoria than anywhere else in the
world).  Finding gears for the tranny rebuld was fun
though.  After calling everywhere in north America
found what we needed about 5 miles away.
