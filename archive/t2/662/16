Not sure exactly what ACVW stands for but I just went through this 
process with my 63 DC and one of my 78 Transporters.  If you can, go 
with the Collector Vehicle plates.  You pay a fee of $200 dollars which 
registers the vehicle for 5 years.  The good part about this route is 
that you only have to get the vehicle smogged once.  Then never again 
during its time in Colorado.   So, yes I did have to get the 63 and 78 
smogged but it was not too hard.  There is a place by the name of 
Painters Grinding in Denver which does good work if you need someone to 
take a look at it.  They can check your exhaust emmisions and everything 
ahead of time also to tell you if you'll pass or not.  If you go with 
the regular plates, you'll have to smog every year or two.

I really don't miss California now.  ;)
