Jules,

The three year old gas has *got* to go first!

In this order:

Drain old gas out of the tank.
Replace *all* rubber fuel line hoses.

Replace or install a new fuel filter.

Fill with new gas....*then* fire it up again and see how it does.

Personally, I would then get the ignition system up to par before I 
touched the carb.(points/plugs/etc.)
Adjust valves...yes, you will haveto do this again after installing the 
new push rod tubes, but this is just a test to make sure it runs ok before 
the new push rod tubes.

Make it run, make it run right, make it run fast<grin>.

Cheers, dave
