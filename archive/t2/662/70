I totally agree with Richard. Do a full tune up and then diagnostic on it. 
It will give you more facts/info on the best course of action for the 
bus/engine instead of just assuming the engine is going to die tomorrow.  
Find a type 4 engine guru and let them look and hear it run and get their 
opinion.

Like another person said maybe you can run it a good while like it is and 
save up and do both at once - have one guy doing body/paint and someone else 
doing the engine work.  Lots of $$$$$$$$$ though. Sounds like you are close 
to getting your bus close to 100% and I'm sure your bus thanks you.
