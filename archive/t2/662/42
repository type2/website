Subject: tranny = engine longevity?

Hi Volksmeisters ~~~

Reading through the '55mph' thread, I gathered that our loved busses will last
longer by keeping the speed down. I'm a careful driver anyway, and I'm very
conscious of overly high rpms.
While at work today I (finally) pieced together that a good way to keep rpms
down and advance engine longevity is to get a five gear tranny. Can anyone
confirm this? Gimme the whys, too, including recommendations.
