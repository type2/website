Jules,

Ahhh...You *did* the good stuff already!

You didn't mention points/condensor/cap/rotor.  I would still do these 
first and then run it a litle to make sure all was well before 
adjusting the valves.  I will assume here that you have already changed 
the oil as well....do it again soon after running for a few hundred 
miles...it's still cheap insurance!

I try to do small steps and then check how it runs in between....then I 
don't have 5 things to wonder about if it doesn't start up.

Heat riser is important!  Glad you got it cleaned out.  Don't remember 
what year you said this one was, but all of the  upright models
had a preheat tube(at least one)...or at least a place to put one.

Can't tell you where exactly on that model, but someone on the list will.



Air cleaners....welll...you can buy aftermarket, but they are not 
recomended(especially for the minimum carb clearance on the bus).
Most VWFLAPS will have...you will need to measure the diameter of the 
carb intake and match it...watch for clearance on other items around the 
carb as well as the overall height.  The problem with these is no 
provision for the preheat tube and they *may* not have a provision for the 
oil breather tube.


An original oil bath cleaner is highly recomended.

Cheers, dave
