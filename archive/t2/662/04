Subject: Denver is nearly a sure thing now...

Looks like early spring is the move date. 

So I'm surfing the Colorado state website and discover that Denver has
smog checks for old cars. 2 stage sniffer test. Every year. (You can
see I'm THRILLED!)

Has anybody in that area experienced this test on an old ACVW and have
any problems passing it?
