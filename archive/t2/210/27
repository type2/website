Hi Jackson,

You only need the swivel base and its baseplate from the donor bus. The 
tricky part is that the base is welded in and will need to be cut out 
with an angle grinder or torch. Then you weld the baseplate into its new 
home and re-assemble the swivel on top.The swivel base raises seat 
height about 3/4 of an inch.

I have this setup in the passenger side of my Westfakia and it's a real 
treat when you stop for a picnic.

Happy trails,
