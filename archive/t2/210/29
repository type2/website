I'm gonna have to say that that is a pretty durn cool bus.  I'd have to 
gut the cabinets and stuff, but it's still neat.  I'd bid 200 for it :-P 
 Anyone want to drive it to me in new york?  

Seriously though, I love seeing rusty nasty old looking buses driving 
down the road.  Mine's pretty bad, but it's not as bad as it could be. 
 I just think a lot of rust and bad paint is kind of pretty, 
sometimes... It's got character.....
