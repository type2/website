I developed an oil leak myself recently. Pulled the motor after confirming=

ordered a long block from NW Con Rod, but since I have fine spec balance,=20
just resealing was contemplated. After removal of the upper tin, it was=20
seen to be the oil pressure switch, but the push rod tubes were weeping=20
pretty good as well. Note the oil pressure switch is aftermarket junk, not=

VDO or VW production.

I found the following by inspection and will replace/fix accordingly. The=20
thermostat cable was almost broken, the motor mounts were separated, the=20
clutch disc was contaminated, the trans mainshaft seal was leaking, a few=20
portions of the cylinder cooling fins were contaminated with flotsom which=
=20
reduces air flow and can create hot spots. I'll be pleased to correct all=20
defects found and insure much more life from this motor.

I'm replacing the push rod tubes and seals as well. Also, retorqued the=20
heads. I am also replacing the
starter because of a few incidents of hot start clicking during 100=B0 runs=
=20
of 100 or more miles. A new starter will last me 20 years, as opposed to=20
prolonging this one but a few more years with the relay kit, simply a waste=
=20
of time/money over the long haul. Note I have verified no excessive voltage=
=20
drop through the switch during the event already, and my cables and battery=
=20
have been tested are in fine order.

I will also point out, under the breather can the aluminum is as clean as=20
the day it was assembled. Just pure dino oil never allowed to get=20
dirty=3Dresults. No mystery oyls or additives at all. Just pure and plain=20
Valvoline at a dollar a quart available almost anywhere in the Post=20
Renaisaince world. And this is after the PO maintained the vehicle for 20k=
=20
since rebuild and my subsequent 50k operation and maintenance. This may=20
well have been a NW ConRod motor. You normally don't get high spec=20
compression balance with compromise assemblies at 70k use.

You will have to remove the tin and inspect your motor to see what needs to=
=20
be done. This can only be done by actual inspection.
