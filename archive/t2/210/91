Subject: We have a winner!!!  Was: timing off at 20 degree BTDC

Anyhow, I live close to Barry, and I was doing my rounds today anyhow
(went over to Pat Flynn's this morning to finish the install of the engine
in his '75 DC, went to my garage to work on the '73).  So after we got
Pat's engine running (still need the clutch adjusted to run... :-(, I went
over to Barry's place.  I thought the same as Tim and Karl, that his
mechanical advance was somehow stuck at full advance, but sided more with
Tim on the "stuck weights" theory than with Karl's "rusty shaft" theory as
I have experienced stuck weights causing this problem myself.

It turns out that Karl is the winner this time!  The upper and lower
shafts are immovably rusted to each other.

The ported vacuum was fine, and the vacuum biscuit in his dist was also
fine, so he was getting full advance when needed and this problem probably
had no effect on drivability.  He'd have toasted his engine in traffic but
(he said sticking his tongue firmly into his cheek) we don't have much of
that here :-)  Actually, I don't think that Barry commutes in the bus, so
he probably does not spend much time at idle.  It would have gotten ugly
if he did, tho :-(

Anyhow, Barry had a good spare in his parts box, we installed it and I
added his toasty dist to my collection.

THE LESSON.... As Karl said, next time you have your 205P or 205S ('76-79
bus) distributor open, do it a favor, pop the rotor off and drop a bit of
oil on the felt pad under the rotor, eh?

HOWEVER...  broken/loose springs on the weights can and have caused the
dame problem.  Look at both causes.
