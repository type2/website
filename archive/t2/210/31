Well, there arer some purists who will sniff at the Frankenbus, seen at
Westies in the Woods- a 60's van grafted to a toyota van!  The sliding
door is toyota, as are the tailights.  Actually registered as a VW bus. 
A cool clock on the nose where the vw emblem should be!  Has a vanagon
poptop  I can send a pic to anyone who asks or has a web site to add it
to.
