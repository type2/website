Subject: Re: [T2] re: Westy extinguisher size? Halon

Halon and CO2 bottle systems  are still put into commercial areas  that 
have the proper setups for them.  Basically you leave  the area slam the 
door behind you  and then hit the button that i usually right outside 
the door.   In the air force a lot of our generator rooms and computer 
centers were set up with those systems.  Both are large areas with 
usually only a couple people on duty mostly just to  monitor  systems.  
Witnessed a dump on a generator room.  The sound of those (about 8)   5 
foot tall bottles dumping  was deafening.
