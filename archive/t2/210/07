Ok I have used it and in the industry I'm in (Transportation) we use a
heck of a lot of it.

Imron is a two part epoxy rather than a paint. you get 3qts and 1 qt and
mix. at that point you have about 30 minutes to pain AND clean up your
tools.    more paint sprayers have been ruined by Imron...
it takes a LOT of presure to spray the stuff.  I seem to recall we used
85psi in our guns.  in fact to paint our buses we fired up the bus and
tapped into the brake system for the air supply.

but when you are done you will have a bullet proof paint job, and you
better like it because your stuck with it.....and nothing sticks to
it.  bus companies now use stick on decals because other paint doesn't
stick worth beans....

great stuff   IF..........
