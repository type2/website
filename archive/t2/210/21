Greetings to all the group. My name is Dale Haines. My co. is called Haines 
Coachworks. I manufacture a Kit Car called the Synchro 917. The last owner of 
the co. called the car the Laser 917. It is a replica of a Porsche 917 that 
is built on top of a VW belly pan. I am looking for a source to purchase a 
2000cc or higher type 2 engine to put in my own car. Can anyone offer a good 
reputable type 2 engine builder that will offer mild to wild? The 1600 cc VW 
motor has it's limitations on how far you can overbuild past it's factory 
specs without creating a time bomb. That is why I am looking for a 2000 cc or 
higher type 2. I plan on using the bus trans. but I'm going to have a co. by 
the name of Transform cut the final ratio down to where the motor spins about 
half the rpm to go the same speed. The car should way in at about 1400-1500 
LBS. I have been a member of this email group for a while and have enjoyed 
the emails from you folks to each other. This is the first time I have ever 
written this group. I know I am not a type 2 purist as most of you are. I am 
in need of a little guidence as to who I can contact to purchase a well built 
type 2 engine. Any and all help would be greatly appreaciated. If you would 
like to see the Kit car that I now manufacture click on this: <A HREF="http://www.laser917.org/">
http://www.laser917.org/</A>  Go to the new 917 page. 

                               Thanks for all your help.
                          Dale Haines/Haines Coachworks
