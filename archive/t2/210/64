Subject: Re: [T2] LOUD FUEL PUMP?

How much do fuel pumps cost to replace? I thought that they should be
replaced about every four years anyway. The diaphragms fail in time, with
potentially dire results. On upright engines, if (rather, when) they go bad,
they can pour fuel into your crankcase, diluting your engine oil and ruining
your bearings in short order. Why take a chance? We had an engine a short
while ago that we took a chance on and lost.. We thought we heard a slight,
intermittent tapping coming from the vicinity of the fuel pump.. we thought
(hoped) it might be something simple. We changed the fuel pump and the fuel
pump push rod. Eventually, and not too far down the road, the problem
revealed itself to be a bad rod bearing. The tapping became a rapping,
finally a knocking! The end result was a blown, overheated engine with
cracked heads. Of course, the bearing was still bad, and the end result.. a
rebuild or new engine.. would have been the same, with the exception that we
at least had an opportunity to save the crank and heads. :0(
I guess the only reason I'm writing this is to say "Be careful not to assume
the noise you hear is coming from the place you think it is!" Noise from the
crank may travel right down the crank to the end of the block and radiate
out, sounding for all the world like it is coming from the fuel pump. We
even used a stethoscope and could not identify the source. Replacing the
fuel pump is an inevitability anyway, and it's not like they cost a lot of
bread. If the noise is still there after you've replaced it, you may have a
more serious problem and you will have an opportunity to save a crank and
heads.  Jan B
