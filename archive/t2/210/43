My guess also.
Remove the cap and try to twist the rotor. It is supposed to turn clockwise
and then spring back. It is probably fully clockwise and have to force it to
go back. Remove the rotor. See the felt pad in the center? Part of a tune-up
is to put a few drops of oil in the felt, but no one ever does.... until the
upper shaft freezes!.
Get a tiny screwdriver or ice pick and dig out the pad. Get a can of Berrymans
carb cleaner in a spray can. Fill the hole with carb spray where the felt was.
Let it soak. Put the rotor back on and try turning it back and forth. Pull it
off and spray again. Let soak. Takes a while but it should free it up. After
you get it nice and free moving, put the pad back in and saturate it with a
light oil like ATF.
