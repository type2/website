HLVP aslo stands for low pressure big volume, and big orange peel----big
time sanding all of the irregularites out of the paint---

Good idea in therory--terrible in practical application--

Excellent in duplicating the concrete block look on your Bus / Van.

=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0H V L P, stands for =A0 High =A0 Volume
=A0 Low =A0 Pressure. It is a type of paint gun that is designed to be
more efficient in applying more paint product (with less "air born"
waste), to the surface. Its use is EPA required in some States. You may
want to check your local laws. The HVLP reg's most likely wont apply to
home use, but again some places don't allow home auto painting either.
=A0 =A0 So best to cover all the bases.....CYA!
