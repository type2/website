Hey guys   here in the hills of Virginia mice are always getting into the 
Buses . Always set traps when putting up for winter , major problems when 
they get in the engine shourd. I have had them dancing on the rear bumper of 
my 66 westy( the Ghoost) driving down the road , had no idea what my wife 
behind me was laughing so hard at, . mice can be a major PITA.  later and 
have fun  miceless now I hope!  Mark Dearing
