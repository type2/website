Eron has a really good point.  I never thought of that before, and that 
is certainly the best way to go.  If my bus ever catches fire, that's 
what i'll do (as long as i've got a buddy to cover the other hole).

Anyway, the deal with halon is that it's like freon.  R12 type freon is 
bad for the ozone, so now we use R134 or some other type.  Well, Halon 
1211 can be had, and it most likely works just as well.  Here's a link 
to a site that sells them...

They appear to have every size, including a ten inch tall, ten second 
discharge one (for like, putting out cigarettes, or cooling hot 
beverages, maybe?).

And, by the way, your local firehouse will not refill your fire 
extinguisher.  They may send it out with theirs to be refilled, but 
unless you've got a very rich fire department, they won't have a filling 
station on site.  Also, they most likely use mostly CO2 type extinguishers.
