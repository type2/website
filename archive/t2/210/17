Subject: Re: [T2] re: Westy extinguisher size? Halon

This is getting off topic, but the reason that Halon is no longer available
relates to the CFCs and the Ozone layer. Just as airconditioners have had to
change over to different gasses, so have extinguisher systems. IF you can
find a source for Halon gas, you can legally re-charge a Halon system, but
you can't install Halon systems anymore (FM200 is the best replacement), CO2
extinguishers are still fine, but you don't use CO2 for the dump systems
like Halon was used for. (Had to do this in an exam a couple of months back
;^)
