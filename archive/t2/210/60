Subject: Front discs problem(2)

Hi again

I wrote about a week ago that I have braking problems with my front brakes.

Now I have dismantled the master cylinder(again!!) and checked that the 
linings are right and that no holes is blocked.

But I noticed a strange thing with my servo becose when I brake without my 
master cylinder attached to the servo there comes a lot of fluid out of the 
servo. And when I pull the brake pedal up it bubbles from the servo.

Have my master cylinder been leeking and could that be the reason why my 
front brakes doesn´t work.

I know that the calibers and brakelines works fine so the problem is 
situated somewhere else.

//Johan
