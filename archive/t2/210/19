Subject: fuell filler hoses

Hi all,

     Thought I would let you all know, I filled up today for the first time
since I did the hoses.  No leaks or gas smell.  I really filled it up too.
I wanted to thank all who offered advice.  I got the propane fixed up today.
New regulator & on/off valve.  The stove works great.  I do have a question
for any of you Riviera owners out there.  With the stove in place, how do
you open the slider from the inside?  There is just no room without moving
the stove.  I am not sure if all Riviera's are the same but my stove goes on
top of the seat (remove cushions first) behind the passenger seat.
