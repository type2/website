'72 Westy 1700 with stock transmission... 

I'm having a problem with hard shifting (not wanting to go in or out of gear) 
and when in gear, there is a chatter... no noise when in neutral or when the 
clutch is in... haven't driven it any long distance - just around the yard.

Where to start with this?
