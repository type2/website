Subject: Shifting poll

OK for all you that are not travelling this weekend
(like me)! And it is still friday

I would like to poll you on your shifting practices.

Do you start in first all the time, second sometimes,
etc.

When I got time I shift into second at about 3 mph, 3rd
at 20mph and 4th at 27mph.

Sometimes I skip third all together (had to rush
through and intersection).

What do you do?
