Subject: How about Imron?

With the paint discussion that's going on I want to raise the question,
What about Imron?

 I have a buddy who works at a place which manufactures big buck
industrial equipment for the road, and Imron is the only thing they will
use.  He says it's expensive, but they buy it anyway.

I've heard it's not something you want to apply yourself, but I've asked
a local body shop if they'll spray it, and they say sure, just bring
your car in prepped and we'll shoot it for you.

I'd really like to hear from someone who knows from experience about
this product.
