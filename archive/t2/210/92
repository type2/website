Sorry, but Bosch Corporation does not supply rebuilt fuel pumps. I have yet 
to see a core value from them. According to Bosch, the FI pumps were not 
designed to be rebuilt. What various and sundry suppliers of rebuilt pumps 
may be Bosch pumps, but they are not rebuilt by Bosch.

To say the rebuilds are better than a New Bosch pump is simply ridiculous. 
I've see hundreds that have lasted 30 years+. The only ones I've ever 
replaced were killed by lack of maintenance, ie, failure to change the 
filter since forever and being subjected to huge excess stresses. A 6 month 
warranty is just about worthless unless it's junk right out of the box and 
you don't count the labor to R&R again in short order.
