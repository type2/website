Subject: living in a VW

Just out of curiosity has anyone out there tried
living in a Bus for an extended period of time? I just
got transfered to Cali by my company and rather than
pay the exorbitant rents out here I decided to buy and
live out of a bus. Thinking I'd kill two birds with
one dollar so to speak ie combine transport with
housing. I'm in the process of buying the bus (name
suggestions anyone) and would love any input yall
might have.
