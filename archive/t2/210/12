Subject: Re: [T2] ugly bus/van entry

As a bus it definately is strange...but i  like that paint job!!  I just 
noticed the plates....and enlarged that pic.  That type of  vehicle 
would have a extremely difficult time getting registered as a  driver in 
japan.   spent to many years there not to know that.  Those plates have 
the "4" pattern.  Corporate  show vehicle not for daily use.  Only for 
show  purposes like promos.  In this case probably  pokeman.  the van in 
the background is probably how that one started out.
