Subject: Re: [T2] How about Imron?

Bob, Small correction here-
Imron is actually a polyurethane paint.
And if I can remember correctly, it isn't quite 1 to 1--it more like 3
to 1 mix, and if you want the stuff to flow out a little better
reduction is OK---

The stuff is the most durable paint known to man---
BUT, it is Verboden to apply without a natually asperated helmit type
mask, paint suit, and rubber gloves.
The poly isocianates will kill you period.
Nasty stuff.
It is non repairable, meaning that if one section of anything gets
screwed up--hope that there is a cut off or seam to paint to---you cnnot
blend the stuff.
It is a total bitch to sand--have a lot of paper on your DA, or orbital
sander--it will ball up in the paper faster than Jackie Robinson---
The stuff can be rubbed out, but there is a 10 to 12 hour window in whch
to accomplish this task--if you wait an hour longer you'll never cut the
stuff with any wet sandpaper, and your buffer will go up in smoke trying
to remve the dust nubs that may have landed in the paint.
 
I have painted 10 to15 yachts for clients in my career, as well as 3 of
my own.
The boat can bounce against a pier till the cows come home --and the
paint won't budge---
Awlgrip, as well as the urethanes made by the Petit Co. are also
primarily for marine use, are Polyurethanes, and also bullet proof--and
a bit cheaper than Imron.

But bad for your heart---and lungs---

I no longer even get close to this stuff because its a pain--I have
opted to use the PPG Concept system which is a modified urethane enamel,
which is totally repairable, and no as lethal to use, lays out
beautiful, and more resonable than Imron---and it lasts just as long----

This is alll the straight scoop---

Later,

Terry

Imron is a two part epoxy rather than a paint.
