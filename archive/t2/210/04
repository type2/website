omg, my kids went NUTS! it really is the ugliest thing i have ever
seen... good thing it WASNT a VW~!
my son identified togepe, jiggly puff, charizard, cubone, bulbasar, mew
and pikachu. there were others, but the pic was too hazzy to tell. i am
not sure it was mew, but i couldnt make that one out, either. thought i
saw squirtle's head behind bulbasar.

sorry for the poke-rant
