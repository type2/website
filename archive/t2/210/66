Dont use a steering wheel lock on any vehicle...I have seen these get 
snapped when tows get up to speed.  A sudden twist has the effect of the 
entire bus trying to turn the wheel.  This is why many tow drivers like 
to put the key in and unlock the steering wheel if they are not doing a 
bed tow.
