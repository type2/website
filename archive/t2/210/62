if the tranny is manual and has plenty of gear oil it should be possible
without damage, wouldn't drive fast though and make sure everything back
there is nailed down, I lost a major component I forgot was laying back
there one time

personally I wouldn't trust the steering wheellock for that.  but rather I
would turn the key and unlock the steering then use rope to tie the wheel,
that way you hit a pothole or something you don't damage anything critical
those steering wheel locks are a PITA to change
