Subject: leak down test

I performed my first leak down test today.  A 1600 DP from my '71. 
I have an air compressor and, thanks to a list member pointing me to 
a web site,  I bought a nifty set of gauges that monitor the pressure 
in a cylinder as 100 psi is maintained at the spark plug hole.

The directions for the gauges mention about leak down values of 92%. 
The highest I got on any cylinder was 48, and I could hear air 
hissing inside my case.

The test was performed with the piston at the bottom of the cylinder 
and the valves closed.

The directions did say to warm the engine to operating  temperatures. 
I couldn't do this because it was lying on the garage floor awaiting 
a tear down.  Can my  extremely low numbers be due to the temperature 
being not correct?

If anyone has actually made this measurement on an air cooled VW 
engine, please chime in.

Jack
