Subject: RE: [T2] re: Westy extinguisher size? Halon

	In a bus engine-fire, one shouldn't open up the engine compartment anyhow.  
It fuels the fire.  If your engine is sealed properly, you should block off 
one side of the air-intake louvers, and fire the halon gas into the other 
side.  It should effectively choke the fire of oxygen, and extinguish it.
