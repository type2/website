I think that you gain efficiencies by having the bus tow the bug.  An 
engine doesn't send all of it's power to the rear wheels, there are losses 
along the way.  Some of these are (relatively) fixed, so just by having the 
engine run you see these inefficiencies.  Just by firing up the second 
engine you are going to decrease overall efficiency.

Then there's the angle about inertia of the combined vehicles.  Getting 2x 
the weight to maintain a steady speed does not take 2x the power.  Getting 
2x the wieght to accelerate might, but once at speed it takes a fraction of 
additional effort to keep them at this speed.
