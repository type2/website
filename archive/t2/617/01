Humidity aids the evaporation effect of the a/c causing colder air? 

Wet your hand and stick out the window into the wind while travelling down the road and it will feel cool. 

I think I've got that right. 

As for 911 engines running hot in wet weather - maybe the fan belt is slipping? <GRIN!>

Honestly I can't see a single reasons why humid air would impede cooling? Been over 15 years since my Navy thermodynaics classes...
