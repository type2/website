Subject: Bleeder valve tip

Since replacing brake lines looks like it's going to be a current topic for
a while, here's my favorite tip for getting out rusted bleeder valves:

Heat them up with a torch, moderately but hotter than you'd be willing to
touch no matter what, then touch the perimeter of the valve threads with an
ordinary candle, or a chunk of supermarket parafin.  It will melt instantly
and be drawn into the hole.    Then just wrench them out after a few more
taps with a big wrench.  Obviously, you've got an open flame going there, so
watch out for other flammables and gas lines.

I've gotten a few bleeders out that way that would not move no matter how
much liquid wrench, heat,  or tapping was applied.
