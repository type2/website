i second that teddy bear......
and chris well put...
i myself think alot on the same things..
most folks say to me why in the world did you get rid of your 2 buick centurys with A/C power windows,power locks,nice heater,cruise control,power steering,etc etc....
 
now all you have is that 68 beetle and that old 76 bus... both painted up like a bunch of hippies moved out of them...
i laugh and i say nope i just finally came to my senses....
 
i couldnt afford to have the A/C fixed when it wasnt cold no more..
and the power windows were unpredictable....
the power locks worked but i kept locking myself in<LOL shits and giggles
the power steering always wined and wanted more..
and when the turning light went out on the front of one of them i had to have someone fix it cause i didnt have the right tools..for it...
 
and they say but they are great cars i say to them back yep they were and now someone else has them and we the wife and i have something more...
 
we have dreams that have came true...
and through it all.... those hippies didnt just move out of them they just moved in....
 
not only that but i havent ever seen a type buick list or a buick camper or even for that fact a wave from another buick... how about a peace sign or just a smile...?
nope didnt see none of that ...
 
through the symbol we found reliability,friendship,love,emotion,passion, and most of all independence to work on it ourselves and not have to count on the crooked mechanic at the buick dealership....charging us 400 dollars for a alternator plus another 100 bucks in labor...
 
so what if i get greasy and my grease(v dub clothes) out weigh my good clothes...
i enjoy working on them and knowing there love comes back to me...
i remember those times also when i was young when people just couldnt afford things like new cars and oil changes and getting there car washed...
 
people seemed to have time for those things then and each other...
look out these days though cause there just isnt enough time for anything...anymore...
i think  also alot as we puut puut along and and watch them fly by racing to there next destination.... blowing us to one side or the other..
i just smile though cause at least well at least for now i am enjoying the ride...
 
nothing like driving a volkswagen....
nothing at all...
someone once said cant remember who old saying but it went something like this was from the 60's or 70's i think it went like this...
 
"You are either on the Bus or off the Bus"
 
peace brothas and sistahs
