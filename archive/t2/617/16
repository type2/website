Subject: RE: [T2] friday question for the chemical engineers

Hi Volks- I'm old, my hearing is gone (too much rock&roll), so I use 91
cause I could hear a  ping to save my life. Plus, my bus is filled with
sound-proofing and my speakers are directly above my head. It's cheap
insurance for me........ TBear
