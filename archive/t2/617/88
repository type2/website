I have a 70'westy. A couple of days ago she died on me. I pushed in the clutch and then silence. I have gas,
and she turns over fine. But I don't seem to be getting a spark from my coil. Tried a new coil and still
nothing. I have power to the coil but no spark jumping off of the distributor to coil wire.
 What am I missing here?
The coil to dist. wire looks fine, but could it be shot?
I should be getting a spark from the coil, when holding the wire next to the doghouse or manifold, right?
 I'm in need of some HELP here. Any ideas? -Chris

Check your point gap. When the dry rubbing block wears down, the points won't open and close.
When the points won't open and close, the coil won't spark!

And you don't have a 70' bus....... that means your bus is 70 feet long!!
You have a '70 bus.....
