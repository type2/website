Listen to that Dave Ramsey guy on the internet (or radio) - lots of call-ins that will for CERTAIN make you feel good about your own situation! <grin> Maybe they should have been driving AC VWs. Or maybe that is WHY they are calling into his show in the first place... <grin!> Well Dave, I bought a GEX engine...
