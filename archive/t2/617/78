Subject: Physics of towing

Mark, 
      Around 1965, a friend and I went to a Pittsburgh (Pa.) auction where we 
bought a non-running VW microbus.  Seemed a bargain too good to pass up.  We 
towed the bus ~25 miles using his Beetle; and in the process we burned two 
exhaust valves in the Beetle.  It seems to me the engine was not designed for 
the load conditions we put upon it -- even though we drove rather slowly and 
kept the revs up.  The combined mass and some hilly conditions, despite the 
cool weather, were clearly too much for the engine.  It marked the beginning of 
an end to our friendship, and though we both understood the physics of the 
problem, it clearly represented bad judgment in several respects.... Glenn

....whether the gasoline required for one 
vehicle to tow another vehicle would be more or less than the gasoline 
required for the same two vehicles to travel under their own power. It 
seems to me that, counterintuitive as it might seem, it would require 
less total gasoline to operate two vehicle separately.

Of course, all I am taking into account is the total mass of two 
vehicles driven by one engine, versus the same mass driven by two 
engines. It could be that there are efficiencies in towing that I am 
not taking into account.

Let me simplify the problem by talking specifics. Which would use more 
gasoline: a bus towing a bug? Or a bus and a bug traveling the same 
distance, under the same conditions, but separately? And why?
