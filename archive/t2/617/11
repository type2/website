My navy thermodynamics was a few years back too...I'm not too sure about the effects of humidity on heat transfer.
 
However, humid air is less dense that dry air, since H2O has two hydrogens weighing 1 each, the oxygen weighs 16 for a total of 18.
 
Every H2O molecule has to replace either an O2 or N2 molecule (ignore trace elements)in the mass of air. O2 weighs 2x16 = 32  and N2 weighs 2x15 = 30.
 
18 is lighter than 30 or 32, so enough water vapor will make the air less dense. This is a significant performance factor for aircraft.
