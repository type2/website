Subject: Physics of towing

For George Lyle, or anyone else who wants to take a crack at it.

While driving around Glacier National Park this week, I had reason to 
reflect on a persistent FART on this list: towing. That got me thinking 
about the physics of towing, and whether the gasoline required for one 
vehicle to tow another vehicle would be more or less than the gasoline 
required for the same two vehicles to travel under their own power. It 
seems to me that, counterintuitive as it might seem, it would require 
less total gasoline to operate two vehicle separately.

Of course, all I am taking into account is the total mass of two 
vehicles driven by one engine, versus the same mass driven by two 
engines. It could be that there are efficiencies in towing that I am 
not taking into account.

Let me simplify the problem by talking specifics. Which would use more 
gasoline: a bus towing a bug? Or a bus and a bug traveling the same 
distance, under the same conditions, but separately? And why?
