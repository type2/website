Subject: gas tank fuel outlet

I have the gas tank out of the '74.  Going to clean and coat it.  The PO 
used some kind of thread lock on the threads of the outlet tube nut, and 
the (aluminum) nut left a good part of itself on the threads taking it 
off.  I got the threads cleaned up with a "thread restorer file" but 
they're not perfect.  The new nut is steel and goes on pretty well.

Question:  Should I use some kind of thread lock on this puppy when I 
reinstall it, if so what?  Any hints on the torque that should be used?  
I'ts not one that you would want to come loose down the road.  Right?
