Subject: RE: [T2] where does this wire go?

I believe it's the old sensor wire that used to go on the open cell
batteries that originally came with our buses.  There was an electrolyte
level sensor that got wired into the test plug.  If the electrolyte
level got too low in the battery the VW computer would pick it up.  I
have the same wire in both my buses and they are both taped off.
