Listees,

('71 1600 DP, 009 dizzy running points)

I've been spending lots of time and money trying to get my bus running 
"good". After the rebuilt carb proved to be beyond help, I got a new 34 PICT 
carb (the Latino variety) from my FLAPS today and insalled it. I also had to 
replace the dizzy clamp as mine was shot.

So I took set to TDC and removed dizzy and repalced clamp and carb and got 
it all back together and I got it running but it's running poorly. The good 
news is that it idles great at 800. But I'm just frustrated with the whole 
timing thing. First my timing gun is like an older kind that connects 
between #1 plug and #1 plug wire, seems everyone else has one that just 
clamp on the wire. The timing just seems inconsitant like it's missing at 
idle but does seem consistant while rev'ing. I was having severe pinging for 
while, this like popping/crackling sound and it seems to come more from the 
passenger side of the engine, but I got it timed to my 30 degrees total 
advance mark (per article in library) while reving to 3000 + RPM.

I took for test drive and it pops/pings when I rev up for awhile and coast. 
Also I think something simple is just screwed up and it seems I'm only 
running on three cylinders or something. It just didn't have the power it 
once did. After my test drive I tested the dipstick and it seems hotter than 
it should. It was also smoking a bit but I guess that's normal for a VW 
engine eh?

Does carb adjustment affect popping/pinging/backfiring/running hot? And are 
there three adjustment screws or only two, I only know of the two on the 
left side, biggie and little, the little I understand is the mix adjustment 
and the big I understand is the idle adjustment. I did the 2 1/2 turn trick 
and probably need to adjust the mixture per the Bentley procedure as I 
couldn't really do it that way with my old carb cause my idle wasn't really 
consistant (it's ALOT better now with new carb).

If anyone could help talk me through this tune up mess that I'm in I would 
appreciate it, I could call you - man I would appreciate it.

Thanks,

Daniel
