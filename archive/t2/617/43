Could you elaborate more on the leaks?  I have been very frustrated by leaks 
on my 72. I replaced front and rear main seals and pushrod tube seals, and 
still have an awful time with leaks. I wonder to what extent my problem is 
black main seals instead of red. I'll hopefully know more soon when I get 
time to pull the motor.
