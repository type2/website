What is it with me and points? 

After replacing all the exhaust gaskets tonight (before dark) I went
to time the bus. Warmed it up, and plugged in my strobe. Nothing. WTF?

Triple checked all my connections, still no light. Walked over to the
Volvo, plugged it in, worked fine. You KNOW what that means...

I haven't put 1k miles on this one and it's already jacked. Now I have
to wait till morning to check it out so I can have some light.

(And yes, I lubed the rub block when I installed.) 

I'm just hoping that it slipped out of adjustment and didn't waste the
block like my last one...
