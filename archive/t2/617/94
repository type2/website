Subject: Re: Brake lines

--- Having installed a new brake system requiring new lines in a
83 Rabbit I have to say that it is easier to buy the new line with
connectors and doing some bending that it is to install a new
connector on an old line. Buy a tube bender.
Or get a guesstimate on having the new steel lines routed by a shop..
it might not to expensive if they use premade lines..
getting the flare right is a PITA IMHO.
