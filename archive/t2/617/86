Yep seen that one plenty. IT is a commercial about the use of Whopper 
wrappers to get free music downloads. It is a few kids rocking out and the 
officer walks up and questions them about their music being free. "Yeah it 
was free is that illegal?" they answer. It is play on the Bus driver 
stereotype "always up to no good or something illegal". Most would think of 
illegal drug associated issues but it goes farther back than that, ever 
heard Alice's Restaurant? John Baker has. Dumping trash out of a bus is 
illegal too =D.

Of course I like that one better than the fully medicated model playing in 
the wind, dancing around on what looks to be a nice bus(although PINK) in a 
tampon commercial. Total disregaurd for the roof of the bus.
