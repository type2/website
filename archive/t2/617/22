<Problems in the fatherland?>

I'm no expert (though I play one at home...) but I think I read that Germany's auto worker wages were pretty high (compared to???) and of course the high cost of benefits. 

The never ending struggle bewteen management and labor. Maybe EVERYBODY in the organization ought to consider a paycut or freeze or both and cut their personal spending a bit so that the less pay doesn't hurt so much. You know get top management somewhere close to the wages of the people they manage.  

I had to chuckle nervously a few years ago when I was working for the local university and the professor level folks were screaming for more pay when they were making 4-6 times more than I was. I was often doing everything but teaching classes for a fraction of their pay and it costs the same for me to stay warm, keep clothes on my back, feed myself, and transport my hinney back and forth to work. Of course they had a certain lifestyle far beyond mine to maintain. Whatever... I was just working towards graduation. (Still have 4 classes on my engineering degree to complete). I left there for work in my field of expertise (I like to think so anyhow).
