>daniel what about the points?
I'll double check them in morning but according to dwell readings they are 
perfect, even for new.


>or it could very well be from the smallest of small exhaust leak...?small 
>hole somewheres?
Maybe this is it? How does an exaust leak differ from a vacuum leak, would 
it show up in a vacuum reading? I went to get a vacuum gauge the other day 
but they were out and I still haven't picked one up yet.


>are you sure you got the dizzy in there right and all the way down..?
It is all the way down, I'm certain. Could it have gotten switched 180 
degrees somehow?


>have you checked the valves?
Adjusted them last weekend, and checked the side that the popping seemed to 
be coming from. They seem right on.


>what about compression..
Again, last weekend I was at 119/120 on all 4.

>timing is very very important as well as carb settings... remember wrong 
>mixture can be a do or >die situation...
I know, I'm scared I'm going to burn up my motor or something. I used to 
always let my mechanic do timing/carb adjustment. I went over there 
yesterday and he verified the rebuilt carb is toast.


>if you are talking about picasso we wont be leaving to go until around 4 
>:30ishpm saturday..
I want to go camping on the family farm about 2 hours away near Crosville 
TN.


>  i wouldnt say that smoke is normal... what color is the smoke..?
I noticed the smoke after the test drive and was just floating around the 
engine compartment. I think it's just oil burning somewhere. Oil cooler seal 
perhaps?
