Subject: How hard to replace metal brake line from master cylinder to

I got a good scare last night on the way home in my 1969 Campmobile when I had to make a "quick" stop from 45 mph due to a cop directing traffic.  I hit the pedal a little harder than usual, it held for a second, then went right to the floor.  I was able to downshift quickly and slow down enough to get by, and luckily I was only about a mile from home, so I didn't have too much "white knuckle" drive time.  
 
The dripping brake fluid showed me exactly where the leak was... the metal line that runs from the master cylinder to the rear "t" fitting.  It's leaking right in front of the big tube in the rear, right where one of the mounts holds it to the chassis.
 
Three questions:
 
1.  How hard is it to replace this line?  It looks to be pretty well exposed, but the bends on either end look to be kind of a pain.  
2.  How long is this line?  I found the lengths of several other lines online, but not this one.  My local FLAPS carries generic brake line sections in different lengths, so I could splice several together if necessary.
3.  Thoughts on replacing all the metal lines?  I plan on doing a brake job on the bus in the near future anyhow (rubber lines, front wheel cylinders, etc.) but hadn't planned on replacing the metal lines unless I mess up the threads or the connector upon removal.
 
Thanks!
