I just got back from a drive to the swap meet. Before I left I
adjusted the points and lubed 'em up again. They were too tight. I'm
at the end of the adjustment now, but at .016. Time to get another
set. The light is triggering again and the bus is stronger than it was
yesterday.
 
Am I the only one that has the rub block wear out quickly? I've tried
dielectric grease, silicone grease, and even wheel bearing grease. I
don't know what else to try short of dropping $60+ on a pertronix. 
This has happened on both my original 009 and the vac dizzy Karl sent
me. This is my 3rd set of points now... At $15 a pop I'm close to a
pertronix anyway. :-(

Sounds like you have too much primary voltage. Are you using a coil with a built-in
ballast resister?
