Subject: Re: [T2] where does this wire go?

 I just bought a 72 Westy. All stock. In the engine
 compartment this wire is sitting near the battery
 area. The ends are push-connectors joined to one
 push-connector/splitter.
 I cannot find a place for it to hook to.
 I thought it might be a ground, but the ground tabs on
 that side are occupied.
 
 Looking at the factory wiring diagram made my eyes
 crossed.
 Do  the colors in the diagram match the wire colors in> the bus?
 
 Anyone know where this should go? It's part of the
 harness that comes through the firewall, visible in
 the pic

Since your link didn't have a pic around any where......

Maybe the wire went to the flux capaciter..... but it was removed before you got the bus?  :)
