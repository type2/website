Listees,

I got up this morning and adjusted carb per Bentley procedure and I think I 
have it. No pinging/popping sounds and it sounds good. I had pulled out #1 
plug 2 days ago and noticed it was pretty black so I'm wondering if maybe a 
plug got so fouled up it's not firing - so I'm going to replace all the 
plugs and verifiy everyone is firing and reverify timing.

I'm thinking of it if we make it to the farm - it's a success. We can always 
get towed back home via AAA.

Thanks to everyone helping me in the past few weeks especially Faster for 
taking my VW tech support calls along the way.
