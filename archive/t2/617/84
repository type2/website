Subject: 3 Hippys and a Green Bus

If ya'll haven't seen it yet, this thread on The Samba is one heck of a story.

http://www.thesamba.com/vw/forum/viewtopic.php?t=84419

If anybody out in the LA area wants to come help, I'll be heading out
as soon as bottomend calls me to tell me where I'm going.

We're also taking donations. The 3 hippys are down to their last $180
and still have to drive back to IL. Private mail me for my paypal addy
if you're interested in helping financially. My PayPal account takes
credit cards too, so whatever works for ya. I have a PayPal debit card
so the $$ is immediately available to the guys from an ATM or using
the card as a credit card. If the money isn't used, or for whatever
reason we don't hook up, I'll refund all donations.

I don't have much $$ myself, but I can provide emotional support,
tools, and another less "tool-fearing" body. If Colin was out here
we'd be set. ;-)
