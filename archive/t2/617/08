We prob won't get a plain-jane VW at a reasonable price. I figure at one time folks made decisions about what they NEEDED and not just what they WANTED. Wants becomes a possiblity after needs are met and i figure most of us have our needs met (or could by taking a job available anywhere). 

Problem is these days alot of people have enough disposible income to make it possible to get their needs mixed up with their wants. I have been there over and over. Pop culture encourages this too through movies, magazines, and music. Spend, spend, spend. Easy to see evidence of it eveywhere - new cars replacing only partially wornout car, now few people can service their car where when I was a kid ALOT of the people I knew serviced their own car (they had to, could not afford to do otherwise), personal debt is high, lots of folks chasing the next new gadget rather than just wearing what they've got out (do I really NEED that new computer just to surf and read e-mail?), etc. etc.

Consequently the number of people unable to make ends meet has fallen as their debt has increased, and the number of people who buy only what they need has fallen. Since the market is driven by what people buy, the needs crowd has lost out.  Consequently even the plain jane models of vehicles are pretty nice! 

I figure the economy will have to do something pretty drastic to make this change... 

I'll just keep driving my current fleet. I'm shooting for 250K-300K miles on my '97 Cabrio and '99 CR-V, and another 150K miles out of the '78 westy before it gets retired or restored. At 20K miles per year, that's anotehr couple decades between my wife and I... I'd rather take the money we anticipate saving and invest it in a nicer place to live.
