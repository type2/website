Subject: Storage/Prep Oil Question

Senario: Damp basement, freshly cleaned and degreased short block '73 1700 
type IV. I want to oil the crank, bearings, camsfaft, whatnots, etc. Oil 
pump, screen, drain plug, cooler all removed. I watched the priming thread 
the other day and it got me to thinking.

Question: Besides using my oil can suirter to hit the visible parts, what 
would be a good way to get the oil to the bearings and such?
Could I suirt oil in through some other orifaces and turn the engine over to 
get it all dispersed to the areas I can't see?

Right now there is PB Blaster on most of it just to keep the moisture in the 
air from getting to the unprotected surfaces. But I would like to get some 
real lubrication in there before building up the rest of the engine. I am 
imagining something more like an assembly lube or thick oil additive.

Any thoughts?

Thanks,

Michael Knight
