Okay. I only knew about holding the shift key for multiple selections. Ctrl 
does allow for non-consecutive selections. But now I am trying to modify the 
Services choices. Since I only used shift initially, I had to select all 
services. At this point, I want to delete Storage Space, but I find I 
cannot. First, my window is too wide, so I have to scroll right to get to 
the scroll bar to view all the choices. Second, when I scroll, it erases my 
choices. I am using WinXP Pro with IE 6.

Thanks,

John
