 Looking for the wiring harness that I melted last
 night.  It's the one 
 from the alternator to the voltage regulator.  I'd
 like to try and find 
 a good one before I start the process of repairing
 my melted one.

FYI, the Westy harness has 1 more black wire in it to
send a signal to the aux battery relay. The bus
harness does not have it......
