I'm not sure that it's standard for them not to work - as long as the
element isn't scratched (fixable), there shouldn't be anything about the
element preventing it from working.  It's usually the wiring that has
problems.  The rear defrost on my 77 bus works, but it's weak.  I've been
thinking about installing a relay to power the element.  The switch is at
the front of the bus, so there's a fair bit of wire and a number of old,
corroded connections between the battery and the element.  The wire also
runs next to the hinge for the hatch, which means it gets flexed a fair bit.
