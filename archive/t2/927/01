Subject: How about posts of best "workarounds"?

I'll start- on daughter's 75 her clutch pedal did not come all the way 
up; discovered the spring was broken that wrapped around release lever.
Was impossible to remove the lever from under the bus (no amount of 
Kreul helped) and new spring would not feed over lever- I mounted a 
proper sized/tensioned (about 1" or so) spring to an eybolt in the 
firewall behind the lever -the other end holds the lever just below the 
clutch cable.  Works like a charm.  Gotta remember that if engine gets 
dropped!

See my previous post on workaround to opening heat without climbing 
under bus if cable tubes are impassible.
