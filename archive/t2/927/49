So i pulled the remainder of the alternator wiring harness out today.  
The hot wire pretty much melted all the way to the starter.  The wire 
burned through about 3" from the starter solenoid.  The only apparent 
wiring damage on the starter end seems to be one of the wires that runs 
to the box that is attached to the tranny.  I'll replace that.

I picked up a half way decent used harness today, and plan on using the 
plugs to build a new one.  Verner showed me how to remove the wire 
connectors from the plug.

Is it possible i fried my starter or solenoid or both?

What gage wire is the large red hot one that goes from alt to starter?  10g?

What gage wire are the others?  brown, red and green?  As Karl informed 
me the used one I picked up has an additional black wire, so it must be 
from a westy.

TIA,

dan
