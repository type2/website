Subject: Bus Paint Job

I found a guy in San Diego who I think will do a good
paint job on P-II.

I'm going to remove windows, seals, door handles,
trim, pop-top etc and deliver to him for the work.
Going to do the outside and cab floor, nothing else
needs it.

His name is Jimmy Braxton, seems like a straight-up
guy with some history here in SOCAL. Just wanted to
toss the name out and see if anyone has had work done
or heard anything?

TIA,
