I have a good that makes a case for driving only air-cooled.

40 or so miles from here in the San Francisco Bay area the water pump
bearing on my beemer craps out and leaks like a seive. Call for a tow
(got the insurance, may as well). Operator sez it'll be 2-4 hours
(c'mon. Here? We're not in the sticks). B. S. sez I and the son and me
go to the store and buy 6 - 1 gallon jugs of h2o, fill the radiator
(seal in the pump is so gone water starts pouring right out), refill
the jugs, hop in and drive off with the heater on so we can tell when
we're running low (heater stops heating). We stopped every time we
were low on water (every 5 miles or so), filled it up and looked for a
place to refill the jugs. One desolate strech was pretty long and I
thought we were screwed. Looked around and saw a fountain in front on
a housing development and ran over and filled the jugs up and
continued on. Got home a little late, but not as late as if we had
waited for that tow.
