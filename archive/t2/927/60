Subject: Timing Scales Good News

Listers,

 

Just took a look at some new aluminum timing scales that have become
available. All I can say is (insert impressed whistle). Pure "BLING" for
your bus. I know the plastic  re-pops from JustKampers are close to hitting
the States, but these are niiiiice.

 

They were built off of the original OEM plastic scales for accuracy. They
are 6061 aircraft grade aluminum, engraved timing marks and look like they
will take a real beating without deformation. I'm going to throw the very
first one off the assembly line onto my 78 Westy tomorrow. I'll make sure to
photograph the results.

 

I got mine through BustedBus and he is taking online pre-orders. Don't know
who else will be carrying them, but assume our local list dudes will be
shortly.

 

These are definitely a "buy one, buy one for life" item.
