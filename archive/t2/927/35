On a 2L dual carb motor, fuel pump (mechanical) died in the middle of nowhere. I 
bypassed the fuel pump and used a pushbike tyre pump to pressurize the fuel tank 
(passengers job) to get 30 miles to a small town where a I bought a small electric 
compressor to do the same job, got me the next 100 miles to a town which had an 
electric fuel pump.
Also broke a key in the door lock of a type 3 (varient), broke into car by opening 
front 1/4 window and hot wired ignition switch to get home. No real damage to car, 
and only took ~15-20min. to get going.
