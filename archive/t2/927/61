nice jim, BIgthanks. so it seems possible parts could have been made  
off shore and still keep the Lmb germany stamp..

LMB was an original manufacturer "back in the day".  This and other  
German OE manufacturers have long since disappeared over the years  
being swallowed up in the ever consuming consolidation of European  
manufacturers that have of course moved tooling and manufacturing to  
the four corners of the world these days.  But ya never know, you  
might have found a "treasure trove" of NOS pieces.

Suspicion should always be raised and acted upon accordingly, no  
matter how "good to be true" something (or some things) may be.

I've never seen OE German heads come enveloped in cosmoline, at least  
when I've remembered that far back (70s).  When my father and I  
purchased new OE German bare 1600 dual port heads in 1977 from the  
dealer, they weren't coated in cosmoline either.  Cranks, flywheels,  
camshafts, etc., yes, plenty of cosmoline on those :-)

someone is selling type 1 single port cylinder heads that are stamped
"Lmb germany". does this necessarily mean they were made in germany?
they have no cosmoline, and come as a 10 pack in a wooden crate.
should i be suspicious that they are not actually made in germany?  -
