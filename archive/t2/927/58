In my bug, broke accelerator cable in a toll booth.  Sweet.

A roll of bell wire was what saved the day; wire attached to
throttle and run up through grill, over top, and in driver's
window, then tied to upright between window ana vent window.
Just pull down on the wire and get acceleration.  Worked for
about 200 miles.
