hey guys    heres two that happened on the same trip.   Towing a single cab 
back about 100 miles away. Had a flat , no spare, had tools,  I am standing 
there and the old rt 11 beside I81 had an empty motel. I jump the  fence and was 
just looking around and found a VW bug tire covered in the weeds  that was 
still holding air, man talk about luck.  We fixed the flat and was  towing on 
down the road. Going down a big hill all of a sudden something smacks  into the 
back of the chevy truck we were in. We turn around and the single cab  had come 
loose from the u haul tow bar and had smacked into the back of the  truck. We 
very carefully slowed down and got to the side of the road. On  inspection we 
see that one of the nuts that held the chain type clip in place  was gone. 
The chain clip was just hanging there. We looked all over the two  trucks for a 
nut that would fit and found none. I was sitting on the guard rail  and see 
the big nuts on the back of them. Bingo it fit perfect. And on we  went  later
