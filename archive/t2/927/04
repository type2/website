Subject: rusty hub caps

With all the other problems out there, this one is sure a minor one, 
but for me it is long-standing.

Can anyone suggest a way to keep after-market chrome hub caps from 
rusting?  I've tried lots of wax, a certain POR-15 product, special 
chrome polishes, ........ none of these lasts.  I guess I could 
invest in a silver-like powder coat, but that seems extreme.
