Subject: Re: [T2] rusty hub caps

Use OEM or NOS hubcaps! Bus Depot had them for $40 a cap!  At shows you 
can find rustfree (on chrome) used ones for $5 to $1 depending on 
scratches or dents.

Jack Dinan asked: Can anyone suggest a way to keep after-market chrome 
hub caps from rusting?  I've tried lots of wax, a certain POR-15 
product, special chrome polishes, ........ none of these lasts.  I guess 
I could invest in a silver-like powder coat, but that seems extreme.
