Subject: Re: [T2] AC

As I was browsing through old repair bills for the Golf I noticed that
a CA licensed repair shop had charged 35$ for "Free ON" recharge. That
is pretty cool joke given that it wasn't free, the AC still wasn't ON
after the repair and it wasn't freon altogether like we learned
recently. The car is a 1995 and uses R-134a (Tetrafluoroethane)
instead of R-12.

That shop had kindly offered to install a new compressor (555$) and a
new expansion valve (145$) + labor cost. That comes to about half the
cost of the car.
