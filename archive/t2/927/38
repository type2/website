Oh,, I thought for a minute I was following YOU!! .. but it was a ford..
all I could see was this guys arm ,,, yanking left.. then yanking right... 
for miles...
shook my head... got a chance to get up beside him to see ... and
WOW.. he is working the wipers manually!!!  lol

Alrighty... I watched a guy's face turn white as he was checking the bottom 
end of his water cooled I4 engine... Yup... it had spun a bearing. and it 
was going to cost him large to finish his travels... only a few hundred 
miles.
I said... well,,  I heard a story about a guy taking the tongue out of his 
leather boots.. making a "bearing" from that,, and driving for miles.

I Had another beer and left.

Turns out.. he did what I said.. drove it 280kms... and circumstances led 
him to sell it .. they drove it back to the same shop we had a few beers at 
earlier that summer....this time it was making a strange noise.
That is when I found out for sure the rod bearing was actually made of boot 
tongue leather!
