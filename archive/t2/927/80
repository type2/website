Mine works just fine... One element is broken. That's it.

I found the ground wire was cut off when I got the bus, but I fabbed
up a new one with lots of heat shrink at the connectors to keep them
from breaking.

My 73 had the elements mostly worn off. I had debated whether to strip
it off altogether, or replace the glass with one from a later model in
better shape (then I got rid of it so it was a moot point.)

To decide what to do, check to see if you have current at the wires on
the window when the swtich is on. If you do, then you just need to
repair or replace the glass. If not, work forward to find out what's
wrong with the circuit.
