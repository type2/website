Hey guys  heres one of my best ones. Driving to Key west in a  splittie. 
About midnite in a bad part of greensboro NC my shifter quits working.  I am right 
outside a black nite club and all these black guys are watching me as  I 
crawl under the bus to find that the screw in the coupler was gone. Now this  is 
an odd ball size screw that was suppose to have a wire tye on it but didn't.  
So I take a sheet metal screw from the engine and tape it into the hole. I 
drove  all the way to key west and back to Virginia shifting very easy. Fixed it 
right  when I got back to my shop  later  Mark  Dearing
