Subject: Parting out 78 Westy in Vancouver

I'm about to start parting out a green 78 Westy in Vancouver.  (body 
too rusty to fix)

Engine/tranny are gone, but nice interior cabinets, electric fridge, 
complete pop top, tires etc are available.

I'll post photos on the Samba in the next day or two, but pmail me in 
the meantime if you need anything.
