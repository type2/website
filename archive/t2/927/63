Presumably with the working vehicle's owner's permission... ;-(

	The eminent Stanfurd psych prof Ph Zimbardo researched the 
petty-theft-auto subculture by abandoning junkers in the 1970s at 
several carefully chosen sites around Palo Alto including some 
hevi-doodi tinted territory.  A hidden camera nearby logged movements 
over the weeks or days of informal dismantling to a hulk down on the 
hubs on the public street.  One grad student was herding a heap to a 
selected site when he detected a rear tyre had gone flat, and didn't 
think the 1-ply shreds would get him to the destination, tho' he was 
already well into what my American wife used to call 'a 
neighbourhood'.  Also the cars were supposed to look fairly complete 
at emplacement.  The driver therefore figured he'd have to try to 
slap on the spare wheel  -  if any.  He was heartened to find a spare 
wheel, but was still anxiously searching the trunk for a jack when he 
heard noises from the front of the car.  Looking along thru the 
windscreens rear & front he could see a denizen of the neighbourhood 
disconnecting the battery.  Suppressing his rage he reasoned this was 
an opportunity to meet one of the dusky brethren hitherto viewed only 
as fleeting dusky figures (1 frame every 20 s was the default 
setting, I seem to recall); so he hailed the fellow from behind the 
trunk, in a friendly tone.  The battery thief responded cheerfully 
"you've beaten me to the spare, so I thought I'd get the battery'.
