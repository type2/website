AFAIK Bus Boys doesn't carry Schofield.

Any metal on our site with an AHS prefix is Schofield. But some of the metal
that does NOT start with AHS is also Schofield. Of course you can always
email to ask about the brand of a particular part (if not listed on the
site).

Also, I can get Schofield metal that is not on our site, but the lead time
may be long depending on the timing of my next U.K. container. For example,
right now we have a shipment leaving within several weeks, but after that
probably not another one until Spring. On the other hand you would avoid the
significant shipping cost of
ordering from England.

Finally, it's worth noting that not all metal A.H. Schofield sells is his
own product. He makes certain panels, but others he just buys elsewhere and
re-labels. In many of those cases I can get the same panel cheaper directly
from the source.
