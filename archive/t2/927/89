Note to self: Put snow tires on BEFORE snow arrives.

My Vreds (no all season rating) are horrible in the snow. Not the
tires fault since they're not designed for snow. My fault for not
swapping them.

Though the bus still did better than most of the cars and some of the
4wd trucks. heh

Before leaving (I started clearing the snow before I remembered to take a pic):

We're at 8 inches and it's still coming down hard.
