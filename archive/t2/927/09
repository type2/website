buy new brazilian hub caps and take them to a chrome plater and have  
them triple chrome plated. they will strip the existing chrome off  
(!), copper plate, nickel plate then chrome plate, with polishing in  
between each step. it will cost about 30-40 bucks per hubcap, but  
they will be perfect and should never rust.
