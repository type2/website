I couldn't find that stuff either. The old stuff seems to go brittle over
time.

I do know that GoWesty sells a similar tack strip. It's about a 1/3 the
thickness of the original.

It must be available someplace for less than 75 cents a foot...maybe an
upholstery shop could identify it.

Staples work well but you'll need an electric staples to make the job goes
easier. I took out 281 staples so you're putting in about the same amount.

Most staples have a 3/8" crown but the ones used in the bus were 1/2". FYI.
You'll want to use stainless steel or monel staples so they don't rust.
