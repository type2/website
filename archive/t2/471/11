Subject: Pop Top staple strip

Greetings,

What are the latest thoughts on what to use for the staple strip when 
installing new pop top canvass? My strip was old and hard and in spots 
cracked into several peices. I looked at the big stores Lowes, Home depot, I 
was thinking just a thin wood molding like yardstick size. I looked at the 
vertical blinds too but they don't seem the come in replacement sizes long 
enough. And I have looked at the rubber molding that goes around the 
baseboard of walls (comes in rolls).

Also, what to attach it with? Staples? Tacks? or what about screws and 
finishing washers?

Thanks,
Brandt
