Update: This *is* easily doable.  I got several good suggestions for how I 
might accomplish this, both here and on the samba bay window forum.

I then spoke to my mechanic, and it turns out he has done this OE 
stalk/electric washer modification several times before on 914 Porsches using a 
microswitch from Radio Shack. He is confident that he can use the same part and 
technique on my bus. 

I will post part numbers and other info when I get them from him next week. I 
personally feel this will be a great "real world" upgrade for my bus, while 
still preserving original appearance. 

As always, thanks to everybody for the great suggestions and leads.
