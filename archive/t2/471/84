Yeah, my school has been closed for two days because of all the ash
blowing around from the Val Verde/Pico Canyon/Simi Valley fires.  While we
in SoCal aren't strangers to poor air quality, having visible chunks in
the air is a new experience.

A nice snowstorm would be quite welcome.

BTW, if you value the finish on your bus, hose the ash off.  It isn't good
for paint, chemically speakiing.
