Subject: RE: [T2] 78 2.0 and Oil

This is usually caused by water in the oil...maybe your radiator is leaking
into the oil sump lol

Water gets into air-cooled oil from humidity in the air. This occurs
normally, but can be aggravated by a missing o-ring on your oil filler cap.
Once the water gets in the oil, it doesn't stay very long since oil temps at
or above 180* will drive the water off.

Normal driving will get the oil warm enough, but if you usually only drive a
few miles at a time, it might never warm up. My daily commute of 7-8 miles
barely gets my oil temps up, and that's only cuz I climb a huge hill on the
way. And I live in S. California.

The other thing that can keep the oil from warming up is missing
thermostat/cooling flaps. This would allow too much cooling air during the
first few miles. If you live somewhere really cold, it might never warm up.
