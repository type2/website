I have an original sensor with both Bosch 0 280 130 012 and VW 022-906-041 printed on it. Just find that Bosch number at your favorite online vendor.

There are several VW numbers for different applications that I'm aware of:

022-906-041 stock for FI Bus
311-906-041A supercedes 022-906-041
022-906-041A not 100% positive but I think this will lean out the mixture.

I was hoping to take a look at a 311-906-041A from the VW dealer to see if it also had a Bosch number printed on it but the part was so overpriced I didn't bother to satisfy my curiosity. Taking donations. ;-)

I have no idea what these Bosch numbers map to so it's probably best to avoid them if you ever get a local monkey trying to pawn you one.

0 280 130 003
0 280 130 017
