Subject: Heat, Rust and Noise in VWs by G. Matthew Bulley 

Has anyone been to "Heat, Rust and Noise in VWs by G. Matthew Bulley" in
the library lately?  I would like to ref it as it had some great detailed
advice, however..... It appears to be a dead link.  If anyone could get me
a copy of it, I'd appreciate it.  Thanks, list!
