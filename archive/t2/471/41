Hmm, after the second Sachs friction disk delaminated in 70,000 mi (the
orginal lasted 150,000mi), I replaced it with a LUK from BUSDEPOT-
shifts like butter now (for about 30K mi), no chatter or vibration.

 The replacement I put in mine was a LUK, it would NOT
 disengage!!  I had to R&R the engine again and replace
 it with a Sachs.....
