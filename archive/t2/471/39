The T2 was available with headlamp washers (M288).
This came only in combination with electric
windshieldwashers. This option is pretty rare here in
Europe. Also in the USA this must be pretty rare
(perhaps it wasn't available at all).

As far as I know this option was made for the Swedish
market and was standard there from 1974 on. Perhaps
you could get in touch with someone from Sweden and
arrange the wiperhandle. It is a special one with a
switch instead of the fluidvalve.

Here's a picture of it from the parts book:

Watch out to get the good handle. During the most of
modelyear 1974 an old style handle was used which
probably won't fit.
