alcohol does bind to moisture but is recommended and often included on
small pads with new wiper blades to condition them.

don't know if this recommends it for other uses.

Definitely.....brake fluid oxidizes paint which means its reactive.

If you read the bottle it tells you to keep it sealed.  Old brake
fluid shouldn't be used in a brake system because of this.
Once oxidized it compresses more than new fluid.

While rubber may appear to look better I'd be hesitant about using
brake fluid on it.

UV light in sunlight hastens oxidation and aging of rubber so I
question using a product that will oxidize paint.

I'd stick with the products that state they are formulated for rubber
and preferably include  some sort of UV screening ingredient.

Its a little messy but I've used Vaseline on non automotive rubber in
the past....apply while doing washes, etc. and wipe off the excess.
