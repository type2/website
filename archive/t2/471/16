 Greetings,
 
 I am looking for a new seal for the external plug in
 unit box thing for my 
 78 westfalia. The old one is kind of foam in nature.
 Anyone know where I can 
 get a new one? I didn't see one at Gowesty. The seal
 has 3 screwholes at top 
 and one at the bottom.
 
 This is the box with the delta six industries
 sticker on it. Anyone know 
 where to get a new sticker? One not in the $17
 Gowesty? camper sticker set.
