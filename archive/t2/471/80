Hi Russ,
Did you integrate the Radio Shack switch into the existing wiper/washer 
switch? 
If so, did you put the new elec. switch in place of the fluid valve from 
behind.I went out and grabbed the spare wiper/washer switch from my parts 
stash and it looks like the fluid valve is riveted on to the switch. I am 
guessing it takes some judicious drilling or filing to remove the valve. Can 
you take pics of your setup?
thanks
Mike
