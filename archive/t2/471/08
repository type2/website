Quaility of finish is important, wear of .2 or .3mm is not an issue. If it 
comes clean without too much effort with a few strokes of 120 grit and 
progressing to a nice polish with 400 or finer, wear will have little 
effect. This is not a high stress bearing. The only failures I have ever 
seen are always due to improper install or lack of lubricant. They always 
outlast the clutch if installed and lubed properly. If it's gnarled enough 
that you can't get to the bottom of the pits, life of the new pilot will 
suffer.
