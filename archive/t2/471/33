Subject: BN4 HEATER

Hi James,
I went and took a look at the heater.
I finally found the glow plug hiding out of sight.
it was in the center as you mentioned but it was on the other side when
looking at the
heater.do you use a regular spark plug wrench to get this out?
i cant see well enough to know what to use to get it out.
it has a rubber seal around it and i got the rubber seal out of the way.
Thanks again,
Darren
