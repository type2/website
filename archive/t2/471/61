  It's called fish mouthing, notching a tube to butt against another tube.
You need to cut 2 sides when your done it looks like a fish mouth.
   Everyone has come up with good ideas but faster-laster still has not said
what size tube he is using. The size of the tube will dictate the process
needed to do the fish mouth.
   When I have built racks out of 7/8" or smaller tubing I use 2 different
approchs on doin the fish mouth.
 One is I use a drum sander

 or If I have a lot to cut I take my 6" bench grinder and carve the sides of
the stone to make it round instead of flat. This way I can just push the
small OD tubing into it to make the fishmouth. This works great with 1/2"
and 3/4" tubing but you have to work 7/8" and/or 1".

  Before I had the right tools to fish mouth we did it the poor mans way
where you cut halfway through the end of the tube at an angle then roll it
180 degrees and cut the other side. Poor mans fish mouth.  cut\ roll it 180
cut/

Re joining a tube to a tube-
Check with any bike shop frame maker- isn't this called "mitering" the
tubes you are butting?
