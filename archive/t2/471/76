1.  They're just reflectors

2.  Two hints I learned from a mechanic I used to work with --

Brake fluid makes a really good rubber conditioner  - and after you wash 
your van you can rub some on the tires to give them a like-new, but not 
glossy look.  Works great actually.

Mineral oil works wonders on vinyl dashboards to keep them from drying 
out - please don't use armor-all because it contains alchohol and will 
dry out your vinyl.
