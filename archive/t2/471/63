Excellent point Ronnie, thanks for bringing that up. I didn't
honestly expect this many ideas! I will be using 1/2" EMT. it grinds
easy, bends easy, and (as I found out last night) actually welds
pretty darn decent. My first thought was the grinding wheel, but what
I saw at the local big store, didn't look like it would fit the bill
but I might give it a try.
