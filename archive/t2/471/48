Subject: Re: [T2] Pop Top staple strip

Hello Volks

I used the old strips,previously soaked in hot water to  get them softer, to
hold the tent I use 1/2 heavy duty staples with a manual stapler, an
electric one must do the job easier but with the mechanical one you can do
it with out problems, you must took the staples out but hand anyway and it
is a much tougher job thet put then in. A friend of mine use an aluminium
strip about the same size of the origynals plastic strip and Stainless Steel
screws to keep it in place.
