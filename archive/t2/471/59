Subject: RE: Electric Windshield Washer on '78?

I did this on my 71, which has the earlier style dashboard mounted
wiper/washer switch.  I removed the fluid valve and replaced it with a Radio
Shack pushbutton switch mounted on a homemade bracket.  Works great.

I'm unfamiliar with the later bus switch and I can't imagine that it is
anything like what I have, but, if you want to send some good photo's of it,
perhaps I could come up with a way to convert it.....
