Subject: new temperature sensor source?

Hi,

I recently found the temperature sensor in my '80 injected vanagon to 
be the source of my cold start problems.  Its resistance was not up to
spec.

It fits in the cylinder head just behind the #3 plug and tells the
computer the engine temp. so it can adjust the mixture.

I believe the part number is:

022-906-041  

Bus Boys site lists them for $20.10
(but listing doesn't always mean someone has an item.)

The original ones were Bosch.
(I would think there was more than one application.)

Is this item still produced?

Bus Depot doesn't list them and my local VW dealer couldn't seem to
find it by the part number ( I may just need to go in person instead
of calling....usually you get better service face to face).

Is this a hard thing to find new?

If not, I call Bus-Boys or keep searching.


Sincerely,
--
