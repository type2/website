Subject: Re: [T2] Gas heater

I think there are probably a number of heaters out
there that are downright unsafe for use in the bus,
and certainly if they (or any others for that matter) 
are improperly installed, vented, supplied.  The
original supplier to VW of these heaters was a German
company named Eberspacher (aka Espar in the USA) and
they manufactured the BN4.
I'm not aware of other names which are "certified" for
use in the bus, though there are probably some out
there.

And now if I can I make a selfish plug: I have a never
used BN4 for sale in E***Bay under item #2439016006 --
there is a photo.  Some lucky bus owner will be
getting it for the *low* price of $199 unless someone
gets to it first in the next 10 hours.   I have lots
of photos at http://photos.yahoo.com/j_griffin100
under the Eberspacher Folder.

Good luck with getting your bus warmed up!
