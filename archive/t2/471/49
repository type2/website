Not everyone, but most are. Most assume if it screws in there without 
stripping the threads they are good to go. The German item will cost you a 
dollar per year of life and one R&R. The junk might or might not last 5 
years. Many don't. And you will need at least 4 or 5 R&R's in the life of 
the German item. But soon your troubles will be over, no more decisions to 
make. The German item will be NLA due to lack of justifiable sales and then 
the price of the junk will jump to $20, for the same $5 crap. That's reality.
