Anyone know where I can find a new felt sealing washer and the metal
ring that centers in in the flywheel for a type IV (2.0L). The Vanagon
part number is 021-105-311. I am not sure if it is similar to the 1600 
engines,whose parts number is 111-105-311. I do not think either number 
includes the metal ring that centers the felt washer. Any idea where to find 
one of these?

I've been having getting these small engine parts from BD also. Does the felt

I've been looking for the metal washer with 5 holes, 021-105-275. The only 
places I've found are the online porsche vendors and Porsche dealer.>> 

Hey guys, Is BD maybe temporarily out of stock on these items? Just last 
month I ordered and received(from BD) the metal gasket (021-105-275) and the 
felt ring (111-105-311), for my 1.7l 72 engine. I also ordered a new pilot 
bearing, it didn't come with a felt washer. Aren't most such engine parts 
interchangable between ac vanagons and type 4 busses?
