Subject: Re: [T2] Felt Pilot Bearing Seal and metal retaining

The metal washer I am talking about is actually the bushing that takes up
some of the space in the flywheel where the pilot shaft goes through. Used
to keep felt washer from creeping out of the flywheel. It has been
suggested that I just have a machine shop make one. In the old flywheel I
have, the bushing is just a cheap piece of aluminum thin walled pipe. just
wondering if anyone had ever seen this around as it certainly would be
easier to buy then have a shop make it.

By the way, BD states that the felt washer is now back in stock (for a
while). Also it appears that Pelican parts also carries it.
