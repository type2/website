Hello All,

I have used Stewart Warner/Southwind heaters for over 5 years in VW's without 
any problems.  They were manufactured for installation in the US as a dealer 
add on item.
I actually just installed one in a bus yesterday and the owner was toasty 
warm on his drive home.
I am now rebuilding Stewart Warner heaters and have a very limited few 
available.  If you need one rebuilt or need installation instructions/owners 
manuals, I can provide photocopies at a reasonable price.
AS state previously parts to rebuild these heaters are available from Rick 
Taylor.
If anyone has any questions, please email me off the list.
Regards,
Al
