Subject: SNOW

Well, I just thought I would share the news with you all that its 
snowing like it means business here in Calgary, which is nice as I am 
going to be in the garage for a while working on the bus it would seem. 
Get the clutch sorted then finish the undercoating and seam sealing.

I am really going to need to order those Nokian tyres.
