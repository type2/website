Subject: camper equipment mounting hardware

Hello all -

I'm in need of the mounting hardware for  the camper equipment in a '71 Westy.  I've got the side cabinet, the bed, upper shelf, and the rear facing seat, but do not have any of the mounting hardware.  Perhaps someone is parting out a like bus?

Also, if anyone knows the various sizes for this stuff or can tell me where I can look it up, that would be great too.

thanks,
Brian 
'71 Westy
