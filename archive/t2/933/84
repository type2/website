<<Probably the Yokohama Y356 in load range C if you are only going by
price. $58/tire at Tire Rack right now.>>

This is right on the top of the worst new tire's I have ever
purchased--Hands down.
Had them siped at Discount tire a,d they still were terrible in the wet
& snow.
An awfully hard riding tire, and short winded--22-3,000 miles and they
were done.

They wear real funny--the outboard edges--maybe 2" on the inside &
outside of the tread wears off---bald first, the inside still has some
tread left.

Phooey.

I'll tell ya about the tires I have on both My VW Vans right now and I'm
really happy with them.
No arguing now--I'm just telling ya'll what I have found.

P 225x70R14's Cooper Road Hugger GT's AT's--C rated.
They are car tire's.
But they are rated at 1648 lbs.(-at-) 36 psi.

And doing the calculations --subtracting for the DOT requirements--etc.
they still fall within the safety limitations that is required.

I think each wheel is supposed to have something like 1400 lbs rating
minimum per tire--these fall in at 1428 lbs per wheel.

So they are right there.

They handle nice, ride nice, wear very well, and give real good all
weather traction.

They cost $64.00 each at Discount tire $309.46 mounted, balanced,taxed,
etc.

Come with a 50,000 mile warrantee.

The Yokohama's 356's come with no warrantee---
They are rated as a commercial tire--and are not covered for
nothin--your on your own with them.

You were looking for some decent hoops---

These Cooper's I am very happy with.
