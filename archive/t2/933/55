That was on a split.  On a bay, the "nose" of the box goes through a
tunnel in the frame rail.

I'm not saying that it couldn't be done, but I'd have to be _really_
motivated to do it, such as by the complete lack of rebuilt or used early
boxes.

IIRC, the raising of steering boxes is to prevent their scraping on the
ground on lowered buses.  I guess if you have already hacked your bus
enough to get the steering box within scraping distance of the ground a
little more hacking to raise the steering box isn't significant!
