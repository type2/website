Just so everyone knows.

I have the complete left rear pane of glass sitting in my garage.

I am afraid it could be broken.

I had to replace the whole pane because the window was so badly rusted 
out that my bodyman refused to put the window in the same way, he wanted 
a continuous pane in there.

So, now it is a mirror image of the right side.
