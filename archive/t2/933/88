Hey George,

Someone came up with a posting a week or two ago--not here but on one of
the Vanagon lists, while having pretty much same kinda tire discussion.

Now--with all factor's added subtracted, & divided, from the formula
which Mr. Chase has come up with the hoops I described were withing the
proper parameters of load range safety.

The minuim weight rating on each tire factored in at 1400 lbs using Mr.
Chases formula--or the DOT's anyway.

They are 6 ply tires.

Now, and I don't know if the Type 2 Bus requires more side wall, or
plies to get the job done than the rolling bricks--but these hoops I
described, and am using are OK, and if they had the squirm I wouldn't
have bought another set of them for my 87 Westy.

I fit the first set on my 89 Carat and worked out OK.

One question I was thinking about reflecting back when radial tires
first came out, I recall advertisement and technical information sheets
when there was the big move from Bias ply tires to the radials--
And I do remember this--

The advantage of the radials were to be able to rolll with the road in a
corner, where the bias tire sidewall didn't.
The rolling of the sidewall in corner's especially on the wheel was
allegedly the ticket for long tire wear & a big advantage in handling &
stability.

Now ,all of a sudden this theory is out the window here in VW land.

How Come?

If the radial tire isn't up to the job, why don't folks just go back to
he stiff sidewall bias ply tire's?

This sure makes plenty of sense to me--
 
Clementine's tires are still Ok so I didn't have to replace them.
