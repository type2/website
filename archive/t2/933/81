My friendly local Discount Tire quoted me $110 each
for the CQ (studless) 185R14's and I'll be buying 4.
This is just the tire price - another $11 per for
mounting. I will let you all know if this is the
"final" price!

Just a little more info: Both the 185 and the 195 bear
no aspect ratio number - they are 80% aspect ratio -
the "old standard"

On 5.5" rims, the 185's are 25.6" diameter and 7.4"
overall width

On 5.5" rims, the 195's are 26.2" diameter and 7.8"
overall width

The CS (from what I gather) is targeted toward "mild
winter use" and "improved all-season capabilities."
They are not studded.

The C2 is studded or studable.

The CQ is non - stud targeted for heavy use in snow
and ice.

All three designs bear the Snowflake emblem - Severe
service.

Hope this all helps - and I hope they're as good as
I've been lead to believe! -BaH
