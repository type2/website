Subject: RE: [T2] Where can I order this shifter part?!

Gary,

Only 68-74 are available new.

I think I have one from a 79 that I could send you off-list. If I remember
it still had the factory anodizing on it and looked in great shape.

BustedBus or Bus-Boys would both be able to provide excellent used units and
could guarantee quality.

I replaced my bad shifter, and when I pulled it out I noticed that my  
shifter rod
(part G on this image: http://www.bus-boys.com/shift6879.gif )
Has a crack in the front housing that the shifter ball sits in.

i want to replace it, but when I do find them on line, like at Bus  
Boys they say that they are used.  Do any of you know if this part is  
available new?

Thanks,
