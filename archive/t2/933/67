That's not the one I was looking for but it sounds right.  I know the drag link is the trick.  Thanks...KR

After the tie-rods are adjusted to set the proper toe at the wheels,
jack up the front wheels and turn the steering wheel all the way left,
then counting rotations, all the way right. Then go back half of what
you counted and this should center the road wheels.

Disconnect the drag link from the steering box pitman arm and recenter
the steering wheel (all the way left, then halfway right just as
before).

Now that the steering box is centered you can adjust the drag link at
the pitman arm to fit. All done.

If the steering wheel isn't perfectly straight you can now (and only
now) pull it off the column and adjust it. You will see two lines
marked on the wheel and the column to show where the factory thought
the parts should have been aligned.


I think I described this incorrecly.

To get the road wheels straight ahead you need to eyeball it and
remember what position to steering wheel likes to reside. Afterwards
you can disconnect the draglink and center the steering box with the
steering wheel.
