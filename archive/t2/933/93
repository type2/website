* Larry's website page on the correct tire has disappeared. It was:
http://www.roadhaus.com/Tires/Guideline.html
But in it, he said the weight rating was 1560 lbs for the correct reinforced sidewall or Commercial tire. Not
sure where you are getting the 1400 figure from.
All Larry has now on his Roadhaus website is this link:
http://www.roadhaus.com/tires.html
And if you look at the 1st tire listed, a BF Goodrich, it says Max load 1515 lbs. and then below it it says
Meets Specifications: NO

What you are confusing is total weight a tire can handle sitting still vs total weight a tire can carry while
moving.
From the NHTSA website:

Maximum Load Rating
This number indicates the maximum load in kilograms and pounds that can be carried by the tire.

Key word is "carried".

The rolling of the sidewall in corner's especially on the wheel was
allegedly the ticket for long tire wear & a big advantage in handling &
stability.

* All of a sudden?!?

No, VW has specified the correct tire to be either a reinforced sidewall or a Commercial tire since the mid
70's in print. Go read page 53 of the 79 owners manual

On the Tire Sticky on the Samba website, I posted pics of page 51 of the 78 owners manual but the website is
gone now.

 the stiff sidewall bias ply tire's?

Getting educated makes more sense........
