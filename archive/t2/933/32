Hi Gilles,

Fill the tank. Document the milage on the odometer.  Carry a spare  
gallon just in case.

WRecord the odometer reading when the fuel gauge reads three  
quarters, half, one quarter, and empty.

Refill the tank, and determine the milage between notches on the  
gauge. If they're roughly equal, the gauge is accurate.

In my experience it is common for the gauge to remain in the full to  
three quarters range for quite a while, and then quickly drop to a  
quarter tank and slowly run down to empty.

FYI, a dry tank will take 15 US gallons of fuel to fill. (55 Liters).


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
