Subject: 70 deluxe question

I bought a '71 sunroof deluxe this weekend to restore. It has strengthening
panels welded across the bottom center section between the inner frame rails
and between the frame rails and rockers to compensate for the sunroof. I
have seen this before on early bays.

 

Then I saw a '70 deluxe with only panels welded underneath the bus between
the outside of the frame rails and the rockers. These are definitely
original. It doesn't have a gas heater, no sunroof, not a camper and the
only one I have ever seen. The only thing different is that is had evidence
of a factory hitch. Any thoughts? ETKA says nothing.
