Subject: Steering box question

Hi,

I see that the 68-72 and 73-79 use different steering boxes. Is the
later model retro-fitable to my '71?

Found a tight spot in my steering - I'm sure it will drive fine for a
while longer but figured I'd better start shopping around, just in
case.

Anyone have a 68-72 box in good shape they would care to part with?

Thanks
Jules
