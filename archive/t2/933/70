 That's a pretty good description though the first two steps are a bit
confusing. I think I'll let the alignment place off the hook on the
centering process - just have them set the camber and toe. Then I plan
to set the centering myself by the following process:

Adjust drag link until it drops into the pitman arm.
Then, depending where it ends up, I'll pull the steering wheel off and
reposition to my liking (I like the spokes at about the 10, and 4
position allows me to read the speedo and oil pressure simultaneously,
the OP guage being just to the left of my steering column)

Be warned that not having the steering wheel centered will mean your turn signals will not cancel correctly
and you will probably break your steering wheel trying to remove it.......
