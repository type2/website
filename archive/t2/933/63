Subject: re: Split my first case!

Oh no - memories of peeling a seal from the head of a nissan pulsar are 
coming back. The block is aluminum, so I had to be very careful not to 
scratch it.

I used carburetor cleaner, and a plastic tool (like an old toothbrush filed 
down to a chisel-point: think softer plastic or nylon, maybe even popsicle 
sticks??). The gasket was STUCK on there. It took hours of spraying, then 
trying to pry and scrape the stuck-on gasket off with the plastic tool - but 
I finally got it. However, there's got to be a better way to do this: The 
carb cleaner ate through the rubber gloves and a few layers of my skin and 
fingernails.

---- wait a minute: we (art teachers) cut blocks of clay with a section of 
wire. What if you get some strong fish-line and hold the line tight, wiggle 
it beneath the seal? Floss the seal off?
