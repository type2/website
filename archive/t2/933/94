Thanks for the responces everyone.  I've got a nice list going now :)  Hope
it makes it in the archives.

Mark,  believe me...I've thought about trucking it out there.  And I might
have if I had a little more time.  I'd love to see you and Kelly get your
hands on this bus.  I am happy to see it finally get back on the road
though...this being the first bus in my life.

Oh yea, still just three kids.

Peace,

Troy
