1st things 1st: Is there slack on the pushrod when the
brake is not applied? 


2nd: The light comes on because there is an imbalance
between the two chambers. You do need to get that air
out of there (brakelight switches)

3rd: Tighten the first star wheel. Get in the bus and
pull the parking brake on as hard as you can then
release it. Go back and check to see if you can
tighten that star wheel any more now. Loosen it until
the wheel turns with minimal (almost none) drag. Do
the other star wheel the same but of course they
rotate opposite directions. When through with that
wheel, switch to other wheel and remember that the
directions for tightening are swapped from the other
wheel.

Normally I would say that as you tighten you should
get in and stand on the brake pedal as hard as you
can, but if you still have no solid pedal, that's not
gonna help anything. The parking brake does not center
the shoes quite the same as the wheel cylinder does,
but it's better than nothing.

I do believe you still have air in the rear brake
circuit and in the master cylinder itself especially
at the light switches. Hope this helped. -BaH
