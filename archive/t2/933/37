Subject: Where can I order this shifter part?!

I replaced my bad shifter, and when I pulled it out I noticed that my  
shifter rod
(part G on this image: http://www.bus-boys.com/shift6879.gif )
Has a crack in the front housing that the shifter ball sits in.

i want to replace it, but when I do find them on line, like at Bus  
Boys they say that they are used.  Do any of you know if this part is  
available new?

Thanks,
