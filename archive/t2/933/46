Sounds like you're on the right track, fix the known
problems, get an alignment, and go from there.  If you
get aligned at an air-cooled shop, they will probably
be able to identify any lingering suspension issues.

Also, did you check the front wheel bearings for
proper play? Mine ended up too loose once, creating
woobliness.

If your brake booster still works, it's diaghram is 
probably OK.  Liquid in there could come from the MC
side (brake fluid leak) or maybe from your worn front
vent hose if you drive through a lot of water. Color
sounds more like brake fluid than rusty water though.

I can't think of any way that rubber brake hoses could
have anything to do with liquid in the booster.
