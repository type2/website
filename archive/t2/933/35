Howdy all,
Just a quick note to all of you out in type 2 land. I have been a quiet member of 
type 2.com for many years, and have enjoyed reading all the great information, and 
occasionally responding when I could.
Things at home are getting busier all the time, and I just don't find the time to read 
the e-mails nowaday's, so the time has come for me to sign off.
For those of you that know me, I can still be contacted on this e-mail address.

The good news is my bus ('77 Deluxe micro bus) is still going strong, and is truely 
part of our family, and in true "kombi" fasion is evolving yet again, as it has done 
over the years to meet the needs of our growing family.

Anyway, a big thaks to all of you that have helped me over the years, and 
hopefully I will be back again soon!

Richard,

full of parts....)
