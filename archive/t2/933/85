<<Probably the Yokohama Y356 in load range C if you are only going by
price. $58/tire at Tire Rack right now.>>

>>This is right on the top of the worst new tire's I have ever
purchased--Hands down. Had them siped at ??Discount tire a,d they still
were terrible in the wet & snow. An awfully hard riding tire, and short
winded--22-3,000 miles and they were done.<<

The Y356s say "Highway Rib Summer". This seems pretty apparent they
arent meant for wet conditions.
I have Y356s, and I bought them knowing the were "Highway Rib Summer".
Luckily I live in the desert, where it rains twice a year, and never
snows.
