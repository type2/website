I had my muffler, heat exchangers, heat control boxes, and all associated parts coated here:

Stuff comes in black, silver, white, grey, and looks great.

They sandblast, then spray on the product wet,  it gets baked to 500F and is guaranteed to 2000F after.  They do race car exhaust systems.  Aluminum phosphate based stuff.
