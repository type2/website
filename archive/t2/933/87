The manual for my '71 specifies 1520 pounds as the minimum load rating
for the proper reinforced tires.

Passenger tires must be derated by 9% to determine light truck load
capacity.  Doing the math  backwards, this means that a passenger tire
has to be rated at 1670 pounds to meet the intent of the 1520 pound
reinforced tire specification.

I used to use passenger tires too, until two of them decided to have belt
separations in the 100 mile stretch between Olancha and Bishop,
California.

Since then it has been 8-ply 185R14s!
