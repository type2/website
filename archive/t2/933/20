good point peter.... so that birngs me to this question then....
   
  how much drag do i need on  the first start before i start on the second....?
   i usually let the tire stop and then back off a little bit from stop...
   
  then start next start until i hit stop again and then back off a little bit.... so there is a slight drag in my tire when i spin it....
  does this sound right guys..?
   
  thanks
  chai

  I'm not sure how sensitive bus brakes are to this, and I noticed you said
the brakes were adjusted, but the brakes on my mini (drums at all four
wheels) have to be adjusted quite tight or the brakes require pumping to
operate. I have noticed that the play in the pedal is much less on the bus
when the brakes are adjusted properly.
