Subject: Repair shops in the Denver/Colorado Springs area

Archives aren't helping me much here and my list of other groups I trust are
limited.  So, here I am.  As much as I would like to get my 78 transporter
up and running on my own, I simply don't have the time.  So I am trying to
compose a list of repair shops that people here feel are good enough for a
recommendation.  The bus will need quite a few things looked, including a
2.0 FI rebuild, new brake lines, rotors, pads, MC, CV's, wiper motor, shift
linkage inspection/adjustment, and a variety of other tasks.  My goal is to
get it running and driveable, so there are some items that can wait for a
bit.  Shop location can be anywhere from the Denver area down to Colorado
Springs.  I'm pretty open and don't mind going a little out of that range if
it means a shop with a better reputation.

Any thoughts?

Thanks,
