I personally use the 195 Hankook from Bus Depot.

http://busdepot.com/view.jsp?model=8&category=48&group=148&prodgroup=-1

Well priced and good performance. Not a winter tire per se but got me
through last winter in upstate NY with no problems.

the 195's run $89(US) each
the 185's run $76(US) each

What's the price tag on those "Woosung SV 820"'s?
