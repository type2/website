<<i have installed new master cylinder and got all air out of brake
lines and my pedaL Is still just as soft as before but at least i can
feel my front brakes grab now...>>

You still have air in the lines, if the pedal is still soft, or the back
brakes aren't adjusted up all the way.

<<. before i couldn't feel that... 
i used a whole big bottle of brake fluid up also... 
the lines don't have air in them now... and my adjustment on the brakes
is
good..... >>

Fill the master up, and crack one wheel bleeder at a time---start in the
back of the Bus first.
Let the fluid run for a minute or two--
Fill the master up--go to the next wheel--do the same, do all the wheels
the same way.

Let gravity do the work for you.

Now---get someone to push on the brake pedal with the rear drums off to
verify if the rear wheel cylinder's are working properly--or at all.

It could either be a collapsed brake hose, or bad cylinder's.
If one is bad--replace them on both sides--cylinder's and or the hoses.

If they are---adjust up the rear brakes tight, and hit the pedal---see
if it has come up .

If so--back off the adjuster a hair just so the rear wheels aren't
dragging , and you should be on the money.

If the pedal is still spongy--you have a bad master cylinder.
