Discount Tire was able to pull through for me when I looked for snow/ice
tires with the proper load range when I owned the Guac.  Like Richard said
though, they aren't cheap.  I don't have the reciept in front of me at the
moment but I believe I was right around the $1k range for a set of 5 Hakka
CS's.  The performance of these tires in the snow and ice though?  Simply
amazing.
