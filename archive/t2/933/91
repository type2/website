Terry,

Arrgggh....several years ago the Y356 tires were thought(by the list) to 
be pretty good.

Close up view here :http://www.shockwaverider.com/newbus/picture-005.html

Hmmm..but seems I specifically remember that mine were load range "d"

So what the heck happened?

The ones on my 78 seem fabulous to me.  No funny wear patterns.
And in the rain, they stop as good or *better* than on the dry.
A panic stop at 50mph in the rain will absolutely make red stripes on your 
body from the seatbelts.  My wife and I tested this several years ago
on a trip to get a Christmas tree from the local store.

And compared to much more expensive tires on several other
cars I have on the same roads, they are *not* "hard"...of course, maybe I 
am just weird, cause I think my KYB gas shocks are "soft"...and Richard 
thinks they are hard as rocks....


What part of "wet" do you have a problem with?
Hydroplaning?  Stopping? Turning?
Deep water?


Cheers, dave
