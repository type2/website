Subject: Re: [T2] 68-69 vin plate locations

The first year the Vin Plate appeared on the dash was 1969.  The USDOT
didn't require it on the dash until January 1969 production forward, so some
early 69s didn't have them.  The Main Vin plates with all the codes &
stuff behind the seat continued in that spot as well to 75 I believe.
