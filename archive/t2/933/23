Let me suggest another possible problem.  If one of the rubber hoses, in the
brake system, has gone soft it could be expanding as it comes under
pressure.  It kind of acts like a balloon. Have someone press the brake
pedal down while you check the hoses.  I don't think it's a common problem,
but one I had years ago.

HELP........ ~!~...

i have installed new master cylindr and got all air out of brake lines and
my pedaL Is still just as soft as before but at least i can feel my front
brakes grab now.... before i couldnt feel that...

good.....

the e brake works awesome but the back brakes arent working with the
pedal..? pedal is way to soft....

i am gonna end up driving to work using my ebrake this week i cant go
through another week like last week no vehcile getting shuttled around....
