Subject: rear hatch torsion bar replacement

Hello David,
              I fixed this kind of problem on a 69 Type 3 squareback ~20 years 
ago... so the value of my recollection is limited.  The bushings in the arms 
were pretty severely worn, ditto the clevis pins.  I was able to buy new arms 
and made the pins on a buddy's lathe.  The _key_ to reinstalling everything was 
a tool made from a large screwdriver (or maybe tyre spoon) -- I used an 
oxy/acet torch to re-shape into a J shape.  With this tool you can then 
reinstall the torsion bars.  I still have the tool someplace and may have the 
write-up from an old Bentley... so if you are interested in pursuing, let me 
know.  Where are you located, in a rough geographic sense?

The torsion bars that raise the rear hatch on my 68
bus are sprung. the joints in the arms that connect to
the torsion bars are worn as well. Has anyone ever
replaced these bars? I was staring up at them while
camping a couple of weeks ago and I think I know how
to remove them. I am just looking for some advise and
tips. Also, I will have pictures of my trip to
Linville Falls soon. Boy, do i have a story to tell.
Thanks!
