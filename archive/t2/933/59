Hi,

I'm looking for the alignment procedure documents on ratwell.com and I
cannot seem to find them.  Can someone point me in the right
direction?


Thanks

The manager told me the guy cursed for an hour before he got it right.  Then I noticed the grease marks on the Bentley and Richard's stuff.   Good luck...KR
