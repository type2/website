I'm glad someone else discovered this trick. It frustrated me for years that I was able to do everything including removing and installing engines and trannys, but still felt dependent on someone to help bleed brakes.  Then I discovered that just letting the fluid trickle out by gravity works. In fact since adopting this technique my brakes have been harder and tighter than ever before. 

Cheers,
