Subject: Best bang for the buck tires.

OK, so let's shop the other side of the market for us 'regular' folk and find
the best bang for the buck. No way I am EVER going to be able to put 1000
bucks of tire on my old Westy (Hakka's or Agilas). So without starting a tire
war what's the best cheap tire out there. The Woosung SV 820 with 8ply rating
Load Range D? It would appear that the FAQ's out there at roadhaus etc are
getting a bit long in the tooth, with many of them NLA. Right now I have brand
new Laredo LR C tires on mine, put on by the PO.
