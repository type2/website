Hi,

As for the turn signal canceling ring. I have found that by rotating
the turn signal assembly around the steering column a few degrees I am
able to compensate for the steering wheel being off and still have the
turn signal canceling work well. Of course this is on my '71, and I
doubt it would apply to later model years with the turn signal
assembly integrated into the column. Not having ever owned a later
model year bus this is of course only speculation on my part.

As for removing the steering wheel, I've had to do it before to fix a
problem with the lock assembly. A steering wheel puller tool only
chipped the wheel material. What worked was loosening the nut then
bringing out the BFH and taking a few whacks while alternately pulling
on opposite ends of the wheel.

The following tip suggested by J Barry Burneskis  (8/10/2005) has
worked for me in the past:

"(1)loosen the nut under the horn button, but do not take the nut of the
steering shaft; (2) pull up on both sides of the steering wheel, using both
hands (3) Have a helper smartly smack the steering shaft (with the nut still
on) with a BMFH"


thanks
