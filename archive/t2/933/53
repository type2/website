Subject: More from Nokian North America

I asked David Fontaine at Nokian North America two
questions about sourcing tires for our vans. I had
been to several dealers and had studied numerous web
sites and had no clear picture of what they offered.
The authorized Nokian dealers told me flat out that
Nokian does not import any tires suitable for our
buses. The Discount dealer near where I work tried a
little harder and came up with some information but it
was incorrect information.

The first question was regarding what tires they sell
that are appropriate for our buses. His answer:

David Fontaine [Nokian N.A.]wrote:
Hi Dave,
Our Hakka CS, CQ, and C2 lines are all load range D in
the 185R14 and 195R14.  These are not big sellers here
in North America so many dealers arent familiar with
them.  We do carry a complete stock on all of them, so
you should be able to source these without a problem. 
Thank you for contacting us.

My second question was regarding the Hakka2 line which
my friendly local Discount Tire store told me offered
a load range C tire:

Hi Dave,
These two sizes that you mentioned [185R14 & 195R14]
in the Hakka 2 line are not load range C tires.  They
are only standard load.  If you are looking for load
range C or D for your application the only lines to
consider are Hakka CS, Hakka C2, and Hakka CQ.  Any
studdable tires that we sell are available factory
studded or unstudded.
Best regards,
David
[One TireFactory dealer told me that Nokian studdable
tires are only available factory studded.]

I still haven't gotten pricing! At least this clears
up what they do / don't offer to their apparently
ignorant dealers! -BaH
