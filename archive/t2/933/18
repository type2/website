I'm not sure how sensitive bus brakes are to this, and I noticed you said
the brakes were adjusted, but the brakes on my mini (drums at all four
wheels) have to be adjusted quite tight or the brakes require pumping to
operate.  I have noticed that the play in the pedal is much less on the bus
when the brakes are adjusted properly.
