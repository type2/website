<<so what yall are saying is just crack one bleeder at a time>>

Yep---let'er run right outa them bleeder's.---

<< with no jar or hose hoooked up to it...?>>

I ain't sure if the jar would fit over the bleeder, but you could put a
hose on the bleeder , and a jar, can or pan under it  just so you won't
have the brake fluid running all over the gragage floor--

This is optional.

<< and then let gravity take the fluid out the cracked bleeder..? will
it not suck air back in...>>

It can't.
Gravity only pulls the fluid one way--out.
 
it'll run right outa the brake lines right onto the floor, jar, can, or
pan--with the air that's in them.

It's pretty basic and simple, and I've been doing the bleeding this way
for 40 some years---If I don't have anyone around to give me a hand to
pump up the on the brake pedal prior to bleeding--a two man job.
