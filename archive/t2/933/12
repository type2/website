HELP........ ~!~...

i have installed new master cylindr and got all air out of brake lines and my pedaL Is still just as soft as before but at least i can feel my front brakes grab now.... before i couldnt feel that...

i used a whole big bottle of brake fluid up also...

the lines dont have air in them now... and my adjustment on the brakes is good.....

the e brake works awesome but the back brakes arent working with the pedal..? pedal is way to soft....

i am gonna end up driving to work using my ebrake this week i cant go through another week like last week no vehcile getting shuttled around.... that was way tomuch for all of us..

any help here would be much appreciated... or does it sound like i got a bad master cylinder from advance....???? 



                                                                Better start thinking about sealing up those windows and leaky doors....
