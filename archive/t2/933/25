Subject: 69 westy with 71+ brakes?

Howdy,

So I finally got to work on my brakes and strange thing is that my bus 
has 71+ style drums in the back and discs in the front.  Is this a 
common upgrade for the older busses?  Is the wheel shaft and housing end 
with the splines longer on the pre 71 bus which would explain the large 
washer behind the castellated nut on my bus and the fact the splines 
stick out about 1/8" maybe?  Anyone see any issue with this?  With the 
washer on the castellated nut is plenty tight when torqued down.

Thanks,

Stephen
