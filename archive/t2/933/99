Subject: RE: [T2] Best bang for the buck tires.

I guess the tire war is on again here so what the hell, flame suit donned... 
   
  I bought the Yokohama 356's 3 years ago for my 78. I live in Annapolis, MD and drive my bus all year. Not a daily driver but I do drive it in all conditions. The 356's have been great for me. Maybe I am a dolt and dont know a good tire from a bad one but these now have 23,000 miles on them and they look great. I keep my bus aligned and suspension in good shape. I have not had any more problems in the rain with these tires than any other tire on a VW bus. Its not like these are the best vehicles for high speed slalom driving in the rain. The price was right. A lot less than the Agilis and FWIW these tires have done me just fine. But as always YMMV.
