Kevin -

That is correct and I made mention of this in a previous post on 10/24/2011:

"Unfortunately there is NO definitive wiring diagram for the Late 68-69
Type 2 either on-line, Samba or in Bentley.  Bentley's diagram is for
the early 68 Type 2 despite what it says it is.

"I am working on a subdiagram for the turn signal/hazard lights that I
hope to have uploaded to my website soon to better address and solve
the confusion."
