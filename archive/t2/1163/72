There is no reason to not use synthetics in older cars, there may have 
been early in the development of synthetics, but it is more of an old 
mechanic's tale than anything else.  I run synthetics in all my engines 
regardless of age and make and have yet to have a single problem.

The book says to run 30wt year around in the air cleaner, but mentions 
using 10wt in subarctic conditions.  I would thing that running a 10w-30 
year around would work in most areas, YMMV.
