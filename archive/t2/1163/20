nope looks right, I usually get something under that metal lip and lever 
it right out, sometimes it is a bugger but mostly it will pop out.

I have noticed no difference in the metal ringed ones and the rubber 
covered ones, although I think the rubber covered ones are the only ones 
avaliable. at least I haven't seen a new metal ringed one in years.

be careful not to score the inside of the bore but you have already 
fubared the current seal so do what you need to get it out, then press the 
new one in evenly until it is flush with the top of the case much like the 
old one is.  it will easily go in an inch or more but then it won't seal 
and tranny fluid will pour out and you will have to pull the engine again.

also usually when pulling an auto tranny engine the center shaft of the 
three will pull slightly out, make sure it is pushed all the way back in 
before putting on the convertor or the engine will not seat properly, hard 
to tell from the photo but it looks like yours might have pulled out a 
little they only come a 1/4 inch or so further out than the middle one.

good luck
