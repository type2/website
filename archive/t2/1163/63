Joe,

This is the first link when Googling "two pack paint".
http://www.austinsevenfriends.com/paint.htm


Very informative.. It describes
what "two pack" is and what cellulose is.

The previous owner of my bus did a
respray himself.  He probably used cellulose or some other spray-and-pray
paint.
When I got my left battery tray replaced by a reputable garage I asked
them to match and repaint the area.
They repainted the left rear quarter with
proper Neptune Blue (L50K) two-pack and the difference is astounding.  

The
other areas of the bus are already getting rust showing through, but that
two-pack-painted area look like it will weather the elements for a long time.
I would suggest doing the two-pack or possibly (gulp) roller painting by hand.
 There's a thread somewhere that I had seen about roller painting and the
results are spectacular if you take the time to do it correctly.

Josh

Okay - what is
cellulose paint in "American"? Acrylic Enamel? Lacquer?

What is 2K or
two-pack paints? Are we talking about base/clear paints?
