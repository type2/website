	The term would normally mean lacquer and implies 'thinners' & 
turps  -  water useless, NOT acrylic.

	I take this to mean the same as 'two-pot' which is the 
current term in NZ.  It means the paint is mixed just before use from 
2 pots.
	Some of these 2-pot paints feature volatile compounds which 
cause no apparent harm when first you breathe them but then if you 
later breathe similar chemicals you may suffer a severe attack of 
asthma.



>  Are we talking about base/clear paints?

	The base coat in such a setup could be a 2-pot, but there's 
no necessary connection.
