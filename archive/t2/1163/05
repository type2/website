actually they are just slightly thicker or something,  I've had some 
problems with the 3rd rate rotors slipping and of course engine stops the 
rev limiting rotor seems to be better made and haven't had this problem

maybe just my screwy engine, but it works.

only way my van will do 88mph is if I push it off a cliff
