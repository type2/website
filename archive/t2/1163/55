Hi Volks!

There's no use denying: I haven't been reading this list
for ages, just scanning the headers; I haven't owned a
Type 2 for even longer than that, and with their prices
skyrocketing I'm not likely to rectify that anytime soon,
if indeed ever; and I just don't have the time and energy
to treat your postings with the respect they deserve.

In other words, time to say goodbye. ;-(

But the affection remains of course.  So if any of you have
any problems that, being and speaking German and living in
Germany, you feel I might be of assistance in solving, do
feel free to drop me a line.  (And should I not respond
within a couple of days, do feel free to pester me until I
do.  I seem to need that at times.)

I'll see you when I'll see you ;-)

Airhowlingly yours,
    Ermel.
