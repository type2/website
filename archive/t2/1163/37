These were being OE made in Mexico for VW and the Puebla Beetle
production which stopped in 2004.  Since then VW has trashed out
tooling for hundreds of production & replacement parts.  Sorry, EMPI
Chinese is all that's available.  Time to hit the boneyards for the
good used OG stuff to recondition for your pleasure.
