Subject: RE:[T2] Replacing wiper Hose

I searched around, and went with some of your recommendations, and this is
what I was able to get to.

 

I could replace the hose from the wiper switch to the 'T' connector, then
from the 'T' connector to the passenger side nozzle. I also replaced the
hose from the Schrader valve to the tank. I could not get to the hose from
the 'T' connector to the driver's side nozzle, this one does not seem to
leak. I think I could get this hose off, but was worried I wouldn't be able
to get it back on. I may tackle the hose from the switch to the tank, but
this doesn't seem to be leaking either. I did cut the end of it off, and
reconnect it.

 

The hot water tip is good, I put the hose is a mug of really hot water for
about a minute, this seems to loosen up the end. I pressurized the system
and it seems to be holding pressure. I'll check again in a week or so. I
know it is not the 'modern' way to do it, but I think this is such a cool
system, if I really had my stuff together, I should have connected it to my
spare tire, like in my old squareback. I think the old valves had a safety
on them, that would only take so much pressure from the spare, so the spare
would not get too soft. I'm not sure if this valve has that, so I wouldn't
want to 'flatten' my spare.
