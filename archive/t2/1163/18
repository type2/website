Ok, I'm currently trying to remove the existing torque converter seal, and
it's not going as smooth as I expected. The link below is a picture of what I
am dealing with. The metal part in that picture, where I scored a line, does
not budge. But, the new seal I have (link #2) is about the same size in
diameter as that metal piece. Questions is, should that metal piece come out?
Why doesn't my new seal have this metal part, and is there something that I'm
clearly missing?

Also, I added more pic's in general to that gallery, including one of the
rebuild package that we found (from TranStar) and bought via Makco
Distributing.

Peace, Troy
