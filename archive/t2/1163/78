Subject: Re: [T2] Paint translation request - TCP Global paints

For those of you searching for reasonable priced paints in the correct colors, have a look at the link below. I have put up my link to the Yellow Chrome L-20A needed on my 77 Westy, but you can put in your own color needs and the TCP site shows you all the product they have for your particular paint. I'm probably going to use their own Resto paint. Check the price difference between it and the PPG etc.
