well with an auto tranny it is next to impossible to overrev (or lug) the 
engine it just won't let you and does the shift without your help or 
input.
yes you can force a shift and I guess if you are whipping along at 65 or 
so and accidently knock the shifter into 2nd it might overrev for a moment 
or two before it overides your shift and goes back to 3rd.

auto tranny's have thier problems but lugging and overreving arn't usually 
among them.
