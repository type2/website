Subject: Re: [T2] Leaking automatic transmission

You have everything you need.

The metal ring you scored is part of the old seal. You need to pry it out.
Rent a seal puller from your local auto parts store to make it easy. Be
very careful not to damage the case when you pry it out.

Your new seal has the metal part, it is just encased in orange silicone.

Hope this helps.
