This is what I am hoping. Best I can tell (and others too) it's from the bell
housing area.

I have a few, so hopefully one of them will be good. What are the signs of a
bad one other than major dings or cuts?

Check. This is actually the only thing I have done so far.

the starter side of the tranny it is an 010 tranny if on the dipstick side it
is 003 tranny

We (my wife) dug extra hard on the interwebs and found three available. I
shamelessly bought two, and left the one for someone else to find, scared that
I may never see one again for purchase. The second one, along with the
remainder of the first, will go with who ever buys the bus.
