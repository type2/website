An oil thread!
Even more controversial than the proposed
Mississippi Amendment 26!

You'll get as many opinions here as there are list
members.

First, I'll tell you what I use in my '79 Bay with a 1600 twin-port
rebuild.

I use my FLAPS own brand 20w50 mineral oil all year long.  It's
cheap, meets the VW spec, and it gets the job done.
(Halfords in the
UK http://www.halfords.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product_storeId_10001_ca
talogId_10151_productId_166289_langId_-1_categoryId_165581#dtab)
Then again,
I'm in the East Midlands of England so our summers and winters are not as
extreme as some places in the States.

My engine loves the stuff and just
glides on it.

I only allow 3000 miles between oil changes.
My bus is a daily
driver and does plenty of family vacations.
So that's about 60mph or less on a
daily basis and about 65 mph for highway travel for the vacations.

A LOT of
VW specialists in the UK use straight SAE 30 mineral oil.  Not a bad choice,
but with decent, cheaper multi-grades available, I don't see the point.

I
think more are coming around to see the multi-grade side of things.

As for
the Synthetic vs. mineral issue.  I've heard various theories.
I've heard the
"micro-gap" argument like you've stated, I've heard synthetic doesn't transfer
heat as well, I've heard that it's perfectly fine.
I can't really state any
technical reasons for or against synthetic.

My rule is, if you're changing it
every 3000 miles then it's not in your engine long enough to matter.

As long
as it meets the engine manufacturer's spec you're good.


The owner's manual
for a '70 bus shows 20w20, 10W (!), 5W (yikes!) for winter use depending on
your average temperature.

Then
look at less than a decade later at the '79 bus owner's manual.
http://www.thesamba.com/vw/archives/manuals/1_79_bus_uk/49.jpg

You now have a
host of multi-grade options that should see you though all year long.
Multi-grades got better so VW approved their use.
(Take time to note some of
the other gearbox and additive advice).

I looked on Autozone, and there are
plenty of 20w50 (and other grades) options from well known brands.  Your
choice of mineral or synthetic.


The Type 2 Library has plenty links on oils
(http://type2.com/library/mainten.htm#1).

VW Resource has some good links as
well.

Let the oil flame war
begin.

Subject: [T2] Mmineral. vs Semi-Synth oil???

Hello
Winter approaching and time of due oil change. Looking at the brands and
types
have to consider appropriate viscosity and type.
There are many brands who
state that they are semy- synthetic.
As far as I know for older cars it is
better not to use synthetic. I read
that the resoning behind is that the synth
has the tendency to be more
penetrating into micro gaps . Therefore the so
called Mineral Oil is betetr
.
Hm... thinking about our classic air filter and
what is better - denser or
more liquid viscosity ? :)
Any thoughts on this ?
Talking about 1600 VW t2 from 1970 with rebuild engine.

I would also
appreciate recommendations for trans fluid - type , brands
etc.

Peace and
Prosperity !
