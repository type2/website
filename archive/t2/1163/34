Yeah, there may have been a leak in the past, but not since I have had the
truck (about 4 years). I almost always have papers on the dash and an under
parcel tray-and it never has had any water on or in it. When I pulled my
truck into my garage on Saturday-it was coming out of a heavy rain, and
still everything inside was bone dry.

that rust inside is a hint that you may have a leak now or have had in the 
past.
