A rev limiting rotor is going to be far more useful in 1st or when 
shifting between gears than in 4th.  Dang easy to over rev when you have 
it floored pulling out into traffic off a shoulder and have the wheel 
loose traction, or when pulling out and hitting an ice patch.  I had the 
throttle stick once when I went to shift from 3rd to 4th in my first 
Thing, as I was already at redline this cost me an engine.
