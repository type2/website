Well, I just opened the tail lights. The passenger side one had the bulb
socket totally loose. I jammed it back in there, and now all seems to work
correctly. If this happens again, I'll probably solder the bulb holder to
the assembly.

 

After referring to my Bentley, I also realized the assembly was installed
upside down, which explained the hole in the assembly. I figured it was a
drain hole-and in the wrong spot, until I figured  out the assembly was
upside down.

 

I think the relay is working properly now, the brake sensor light does not
flash when headlights and turn signal are both on, although sometimes the
relay makes a funny noise. I'll give it a week or two of driving to see what
happens.

 

The wiper motor, is still not working. And when I try to turn the wiper on,
the gauges (I installed) light up. As the problems seem to be 'ground'
related, I wonder if I knocked the ground off the wiper motor when working
inside the dash. I'll see if I can find the wiper dash.

 

Oh yeah-while doing this work, I replaced the wiper switch itself, and
installed a new hose from the wiper switch to the t-connector for the washer
fluid. This got rid of the leak at the switch itself, now I have a leak at
that t-connector. I think I need to change all the hoses. 

 

Thanks again for the suggestions.any more on the wiper not functioning?
Probably a ground issue too?

Yes, just the rears use a dual element bulb.

 

I also have had a tough time with the chassis grounding system on 68-'69 T2
buses. It is not uncommon to have to run
