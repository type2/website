Subject: Re: [T2] '78 Westy draglink removed

For whatever it's worth, I picked up one of these from Harbor Freight  
when I went through the front end of my Bus .. everything *POP*ped  
apart beautifully, even the drag link off the pittman arm.   
Everything was OG-from-1975 and "stuck" barely begins to describe  
it. ;-/
