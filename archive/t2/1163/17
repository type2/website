Subject: Yellow/Green Recovered Vanagon seats plaid for 76-79 bus

I have a set of vanagon seats that I had recovered in the 76-79
yellow/green plaid.B  The butt surface as well as the back are in the
plaid, the rest is in a nice tan new vinyl.

I paid over $500 for the labor not counting the cost of the seats or
the plaid.B  Sadly, an unscrupulous person promised he would fix my van
for $$ down and lots of parts and he disappeared with both; at least I
have the seats.

Much nicer than the horsehair seats in the 76-79.B  A little taller,
fits perfectly on the rails for the 76-79 bus

$350.B  Will send pics if interested

approximately 1 hrs south of Winchester on I-81 in Waynesboro VA.B  2.5
hrs from DC.B  May consider delivering to DC with deposit payment in
advance (work during the week in DC).
