I'm a big fan of synthetic oils too - I even run it in my lawnmower. 
That was a waste b/c the deck rusted out and the engine still ran like a 
clock... LOL!

Seriously - what wore out at 175K miles?

I recently had the valve cover off of my 225K mile CR-V and the cam 
still shows machining marks everywhere on the cam but the tips of the 
lobes. Have run Mobil 1 since 1500 miles when I changed the oil to wash 
out any manufacturing debris.
