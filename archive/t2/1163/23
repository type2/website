Subject: Re: [T2] Leaking automatic transmission

(-at-) Jon & John, thanks for the pointer on the metal being covered by the new
rubber. I went and bought a $10 seal puller from the FLAPS and it popped right
out. Shot of the new one in place (-at-) http://goo.gl/dQJl7 . Got the transmission
and the engine installed today. Still need to hook up odds and ends, but
hopefully this is the end of the ATF leak. Thanks for the help everyone.

Peace, Troy
