Subject: Re: Success! (Getting a broken ez-out out of my crankshaft)

Two things I'm going to try to get the hollowed out bolt out. One: I  
got a set of extractors from Harbor Freight that chuck into a hand  
drill. I'm going to blast the back side of the bold with penetrating  
oil, and set the hand drill clutch so that it clicks, or whatever  
those things do when there's too much torque, and then work away at it  
until it moves.

The other thing I thought might be worth trying is to put just the  
right size lag bolt in and try tightening the hollow bolt in.

Any other ideas?
