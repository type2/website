The non greaseable type will last for twenty + years or 200K miles so 
there is little real reason to ever want to grease them.  I guess if you 
did frequent stream crossings and such a fitting to purge whatever water 
might enter would be good.  If your boots are shot, you can just drill a 
smallish hole in the center of the top and use a needle fitting to 
grease them.  Just leave a bit of grease over the hole to effectively 
seal the hole.
