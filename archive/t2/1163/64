Thank you Lourd Baltimore and Robert. LB - I googled for several terms 
but not "two pack paint". (DUH! LOL!)

I used lacquer on my '66 Mustang way back when and though it looked 
spectacular it was SO fragile. Any bumps chipped the paint badly. Don't 
know if it was the way I sprayed it or all lacquers.

The acrylic enamel of my bus has been tough but it obviously doesn't 
look like modern paint with a clear coat.

As for the two pack paint I don't have the safety equipment yet to 
safely spray that.

Thanks again guys!
