Subject: Cleco fastener size for panels and panel adhesive??

Can anyone recommend which size cleco fasteners to purchase to help with panel work? I'm replacing my rear wheel wells with the big size panels and am thinking that cleco fasteners and panel adhesive might be the way to go. I looked on Ben's website and he repaired a vanagon this way, and it turned out awesome!
