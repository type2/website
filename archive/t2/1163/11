I run across this every day when doing the purchasing for Airhead/VWG.
 There a few (the operative word is "few") items from Meyle that are very
good, but a lot are questionable.  As an example, I know the Chinese outfit
that makes the 111 905 865 L Ignition Switch for Meyle (and Febi
[informationally yours]).  These fit Late 74-79 Bugs, Buses, 80-91
Vanagons, a lot of inline 4 Vws - PURE garbage.  I had 5 of them literally
explode apart while sitting on the shelf.  Had one of these in my 914 the
3rd owner installed (I'm the 5th owner) gone bad and it literally fell
apart when I removed it.  Kostal only switches for me.

Haven't had any issues with the Kolbenschmidt items made elsewhere....yet.
