Subject: RE: [T2] OT: emergency flasher relay in a 1968

Well I took the dash apart this weekend. 

The problem I had was when the headlights were on, and I used the turn
signal, the brake reservoir light would come on. Additionally when I used
the turn signal, the lights outside would work fine, but the one on the dash
would only blink on once then off. I could hear the relay ticking back and
forth, but no interior light flashing. The brake reservoir light issue is
new, the other one I have had for a few years, but always intermittently.
Now it is constant. 

I installed a barrier strip - like this one
http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2103983 to connect the
grounds to (Thinking there was a problem with the grounds). Now when I turn
the windshield wiper on, the lights on my tach, oil pressure, and oil temp
gauge comes on. So something somewhere got screwed up. I'm going to try to
review all the wiring, but was wondering if  you guys had any pointer on
tracing this problem? 

Oh yeah, I did try to remove turn signal relay, and dismantle it. It was a
bit rusty inside, I tried to clean it up as best I could, but am ordering a
new one today. 

I did check my windshield area, and I see no leaks.

check for leaks around windshield.  since the relay is mounted upside down 
water can drip down and get into the relay and sometimes can last a long 
time.  caused me many grey hairs figuring out why my turn signals were 
wonky,    fixed leak in windshield and poured the water out of rely and 
has worked fine ever since
