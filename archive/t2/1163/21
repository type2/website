Subject: Re: [T2] PARTS NEEDED - ball joints with grease fittings

Nobody makes them anymore. However, you can easily tap a metric NPT fitting
into the top of a new set of balljoints.

They are now making them service free since the lubricant used in the
balljoints provides virtually lifetime lubrication. Well, as long as the
boots stay undamaged.

I'd just stick with the non-zerk style and make life easier on yourself.
