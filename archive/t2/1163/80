	Short of flaming, that may be challenged.
	True, the mfr's Instruction Manual (at least the 1972 edn) 
says 5000 km  ( = 3000 mi).
	But you don't have to go back v far in history to find 1000 
mi widely recommended  -  and that was on engines with an oil filter, 
whereas many VW engines lack that component.

	The only reason I've heard of is that multigrade which has 
done a lot of work in the engine (3000 mi, for instance? :-[) may 
fail to attain the viscosity in the top of its range  -  e.g what was 
supposed to be, say, SAE 20-50 is degraded to 20-30.  Even if that 
happens, what is the evidence that long hot running will cause rapid 
wear?  Won't the degraded multigrade still do about as well when hot 
as singlegrade SAE 30?  And presumably the main advantage of 
multigrade, v low viscosity when cold, will persist.
	Let me slip in a plug for my thesis supervisor Alex T. 
Wilson, who did the expts for an oil co. in 1955 using piston rings 
which incorporated a radionuclide.  Counting the radioactivity in the 
circulating oil every minute after cold startup established that 
nearly all the wear is in the first 10 min from cold startup.
Over-revving, or even worse, lugging, while cold is a v powerful way 
to cause rapid wear.

	My buddy who races a Jegwore D-type (replica) tried Mobil 1 
soon after it came out.  He found far too much of it got pumped 
'upstairs', so he burnt far too much oil.

	Oil is cheaper than bearings.  If in doubt, change it before 3000 mi.

	Sorry to introduce a degree of cynicism, but if it isn't made 
by a reputable mfr e.g Castrol, the claim 'meets the engine 
manufacturer's spec' may not be based on actual testing but more on 
mere PR.
	The own-label 'Halfords' is probably made by a major mfr, but 
it may be difficult to confirm that as a fact.

In my temperate climate I use Castrol 10W-40 year-round.
And I drive gently till the engine is warmed up.
