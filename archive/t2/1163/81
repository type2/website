Subject: Re: [T2] Mineral. vs Semi-Synth oil???

The need to change oil frequently changed considerably when PCV systems 
were added to engines.  I went long ago to synthetics and started doing 
annual or sometimes even less frequent oil changes on my engines with 
filters and good crankcase ventilation, sometime on my watercooled 
Vanagons this meant the engines were seeing 20,000 miles between 
changes.  The only real problems I have encountered doing this are that 
you still have to check and do the rest of the vehicle maintenance as 
specified by the book.  If you have u-joints or tie rod ends that need 
to be lubes at 2000 miles as do the ones on my Land Cruiser, you can't 
let them go for a year just because your oil will easily last that long.

Note that the stock VW crankcase ventilation systems are sub par 
compared with most systems out there, which means it either needs to be 
improved on or you shouldn't run longer than factory recommended oil 
changes.
