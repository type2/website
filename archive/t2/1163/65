Subject: RE: [T2] Replacing wper hose

Hey Max,

 

I replaced some of the hoses, and that seemed to fix my problems.

 

I don't think glue would have worked. I have used that stretchy
silicone-type tape on the hoses on my '65 bus. That worked well. The barbs
on my '69 are good enough that they are clamping on the washer system.

My solution has been not to use the spray. Mine currently do not leak at the
connectors but are starting to sweat water. I have considered using some
tape around the lines. 

If you can see the connectors, can you squirt some glue onto them? It might
be easier than replacing the entire system.
