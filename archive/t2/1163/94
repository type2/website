Subject: Success! (Getting a broken ez-out out of my crankshaft)

After many weeks using many techniques, I have finally gotten the  
broken ez-out out of my crankshaft center bolt. (2.0L engine).  
Technically, only part of it is "out" (in the form of fillings). I  
used a drift to break the rest out, and it's still in the shaft.

I tried everything. What finally worked was a Dremel tool with various  
diamond bits (from HF), and more patience than I thought I had.

Now I have to get the bolt itself out, along with a "sleeve" of who  
knows how much remaining ez-out. I plan to take my time.
