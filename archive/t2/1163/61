Subject: Paint translation request

Hey, I've been reading a UK site and am wondering what the American 
translation of what I'm reading is.

The website is:

Okay - what is cellulose paint in "American"? Acrylic Enamel? Lacquer?

What is 2K or two-pack paints? Are we talking about base/clear paints?

Thanks,
