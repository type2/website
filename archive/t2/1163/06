where is the fluid coming out of the tranny.
in other words where is the leak showing.

if near the bell housing it is probably the torque converter seal.

remember when putting in a new seal it DOES NOT get pushed all the way in, 
but it must be flush with the front of the case.   check the seals I have 
got bad ones right out of the box..

replace the pan seal too.

parts for the 003 tranny (early auto tranny) are NLA
the later 010 tranny can be rebuilt as kits and parts are avaliable.

the parts are not interchangable.  so if you got a kit it is probably for 
the later 010 tranny.   easy way to check is if the shifter linkage goes 
to the starter side of the tranny it is an 010 tranny if on the dipstick 
side it is 003 tranny
