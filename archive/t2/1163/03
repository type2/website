Subject: Leaking automatic transmission

For the past several months, we've been dealing with a leaking automatic
transmission in our '74 Westy. When I say leaking, I mean it wont get 20 miles
down the road before it's blown all the ATf fluid everywhere. At this point,
we managed to find some rebuild kits that include everything to overhaul one
of these. I'm hoping I don't have to go that far though. The approach I'm
taking is to replace any seals I can get to without splitting the transmission
open. Over the past couple of engine removals, I've failed to replace the
torque converter seal. I'm hoping this is where the issue is. Aside from the
torque converter seal and the gasket for the belly pan, does anyone have any
other pointers for what I should do with this thing while it's on the floor?
