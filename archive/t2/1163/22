Subject: Re: [T2] 5400rpm rev limiting rotors for 10 bucks at cip

ah.. so true.. In fact, when I switched out my 002 trans for the 091.... I
usually forgot to shift into 4th.
my wife asked me a couple times,, "are you going to use 4th?"
as 4th was a certain sound... I drove by ear, 4500rpm at 70mph ish...
lol.. so I could attain that in 3rd with the "new" trans lol
