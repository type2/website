Subject: Need a part, can't find a part number

Hi,

I'm looking for the metal heater tube that goes in between the heat
exchanger and the flapper box. Passenger side, for a '75.

Can't seem to find the part on busdepot or on any of the parts
diagrams on bus-boys.

Bus depot is showing this :
http://busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=071256051PR which looks
right, but it says 72-74 and 79, and 80-83. Seems this would do the
trick, any reason not?

Any help is appreciated.

Thanks
