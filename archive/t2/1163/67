	So much the better!  Surely you don't want the vehicle to 
look mahdjvn.  Glossy, poncy  ... <:-|

	It really isn't worth the risk.  For our purposes, those 
2-pot paints offer at most some marginal advantage, but at the price 
of v good spray booth ventilation; some possible hazard to the 
personnel, and even in unusual circumstances to members of the public 
near the exhaust fans outlets; and (I assume) higher price.  The 
chief expert on occupational health in our med sch -  a big-time WHO 
consultant -  warned me of this hypersensitisation, and regards the 
delayed asthma as sometimes life-threatening.  IMHO these types of 
2-pot paints shouldn't be allowed.
	Now I just have to retrieve the name  of the offending 
compounds  ... :-X.
	Meanwhile, what I've told you about them is reliable.
