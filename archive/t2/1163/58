Subject: Replacing wper hose

After all the electrical work, I'm thinking I'd like to replace the washer
fluid hoses, as they leak at their connectors. What is the recommended
approach for this-should I remove the whole dash? Do I disconnect all the
switches first.then the whole dash, can you just take the upper portion of
the dash off.suggestions appreciated..
