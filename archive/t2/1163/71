Subject: Mmineral. vs Semi-Synth oil???

Hello

Winter approaching and time of due oil change. Looking at the brands and
types have to consider appropriate viscosity and type.
There are many brands who state that they are semy- synthetic.
As far as I know for older cars it is better not to use synthetic. I read
that the resoning behind is that the synth has the tendency to be more
penetrating into micro gaps . Therefore the so called Mineral Oil is betetr
.
Hm... thinking about our classic air filter and what is better - denser or
more liquid viscosity ? :)
Any thoughts on this ?

Talking about 1600 VW t2 from 1970 with rebuild engine.

I would also appreciate recommendations for trans fluid - type , brands
etc.

Peace and Prosperity !
