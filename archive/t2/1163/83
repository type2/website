I've been using nothing but 100% synthetic oil for over 40 years (since 
mobil 1 came out)  when rebuilt last engine it showed very few signs of 
wear on bearings, rings etc after over 175k.    I change oil every 3,000 
miles with 15W-50 mobil 1 full synthetic, and good filter.  cheap 
insurance.

Bob
also use synthetic auto tranny fluid, brake fluid, grease, etc.
