I was given a bottle of one of these snake oils to try years ago.  I 
kept it until I had an engine that I was planning to tear down soon.  I 
dumped it and and ran it for a fair time and then pulled the engine 
down.  I could find no evidence of the "nano" particles anywhere in the 
engine. There was no sign of them in the bearings, rings, or cam 
surfaces.  FWIIW, if they worked as claimed they would certain clog up 
the hone marks in the cylinders creating havoc.

I purchased the following product, but I am reluctant to use it since I
read the article above ! :
http://rimet.ru/technology/using/
sorry no english translation , but in short :
they claim that it is made of nano-particles of copper, silver and .. lead
( PSST! dont tell the environmentalist! : ) )
particles that are less than 0.3 micrometter (5m ). It works on heavy worn
parts and surfaces where the temperature is higher, sounds like soldering
process, which affects only heavy friction areas - pistons rings bearings.
They claim particles are so small that they do not affesct the oil pressure
and oil conventional ( modern) oil filters.
Product was in use since 1988 and with good report also from ... the
military .

Should I bite the bullet ? :)
