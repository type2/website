To Jon, and all.

I've commented before on brush car painting, works for sure
if you like to sand.

But I'd rather comment on something new (to me at
least.)  I buy a pack of "good" N95 rated dust respirators (as the thicker
masks actually are) every 2 years or so.  That is how long a box of 20-25 gets
me, and I just ran out again.  I sometimes use a real painting respirator for
sanding, but often just the N95 (which is even in it's prior form LOADS better
than usual "dust masks.")  Thing is this time things have changed and much for
the better.  3M has added an exhalation flapper valve to it's N95, which
improves function incredibly.  Particularly if you are like me and wearing
glasses, the valve exhausting down in a godsend to keeping the glasses clear,
but even for just general use, now the circumferential seal isn't broken by
exhalation pressure every time you breathe out, just kicks out the valve, just
like a real mask.  The seal to your face is always maintained, seems immensely
improved.  My guess is that they are loads more
 effective.  Mind you OSHA (hospitals particularly as an example of such)
considered an N95 rater even in its prior version sufficient for even
incredibly virulent things like TB and varicella zoster (chickenpox) at least
with good fit in an ideal world.  Now I never much believed that, but I
believe it a lot more with these.  I would never so much as sand anything
(even wood) without one.  About $1 each in a box of 20 as Jon mentions, up to
$2.50 each if you only buy a 2 pack, your life is probably worth more.
 
Of
course, I still break the major rule anyway, I have a beard again, I don't
vaseline it up, so anything except supplied air (which I use when painting) is
a bit of a joke, but again the fact that these don't break around the
circumference with every exhale means they bed more into the beard.
 
YMMV.
 
John

ps. The reason I recommend using your OV respirator while
sanding/blasting/cleaning/painting is that they fit, and seal, much better
than any but the most expensive dust filters.  If a filter doesn't seal, it is
worthless.  Second, these days, they are available in every hardware
store/FLAPS/big box outlet for cheap.  Good quality dust filters that seal,
and stay sealed, are a specialty item, and cost more than an organic vapor
respirator. Also, they are not available everywhere. http://www.airace.com/
These, while they work great, cost 4x (~$85) what I can buy a 3m OV blister
pack (~$18) at the big box/online.  The ten-pack paper, or treated fluff, dust
masks are worthless, IMHO, because they don't seal, and stay sealed. YMMV.
