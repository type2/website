Kevin,

Whenever I run into this type of problem I check one thing first.

Check all of your turn signal/stop bulbs and make sure you don't have a
single element bulb jammed in where a dual element should be. A single
element bulb will close the circuit on a two prong socket and create really
spooky wiring issues. Everything "works", it just works wrong.

Also check to make sure your bulbs are not coming loose in their housings.
Some of the newer ones use weak solder and will twist out resulting in odd
grounding issues.
