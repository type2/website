What's your basis for that statement? Taken plainly, it's true that $20 
worth of oil (4 quarts of high quality oil) is cheaper than a $40 VW 
main bearing set.

But pragmatically, is spending, say, an extra $300 on oil (e.g. 33 
changes/100K miles instead of 17 changes, and don't forget also add 
screens/gaskets/time to that) cheaper than the amount it extends 
bearing life? I seriously doubt it. I suspect more VW engines have been 
rebuilt because of overheating (ever dropped a #3 exhaust valve?) than 
because of worn bearings, and that's got nothing to do with how often 
you change the oil.

The question is not whether oil is cheaper than bearings, but what's 
the return on investment for high frequency oil changes, even ignoring 
the ecological impact?

Fact is, a no-brand motor oil of today is very much better than the 
very best oil available 50+ years ago when the whole 3K oil change 
routine became ingrained.
