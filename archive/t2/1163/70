Subject: Re: [T2] Paint translation request

I'm with Robert (and a groundswell of other people in the classic car world
who don't want things over-restored.)  I hate basecoat clearcoat systems on
solid color paints.  Absolutely worthless to me.  I mean, go and repair one
for heavens sakes, got to do the same job as if it were metallic, with at
least 3-4 thins and blends, for a solid colored car.  AND it doesn't look
correct.  And you cant buff it too much, or you'll be through just like a
metallic and be cursing the repair.  And for what pray tell?  VW paint
(classic VW paint) is meant to be single stage, and to tell the truth
depending on year, often with a healthy amount of faint texture from the
factory, though in that regard VW was usually better than most.  Catalyzed
acryllic enamel will last as well, or better than most 2 stage urethanes, and
is bang on for the texture of what VW put on there in the 70s.  I still love
it, it is what I learned to shoot on 20 years ago, it is still
 great.  Of course, it doesn't dry super fast, and attracts bugs and dust like
a magnet in a garage job.  But doesn't matter cause if I put enough (3-4 wet
coats) on, I can color sand and buff it out till the cows come home without
ever a worry.
 
Now I do like some single stage urethanes as well.  Cause they
shoot better, almost like laquer, garage dry faster, etc.
 
The only time I
want clear on a solid color is if I'm striping, flaming, whatever and want
clear over the effects.  And even then, probably isn't how the factory (on
redneck US iron) would have done it as far as striping...
 
Anyway catalyzed
enamel or urethanes, either way you are dealing with isocyanates.  May kill
you, may not, you decide the level of protection be it a very good quality
mask or supplied air respirator that you need.

It really isn't worth the risk.  For our purposes, those 
2-pot paints offer
at most some marginal advantage, but at the price 
of v good spray booth
