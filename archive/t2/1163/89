	It's an old saw.

	I suspect similarly.
	In that olde saw, 'bearings' actually stands for 'all parts 
that can wear faster on account oil has become degraded'.

	good q.
	glad ecological impact has been mentioned; it depends quite 
strongly on whether the used oil gets recycled (to make oil which is 
actually better than new, as I've previously expounded).

	I believe so.
	But that factoid leaves open the issue of whether oil changes 
more often than 3000 mi will pay.

	I admit the q. remains open.
