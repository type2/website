Subject: Re: [T2] Leaking automatic transmission

Troy BTW,

If you haven't reinstalled one before, pay close attention to the
picture showing the pump shaft to turbine shaft geometry before sliding on the
converter.  I've gone on about this on samba to some idiots before, that one
picture is worth a million dollars reinstalling any VW converter in any
vehicle from about 1970-1992.  You must verify that pump shaft is correctly
seated before sliding on the converter.  Cause the converter will appear to go
on fine, you will bolt the engine back up, then things won't turn, and
depending on how foreceful one was trying to mate things, you may take out the
pump.  I think the picture still applies to an early autobox, though the pump
shafts were square I think and a dimension to measure given, with the later
trannies with chamfered shaft you can just look at it and sort of know.

WAY
important though.  And since I'm posting this not just pmail, I'd reiterate
for all, that I'd consider measuring the converter bush if at all possible,
because if original, and worn, particularly if egg shaped, it is going to take
out the seal quickly.  I don't know what chance of finding one would be unless
they kept it the same, which they may have like the seal.  After settling on
the later tranny, they used it for 20 years in every VW and Audi made, so they
do tend to hang onto a design.  Unfortunately the early one (yours) only hung
on for 5-7 years or so (if it was indeed in 411/12s as I sort of think it
might have been.)  But you get the way cool 2 piece billet ATF filler tube in
exchange, nearly worth it unto itself.

(-at-) Jon &
John, thanks for the pointer on the metal being covered by the new
rubber. I
went and bought a $10 seal puller from the FLAPS and it popped right
out. Shot
of the new one in place (-at-) http://goo.gl/dQJl7 . Got the transmission
and the
engine installed today. Still need to hook up odds and ends, but
hopefully
this is the end of the ATF leak. Thanks for the help everyone.

Peace,
Troy
