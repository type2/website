Speaking of wiring to the dome light, it there an easy way of replacing that
wire?  Mine was fried when I got my '72, don't know how the whole thing
didn't burn up, and I haven't replaced it yet.  I've just been using the
back side light.

It's not that much different from a bug. Access behind the dash is the main
hassle, which is expedited by dash removal. From there it's mostly a wiring
harness under the bus to the rear. The other consideration is threading the
dome light wires through the frame in the ceiling.
