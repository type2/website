Subject: Wiper, wiring and more electircal gremlins

Well.as per list suggestions I have looked at the flasher relay-discovered
some rust inside, which probably indicates that my bus had a windshield leak
at some point in its history. I have ordered a new one. A 4-prong to replace
the existing 4-prong.

 

The brake warning light comes on when I have the headlights on, and use the
left turn signal. It was suggested that the reason that this may due to a
bad ground somewhere. I'm not sure how this causes that, something about
power getting backfed.sorry it is beyond my electrical understanding. 

 

I have since installed a barrier strip for grounds, so I can hook ground
wires up, and really tighten them-to make sure they have a good connection.
Now when I try to turn my windshield wipers on (which worked fine before)
the cluster lights of my gauges (oil temp, tach, and oil press) comes on,
and the wipers don't work. Is there any reason these should not share a
ground? I thought a ground is a ground.

 

This seems so odd to me. I don't get it. I checked all connections, and
everything looks correct, and looks like it is grounded correctly. I have
checked against the wiring diagrams, and can't find fault anywhere. I am
sure I am missing something, but can't figure out how to trouble
shoot.suggestions on a troubleshooting plan appreciated.
