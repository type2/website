I think the wiring diagram in Bentley is not correct for my b69, as it does
not show a 4 prong relay which is what I have.

Unfortunately there is NO definitive wiring diagram for the Late 68-69
Type 2 either on-line, Samba or in Bentley.  Bentley's diagram is for
the early 68 Type 2 despite what it says it is.

Huh.    The diagram for this subassembly in the Bentley was 100% correct for
my 69 when I used it to convert my 66 to the 69 relay and flasher switch.   My
hand drawn diagram for the 66 w/ 69 parts may be a bit more sketchy.....
