Subject: RE: [T2] Wiper, wiring and more electircal gremlins

Thanks for electrical help.I think I not only fixed the issues, but
understand what happened-thanks to all your input.

 

The problem originally was the rear taillight on passenger side was not
grounded properly. The bulb holder had fallen out of the bulb holder
assembly. I thought the grounding problem was up front, so I installed a
terminal strip just for grounds up under the dash. My big mistake-I thought
the spade connector on the wiper motor was for grounding-so I had grounded
my dash gauges to it. In fact it was actually just a spot to connect a
ground wire to the chassis. So it is not a ground at all. 

 

After my tinkering, I ended up not grounding the wiper motor, so when I
turned it on-it was trying to ground through the gauges I Installed-hence
they lit up. I fixed this ground issue, and I fixed the loose bulb in the
back. Now everything seems to be working correctly.

 

Thanks to all.
