There are forums right now for people who are too confined by just 
'e-mail', I'd suspect those people are not here reading this e-mail. 
This list fills a need and does feel 'right' for some of us (at least 
me), I'd like to see it continue.

There are other options for the list portion of this group, but the 
"type2" web site is a real treasure that needs to be preserved. 
Preserved and accessible.... The list portion and the archives can be 
at different places, "WetWesties" does it that way and it works well.
If preserving the accumulated knowledge means going to an established 
VW site then I guess that's what has to be done but "I'd" like to see 
the e-mail list format  maintained.
