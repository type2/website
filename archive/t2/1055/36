Hello David and the list,

I have been on the type2 list for 8 or 9 years now and consider the type 2 list very important tool in holding the VW Bus community together. In this list, I have seen many complete strangers lend a hand, a drive way, advise, parts, tools and whatever they could to each other. This community has created a some awsome events where VW owners and admirers could gather. 

I think that a couple of factors have hurt the VW community. One, the economy has forced many, many people to give up any hobby that did not pay the bills. (most don't) This translates into no money to spend on restoring a VW and no money to travel. I think that the high gas prices has made people less willing to spend any money on "extra" vehicles. Vehicles used for any purpose other than cheeply getting to work and back have become less appealing.

It is a sad day when people are forced to choose between taking a soul soothing journey that is the ownership of a VW bus and commuting to work in the shortest rout possible.

Mr. Raistrick, please email me and let me know what I can do to keep the list and site alive. I think once the economy comes back around,(I think with a new President) that our long lost members will come back with more interest than ever and money.

David, please call or email me to let me know,

Regards,
