Subject: Re: [T2] Boston Bob

I was just reading through the last few days of list email.  I'm very  
saddened to hear about Boston Bob. :(  My bus has one of his rebuilt  
engines in it.  I never met him, but did talk to him on the phone  
about my engine.  He also spent alot of time explaining everything &  
helping us out with all the engine questions we had.
