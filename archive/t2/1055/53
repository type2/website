I'd say there are enough of us willing to volunteer that we've got the
admin aspect covered. ;-)

If we can get a free or nearly free host for the site and list, we'd
be set. The church I work at has tons of bandwidth and disk space to
spare (just got a 20 meg circuit, and I put in a 24TB iSCSI box a
couple weeks ago and we have gobs of unused server hardware), but they
unfortunately won't host it. =D

So the real question is: If we can solve the hosting problem, do we
want to keep the lists going? Or is the consensus to go ahead and
migrate to TS or somewhere?
