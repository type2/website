Subject: Type2.com going down???

I really hope you guys don't decide to take it down!!!

I haven't had time to participate as much as I want to since the particular
time for me at my job is especially crazy right now (NFL), and my wife is
pregnant... so I'm dealing with everything that goes with having a child for
the first time (selling unnecessary cars, getting rid of everything in the
closet and attic that you feel is complicating your life), and with everything
else that's been going on, I've been really stingy with my money...

However, this list has meant the difference between having a piece of junk in
my garage to having a very large "family member" that sleeps in the garage.

If there's anything I can do to help $$$, please let me know.

I have a friend that owns his own hosting company and hosts stuff dirt cheap.
If there's something he can do, just let me know and I'll ask him to give you
a quote.

If someone sets up a PayPal link, I'd be happy to send money to keep this list
going.

This will smooth over, as they always do... but right now I think everyone is
in a nervous place what with the uncertainty of which way the economy may
turn...
