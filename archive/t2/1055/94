Hi,

I don't know what I would do without Type2.com.? It has saved me and the my Bus countless times!

I am "fluent" in HTML, some javacript, CSS and familiar with FTP transfers.
Additionally, I am a webmaster for my astronomy club (www.westminsterastro.org, shameless plug could not help it).

 I am currently a full time college student pursuing my BS in Astro-physics, so time is precious, but I am willing to help when and what ever I can.

SO if there anything do to help keep this site going please let me know. 

Clear skies and Happy Trails (of oil with my Bus),
