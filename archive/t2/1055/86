Hi volks:

This list is a lifeline for me in my ownership of the Westy.  I love the 
email format as it gives me a search able archive to figure out 
solutions for my bus problems.

Having said that I know keeping this going is not free.  Please let me 
know if there is a way I can help.  I am a Windows Network Admin at a 
university hospital here.  While I can't host the list, I might have 
some hardware to kick in or perhaps some slight expertise.

Also, once the Boston Bob fund is finished collecting for the first 
wave, perhaps we could put in a short fund raiser for the Type2.com 
lists.  I get 300-500 posts every day or so on this list.  If each of us 
kicked in $5, that would go a long way.  I think many of us can do a bit 
more.

Please write me off line or even call if there is a way I can help.  
I'll also watch the list for donation opportunities.

BEN
