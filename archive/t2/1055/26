Hey John,

I don't know what type of engine you have but Richard Atwell has a 
sounds site for T4 motors (the sound files are from a GE motor from 1978).

http://www.ratwell.com/technical/EngineSounds.html

John Muir did have a site for engine sounds but it has been down for 
quite a while.  The site was just his tape sounds online.  I have a copy 
of the sounds/website (for the upright engine) on my computer.  Is 
anyone interested in putting them back online?  Can we do so legally?

Andrew
