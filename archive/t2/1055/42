 I'm not sure it's the financial thing that's pushing buses off the road - 
we
still drive them in the UK and our petrol (gas) costs many times what it
 does in the US. I think that the type of person driving them has changed.
Once the world was full of people who liked to tinker with their vehicles.
Now it isn't. Modern(ish), reliable cars are everywhere and you can pick one
up for little money. A lot of those who I see driving buses treat them like
a modern car and if they break, they hand them over to someone to fix.

In the UK I still see well loved buses on the road. I almost never (well
once a month maybe) see a Beetle on the road.

Just a thought - why not unify all the lists again ? Once upon a time the
lists were split to reduce the traffic. Is now the time to reverse this ?

Phil - On the list for well over 10 years and would credit it with keeping 
my bus on the road.
