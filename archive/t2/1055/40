Hi all,


As a long-timer (came from vanagon!), as many of us are, VB and T2 offer 
something that other forums don't have - the community and the history.  
I'm sure we are all on thesamba as well, but there's a kind of warm 
cosyness with VB and T2 - for example I would hope one day to tour the 
US and visit some names from the list - may never happen but a nice 
thought...  I only ever met Clara up to now when she came over to europe 
-  hi Clara  :) 

I bought my 71 westy three years ago from a guy in Virginia and the list 
vouched for my non-scammer status and Steve Dolan helped me big style to 
ship the bus to the UK - it wouldn't have happened without the list and 
probably not using other forums in quite the same way.

I guess I'm all nostalgic and it's kind of sad news, but I'm sure 
someone will take it over by the sounds of it.  Don't yahoo offer groups 
that could support the membership, or perhaps since time has moved on we 
could use facebook so we could add some extra visual dimensions to our 
still popular club - this could easily be a rebirth which used the 
legacy of VB and T2 but brought it up to date.  You might hate facebook, 
but running it from there would solve the hosting problems and it 
effectively supports email only of new messages - any thoughts ?
