Subject: Weber Progressive accel pump adjustment

Hello oh knowledgable ones

I know the progressive is bad out of the box, but I am looking for specifics
to tune the accelerator pump.

I have adjusted the idle jets to get it to fly... for a 1.7L..., but I keep
getting a stumble caused by too much gas off the line.

I am getting to much of a squirt out of it, how do I go about limiting this
the pump output?

Thanks in advance
