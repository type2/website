I suspect that VB list is quieter because a lot of the buses are owned by 
kewel people who never get their hands dirty - a split is incredibly trendy. 
Perhaps the other buses will go the same way but for the minute there is 
traffic and if we can scrape together the funds and volunteers then keeping
the lists going would be good.

Perhaps one area we HAVE missed out on is publicity. How does Type2.com 
publicise itself ? Any press officers out there who would be willing to 
draft press releases to all the VW mags ? If not I'd happily do it as I've 
written a few articles for them in the past. Traffic should mean cash if 
there are regular appeals for money.

Yes,  over the last few months the VB list is all but dark and T2
continues to chatter quietly. I for one will miss the Camaraderie that is
not so much present on Samba. This venue is far more personal. I don't
have the technical skills to take over the list, however some of you folks
out there may have some ideas on how to make the lists live on. And yes,
maybe combining VB and T2 is the way to go now.
