Hello list,

Several years ago, I had made up some type2 advertisement fliers. Any time I saw a bus in town in a parking lot, I would stick one under their windshield wiper. I used to keep them in my car for that reason. I also told (and still tell) any bus owner that I met about type2.com.

Also, in the past, I donated many vw parts that I did not need with the stipulation that the receiver donate money to the type2 list. This might make a good fund raiser to those out there with spare parts to give away. I am sure I have a few.

Also, money is very tight for me right now. I am in college full time while also supporting my family of 4. My bus sits idly at my parents house. It has been sitting for a year and a half, slowly rusting ever since the engine decided to beat its self to death. After I move this year and sell my house, I will be able to at least put it in the garage and fix the engine. I had to sell my beetle to help make ends meet. I don't mind donating a little money to the list, but I want to be assured that it is going towards the continuation of the list.

That may be selfish, but I want to see the list continue.I cannot give much money, I am willing to do what I can to support the list.

Regards,
David Kelly
