Although I accept the reality that email lists are a near dead form today, out
of nostalgia I do have another thought.  I was never a fan of breaking the air
cooled lists off in the first place, and equally not a fan of the
vintage/type2 separation.  In fact I think I surmised/predicted this day would
come, though certainly the evolution of the web is much the cause. 
Periodically I subscribe to vanagon for some reason or another and its volume
is as low as either of these, maybe just a bit more, certainly no more than a
few messages a day.  I think it might be at least worth considering pooling
all resources $$ and people wise back into one big list that doesn't have much
volume to sort through.  I think a lot of camaraderie was lost in the day, at
the time plenty of volume, made sense to some, but the social aspects were
lost when people were lost and rules were made.
 
Of course although I can volunteer some money, I don't have the time, or the
experience anymore...  So my thoughts are much BS.
 
A thought anyway.
