Tony,

Don't know what baseline settings and jets you need for that size engine.
HOWEVER, follow the set up instruction CAREFULLY on that progressive carb.
If its an upright engine, the adjusting needle valve is tough to get to as 
it faces the fan housing. I had to make a little screwdriver from a piece of 
5/16" square stock to get to it. The idle speed screw is similarly tough to 
get to.
Recommend setting the needle valve and speed screws per specifications 
before bolting the carb in place.
I used one for years with problems until I found that the second barrel was 
open just a crack at idle. After I got that second barrel closed it started 
running pretty good and still does on my 1776.
