Subject: Say It Ain't So

The list is really going down? Oh, no... I bought my bus eight years ago and the list has been a constant friend and support through everything.

If we can find somebody to take it over, I'll be happy to help support it. I don't have much, but I'll find away.

Do you mean the end of October??
