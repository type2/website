maybe it is low because the economy is in the tanks and people aren't
working on thier buses now. those that run keep running and those that
don't are sitting waiting for the money to fix em.

I've got more good info out of this list than any other single source.
better than a Bentley.

this list is where I went to keep the one I've got now running. and it
is worth a few bucks for me to help keep it running since I plan on
keeping this bus a while longer.
