This is sad news.  I love the format of the site.  Forums are a completely
different type of entity.  I have always felt this list was more personal.
I would love to see one of these volunteers take over the site and leave it
the site and mailing list intact.  I have owned my my bus since 1996 and the
site has been such a large resource for me. If the site/list dies then lake
me  take the opportunity to thank all of you for enhancing my VW ownership
experience.  I was in high school when I got the Bus from my Dad as a gift
and I'm a father now!

a sad day.
