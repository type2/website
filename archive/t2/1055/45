As network administrator at a University, I completely understand the
budgetary issues related to keeping a web site and listserv afloat.  Everyone
is looking for ways to save money these days (Our University included).  I
would be more than happy to offer my services to migrate the listserv and web
content but would recommend using something like Google Apps that would offer
web site and listserv integration at no cost.  Administration of the site is
also easily distributable.  One major concern, with everyone, deals with
history.  People develop a kindred spirit with tinkering with inner workings
of the servers and software because they have more control offer the service
themselves.  This is much like all of us who would rather work on our VWs
ourselves instead of taking it to a shop.  However, no matter which way the
Type2 website and list goes, I am willing to help in any way I can.  This
group has been an indispensible resource for me.  The groups collective
knowledge and experience has kept me, my family, and my vehicles going like no
other resource.  Just let me know how I can help.

someone with more time to keep it up
