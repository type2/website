Hi Don,

I host pottsfamily.ca and busesofthecorn.com with nomonthlyfees.com,  
they charge $70/year for 600MB of space and 2.5GB traffic per month.  
That even includes annual .com domain registration fees.

And you can run a list with it. It's not as convenient as having your  
own "box", but it is affordable and it works. (Just like my buses)

But some alternative process may need to be developed to maintain the  
archives.
