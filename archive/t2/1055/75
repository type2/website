Thanks, Eddie and to everyone else that has stepped forward to offer time or
tangible resources to help.  I've lurked on this list for years.  It was my
first support system when I bought my bus, and it still serves that purpose
to many people.  I get lots of ideas from folks here about how to improve
things, and I hope that continues.  Personally, I don't want the list merged
with TS.  I find the boorish behavior on that site unbecoming of bus-owners.
I have donated through the PayPal option on the /donate page and I
pledge more, once the conversion and new ongoing/upkeep costs are identified.
I sincerely hope we are able to keep this, the archives and the library
together.  There has been little mentioned of the library, but I find that to
be useful (albeit a little stale).  Maybe folks use RAtwell.com, but I like
the library format on type2.

Thanks, and good luck.
