Subject: Re: [T2] Boston Bob

Hello all!

I am very sorry to hear about Boston Bob. I remember very favorable 
opinion of him by the list the last time I was really active in the 
discussions here.

Has anyone compiled his knowledge anywhere. His opinions and 
recommendations?

As I recall his engines were valued because they lasted. Were the 
engines any more powerful or better mileage? Did he stroke or put larger 
jugs on his engines?

Were his engines better because they were "blueprinted" i.e. perfectly 
matched parts?

Thanks,
