Lets try that again.

Disk space (for the website as it sits today):

$150/m for 1u of colo and more bandwidth than we actually are "allowed"

Well, we really need a new (or new to us) server.  And the whole thing
could really use a new install.  Rebuilding the lists is either a) a pain,
or b) notsobad if we use the 8 year old version of ezmlm-idx we're using
now on the new box.   But really, the entire environment (and website)
needs a top to bottom scrubbing.
