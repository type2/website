Hmmm, now there's an interesting thought. I still remember fondly the early
days of vanagon(-at-)lenti back in 1994, when all generations of busses got along
quite well.
:)
Since the traffic is so low now, maybe that's a good idea? As for
fundraising, I'm good for a few bucks, (maybe via paypal?) as are I'm sure
many folks...
But I love these lists, have many many many fond memories, and hate to see
them slip away.
Samba is great also, and I spend a lot of time there, but it has a different
feel to it.
