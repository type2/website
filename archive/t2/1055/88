Absolutely.  That's why I haven't asked for donations at this time.

Without volunteers to run things, there won't be anything that needs
donations.

A small handful of people have offered their technical assistance, and
I've tossed them in a room.  We'll see what they come up with.

If I missed anyone who is volunteering technical help, let me know.


If the worst happens, and no one (or no plan) comes together to run
things, I want to drain the bank paying the last of the bills.   We have
right around enough to finish things up right now, so we'll be even.  If
it costs less than we have, we'll refund going backwards (last donation
goes back first).  If it costs more than we have, the admins will be
covering it.
