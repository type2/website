Hello All,

Yes,  over the last few months the VB list is all but dark and T2 continues 
to chatter quietly. I for one will miss the Camaraderie that is not so much 
present on Samba. This venue is far more personal. I don't have the 
technical skills to take over the list, however some of you folks out there 
may have some ideas on how to make the lists live on. And yes, maybe 
combining VB and T2 is the way to go now.

If anyone has ideas of how to keep this going, I'm all ears and maybe I can 
help out.

Its really been great over the last 7 years or so that I've been tuning in. 
Learned a lot, met lots of great people and I hope that I have been able to 
help a few folks along the way.

Best of luck, Best Regards and keep on bus'n. I will.

P.S.
In case we go dark sooner than later, I'm still working on making 55-67 
steering wheels. The mold is almost there. I have one steering wheel in 
paint just for test. I have lots of email addresses in my address book. If I 
am finally successful, I will send out a post to everyone I can ID as a 
listee. Pmail me now if you would like to hear from me later. I will make a 
list of interested parties.

The Steering Man.
