No idea where to get one, but I can't help but wonder if the bearing  
from a similar-era watercooled VW (Rabbit, Scirocco) might be the  
same, or could at least work..?

Needle bearing for those is P/N 171-419-517, race is P/N  
171-419-518A.  There's also a listing for a ball bearing, P/N  
171-419-517B .. no idea why, I've never seen a ball bearing at the  
lower end of the column.  Give the dealer a ring and ask for those,  
might still be available.
