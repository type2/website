The people are here, but money isn't.

The list as it sits today is an extremely complex piece of work.   It
could be simplified, as most of the features we built into it were from
the days when we saw more than 100 messages per day per list, and were
there to allow us better control over what came through (and to keep that
"vibe" everyone says they want to keep).

If we moved to a common list oursourcer, those features and control would
go away.  And someone would have to step up to maintain it, and import our
subscriber lists, etc etc.    We'd have much less ability to remove and
restrict access to those autoresponders, for example.
