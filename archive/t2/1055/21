Subject: Question about ceramic exhaust for 1600 Boston Bob Engine 

One of the last conversations I had with Boston Bob was to add an extractor to
the 1600 DP I just got from him for my 71 Westy - I bought an empi header with
the quiet pack - not too pleased that all the paint flaked off and it's rusted
on the surface in just a month.I feel that the header actually makes the
engine compartment hotter - at least the apron is hotter than the stock
exhaust- this concerns me more than the rust right  now.

Anyone have any luck with a ceramic header  from empi - Does it keep the apron
any cooler?

Bob suggested I'd get a little better performance from an extractor than the
stock exhaust.

Open for suggestions on an exhaust for the Westy.

Thanks,
Trey
