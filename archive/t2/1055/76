	Good on you Ron.  I trust all will accept his wonderful 
offer.  Isn't that a fine offer by the excellent Ron, making the end 
of this brief panic?
	We have it on the highest authority that it is more blessed 
to give than to receive.  One reason why that is true is that in 
giving we often evoke giving by others, which can lead to our 
receiving.  This looks like an example!
