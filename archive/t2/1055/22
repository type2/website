Subject: More on engine noise files

Thanks to all those who pointed me to Ratwell sound-files. You were 
very quick with replies, thank you, and I'll keep that link.
As Ratwell says, his files deal more with what a good engine should 
sound like, I'm still curious about those bad sounds.
Can we track down the old John Muir sounds ? Neither the link nor 
mirror given by Ratwell work.
Has anyone ever saved these or know where else they can be found?

I'd like to know what "about to throw a rod"  sounds like - and what it 
means!
