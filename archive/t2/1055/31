First, thanks to everyone who did the heavy lifting involved in
keeping the list up.

I've had 2 kids a mortgage and a cross country move since my first
bus.  The 76 is garaged and the 65 and 79 are long gone, but there was
a time when I relied heavily here to keep rolling.

My two cents is that we please maintain the archives with someone
reliable, as has been discussed.  We all know that the information
there will never be duplicated anywhere.

Thanks,
