The website and archives WILL remain online, in some form or fashion.
There's no plan to shut them down.


As for the various suggestions to move the lists to google/yahoo/etc,
there's two major issues with those:

A)  Someone has to do the work to get things there, and to maintain them
there.


B)  Everyone agrees that the Archives are important.  If the lists were
moved, how do you propose extracting the list messages from the outsourced
mailing list provider, to import them into the web archive and search
engine?
