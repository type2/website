He passed away a few days ago from a third bout of cancer.  This time it was
bone cancer.
:-(

While there's a lot of buzz on the "mother list" (Vanagon List), you can
follow what's going on on the samba:

Over $6000 (and still counting) is being collected for his family thru Larry
Chase's "Pay It Forward" emergency fund (one daughter has "special needs").
Looks like a lot of Type 2 and Vanagon owners are gonna be showing up for
the funeral next weekend, some driving, some flying in  Wish I could go.

For more details on donations and the funeral, again, see the above samba
