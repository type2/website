Subject: HOSTING SOLUTION - Re: [T2] Type2.com failure, impending

Hey Everyone,
palosverdes.com will host non-profit websites for free - I think the 
only thing that Ted (the guy in charge) will ask is that it makes 
mention on the site that it's hosted by palosverdes.com.  He started 
this service after he sold his business and funded the project with help 
from the city and other investors.  It's a great service and he's always 
excited to help out non-profits that need hosting.  They also offer 
classes on web development and other neat stuff like that so this fits 
perfectly into their mission.  This is my site that's hosted there:

Obviously (from the lack of good design), you can host a site that looks 
however you want it to look.  The nice part about this is that you don't 
have to do any server management what-so-ever.  They have fast servers 
and I've never seen any downtime.  I have been using their services for 
a very long time now (about 8 years) and Ted has been awesome and super 
friendly.  If we wanted, we could even do some ColdFusion programming as 
they offer those services if there were people interested (I'd be 
willing to help in that area).

I believe that they also host mailing lists, but we'd need to see the 
details of how it works.  I think this is something definitely worth 
looking at.

Please let me know if you would like me to find out more info.  It's a 
great solution, especially because it's a free service and type2 is a 
non-profit... win-win for both parties.

Mike
