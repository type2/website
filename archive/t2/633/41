Subject: Mixture and CDI

Folks... I just sent this question off to John (-at-) ACN, but I saw another 
FI mixture question fly across the list, and so I thought it might be 
useful to ask it again here, if nothing else just to record a 
discussion about it in the archives...  Here goes:

Regarding idle mixture... Normally this is one using an exhaust gas 
analyzer.  A CDI is going to improve the burn in the cylinder (at 
least, that's the reason I'm considering it :-), and so is going to 
alter the exhaust gasses.  This renders the %CO spec somewhat useless.

Should I make sure the idle mixture is set correctly *before* I install 
the CDI, and revert to stock ignition whenever I adjust the idle 
mixture?  Is this going to result in running too lean?  Or, should I 
set idle mixture to the %CO spec with the CDI installed?  Or is this 
going to result in running too rich?

My primary goal is to improve fuel economy, with improved emissions 
being one of my secondary goals...

Ok, discuss! :-)
