Hi Volks,

We had a GREAT time at Jamie River's 2004 Fall Tour this weekend. Good 
weather, great people, lots of buses (15 or 16 in total) and great food 
too. We hiked the Bruce Trail along the Niagara escarpment, which 
brought our club to its third encounter with the escarpment this year. 
The scenery along the escarpment up neat Tobermory is breathtaking, and 
everyone got some great pics. Our family did some rock climbing and 
came back unscathed, so after a short respite we enjoyed a glass-bottom 
boat tour to check out some wrecks in Fathom Five Underwater Park.

I have the camera unloaded,  a bunch of captions attached to the images 
and a swift uplink to the server, so I am able to share my pics from 
the weekend.

Enjoy them here:

I also put my Dad's pics online, but with fewer captions:

Thanks to Jamie and Ruth for putting together such an awesome weekend!

OMG....  I have only three days left to clean out the bus and 
reassemble the westrailer in time for John Brown's Buses!!


Happy trails,
