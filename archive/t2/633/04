Subject: Re: [T2] Rear Wheel Not Turning

Good evening,

I released the parking cable; and compared my new shoes to the
originals for fit before beginning the job.

After taking a break and reading the wisdom found here, I was able to
rectify the shoes with the drums. Fully assembled, the wheel now turns
freely so next i'll put together the other one.
My T2 was manufacturered 6/71. 
Turns out the solution to the problem was just to grab each of the
shoes in one palm, exercise my torso, and give the assembly a nice
shake, shove, and jolt together. Something finally seated propertly. I
released the adjusting screws as far in as they could go, and put the
drum on with tight bolts...seems to be just what was needed.

Thanks for the tips and insight everyone.
