Richard,

I want to know why you aren't running for President!<grin>...

**Outstanding job**!


I didn't read all of it, but just some of the sections that I felt 
competent in.

In the fuel tank section you need a **strong** (in red) warning to not 
keep any muratic acid anyplace but outside.

An open container of this stuff in the garage will rust chrome tools in a 
closed cabinet in two days.

You might want a link at the top of the fuel tank restore section that 
points to how to get it out....

You might emphasize *real* talcum powder usage on the grommet replacements
in the torsion bar adjustment part....lots of over the counter stuff is no 
longer *real* talcum powder, but a "modern" replacement.

Seal section...I have been told by a guy that worked for a dealership for 
many years that vw considered adding glue to seals an unnecssary expense 
and that almost all of the seals were made to be installed without glue.

YMMV

Cheers, dave
