Nice score for your friend Richard! I have a 72 also, but I don't find the 
lack of access much trouble. Switched to a Weber progressive, though, so 
things are much less crowded over the motor. This issue of the can hitting 
everything came up with me a few weeks ago, and I was advised to reindex the 
distributor drive shaft.

Have fun!
