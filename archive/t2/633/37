Subject: 78 Transporter for Sale, no engine, Auto Tranny, Virginia, $500

I am selling my project Transporter.  I bought a wetfalia instead.  I took
the engine out and sold it, but everything else is there and complete.  It
is an automatic tranny, and it has the factory AC in it.  All  glass is
good, and all door hardware works good.

It has some surface rust, none serious and no rust through.  I removed the
fuel tank to seal, but I haven't done that yet.  You will get the tank of
course.

I can trailer the bus to you for an additional fee (~$100 DC area, other
places different), or, you can tow it as it rolls and tires are good.
