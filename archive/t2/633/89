It's tough to get the money out of a recent rebuild in a bus. You
already know about your 78 so the 69 will be a big question mark till
all it's troubles get settled. Unless there is a driving reason to get
the 69 I would just hold onto what you have and enjoy driving it.
Keep in mind that if the 69 blows the engine soon that 1500 bus turns
into 3000 quick.
