Well done adding even more information to a very well rounded site !
Always a wealth of knowledge Richard.
I figure if you ever make it up north to Calgary, Alberta I will owe 
you a beer or three for all the bits of knowledge I've forgotten and 
found on your site. Strangely enough mostly relating to mud flaps.
