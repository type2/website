Subject: Gas running out top of carb

Hey all,

Well, finally got my engine in. Yay! (After 8 weeks of waiting, I finally 
managed to get a flywheel and clutch kit that bolt together...) Now, it turns 
over but doesn't fire...

I'm getting gas to the carbs because there's gas spraying out of a hole in top 
left of the left solex carb. Does that mean the float is likely sticking down 
and isn't shutting off the gas flow?
