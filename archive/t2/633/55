Subject: Re: [T2] platinum plugs revisited

We have lots of problems with pre 95 cars coming in missing on acceleration and they always have plat plugs in
them. When we tell the customer we have to replace the plugs with the correct copper
core, NON resister plug, they come unglued. They usually just bought the plugs and the store that sold them to
them swore up and down that the manufacturer recommended them. We have a hard time making them understand that
it is NOT the car manufacturer, but the plug manufacturer that wants you to buy the most expension plugs.
Mercedes only specifies copper core, non resister, Bosch plugs.
It wasn't until the 112/113 engines came out in 98, that MB put in platinum plugs. But the ignition system is
designed for them.
