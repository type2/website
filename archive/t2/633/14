Hi Max ~~~

Sounds like you are up on making the spark strong, and that's good. Get
Bosch everything!
My experience to vastly improve mileage was cleaning out the oil bath air
filter. I went from 17 to 22 mpg on the highway.
I also learned to take it easy on the gas pedal, and that further improved
highway mileage. Leaving it in gear while cruising downhill, I was getting
26.6 mpg from Charlottesville VA to the VA-NC border stop at Pleasant Hill,
NC. I had also taken out the icebox/sink combo to save weight on the Myrtle
Beach to NYC trip, ultimately getting over 18 mpg (with two adults, three
kids and packed to the gills with luggage & food).
