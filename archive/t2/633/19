Subject: odd oil pump

i once tore down a motor from an early T3 - had the 'super 1500' pump 
in it. the cover also had  that inscribed.  and an austin vw shop had 
an NOS one on their wall with the inscription in red enamel; they 
said it was s'posed to be from a  T3. i believe vw actually CALLED 
that model the '1500.'  but i am typing from memory, so YMMV.
