Subject: FI air fuel mixture adjustment

Greetings,

First, I gotta say how helpful this site has been.  Thanks to all for 
passing on their knowledge and experience (try that with an Oldsmobile!).

My question - is there a good set of instructions for setting the AFM 
without an exhaust analyzer?  I've been doing it by trial and error for the 
last fews years with my '79 (CA).  You know, move the spring a bit, turn the 
screw, re-adjust idle and timing...  I've been more or less relying on 
vacuum pressure at the air intake distributor to help me find the "proper" 
adjustment (more vacuum = better adjustment?).  I keep thinking if I did 
these things in a certain order (or knew better what I was doing in the 
first place) the whole process might be improved.

Regards,
Mike

'79 that runs O.K.
