Subject: more NOS bus!

Another couple of question for the 72 bus:

- How is the slack removed from the thtrottle cable at the left carb?

- In this stock setup with those dash pots how long should it take for the vacuum retard to return the timing to the idle level of 5ATDC when the throttle is snapped closed?
