  In my buses I average 25,000 to 35,000 on a set of NGK plugs. If you buy a new 1600 OE VW Mexican motor they 
come with NGK spark plugs. The funny part is that BOSCH has a factory close to the VW engine plant in Mexico.
   Is VW shopping price or have they finally admitted that NGK's work better then BOSCH in an air cooled engine!!
   Also my cost on BOSCH plugs is 25% less then NGK's and I buy them by the case lots
