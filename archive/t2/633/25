 Sorry for the not so clever subject line, couldn't resist.
How do you get into the heat adjust levers on a late Bay?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

How late is late?

74 and up, they just pushed on. 2 red and 1 blue.
68-72, they are held in by plastic pins. 2 red and 2 blue.
73 only, they used the 68-72 levers, but only 2 red and 1 blue. Instead of pins,
they used spring clips, this made the levers removable like 74+. You just pulled them out.
The spring clips will fit on 68-72 buses instead of the pins, but you need to find 2 73's to
get enough clips......
The 73 only levers look a little like 74+ levers, they have a ridge on the red ones so you can 
tell the hot from the cold..... I guess for a blind driver? Like having braille on a drive-up ATM.
