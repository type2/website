Indeed.  And I think the '78 is definitely the better of the two 
model-years.

I'll work on L-Jet FI over carbs any day.

Is the 69 drum brakes all around?  I certainly prefer the front discs 
on the later bays.

The later bays also have a better engine and transmission than the 
early bays.  Besides being more durable, the 2.0L Type 4 engine moves a 
bus around a lot better than the 1.6L Type 1 engine.

Assuming the 78's engine is being rebuilt to stock spec, it will have 
hydraulic lifters, which means you check/adjust valves every 30,000 
miles instead of every 3,000 miles.
