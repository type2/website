that could be the case, however you could also have a lean out
condition w/ a sub par FI pump (or pressure regulator) or simply some
cloged fuel injectors. It could only help to have them professionally
cleaned or replace them. I'd say since it ran well for a long time
then suddenly things seemed to indicate an increase in engine head
temp something else you have not addressed yet is to blame.
