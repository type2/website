I'm with you there. I have the dubiously wonderful opportunity to
rebuild the cabinets in my bus. Rather than use heavy plywood, I'll be
framing the cabinets and using 1/8" panelling to skin it. Should weigh
half of what it did. If not less...

Plus, I'll be making the part that rides over the engine compartment
removable. The initial reason was so that I could carry full sheets of
plywood (or whatever) that wouldn't fit otherwise. But that gives me
an extra weight benefit.

Also, get rid of TIlly The Two Ton Toolbox. I had 2 big metal
toolboxes in my bus for a long time. Then I sat down and sorted out
the tools that I need to do any job on the bus. They all now fit in
one of those little plastic 99c toolboxes! Of course a timing light
and tach/dwell meter won't fit, but they ride just fine under the bed.
I'll be making velcro mounts for them soon though...
