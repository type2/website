Tim,

First things first....take the cht sensor off the head but leave it in the 
bus.

You probably have enough wire to pull it out from the bus slightly.
Boil a pan of water and take it out and dunk the sensor in it in order to 
get *some* idea of where it really is.  

Bad temperature information is worse than none at all.

Sounds like you have the enrichment set pretty high, but if necessary, set 
it even higher for the time being.

Based on my experience, a 210-220 oil temp would not indicate heads 
running at the temperatures you specified....once again..bad temperature 
readings are worse than none at all.

Something to try...go for a drive at 60mph....then go back home and retard 
your timing by a few degrees...go for the exact same drive(and speeds) and 
see if it makes a difference.

As you said...something is not right!

also, what do your plugs look like??  Burned? sooted up?  Different from 
each other by a large margin?  Correct plugs in?..plug range too 
hot?..vacuum readings are ??

I know you have probably checked most of these, but let us know!

A picture or two of the plugs and/or your engine would help....maybe 
someone can spot something that is odd....

Cheers, dave
