While the Bentley manual says to remove the engine on a '72-79 bus in order
to remove the tank, I've done it with the engine installed. It just barely
clears the top of the engine if you remove all of the stuff up top (air
cleaner, etc.).  I think I did have to loosen the engine mounts and nudge
the engine lower just a fraction, if memory serves me correctly.
