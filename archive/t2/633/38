Subject: platinum plugs revisited

Folks,

Was looking for something else and came across this on a site on Mercedes.

On a 30-50 year old Mercedes-Benz with original components, the 
distributor cap, rotor and ignition wires will need replacing.  Last but 
not least, you will need a set of new and properly gapped spark plugs - DO 
NOT USE PLATINUM SPARK PLUGS!  Mercedes-Benz specifically advises against 
these for all engines up into the 1990s


Interesting...no?...and this is even for water cooled engines...

Karl,....seen that in any of your tech bulletins?

Cheers, dave
