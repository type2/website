Capacitive Discharge Ignition.

The idea is that you feed the coil with a larger jolt instead of +12.  
The jolt comes from a large capacitor (or bank of capacitors), hence 
the name.

Basically, your points (or Pertronix or whatever) become a switch for a 
very low current (a "fire!" signal for the CDI box), and then the CDI 
box dumps a big jolt to the coil.  Doesn't Bob Hoover have a sermon 
about how great CDI + points are (the only part that wears out is the 
rubbing block ... low current == no pitting!)?

The point of all of this is to provide a hotter spark, allowing you to 
open up your plug gap, and get a better burn in your cylinder.  This in 
turn can result in improved fuel economy, improved emissions, and 
improved power.

AFAIK, the ignition on most modern cars is of the CDI type.
