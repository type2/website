Subject: Insulation

Hi -
I was browsing the archive and found a fascinating series of articles related
to insulating a bus, but the were a number of questions that remained in my
mind, such as where to obtain some of the materials.  They recommended using
"Q-Pads, Kool Patch and NASA insulation."  I know about Kool Patch, but has
anyone else an idea as to what "Q-Pads and NASA insulation" are and where they
can be had?

Cheers,
