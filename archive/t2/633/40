Subject: Re: [T2] platinum plugs revisited

  At the SEMA show a couple years back I talked to the BOSCH engineers and he stated not to use platium or any other of the Bosch plugs 
except the original single electroid styles. On another note he also stated that BOSCH plugs are not recomended on any older air cooled 
engine!!! Something to do with oil blow by causeing the plugs to foul. Myth or truth I do know, I only use NGK's.
