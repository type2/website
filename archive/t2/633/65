Subject: Starter Question

I pulled my motor awhile ago.  It was starting before
I pulled it.  I needed to replace the clutch.  I put
it back in and tried to start it but nothing happened.
 Pulled the starter and used the troubleshooting
identified on the list and it looks like it is bad. 
All I did was clean it up.  I didn't soak it in
anything.  

Could I have connected it wrong to cause it to go bad?
 I have the wires from the altenater harness going to
the big lug and one wire connecting to a spade
conntector. 

Did I miss something?
