Subject: Re: [T2] Bosch Platinum

I ran Bosch Platinums for about 6,000 miles in my 2.0 '65 Beetle including the tow from VA to TN dragging the Hyundai down. No problems, no damages. However they were no better either. I'll stick with the Supers from now on. I have the Platinum +2s in my '97 Cabrio. They run better than the OEM plugs which had 102K miles on them but I don't see anything worth their cash. If I was running triple digits on the Autostrada or had an oil burning prob maybe they would shine. 

I ran Supers in my '84 Rabbit 'vert (basically GTi) at 160 kph+ regularly and the Supers held up just fine too.
