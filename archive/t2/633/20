Shhh ... don't give out the secret, just come up with a catchy name for it 
and paint the whole thing some far-out color. Design a web page and sell the 
Super Lift (or whatever) for $79.95. Throw in a set of grungy old Vice 
Grips, er, "locking pliers" -- can't call em V.G. in the advert, or they'll 
want their cut.

No big deal. That's a very minor safety issue. Don't worry, I hear engine 
fires are extremely rare in these vehicles.


Once I got the engine started, it would idle but

That sounds like most '79s on the road today!

Houston to bus driver: You are cleared for liftoff.

Moral of this story seems to be that doing it yourself isn't just cheaper 
and dirtier, it's the only damn way to know it's done right. Which reminds 
me of the U.S. government's motto: "We're not good, but we're slow."

Congrats!
