The two easiest ways to improve mileage are:

- slow down. Huge impact on mileage if you're not in a hurry.
- remove unnecessary weight. Most people (including me) carry round a heap 
of junk that they could do without. Also if you've got a campervan and your 
not worried about keeping it stock there are considerable weight savings to 
be had by reconstructing the interior in lighter materials (on my "gunna" 
list). If your really keen it should be possible to make at least some of 
the fittings removable so you only put them in when required (also on 
"gunna" list).

Cheers,
