Subject: Re: [T2] Found another bus....

One possiblity is to sell the engine seperately from the bus. A complete 
rebuilt type 4 motor is worth money and you could box and ship it if need be 
via FedEx freight. Or else get the bus 100% and then sell complete.

I like the 69's better, love the early bays. I went through several buses to 
figure out what I like best including a split and aircooled Vanagon.
