Subject: Start adjuster tip

Doing the rear brakes on that 72 friend's bus I cam across a frozen star
adjuster. I finally managed to break it loose by threading the screw all the
way in and using my drag link socket for the oil pressure switch and a long
1/2" dr. breaker bar. After that it tapped out with a little more
penetrataing oil and a punch.
