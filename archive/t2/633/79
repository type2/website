I think if it were possible you would still have to disconnect the Vapor 
Lines on top and atleast create enough slack on the lines below. But IIRC, I 
don't think that would be possible either. Conflict between the lines, the 
inlet and outlet on the bottom of the tank and the opening they pertrude 
through will not allow the "play" you need to tip it.
