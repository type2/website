Worth trying. But once again, there's no way to inspect. You might soak 
just to the point where you have a few pebbles in there. Then one could 
get into the restricted passage and shut the whole thing down. In a 
way, it's like cleaning the gas tank -- something you know a lot about 
-- but unlike a gas tank, impossible to inspect.

Wishing ain't getting. Apple has the same problem with older Macs.

I think that the bigger problem is when it gets clogged, undetected, 
and then promotes oil leaks.

Actually, I'm surprised that there isn't more discussion of this in the 
archives. Take these three facts and put them together: (1) buses are 
believed to be unreliable; (2) PCV valves are notorious for causing 
problems in all vehicles that have them; (3) there's no replacement for 
our application, and little reliable knowledge about what to do about 
that. Seems like a recipe for a trainwreck, to me.
