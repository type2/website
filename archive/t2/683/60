Well, I am making no pronunciations as to my sanity... ask anyone who has
met me :-)  OTOH, as I said... new Eurovan camper is ~$50K, new Westfalia
Marco Polo is ~100K.  It's a matter of perspective.  I have always thought
that as long as my car was not costing more than the payment for a new
car, then I was dollars ahead.  These days, that's ~$500/mo.  Even in this
worst-case disaster area of a resto, the split has still cost less than
that and at the end of the day, I wind up with a paid-for, new-condition
vehicle.

AMEN!  It's important to have more than one... otherwise the pressures of
living drive you to make bad decisions.  If the bus *has* to run on
Monday, then you *have* to tke short-cuts that are ill-advised in the long
run. A splittie is not a bad choice for you, there in CA. The type1 engine
is cheap, the trans from a swing-axle beetle will do in an emergency (with
an R&P flop). it won't depreciate and when you are done with one, then you
switch over to the other.  I know you had tongue in cheek, but it's not a
bad move.

That's "vintage pervert", son :-)  And it's all to easy a disease to
catch... just ask me :-)
