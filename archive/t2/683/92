You may find that these were meant for an Audi ( Merc, Audi, VW T2 etc all 
had the 5 x 112 stud pattern ), I've got a set of 15 x 6" mags off an Audi 
A4 (http://neale.org/images/a4rims.jpg) that fit the rear, but I've got to 
open the centre hole about 2mm to clear the front hub domes.

The 15 x 6" mags I bought from the local VW specialist clear the hubs fine 
http://neale.org/images/tiggers.jpg , and so do the 18 x 8.5" mags 
http://neale.org/images/antera.jpg I picked up 2nd hand for one of the 
"projects" ;^)

FWIW
