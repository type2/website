Do you have to get to the point where you're boring out the original
breather? Can't a compatible replacement PCV valve be found?

It seems that every model of every maker of every year had a different
PCV valve. So the odds are good that there will be one that can be
made to fit without tearing up a NLA part...

Just a thought.
