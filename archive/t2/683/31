Subject: fuel tank sender gasket

Hi all....I'm in the process of reinstalling my refurbished gas tank (74 
dual carbs) and have noticed that the thin little "O - ring" type  
rubber gasket (for the VDO sender unit) is quite hard and has tiny 
cracks in it.  I don't want to seal the sender unit on with my favorite 
goop "Seal All" as I wouldn't ever be able to get it off without 
destroying it.  Does anyone know of a source for this little "O- ring" 
type gasket or, better yet,  some way to refurbish it?
