That is true. If you are trying to maintain the same overall tire height as
stock (which keeps the speedo accurate) but with bigger wheels, this
requires a shorter-sidewall tire  - which will result in a harder ride, all
things being equal. That's the downside to the latest "import tuner" rage,
combining humongous wheels with extremely low-profile tires. They may look
cool (kewl?:-), but driving down the the road your "pimped ride" feels more
like a pimped go-cart. Of course some of these people are putting 20 inch
wheels on a subcompact.  We're not talking about quite the same extreme in
the case of a bus.
