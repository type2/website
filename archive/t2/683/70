Subject: Flywheel torque

I came across a TSB from VW #13-93-03 dated July 31,1993 that stated the
flywheel bolts should be torqued to 44 ft. lbs. then another 90 deg. turn.
It also makes mention of bolts coated with locking compound but gives no
part number.

The TSB covers more than just Type 2 with manual and automatic
transmissions.

Does anyone know why this information was issued to dealers?
