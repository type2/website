Subject: When in doubt, cut it open

I have two of the air breather valves. So I cut one in half on a 
bandsaw:

This much is clear enough: vacuum from the boot between the AFM and the 
throttle draws crankcase gases up the large aperture in the bottom of 
the valve and into the small passage, then into the 25 mm hose leading 
to the boot. There is a thin rubbery membrane at the top of the valve 
held in place by a thin wire (my bandsaw did not care for the wire). 
I'm still not clear on how the membrane functions.

But I know this: even after soaking in solvent for several hours, this 
thing is full of crud.

Does this valve do the same thing as a PCV valve? Could it be reamed 
out, to flow unobstructed, and then place a PCV valve in the hose? 
After 30 years, this condition cannot be good.
