Many PCV valves are designed to fit into a hole in the valve cover aren't they?  I could see fabricating a
piece of sheet metal or similar that attached to the metal part of the breather the same way the plastic
part that you cut apart does.  This fabricated piece of metal could have a hole in the middle of it for a
generic PCV valve.

That way you can save the original plastic breather part if you so desire.  It also might make it easier
to attach a generic PCV valve.
