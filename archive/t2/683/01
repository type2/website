My '72 with original engine and PDSIT dual carbs starts immediately, it 
amazes me, even when it is really cold.  If you are having to crank a 
lot, I wonder if the fuel is draining out of the bowls while stopped, 
thereby requiring the cranking to refill the bowls before it starts.

I do not have the issue with the dashpot as you describe, but if there 
is any binding anywhere with the linkage, I have had these symptoms.  
In particular, when a mechanic once replaced the oil bath filter 
backwards, this kind of symptom happened.

The most difficulty that I have had is balancing the carbs, both 
throttle position and the volume adjustments.
