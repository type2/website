They expected you to buy a new VW rather than supply PCV valves for 20-50 
years after production ended.

Pretty much my point...VW engineers were "mostly" in charge when VW
was still a struggling car company...There was a survey by one of the
car mags in the middle to late sixties about build quality...The best
built car, according to the survey, was Rolls-Royce, second was the
Beetle...Except for rust, the VW was probably the best in class for
a keep-it-running-forever award...and cheaply, too, compared to al-
most anything else on the road...
And as for parts, the no longer with us British car company, Alvis,
prided itself on advertising parts availability for any Alvis ever built ;-)

As for me, I'd consider buying a new L.L. Bean edition Subaru...But 
only if it came with the L.L. Bean guarantee...Which it most definitely
does not... :-(
