Subject: Brake fluid leakage - again

Hi all,

I seam to have more then one leakage problem Fluel system is updated
though, now I still have a leakage of brake fluid at the connection between
the dual cilinder and the master cilinder. After a lot of trouble findint
them, I already replaced both seals but these don4t seam to fit correct. Any
tips to further stop the leak? Sealing compound that is brake fluid
resistant?

Thanks again for the help,

Bart
