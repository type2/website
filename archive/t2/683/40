Subject: wheels and tires in the time of cholera.

I'm in deep smit over the fifteen inch alloy wheels Ron has listed at
Bus Depot. I think the available light truck tires which will fit the 
wheels from Bus Depot are too big for the bay wheel wells.

I have been poking around in the type2 archives, on thesamba.com's bay 
forums, and gowesty.com's wheel package pages. I'm tire and wheel
stupid and I'm a bit confused by some of the things I've read.

I do not want to create a safety problem in the pursuit of style and/or
economy.

I would prefer alloy wheels. I would like a set of long lasting, quiet 
tires. I would like a combination of alloys and tires which didn't 
significantly affect my speedometer and also fit my bus. I'd like to 
load up my 78 seven passenger with people and/or stuff and safely move the 
passengers and cargo.

Who has switched to fifteen inch rims and what size/type tires are you
using? What has your driving experience been with your choice of tire
compared to a fourteen inch, reinforced, correctly load rated tire? Will
you keep your current arrangement, or will you try something new when it
comes time to change your tires again?

Ideally, I'd like to know how an arrangement like GoWesty's works on
bay window buses -- their customer feedback seems uniformly in the
vanagon camp, and they have not responded about bay window specific
feedback at present.

Thanks bunches in advance,

jack
