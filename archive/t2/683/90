Hiya Don,

If I'm not incorrect, that black plastic piece is a protective cover for your 
door latch.  It snaps into place on the latch assembly and keeps the dust and 
debris (more or less) out of the latch mechanism.  That you found yours 
(presumably) at the bottom of the door would most likely indicate that the cover 
has broken.  And that is not all that unusual.  The cover gets brittle with the 
heat and the snap-tags break off.
