Subject: Re: [T2] Brake fluid leakage - again

Bart said:

 I seam to have more then one leakage problem Fluel system is updated
though, now I still have a leakage of brake fluid at the connection between
the dual cilinder and the master cilinder. After a lot of trouble findint
them, I already replaced both seals but these don4t seam to fit correct. Any
tips to further stop the leak? Sealing compound that is brake fluid resistant?

NO sealing compound is used anywhere brake fluid is.

I am assuming you have NEW seals between the reservoir and the master?
#58 here: http://www.ratwell.com/technical/Microfiche/t205100.gif

If yes, then you have one of two problems: either the reservoir is cracked, # 1
or # 2 [you never gave the year of your bus] ( # 1 is 69-70.... # 2 is 71-79)
OR the sealing grommet between the tube and the reservoir is leaking, # 59.

The CORRECT seals between the reservoir and master WILL fit correctly.

The seals between the reservoir and master are part # 211 611 817 A
The seals between the tube and both resrvoirs are part # 211 611 833 C
