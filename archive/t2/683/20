Subject: '71 Air Oil Bath Warm/Cool Flow Control Gizmo

Never heard anything back on this request 01/15, so I am re-hashing and 
re-posting:

This device in my air oil bath does not work, and I think my bus would 
run a little better with this bit operating properly. I have read the 
article in the library, but I am not convinced I want to deal with the 
situation that way if it turns out to be broken outright. I'd really 
rather fix it properly, with real parts.

I wonder if the thermostat -- which is brass and screws in and out of 
the tin -- might just need some sort of adjusting (more in, more out) to 
get this thing to trip. My guess, though, is that the little plunger 
that sticks out of it just no longer works. (giggles) Is there a source 
for this wax pellet thermostat? It does not look like it could possibly 
be any easier to replace, if only the part exists.

If the answer is No, then I need to think about compensating for it, 
which would be a drag. I'd like to hear what others have done to deal 
with their warm/cool flow issues. (For temperature reference, I live in 
the CA Bay Area, so it is fairly mild here.)

This might be a good time to mention that I have a spare canister that 
is probably from a '68-70 -- looks just like mine except it has some 
kind of contraption attached to the top of the snout near the flap 
weight. The tin and horsehair are in good shape. The rubber arm had a 
tear in it, which was taped over with black duct tape, but is otherwise 
not cracked. If you have any interest, let me know and I can take pics. 
Will sell, trade or barter. Have other parts from a '70 bus, a few from 
a '72, also. Some big, some small. Any that don't interchange with my 
'71 are up for grabs.

Thanks,
