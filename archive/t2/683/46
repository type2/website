Greg,

It was indeed! :-)  Altho the bus performed much better than I expected,
in that I never had to crawl under it.  Certain other buses in the caravan
did worse, to my chagrin.  I was *hoping* to win the "rusty bus" award,
but the poor fellow whose relay arm fell off won instead (and he deserved
it!)

err... probably not :-)  Remember, the bus went down stripped-out to ease
Kelly's and Mark's work.  The interior is in my basement and will remain
there until it is back here.  While it will be far better looking when I
get ir back, it will still be an empty drum, both from a camping and
sleeping perspective.  That's both bad and good.  For camping and driving,
not so hot, but both Mark and Kelly will have their work on display for
one and all to inspect.  I am proud of what both did/are doing and really
want to afford them this opportunity.

Greg,

I got a blank page here (tho I remember the drafts quite well :-)
