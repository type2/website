OHYEAH!  and it was a bunch of fun to sit on, too!  That's part of the
last $2000 I was talking to Don about.... new horshair pads and
salt-and-pepper upholstery cloth/vinyl.  The springs are still good and
relatively rust-free, tho I may get them blasted and painted.

On doing a restoration, it isn't the big things that kill you, it is the
multitude of details.  I have the '67-only governor for under the carb,
but they ain't cheap if you want to do a total restoration (which I do).
I was lucky with this body to get it with most of the little bits.

One total PITA will be curtains...  finding a source for the damned
curtain material may cause me to go into business.  I think there is
enough demand that if I ordered custom production of a couple thousand
yards of the brown/white/yellow plaid that I could sell enough to break
even, even at $20-30/yard (think $2-300 for enough to make all the
curtains for a bus).  I *BELIEVE* this same material was used from '64-73,
so there should be a market!
