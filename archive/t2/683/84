Subject: Re: [T2] More balancing

Shop manuals often instruct you to mark the position of the clutch on
the flywheel so you put them back together the same way, but do you
really think the engines are balanced at the factory? I don't have
direct knowledge, but I don't see the assembly line stopping for this.
I think the clutches and flywheels are individually balanced when
manufactured, but not balanced as a rotating mass.

How much less when you re-orient the pressure plate, I really don't know. If you don't know the original position (i.e. you didn't take photos) you might as well leave it as is.
