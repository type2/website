100KM = 60K miles, not a big deal for a fairly modern car from 1960 and up...

There are several Volvos in town with 300K MILES on them. My old Honda had 
250K miles on it when I last saw it. I am hoping for 300K miles out of all 
of my current cars. They get cheaper to drive every year b/c the resale is 
crap, repair costs flatten out (as long as I do the work myself), etc. Not 
to mention I can get junkyard parts for my current commuters ('97 VW Cabrio 
and '99 CR-V).
