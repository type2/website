GoWesty's 15" Vanagon wheel/tire package includes standard passenger car
tires, which they claim will be fine on a Vanagon even though they are not
reinforced as Volkswagen recommends. Their argument, is that since the 15"
tire has a taller sidewall it need not be reinforced. As I note on my tire
info page, <http://busdepot.com/busdepot/details/tires.jsp>, I have a real
issue with using tires that do not meet VW specs. There are important safety
reasons why Volkswagen specified reinforced tires on busses. I think it is
beyond question that a reinforced tire should be used if you're using a
stock 14" wheel. The difference in handling and safety is significant.

But would a 15" tire still need to be reinforced, or is it unneccessary as
Go Westy claims? It's hard to come up with an "official" answer since a
'68-up Bus or Vanagon didn't have 15" tires so there is no "VW spec" for
this. But we can somewhat deduce one by looking at other VW vans. When VW
switched to a 15" tire on the early T4 (Eurovan), they continued to
recommend a reinforced tire. This was on a vehicle whose maximum GVWR was
only 575 pounds (total, not per axle) higher than the Vanagon.  So this
clearly shows that VW felt that the use of a 15" tire did NOT eliminate the
need for reinforced tires, at least on a vehicle with the weight of a
Vanagon or Eurovan. This would seem to directly contradict GoWesty's claim.


But how about a Bus, which is not quite as heavy as a Vanagon? Can we get
away with passenger car tires on a '68-up bus if they're 15"?  Well, let's
look backwards to the earlier Busses that had 15" tires. Splitties were sold
with both 14" and 15" tires. In both cases, VW specified tires with the
identical ratings. They were 6-ply (which I believe is still truck-rated,
although without as strong a sidewall as the 8-ply requirement for '68-up).
But the point is BOTH the 14" and 15" versions required 6-ply tires. While
VW specified 4-ply tires on their cars that used 15" tires, they did not on
their busses. Extrapolating this to apply to the '68-up busses, one might
conclude that if VW recommended an 8-ply tire in a 14" size, there is no
reason to believe that going up to 15" would result in a reduction of this
recommendation. Just as it did not on the Vanagon/Eurovan.  Another factor
to consider is that Volkswagen recommended a rear tire inflation of 40 psi.
This exceeds the maximum inflation of many 15" passenger car tires.

Is this answer definitiive? No, it's merely extrapolation of the data that
we do have. But I think it makes sense, and as one who tends to err on the
side of caution, I think I'd opt for truck-rated tires even in the 15" size.
I know that saying this might well cost me the sale of a set of 15" alloys,
but  anyway that's my take on it.
