My '73 1700 w/Kadrons starts on the keyturn pretty much every time. Hot 
or cold.
I made sure to put the biggest battery I could fit in the space back 
there, I dont know if that makes THAT much difference or not in your 
situation.

I have to give the gas a 1/2 press as I turn the key and she sparks up. 
Being chokeless I then have to give it a touch of gas to warm up.
