Must no, desired yes.

There are only 3 possible positions of the pressure plate iirc. There's a 33% chance you put it on the correct way. 

If they are matched up as they were before then the engine will be in the greatest state of balance. That equates to longest life. How much less when you re-orient the pressure plate, I really don't know. If you don't know the original position (i.e. you didn't take photos) you might as well leave it as is.

Each part should have been balanced individually to some degree unless there was a greivous manufacturing mistake so IMHO the engine should be ok especially at the lower rpms.

Perfect balance still wears out the cases just not as fast. The crank will flex by the nature of it's 4-cyl boxer layout.
