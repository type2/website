I actually used rubber cement in the cracks and wrapped them on the
outside with electrical tape and duct tape on top of that.  While it was
messy and not pretty the tape seemed to give the cement a backing.  Some
of my cracks had places where you could see tiny holes and the cement
filled them after a couple applications.

Ideally, someone should cast these things and start producing
after market versions out of a good quality rubber again.
