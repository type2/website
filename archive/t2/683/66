Subject: Cracks in the s-boots

Speaking of things that VW had no intention of supplying in perpetuity, 
there out to be some kind of coating that you could pour into the 
s-boot between throttle and AFM, roll around, and seal the little 
hairline cracks that develop in it (despite the accordian design). 
Something like gas tank sealer, but for rubber.
