Subject: Flapper in the valve?

I'll try asking this another way: there appears to be a sort of flapper 
in the air breather valve. It's conical, with the apex pointing at the 
bottom of the valve. The flapper in the example I am looking at appears 
to be gunked and immobile about 1/8 to 1/4 inch open. When clear, 
should this flapper open and close?

I'm soaking it in charcoal lighter fluid (can't find my kerosene) right 
now.
