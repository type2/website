Or rebuilding a tranny, or replacing a piston on a typeIV without removing 
the engine, or installing A/C.  Even replacing a clutch only rates "hard" 
in my book.  I'd give all of the flat side windows and the rear window an 
"easy" rating and the windshield medium because depending on some unknown 
factors I usually need a second person for the job and sometimes have to 
try it 3-4 times before I get it seated properly.  Still has never taken 
more than 45 minutes.  Regardless, isn't it worth it to get that great 
feeling of having good window rubber all around that doesn't leak?
