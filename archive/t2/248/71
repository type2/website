Uh - why not keep the fuel injection AND the 2000cc's. If your lower end is 
trashed then transplant your heads , pistons, cylinders etc.

That 1700cc may complain about the higher gear of the tranny and lower 
power of the smaller engine.

I say this only b/c it is about as much work to fix that engine as it is to 
transplant another.

Short version: disable and remove the fuel injection pump. Replace with an 
electric pump that will max out at low psi ranges like 3 psi. Cap off the 
return fuel line at the tank. The fuel pump can be a generic electric pump 
from a farm tractor repair shop. I have seen these now as low as $30 and it 
may save you postage.

Wire it to an oil pressure switch and/or an inertia switch. The GM Vega had 
an oil pressure switch suitable. All the Ford products came with these 
inertia switches which cut power to the pump in the event of an accident. 
It is designed to be reset after a collision without tools. They cost about 
$10 in a junkyard.

Your pump can be run off of a relay mounted on the fire wall. Run the power 
(FUSED) directly from the battery, and get the switching relay power from 
the key (+) side of the coil. Any safety items like oil pressure switches 
and inertia switches should be placed after fuse and before the relay.

The alternator wiring is the same. The ignition wiring is the same. The 
injection components should be boxed up and sent to me <grin!>....

While you are at it replace ALL of the fuel hoses and vent hoses.
