The cheap ones are $150 to $300 and will readout on one manufactures codes. 
I am commercial, so depreciable. I charge $75 for hookup. This includes 
code readout and independent verification of all devices and circuits, as 
well as real time running parameters. My system is complete for all the 
Euro marks. It is compatible with 80's technology to date. Half the time 
you get one code that says "rich/lean". I can tell that by pulling a spark 
plug, but more so, I can tell which it is, rich or lean. So a code read out 
alone won't do a thing for you many times. 90% of the time, the fault is 
founded in inadequate maintenance. Spark plugs or oxy sensors or filters 
loooong past due. I identify and resolve maintenance issues first, then 
readout the codes, then erase them, then do a running test to see if they 
reset. If they do reset, then I already know a whole bunch of things it is 
not, leaving far fewer things to diagnose. Want a readout without doing the 
maintenance first??? That's another shop. Good luck.
