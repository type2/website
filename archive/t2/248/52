the flexibel pipes between my ingene en de big pipe to the front , i found 
that the pipes itself containt parts of white asbest , even some broken lose 
ones in the airflow system to the cabine , and big ones where the pipes 
where conected to the metal , i removed them all , with a good active 
carbonfilter mask , safty glases . and other protection and toke a long 
shower after the job and wased all my clothes to be sure[the asbestos i put 
in closed plastic bags wich i will bring to a goverment colection point for 
chemical waste , my car is a t2b westfalia build in june 1977 for the 
european market, eveybody should know for them selfs what they  find
