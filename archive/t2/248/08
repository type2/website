Before I would condemn the vacuum unit by this test, I would get a timing
light and check timing at idle. Then remove the vacuum hose on the retard side
and check timing again.
With vacuum on it should be 5 after.
Vacuum off it should go to about 8 before.
Now connect the retard hose to the advance side and check timing again.
Depending on the distributor/vacuum unit you have, it should go to either
16-19 before or 11-15 before.

Since you have a 75, there are 3 different distributors that came originally
on that engine. Depends on transmission and if it is a Calif version. But
there are only 2 different vacuum units.

Non-Calif, manual trans, 022 905 205AB [0 231 181 012]
This has a 07 125 vacuum unit.
Non-Calif, auto trans, 022 905 205AC [0 231 181 014]
This has a 07 127 vacuum unit.
Calif, manul trans, 021 905 205AB [0 231 181 048]
This has a 07 125 vacuum unit.
Calif, auto trans, 021 905 205AC [0 231 181 055]
This has a 07 127 vacuum unit.

The 07 125 vacuum unit will have 995 on the arm near where it attaches to the
plate.
The specs for it is:  8-11deg Adv (-at-) 7.9 In. Hg, 11-13deg Ret (-at-)7.9 In. Hg.
The long Bosch part number for it is: 1 237 121 995

The 07 127 vacuum unit will have 999 on the arm.
The specs for it is: 3-7deg Adv (-at-) 6.3 In. Hg, 11-13deg Ret (-at-) 8.2 In. Hg.
The long Bosch part number for it is: 1 237 121 999

You really need to call around and get a price for a new one before you decide
to test yours...... and you need to be sitting down:)

Almost right..... get the timing light first! Test and verify before you spend
$$$ for something you may not need.
