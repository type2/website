Subject: Stinky Heat, Cured!

We'll after finally getting my heat hooked up and working with new =
heater cables, a new stock muffler, and the other assorted parts I was =
dismayed that my heat smelled like exhaust.  I went back through =
everything and doublechecked everything and couldn't find anything =
amiss.  Finally after reading through the archives I decided to see if =
the engine hatch seal was suspect.  I duct taped the engine hatch shut =
and took it for a spin.  Nice, clean, exhaust free heat.  Wow, what a =
difference and lesson learned too.  EVERY component in the system must =
be in good shape for thing to work well.
