Subject: Tranny Front Seal

Hi List,

My engine's shipped off to AVP, so I'm fixing some misc. stuff while I
wait...

I'd like to replace my leaking front tranny seal.  Bentley talks about
removing the front shift housing from the tranny, but I'm not sure I want to
do that.  Anybody done this before?   Can this seal simply be pulled off and
a new one installed right over the inner shift lever?  Bentley shows an
inner guide bushing; would this typically also need replacing?  And does
anyone know where to find these parts, or at least the front seal? (I
haven't dried VWoA yet...)

Thanks,
RickG
