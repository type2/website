Time for  a compression check.  you may have a serious blow by problem 
on  a cylinder.
this will force the exhaust and fuel vapor into the crank case to mix 
with the oil.  The same if valve stems arent sealing correctly.  slight 
vapor leakage past and mixing with the oil on top of the heads.  
compression  check  will tell you if that is happening.
