Subject: Re: [T2] strange note on master cylinderr

after looking at some new not rebuilt master cylinders on the shelf at 
work i called one of the suppliers .  he confirmed that they make the 
oem for several of the majors and they do the same thing on their 
castings.  If the part is sold out of the oem parts counter or 
installed in the oem vehicle it shows the oem part numbers and theirs 
are "polished off"  just the opposite when the part is sent out to the 
flaps or general distributors.  then the oem is polished off and just 
the raybestos brand remains.  He said this is common on all cast parts 
as it is too costly to make a separate casting for each use of the part.
