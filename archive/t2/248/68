Ralph,

You didn't mention how it runs?


Only a few places it can happen.

Injector not closing after shutoff.
Cold start injector not closing after shutoff.

Hole in a piston?
really really really bad rings....not too probable unless
	an injector is leaking.

I can't think of anyplace else that fuel even comes close to being able
to get in the crankcase.

Cheers, dave
