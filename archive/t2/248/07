Matt,

I think this is fairly common.  I found mine had more holes and cracks
than solid material.  I wasn't able to find a replacement either so I
used a piece of fuel hose long enough to come off of it's mount on the
top of the tank and loop around to meet the metal vent line.  I believe
the purpose of this vent is to allow air and vapors to be pushed back up
to the filler to be vented out easier than force the air back up against
the incoming gas.  A loop in the vent shouldn't be a problem.  As long
as the hose is gas resistant and stiff enough to keep from kinking, the
pressure of the air trying to get out of the tank will find it's way
around the loop just fine.

My tank showed lots of indications that it had gas slopping out over the
tank for quite a while.  Not healthy!
