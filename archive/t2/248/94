I have to agree with Janice on this one :^)  My '70 putts around quite well 
with the 1600.  It wouldn't fare too well if it were loaded with camping 
gear year round.  I throw the added camping stuff in once or twice a year, 
and limit the abuse to my drivetrain(even with the  091).

Happy Friday!
