Tested the coleman out and it failed. it now sits as a soda cooler next 
to me at the computer.  i  tested a  couple  without the name of 
coleman and they were worse. fortunately i didnt have to buy them for 
testing.  I went with a portable fridge (RC3000) made by dometic.  it 
is a green box that comes with a set of wheels if you wish to use them 
as well as 110v 12v and lp hookups.  it comes with a regulator and hose 
to hook up a small propane torch type bottle but i had a new hose made 
at the local rv gas place to hook it up to my van gas system as well as 
  another hose with regulator to connect to  standard BBQ type bottles. 
I have a  small power inverter in the van so when moving i use the 110 
volt  connection and when camped switch to gas.  the gas has 3 
settings.  on a recent campout down at RMMW i used the high for in the 
daytime and  stayed under 50 degrees.  at night i  set it to the lowest 
setting and it was still at the freezing point in the morning.  regular 
thermostat knob for 12v and 110v.  very happy with this unit  as i  can 
put away if i dont want it in the van and i can move it around at will. 
  As for solar  panel idea,,you wouldnt be able to carry the panel 
needed.  BTW thermo is what the one that went out in your scamp was.
