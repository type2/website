Subject: Bentley For Sale

Well, after driving my '81 Vanagon all these years I....

finally broke down and bought an '82 Westy!  Good body, good interior and
camping gear, not-so-good engine.  Looks like I'll have a "project" for a
while!

Anyway, left in the Westy was a Bentley Vanagon Official Factory Repair
Manual; this one covers 1980 through 1989.  Since I already have a Bentley I
figure I'd offer it up to the lists before trying e*** - you know, that
auction website.  Cover and a few pages a slightly wrinkled, but inside is
remarkably clean, spine and cover are intact and tight.

First $30 takes it, and I'll charge $4.50 (USPS book rate) to ship.

Thanks.
