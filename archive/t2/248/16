Indeed, he probably goes by the term "technician". But that code reader is 
the first thing that should be used. The only alternative is hours and 
hours of pin by pin diagnostics with a multimeter, and we're talking 
hundreds of pins on these later cars. Half the time the code readout will 
give you the solution, in which case a technician will do. Another quarter 
of the time it will point you in the right direction for confirming the 
problem. And the last quarter of the time the codes can lead you on a wild 
goose chase, you will then need a mechanic. If the problem is 40,000 miles 
on the plugs, the computer won't tell you that. I refuse to hook up the 
code reader until I have seen the maintenance history and brought the 
vehicle up to date on all maintenance. Amazing how that solves the problem 
over half the time. Only if that doesn't solve the problem, then do I hook 
up the code reader.

You can buy low cost code readers. Mine cost $7000 and does a whole lot 
more than just read codes. It has flat solved problems for me 3 times in 
the last year that otherwise may have taken me a dozen hours to find.

Whether your vehicle is 3 years old or 30 years old, maintenance via 
inspection, not time/milage, is the road to least cost per mile, no matter 
how much that costs.
