--Okay, so nobody with f.i. ever made it far from home huh?

70's era VW f.i. is not exactly brain surgery folks. You think you're gonna "more than likely be a garage tow" just by having f.i. in your car?

If better gas mileage and not having my powerplant freeze up on a cold day is a PITA, I'll take it.
