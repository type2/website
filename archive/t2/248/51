Richard,

    About the dwell/timing changing, that sounds like the bushings may =
be worn out in your distributor. Remove your cap and rotor, and see if =
you can push your distributor shaft side to side. With the points =
rubbing block on one of the cam lobes (high point) you may be able to =
see it change the setting.
    If it does, replace the distributor, unless you have a =
Brother-in-law that works at a machine shop that can make up some =
bushings and install them.

Tommy
