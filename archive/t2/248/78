For those of you with apparently re buildable fuel pumps and carbs - that 
decide to replace instead: Please save these from the trash and offer them 
to the list. I try to stock pile a few of these spares as while they may be 
plentiful now - they may be hard to get in ten years and more cost 
effective to rebuild.

I have rebuilt carbs and pumps with good results. This is common in Italy 
and I expect common in other countries as well. In Italy you bought brake 
shoe material and reriveted them on yourself for example. I did this a 
couple of times with good results on two cars.

I am inclined to rebuild OEM parts versus South American parts...
