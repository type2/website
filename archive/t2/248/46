>Before doing all of this I would check the grounds coming from the
taillight
assembly to the body chassis, chances are it has either come off, or is so
corroded it is not making contact anymore. IF you hera the relay working
when you move the indicator switch to the right position, IT CANT BE THE
SWITCH.

Duh! You're absolutely right. Thanks! I'll still go ahead and clean up the
contacts though. They've never been cleaned in the 14 years I've had the
bus.
