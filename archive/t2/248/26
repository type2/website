Chris,

My local auto window repairman uses Gojo....you know, the waterless 
handcleaner.  Skip the kind with pumice in it tho.

Stays slippery just about the right amount of time and then cleans up
perfectly....put a little on something and then go back a little
later and watch it disappear!

Chers, dave
