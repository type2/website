Subject: Re: [T2] fuel leak

jason,

i had a fuel pump go bad a few months ago, i was traveling about 190 miles 
home, i stopped for gas about half way and it took 14.something gallons, i 
about freeked cause as you know it only holds 14 gallons, then about 23 
miles down the road i ran out of gas, ( i didn't know it at the time this 
is what it was, but i did someinvestigating and it was caused by my 
leaking fuel pump)

it was about 150$ to replace the fuel pump, i think they are rebuildable 
but i haven't tried to rebuild mine yet. i would take care of the pump, 
not the leak. also have you checked your other fuel lines just for gp, the 
one to the left of the engine compartment hidden up in the air well on the 
side of the gas tank, that one cause a major gas fume issue for me cause i 
couldn't find the leak....

anyway, good luck
