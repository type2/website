Subject: '78 westy timing

Thanks for all of the answers. Some PO evidently removed the timing strip
so I will replace. Thanks. Anyone have suggestions,remarks about how gas
is getting in the oil? I have checked the injectors, cold start valve,
replaced the points which were pitted and replaced the injector seals. I
also used gas treatment and drove several miles- still gets fuel in oil.
