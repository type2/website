I asked a similar question and was told: they are energy hogs. They cool to 
40 degrees lower than the external temps - - that means if your vehicle is 
95 degrees your drinks will only be 55 degrees. 120 degrees in the van - 
equals only 80 degrees inside the cooler.

Never heard of anyone trying to cool a space with one.
