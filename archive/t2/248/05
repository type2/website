Take apart the turn signal assembly on the column (two long screws) and
operate the turn signal while observing. You will see that the lever moves a
contact between and over two "nubs", which should be very shiny. Get some
rubbing alcohol and Q tips and clean the Dickens out of these little
suckers...all three contact points, one moving and two stationary. You would
not think that these points would get dirty or gummy, but they do. The
contacts should shine when you are done. Then reassemble and see how it
acts. If this turn signal assembly is loose or shifts back/forth on the
column, you can give it a couple of wraps of good, stretchy black electric
tape, put the cover back on, and give it some more snug wraps, over and
underneath the assembly. It's not factory, but it firms things up real good.
