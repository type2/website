Before doing all of this I would check the grounds coming from the taillight
assembly to the body chassis, chances are it has either come off, or is so
corroded it is not making contact anymore. IF you hera the relay working
when you move the indicator switch to the right position, IT CANT BE THE
SWITCH.


> Take apart the turn signal assembly on the column (two long screws) and
 operate the turn signal while observing. You will see that the lever moves
a
contact between and over two "nubs", which should be very shiny. Get some
 rubbing alcohol and Q tips and clean the Dickens out of these little
 suckers...all three contact points, one moving and two stationary. You
would
not think that these points would get dirty or gummy, but they do. The
 contacts should shine when you are done. Then reassemble and see how it
acts. If this turn signal assembly is loose or shifts back/forth on the
 column, you can give it a couple of wraps of good, stretchy black electric
 tape, put the cover back on, and give it some more snug wraps, over and
 underneath the assembly. It's not factory, but it firms things up real
good.
