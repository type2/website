Subject: Re: [T2] WINDSHIELD

Hi Bradley,

Maybe *you* just had a bad experience. I've done two windshields and all 
the side windows over the last couple years, and none of them were 
"Super hard". At worst one I would have called my first windshield 
"difficult". The second one was a piece of cake.

"Super Hard" is an adjective I reserve for things like removing a stuck 
gland nut some dipstick PO installed without a wave washer on a Type1 
engine or pulling a stuck brake drum.

As always, YMMV.

Happy trails,
