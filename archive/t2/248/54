Subject: Fuel Leak - Friday Response



It's Friday, please don't take this too seriously!

I wouldn't worry about a fuel leak too much.  A slow leak like that
shouldn't cost more than a few cents per week in lost gas.  No big deal.
Not to mention it will evaporate quickly so it won't be bad for the
environment.

Just drink a big-sized beer and wrap the empty can around your leak with a
bit of duct tape.  That will mimimize the lost money from fuel leakage.

By the way - you should see my bus, I've got freakin' fuel flying all over
the place.  I don't mind except for the over-whelming fuel odors coming
from the engine compartment all the time.  You get used to it after a
while.

Good luck,
Shawn.

P.S.  I think list wisdom will contradict this advice and insist you fix
any and all leaks **immediately**.
