Chris,

Looked at my local HVAC/plumbing contractors a couple of weeks ago when I 
was on vacation.  

Theirs comes in 2 sizes 1/4" and 1/2"(I think that was it) and in 4'
widths.  Thin tar paper on one side and the insulation appeared to be 
some sort of heavy dark colored fiberglass attached.

Mainly for outside insulation of long duct runs.

I am going to go back to your archived article and try to find the tar 
paper locally tomorrow.

Wish me luck as one of my friends that is a roofer had never heard of the 
stuff....but he offered to do the spray in foam on my bus....I regretfully 
declined<grin>(and he understood).

Cheers, dave
