If you look at the TOP edge of your pully (not front or back, but the Top edge
of the pully half closest to you) in the general vicinity of the pre-cut
notches, you should see a circular indentation, this should be TDC. Take a
15mm wrench and lay the left side of the open end in the middle of this
indentation. Now, The right side of the the wrench will be sitting at just
about 10 degrees BTDC. This is Boston Bob's trick, not mine.
