Subject: Re: 72' bus hitch

Mike, I installed a Reese Universal Hitch (00263) on my Bus bumper.  I
have pulled a small trailer full on bikes and camping equipment
hundreds of miles and have pulled a parade float with no problems.  My
bumper is secure and I did not modify the bumper or hitch for any
extra strength.  The hitch from Walmart is about $40.00.  You can find
new ones on eBay for about $10.00 plus shipping.  Jamie Rivers has a
real nice hitch that bolts to the frame but it might interfere with
your exhaust.  Personally, I don't think I would want to pull anything
that my bumper hitch couldn't handle because I wouldn't want to put
the strain on the engine.
