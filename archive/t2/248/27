I went through the Navy Electrician's school and spent a week or so on the 
electronics side of things. Military schools were pretty good I thought. 
Learned lots.

Anyone that wants some adventure (or like me is just spinning your tires in 
life) give 'em a try. Not my "bag" but glad I gave 'em a few years.

VW content: sure wish I had a good Westy when I was in the Navy. Would have 
been nice to have a rolling "home away from home" when I needed a break 
from all the crew cuts and Navy gray!!! Unfortunately I did not realize 
this until I was out for a few years. Bought our Westy and a few weeks 
later smacked myself on the forehead when it all dawned on me!!! "I coulda 
had a Westfalia!!!" I spent my time in the Navy/Italy tinkering with Beetles.

Commercial over.
