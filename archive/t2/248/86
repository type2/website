Subject: Need Westfalia Camper manual

Well, after driving my '81 Vanagon all these years I....

finally broke down and bought an '82 Westy!  I though the supplemental
camper manual was in the car but it turns out it was just a second copy of
the Vanagon manual.

Anyway, I seem to recall that these manuals were being re-published by some
outfit, but I don't know who.  Can anybody point me in the right direction?

TIA.
