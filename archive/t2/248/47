I think this is refering to a distributer that has worn out. The shaft
now will move side to side off center. sometimes opening the points
correctly other times not. It us usually first seen by watching the
dwell change when you rev the engine. Bentley give a figure of
variance & I believe it's like 1degree +- but not sure. Consult
Bentley for the proper number.

So are you saying that your dwell changes? It shouldn't, at least not
much. I just recently replaced my distributor because of this same
problem. runs much better now.

sorta. It is another way to trigger the spark & develop a magnetic
field in the coil which when it collapses causes the nice type of
spark that will jump across a gap in a spark plug. But neither system
will let you get the most out of your engine with a worn distributor.
I would check it.
