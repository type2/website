Probably not any more slow than what you currently drive. I would ask the 
VANAGON list for their opinion. There are a few engine mods you can do to 
make your steed a bit faster and pleasant to drive.

Advantages: real heat, Vanagon refinements, diesel fueled power (I like 
diesels).

Disadvantages: you will have to learn some new skills, slow but not much 
slower than what you've got, bet NOBODY will work on this thing for you 
unless you are visiting a VW specialist.

I'd buy it.
