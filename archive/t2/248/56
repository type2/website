I checked the distributor and it's fine.  I'm lubricated it properly now and there is Bosch grease between the cam and the rubbing block.  The dwell changes but it is within the Bentley spec.

What I'm saying is that sometimes the spark seems to fire a little later and the timing mark moves a few of degrees. The idle isn't rough, it just isn't 100% rock steady at idle 7.5 BTDC.  Before I replaced the points and rotor it wasn't consistent at all: the points, has a huge pit and a matching tit where they had melted, and the rotor (rev limiting 04016) had big holes in the metal contact at the edge.
