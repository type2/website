I have replaced all the windows in my '79 bus last week.  It is a super 
hard job!  Anyone who says other is lying or never done it.

I got new rubber from the Bus Depot.  New is nice but it is all 
manufactured in Basil or Mexico - can't get the good stuff from Germany. 
 The new rubber is thicker so the old window space is smaller.

Go to NAPA or any auto part store and get the window and weather 
stripping grease. Do not use white grease as it will damage the rubber. 
 The right stuff will tell you it is ok on rubber.  The old dish soap 
method works but is very messy and trends to dry up too quickly.  A tube 
of the window grease is only $5 to $7.  Don't be penny wise and dollar 
foolish.

You will need a window stuck to put the new rubber on the window.  The 
cost $1.50 from Rock Mountain Motor works.  Buy is strait from them or 
get the same stick at the same price from the Bus Depot - gotta love 
those guys.  One stick is a must and two is really nice.  DON'T use a 
screw driver.

Get the line as suggested - 1/8 to 3/8 in diameter.  Leave one loop of 
line out at the top of the window and one at the bottom to pull with to 
get the inside lip over the ridge.  the window will "suck" right in a 
you pull the cord out from the inside and the other guy/gal pushes from 
the outside.   Get ready to sweat!

I had help from a friend in the auto body business.  He use to do auto 
glass in Texas for 10 years before moving to Maui.  It took us 3 hours 
for all the windows in the bus.  The windshield was the worst.
