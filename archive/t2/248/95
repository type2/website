Mc-Master Carr has much better materials for I'll bet a cheaper price...

A local source to check would be commercial HVAC contractors - we have a 
local service that will allow me to prowl through their warehouse 
occasionally. They use ALOT of these materials (and better) and will sell 
you a greater quantity for a lower price.

Also check refrigeration and electrical supply houses.

Lastly look for Industrial Rubber and gasket suppliers.

Typically the commercial guys can sell you vast quantities for a fraction 
of the price of the catalogs like JC Whitney who are just reselling materials.
