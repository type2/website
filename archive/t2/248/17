Whew.. Well, if you make a living at it, and write off the depreciation or
loss on your taxes, that is one thing.. But few of us could afford a $7,000
meter, even if that is a "cheap"one.
Now.... Here IS a cool solution, and I found this out when I went to look at
the '78 VW bus the other day.
This guy told me that for $45, anyone can take their car into a Tune Masters
(assuming it can be moved?) and get a complete diagnostic report from their
code reader. You pay the $45, they give you a printout, and you can go fix
it yourself.
I don't know how many states Tune Masters is in, but I'm sure that some
other outfits will do the same thing. If you have an "engine warning" light
on, this will tell you where to look.  Jan B
