Subject: Compression Check question

I want to check the compression on a 1600 DP engine I have that is NOT
installed in a bus right now. My question is: Can I do a compression check by
turning the engine over by hand on the generator pulley or does it need full
cranking speed from a starter to get an accurate reading?

Peace, John Baker
