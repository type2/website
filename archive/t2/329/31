Subject: RE: [T2] turn signal switch retaining screws specs. needed

Unfortunately they make screws with the same pitch diameter but the head
size is too large.  I've seen people buy standard slotted in stead of
Phillips ad turn the head diameter down in a lathe.  If you can find someone
that sells the right screws, I have lots of people that want them; including
my '71
