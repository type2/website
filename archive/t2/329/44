Subject: disconnecting shift lever

I am pulling engine and tranny. I have done all but one CV and as the 
title says disconnecting the tranny  from the shift rod. Reading 
Bentley  (chap. 3 page13 #9  says:

Working at the front of the transmission pull back rubber bellows that 
covers inner shift lever where it projects from the transmission

I see no bellows - OK could be gone.....

here is what I see     http://kazmal.net/

#10 says; With gearshift lever in 3rd gear cut the locking wire and 
remove the square head setscrew that holds the rear shift 
rod's............ disconnect the coupling from the inner shift rod by 
moving the gear shift into 2nd gear

Am I looking at the right place?
Is the square head screw the middle screw in the first picture?
Please help!
