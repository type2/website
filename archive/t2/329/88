Subject: Re: [T2] gas safety - tank draining saga

Draining out a tank can be quite a surprise.  I've been at it for three
days now.  
I swear my tank was near empty when I parked my bus about a year ago, but
I've filled a 2-gallon gas can and two gallon jugs and still
the fuel keeps a-coming! I will install a little valve (for security and
safety when this tank is finally drained.  sheesh!) 
 I'm paranoid about gasoline, but I've still managed to get my hands
soaked a couple of times during the process. I've got my bus parked in the
covered parking deck outside my office, so I've had a distinct aroma the
past few days after I come back from my lunch hour.
