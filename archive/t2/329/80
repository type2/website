Subject: lock cylinders?

Has anyone found a source to replace original lock cylinders without
replacing the whole lock/handle assy?
First my drivers side and then my passenger side cylinders have broken and
come right out of the handle. I replaced the drivers side with a whole new
handle but then I need an extra key that is the type of key like newer cars
with each side a mirror of the other, not two different sides like the
original.

Thanks,
