Subject: turn signal switch retaining screws specs. needed

Apparently, some time in the past few weeks, unknown TERRORISTS have
removed and made off with the two screws that retain the turn signal switch
into its assembly--on my 1970 Westy???

If some listee would be so kind as to remove one, and let me know it's 
size, length,
and thread pitch, I would be much obliged......................
