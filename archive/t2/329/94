Here is what I do to change my filter. Some day I will install a shutoff 
valve, but for now this works for me.

First I put on a latex glove to protect my hand from gas. Next I tie a 
rag around my wrist to catch any gas that runs off the glove. I then 
take a pair of vice grips and put a rag in the jaws to protect the fuel 
line, and clamp the vice grips down about an inch back from the end of 
the line. I take an artists pencil that I have for the job (slightly 
larger than a standard pencil, and round, though I have used a regular 
pencil wrapped with electrical tape in a pinch), and get it ready. I 
undo the clamp at the fuel filter, and pull the line and plug the 
dribble with the pencil. The rag around my wrist catches the little bit 
of gas that is in the inch or so of line and keeps it from running up my 
arm. The pencil isn't really required when using the vice clamps, but I 
like having redundant shut off. ;) I have just used the pencil in a 
pinch when I didn't have vice grips too.

My skin turns very red when it comes in contact with gas, and using the 
glove and rag I have never had so much as a red splotch.
