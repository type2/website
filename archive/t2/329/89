Subject: Re: [T2] Changing the fuel filter - gasoline safety

I like to keep some little medical clamps around.  The kind you see on TV 
with the long handles and the finger loops at the ends.  They have different 
sizes, and they click closed at varying degrees of tension.  They are useful 
for all kinds of things like that.  I have used them to hold headliners in 
place during installation, hold wires while soldering, all kinds of stuff.  
Their a buck or two a piece at a medical supply shop, sometimes CVS or other 
drug stores.  Highly recommended addition to the tool box!

Thanks,
