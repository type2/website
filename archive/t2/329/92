my suspicion would be that in the 3 years it sat, the rear wheel hubs
rusted to the brake and "froze"   and it sounds like the clutch is not
releasing so you have no idea if it is in gear or not....first thing I
would do would be to get the clutch working and then make sure it is in
neutral.  also some minor part of the engine might be hanging up, check it
thourghly.
