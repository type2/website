Subject: Mirror measurements request

Hi,

I'm tooling the master for the long mirror stem, but still need five (5)
bits of info not available from the pics that were so graciously provided to
me.

All are measurements.  I've uploaded a JPG of the stem with the measurements
marked on the diagram at http://www.cfnson.com/other/mirror01.jpg

If someone has one of the original long stemmed rear view mirrors handy, and
doesn't mind helping out, the info needed is:

1. Measurement "A": The length of the long stem, from where the metal ball
shaft enters the stem's vinyl covering, to the front edge (the edge facing
toward the windshield) of the mounting "base" (the end of the stem that fits
flush against the headliner).

2. Measurement "B": The length of the long stem, from where the metal ball
shaft enters the stem's vinyl covering, to the center of the windshield
"bumper" thingy.

3. Measurement "D": The "height" of the windshield bumper thingy, from the
"top" of the bumper thingy, to where the bumper thingy meets the stem.

And if you have one of the long stems that mount with screws:

4. Measurement "C": The distance between the screw holes from center to
center.

5. Measurement "E": The distance from the front edge of the mounting "base",
to the center of one of the screw holes.

Oh, and two more tidbits; Do the screws fit flush with the surface of the
mounting "base" or are they recessed into it, and what sort of heads do the
screws have?

Thank you for all of the help! :O)

When I get the final master mold finished, I'll send one of the castings to
David (List Admin) to critique.
