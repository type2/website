Subject: 7th Annual High Country Bus Festival

hey volks:

just a quick note about the 7th Annual High Country Bus Festival.
this years dates are  JULY 25,26 and 27th - 2003.

I am planning to update the webpage soon,  but if you would like to see some 
pictures from events gone past, check the link: Last year we had over 160 
buses in attendance.

We will have live music again this year and we are working to see if 
Blistered Dawson will be able to return and host the VW Family Feud.

ALSO, it may have taken them a while,  but I have been told that the article 
about last year's HCBF will be printed in April's issue of VW 
Trends.........so keep your eyes posted.

If you have any questions please let me know,  when I get the page updated 
with all of this year's info I will let you know.

thanks,
I hope to see everyone at EB in April.
Buddah
