Subject: Re: [T2]  SVDA dizzy,vacuum port

I think all dells have a port ready for vacuum next to the idle mixture screw on the right side of the carb. (viewing from the side with the mixture screws) If it is not present, then their is a little plug you can remove and what I did is press in the correct size brass nipple and drill through the barrel with a 7/32 drill bit (I think?) using the brass nipple as the guide. I had a spare 36 dell so I removed that nipple and used it on my good carb while also making sure the positioning is correct and the size of the hole etc. When I was done it looked exactly like the one previously tapped by cb performance.
