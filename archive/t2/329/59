Subject: Turn signal cancel

I finally got around to figuring out why my turn signals wouldn't cancel on
their own (I centered the wheel on the steering box and drag link a long
time ago).

The ring under the steering wheel has a plastic tab that wears at the edges
and won't cancel anymore. I wrapped it with some electricians tape to make
it a little thicker so it works.

What would be a better more permanent repair?
