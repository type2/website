Subject: RE: [T2] My Battery Fell Out...Help!!!!

If you have the money, time and love, the best thing to do is cut out the
cancer, find a donor bus and have a good body shop weld the piece in.  Of
course, this all depends on the work you are willing to put in, the amount
of rust in the tray area and the condition of the rest of the bus.
