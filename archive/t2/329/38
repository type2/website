 From where are you picking up the vacuum source?  I have a neighbor who 
just put a '79 2 liter into his 74 bus.  Despite my advise, he's using 
the Delortos (Big suckers!  Look like IDA Webers.) No x-over between the 
sides.  Unless I can find a good vacuum source it'll have to be 
mechanical advance only. Open to suggestions.
