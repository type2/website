Subject: Bus resists attack!

This evening I went to a friends house in midtown Sacramento and drove 
my '77. It is not the nicest neighborhood around. Case in point, last 
week my friends boyfriend had his toolbox stolen from out of his truck. 
Well, tonight I came out to my bus and somebody had attempted to break 
into it, but the mighty bus succesfully defended itself against the 
attack! Go bus!

They trashed the locks on both doors, but not the slider, so I guess 
that is how I am getting in and out of my bus for awhile. They also 
smashed the pasenger side vent wing, but where unable to make the glass 
break to the point where they could gain entry. Fortunately this glass 
was not original German glass, as the bus had been broken into via that 
window while the previous owner had it, and she replaced it with 
straight safety glass. (In her defense she had already decided to sell 
the bus.)

I have chosen to believe that the bus fought off her attackers using the 
outrage at her previous violations, but it is probably more due to the 
pure amature nature of the attack than anything else. It will have to 
wait till tomorrows light for the full assesment of the damages, but it 
is at least two locks and a piece of glass.

Had they succedded I surely would have lost my radio, possibly my 12 
disc changer, and most likely my tool box and all my tolls. Who knows 
what else would have caught their fancy.
