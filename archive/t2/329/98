Subject: RE: lock cylinders

I got some from one of my suppliers about six months ago, and I assume they 
are still available.  They were pretty costly, though, as I recall around 
$55 each.  I've never seen one of these break, except by being forced to 
turn when the latch is jammed.  I'd sure look at that as a possible cause.
