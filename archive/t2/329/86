Not to mention the slightest spark could kill you.

I tried to goose a burn barrel to life with a bit of gasoline one time 
(long ago) and some spilled on my hands. Well the fire lit up just fine but 
so did my sleeve and hand. I could not rinse the fire off with the faucet 
and the sleeve too was difficult to put up (I just took the shirt off and 
smothered my hand ). Anyhow, it blistered much of my hand.

Why was I doing that in the first place? We'd had a brief rain earlier that 
day and I had not used the burn barrel for 3 days. No heat, no smoke but 
someplace down in the barrel there was a flame and it ignited the gas I 
threw on it immediately. Woosh!

Do whatever you've got to do to keep the gasoline in the tank and off you.

Also - - - unplug the batteries first, first, first.
