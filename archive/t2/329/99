Don't ever think for a moment that your bus won't turn
over, My 73 Bus (Loaf along) fell over on it's side in
the moutians in SC (just pulled over to the side of
the road stopped and over she went)didn't do much
damage but embrassed the hell out of me. Like the
drunk on the motercycle, forgot to put my foot down
when I stopped. Phil
