So can siphoning gas... by mouth.

I now siphon gas only with clear tubing and a siphon pump.  Well, except in
emergencies, then I _might_ suck on the tube, if I'm feeling brave and I am
_very_ desperate.

A very long time ago, I siphoned gas and accidentally got some in my mouth.
Which isn't so bad IF (I repeat emphatically) IF the swallow reflex doesn't
kick in before you can spit it out.

I didn't suffer brain damage or anything (I hope), but I burped gas _fumes_
for three days, and everything I ate and drank tasted like petrol.

I tend to give siphon tubes a wide berth nowadays...
