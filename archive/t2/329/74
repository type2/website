Blake,

Take Tim's advice first ,then turn here if that wasn't the problem.

Check and double-check your hoses in the engine compartment (assuming its FI
ofcourse). MAINLY the hose that connects to the air plenum just in front (FIF)
and under the cold start valve, this one is commonly overlooked. Also check all
the hoses on the S-pipe for proper fitting.

If its not FI, then ignore this message.
