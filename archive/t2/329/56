Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Fluid Dye

Hi Barry,

I'm with Terry on this one. Food coloring is best left to desserts.

Brake fluid is a very special compound, It's got to have a very high 
boiling point, to cope with the intense pressure in a hydraulic system. 
It also has to be non-corrosive to both steel and rubber brake 
components. And it has to be affordable, as compared to competitive 
offerings from other manufacturers.

I would NEVER put something that did not meet the first two criteria 
into my braking system. There's just too much at stake. I would 
recommend that you flush that system ASAP, and drive NOWHERE in the 
meanwhile. If/When the food coloring boils under pressure your brake 
system WILL malfunction, and someone could get hurt.

The third criteria is your wild card. Perhaps you can find a fluid that 
meets your needs (color) and also meets or exceeds DOT3 specs. Try a 
local hydraulic heavy equipment service center (bulldozers, garbage 
trucks, cranes, etc)  and see if they have something in a color you 
like. It probably will be more expensive than what's on the shelf at 
the flaps, but at least it won't hurt anyone.

Happy trails,
