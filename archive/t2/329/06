Subject: My Battery Fell Out...Help!!!!

Hello list members,

    I discovered that my passenger side battery on my 77 westy has fallen
through the floor. Fortunately, it is holding on by a small piece of metal. I
looked at the replacement battery trays (-at-)BusDepot. Is that the best way to go?
And what is involved in installing the new tray? Any help would be greatly
appreciated, i did not see anything on this topic in the library. Thanks
