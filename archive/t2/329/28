Subject: Harvesting a complete a/c system, a few questions.

Hello List,

For all of those who replyed to my last question,
thanks for the help! I am still trying to locate a
good place to have hoses redone locally. Monday, I am
going to attempt to remove the overhead a/c unit from
the doner bus. For those that have done this, is it
difficult? Is there anything I should keep in mind? Is
there any special tools that I will need? Can I remove
the old York compressor from the engine with out
pulling the engine? I noticed that the belt seems to
be located in front (front means front) of the of the
fan shroud. Is this a special shroud? Will I have to
modify my shroud? I have a pick-up and have plenty of
space to haul everything and I will bring plenty of
boxes, a wratchet set, some wrenches , screw drivers,
wire snips, A pry bar, hammer, a utility knife, A can
of PB Blaster, and any other tool that I might run
across as I am packing up the tools. Is there any
unobvious parts that I need to make sure and grab
while I am there? Thanks in advance for the tips! Have
a great day!

David Kelly
