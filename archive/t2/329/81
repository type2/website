Subject: Check those poptop latches!!!

Got a call from an acquaintance telling me he would not be able to visit 
this past weekend. Seems his poptop blew open and tore off on the highway 
between Asheville and Knoxville.

He had to turn around and go back to get it. He got it reattached but it is 
not it's old self.

So just a reminder to double check those latches!!!
