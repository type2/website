I too had a set of 34mm ICT Webers in my bug.  Jetted and synched correctly, 
they worked exquisitely.  Started immediately when cold(Sacramento), even in 
winter, and idled smoothly and precisely.  Still have 'em, and I intend to 
use them in my '70 as soon as one of you fine folks sells me the single-port 
aluminum manifolds to do it!  ;^)
