Subject: Buses on very bad roads: fine or foolhardy?

I come to the Bus world as a longtime Subaru owner.  My '82
front-wheel-drive and '87 4x4 Subie wagons have taken me to all kinds of
ridiculous places -- trailheads in the Cascades, particularly -- at the
ends of unmaintained forest roads, the kind that are severly washed out,
potholed enough to kill a Honda in a mile, ponded a foot deep, under two
inches of flowing water like a meadow trail in springtime, you name it.
Places where the only other vehicles on the road are the sort that
substitute for Viagra.
 
The Bus obviously has more clearance.  It also seems to have better
traction than the front-wheel-drive Subaru.  It also appears to care
less about bumps than the Subarus do -- which I find impressive, since
your average SUV will bounce around when it hits something that a Subaru
will just ignore.
 
Can a carefully driven Bus negotiate such terrain, or am I foolish to
even have such thoughts?  Are there frame/suspension parts that, given
proper maintenance and absent rust, still can't handle a rough road?
How far do you have to tip a Bus before it decides to roll over?  How
easy is it to get a Bus hopelessly stuck?
 
Thanks for any and all advice.  Neither I nor my heirs shall hold any
listmember responsible for any damages I may incur on account of your
replies.
