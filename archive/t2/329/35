Subject: Re-Sizing Screw Heads

>Unfortunately they make screws with the same pitch diameter but the head
size is too large.  I've seen people buy standard slotted in stead of
Phillips ad turn the head diameter down in a lathe.  If you can find someone
that sells the right screws, I have lots of people that want them; including
my '71<

You don't need a lathe to do this one. Just chuck the screw in a drill
press, or even a hand drill, and use a file to turn the head down to the
appropriate size. I've done this many times and it works like a charm.
