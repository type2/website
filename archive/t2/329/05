Subject: head cleaning

I finaly got some good heads for my bus. They are pretty dirty but all the
valves move and after a good inspection there seems to be no cracks. They
are gonna need to have a good cleaning . So my ? is whats the best method of
cleaning them? Is it ok  to put them thru a parts washer ? This is my first
time cleaning and using used heads but for the price (free+ACEAIQ-) I cant
complain. Thanks in advance for your help. CHAD
