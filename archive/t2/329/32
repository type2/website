Subject: Tranny questions?

Hi Everyone,
Well trying to get my new vanagon on the road again and it needs a tranny.  
I'm finding the price varys from like $500-$1100 what do you get for the 
extra $600.  I don't know anything about trannys and want to buy a decent 
tranny thinking of just buying one from Busdepot but wondered what people 
were haveing good luck with.  Is there anybody good on the east coast or do I 
have to mail order.  I want to drop it myself to do some cleaning and fuel 
line replacement ect.  Any input would be great.  This is for my 81 Vanagon. 
Oh yea anyone know how tall of a garage do you need to jack a van up high 
enough to do this work?  Thinking of renting one of those self storage areas 
to do the work that way I can leave the van apart as long as I need to. 
Thanks
Kevin
