Provided that the aftermarket CDI is designed for those plugs.  Not all
are.  The simple "point replacement" devices like the pertronix are
designed to work with the conventional coil and plugs.  If the CDI
system doesn't specify platinum plugs, then it is probably designed for
conventional plugs.  You can use platinums, and it will probably run, but
you gain nothing and might lose a bit due to misfire.
