Wrong.  Metallic silver is the correct colour.  Black was
optionally available for fire engines and such.

That wouldn't be original either.  Turn signals above headlights
go with the small VW emblem, and turn signals below headlights
with the big one.

Depends.  Bus L models had chrome emblems, Transporter models had 
white ones.  Not sure about non-L Buses.  Probably the chrome
emblem was optionally available for the lesser models too; at 
least, it's commonly retrofitted to them.

Airhowlingly yours,
