Hey Richard,
Do you notice a difference when the shocks are set tighter in the back?  
I've got 'em set at 1.5 all around, but was thinking of dropping the 
fronts to 1 and leaving the backs at 1.5 because of the extra weight 
back there.

The bus handles great now, but you definately feel the road.
