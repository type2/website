Subject: Re: [T2] UPDATE - can't remove my old heater cables!

Take a stiff stranded cable and spin it backwards with your drill. Will sort of unwind and fray but will do a great job of cleaning the tube. Add LOTS of spray oil to the tube at the front and let it set. 

I had this problem with the fuel line and heater cables of my Beetle.
