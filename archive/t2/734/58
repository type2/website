The other really bad thing about having a pilot bearing fail is that it
sometimes gets stuck to the input shaft.  This makes the clutch feel as if
it isn't working at all.  It also makes the engine get stuck to the
transmission!  If you're lucky you can get it out without breaking the
input shaft stud.  If you break the stud, the input shaft comes out with
the engine and you get to disassemble the transmission too.  :)
