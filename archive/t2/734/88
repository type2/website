I have the Bentley (both Green and Orange)
  the Clymer and Chilton, and probably a few others lying around here. the
only ones I use are the two Bentleys and the few VW specialty manuals I've
picked up over the years.  the other two were a waste of my money, shoulda
bought another 13mm wrench (must have 50 of em and can never find one when
i need it)
