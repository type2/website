<My wife found me   She came to my shop one day driving a lite green Karmann Ghia>

Mine was my sister's roomate. Holly and I both drove Honda Accords, me an '87, her an '86. I thought, hmmm, same shop manual required for both cars. MUST be a sign... 

I had the same '65 Beetle as now and I asked her if I could trade my '87 Accord (miss that car, saw it two weeks ago and it has 275K on the original drivetrain unrebuilt!) for this '78 VW Westy (same one I have now) and we went everywhere in it. She is anxious to ride in it again...
