A tiny pinch of baking soda added to the superglue
droplet would not only "kick" it, and make it cure
instantly, it would also add an aggregate to the
liquid glue.
Thick CA glue would also not wick down along the
shaft where you might not want glue.  Check your
local R/C hobby store for the thicker glue.


I suggest that if you have the bread, take the used
speedo to a VDO repair shop and have them perform a
maintenance on it.  They would set the numbers to the
mileage on your vehicle while they have it opened up.
