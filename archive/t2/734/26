Subject: Re: [T2] EFI compatibility

If you're going to convert to EFI, you might as well convert to 
something modern and something you can actually tune.  Go with the 
megasquirt.. ten gazillion times better than the L-jet and there's a 
huge support group and FAQ that knows how to tune it.  There's no 
tunability with the L-jet besides changing the spring tension and it's 
old and will eventually break and expensive to fix.

faq/manual:

enjoy,
