Subject: Re: [T2] Who actually still uses the Muir?

The Muir book is a rare bird, as rich in humor, art and entertainment as it
is in knowledge.  The only other book I know like this is the 'Joy of
Homebrewing' by Charlie Papazzian.  I carry the Muir book and have used it
roadside quite a bit, because, well, its about my level.  I would even go so
far as to say that book is a flippin' masterpiece.  You would never find the
equivalent for any other car make. I love reading it late at night while
camped in the bus, uh I mean vanagon.
