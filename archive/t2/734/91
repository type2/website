'73 was the first year for the high turn indicators, and no step bumper.

Bonus round: '73 was also the first year for the above engine access
hatch, and the last year for the fuel door (which was smartly moved
back a bit so you could refuel with the slider open).

After '74 they all look like late bays to me!  I know the engine
compartment hatch hinge changed in '76, but other than that I can't
really tell a '74-'79 bus apart.
