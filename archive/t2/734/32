I was thinking the same thing!!!

I used to make that glue paste when I was building model airplanes.
It's the only way to make the glue hold the wood together. Now, of
course, you can buy that stuff premade, but when I was a kid doing
that your only choice was cyanocrylate (sp?) glue with baking soda or
wood glue. And wood glue was too heavy.

Interesting how hobbies cross over. =)
