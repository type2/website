Well, the good news is I just pulled a pair from a donor bus that is
going to the boneyard next week. The bad news is my camera doesn't do
as well as Richard's on small objects!

Anyway, here it is! The keeper is the small white plastic piece on the
left. It goes inside the tube and must be removed to let the cable
ends pass through the tube. It could also be considered a bushing for
the cable. It is split and comes off the cable by spreading the split.
