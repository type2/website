I need to buy a whole bunch of sound deadener material but this stuff is SO
DANG EXPENSIVE!! even all the generic products on ebay.

Which McMaster-Carr product is the recommended one??
something on this page?

Anyone have another recommended source/experience with (other than described
in
 http://www.shagadelic.org/VW/info/gmbulley-soundproof/intrir1.html) ?
seems kind of extreme. . . don't doubt that it works though!
