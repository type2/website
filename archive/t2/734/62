Subject: Is this stock ?

On my way to work I stopped next to a white bus which was in very nice
shape. I had never seen the square rear air scoops coupled with the
front of a 68-71 bus (blinkers below lights). Was it a 72 ?

I'm no expert at engine sounds but it sounded like a type4. However I
passed it quite easily on the uphill so it might be a 1700. Yes I
could not refrain from "racing" my companion.

If the owner is on the list, we shall have a drink.

Next I saw a beautiful Porsche 356 in the parking lot. What a good
start in the day !!
