Hi Rich,

Before anything, make sure nothing is blocking the inside handle towards 
the front. Once I had that problem so I decided to apply some brute force 
without knowing a ladder was blocking my handle and I broke it, aghhhh....

In any case, remove the panel and you will see two rods between the front 
mechanism and the rear latch. Pull the lower one towards the front of the 
vehicle and it should release the rear latch. Hopefully the front latch 
will then release too.

Good luck,
