Subject: Re: [T2] 71 bus slider stuck closed

This is most likely the result of a snapped cable or whatever it is your
year bus has in there...

Because the thingie's snapped, it doesn't actuate the REAR latch.  You
may have to poke around back there...  Can't remember 'zackly what I did
to release it.  Um, put force in the direction that the thingie would
have?  I think...
