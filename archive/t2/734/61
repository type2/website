I seem to recall someone on The Samba saying that bus was sold and
became a rust bucket. Some of those solutions work as long as they
stay dry, but once any moisture gets in there it gets trapped and
starts rusting...

I like the very loose insulation VW installed. Open enough to allow
moisture to evaporate. Just make sure any noise deadening solution
provides for drainage and evaporation.
