Subject: Who actually still uses the Muir?

Just curious. When I got my bus, I bought both the Muir and the
Bentley. I was familiar with both from my friends all having bugs and
busses in high school, so it was automatic for me.

Yet after reading the Muir a few times cover to cover (pretty
entertaining), I set it aside and have never opened it since. In fact,
I left it on the patio in California and it got rained on for 2 weeks.
I ended up tossing the swollen pulpy mess.

So does anybody else actually use theirs?
