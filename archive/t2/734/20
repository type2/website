Subject: Koni's adjust in 10 mins or your money back!

These Konis rule! (I was kidding about the money back part! :-)

I've been riding on the softest setting for a long time now. It's great for
city but on the highway there is a little too much wind buffeting so I've
stiffened them on the rears by 50%.

How long did this take to do? Took me less than 5 minutes, to undo the
bottom shock mounting bolt on the rear, push up the shock, engage the gear,
twist it 360 degrees, pull it back down, torque back up the bolt and repeat
on the other side. Truly a roadside adjustment!

Amazing. Road report to follow in a few weeks as I slowly dial in my
preferred settings.
