Subject: Re: [T2] Who actually still uses the Muir?

I used mine ALOT at first, then used Bentley after that. I consider it a must-own for a newbie DIY person. Second check everything with the Bentley of course. First I out grew Muir's book and then I outgrew the Bentley procedures. I have not yet outgrown the Bentley diagrams and prob never with since I perpetually suffer from CRS... <griN!>
