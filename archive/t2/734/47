USE not really, like you said it was really entertaining and yes I did
learn from it.

Good book for new Van user perhaps. Good for tip and tricks about how to
maintain your van, after all, it's called.. How to keep alive......

Cheers

Just curious. When I got my bus, I bought both the Muir and the Bentley.
I was familiar with both from my friends all having bugs and busses in
high school, so it was automatic for me.

Yet after reading the Muir a few times cover to cover (pretty
entertaining), I set it aside and have never opened it since. In fact, I
left it on the patio in California and it got rained on for 2 weeks. I
ended up tossing the swollen pulpy mess.

So does anybody else actually use theirs?
