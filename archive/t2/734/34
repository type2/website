Welcome Jason!

Personally, if you KNOW you have a leak then synthetic may be a waste
of money. If you're not living in below freezing temps, straight 30 wt
oil will be fine. I ran that in California. Castrol HD 30, in fact.

The only real benefit you will see from synthetic is better temp
resistance. And even that is open to debate. So unless your engine is
absolutely tight, don't bother.

Yes, do your valves each oil change. Doesn't cost anything but $2 for
new gaskets and 30 minutes of your time. Gets you some bonus bus karma
too. (You catch problems sooner.)

Exhaust: There are tons of aftermarket systems out there. But unless
it puts the exhaust into the side slipstream, you WILL suck exhaust
into the engine compartment and fresh air intakes. Ask me how I know.
I have two tipped exhaust and have to shut off the heat otherwise I
get a free carbon monoxide buzz. Those exhausts only work well with
beetles because the overcar stream doesn't kick back like it does on a
bus with its big flat butt. Now if you never need heat that's an
entirely different story...
