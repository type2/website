Subject: Missing tin?

Today I installed a new foam engine seal in my 76 Bus.All went fine except
for around the left rear corner.It seams to me there is a missing piece of
tin or something.
http://community.webshots.com/user/spikerrr   folder named bus tin

Theres just no way the seal can stretch to fill the gap that is there.Can
anyone tell me what Im missing here?
