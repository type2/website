Gday,

My name is Jason and i am from Sydney, Australia and am a newby to this list
and to looking after my bus myself. Have had a 1975 8 seater Bus for 6 years
(was off the road 3 of those years) which i have customised a little ...
mostly the interior.

anyway i am trying to improve my bus mechanics literacy (slow process) so i
can be more DIY.

First question i have is what is the best oil for my bus? as she is about
due for a change.....have read lightweight (10-30) is good for cold starts
but also a more heavy duty oil can be useful too......anyone recommend some
brands etc

John Muir (How to keep VW alive forever - good book i have found anyway) ...
...recommends best monograde heavy duty Military Standard i can find

Should i look at doing the valves at the same time as its been a while... do
you have to change the oil when doing valves?

Finally....for now.....i want to upgrade my exhaust system which can make
the cabin a bit smelly and is pretty rusted down and crappy etc.........are
there any benefits/disadvantages to a performance exhaust? what about
extractors? or should i just get a nice new or reco'd standard?
would like to increase the power a little if possible but really like the
sound of a loud and happy VW engine so anything that compliments that would
be good

any links for info that people find useful to the above objectives and
general bus knowledge would be cool too.......

cheers for putting up with the long winded and amateurish email
