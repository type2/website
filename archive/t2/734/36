first edition was published, Beetles were around for the asking
(my first was a '57 and $35), and the new owner was assumed
to know nuttin' about cars, much less VW's...That it's been up-
dated is a credit to the original's philosophy almost as much as
the information...
It's also spawned an industry...The how-to-for-dummies manuals
now cover a broad spectrum of topics (Witgenstein to Quantum
Mechanics... ;-)
I dunno, if I had no knowledge or experience with VW at all, the
Muir would probably be a better choice for a first manual...
