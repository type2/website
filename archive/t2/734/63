Subject: Re: [T2] sound deadeners?

Call me crazy, but on a vehicle as old as our Westy (1969) I actually 
LIKE being able to hear the rattles and shakes and squeaks and motor 
noises.

I feel more connected to the Bus this way.

When I previously restored my 73 Eldorado Convertible, it was the same 
way. I almost NEVER drove with the top and windows up (granted, I lived 
in sunny Laguna Beach) and liked being able to "hear" everything.

And now, since we're in Charleston (SC) having insulation just isn't 
that high of a priority for us.

Just my 2.781 centavos. Your mileage may vary.
