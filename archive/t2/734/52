Subject: RE: [T2] steering rebuild

In regards to what you call the swing lever shaft, remember
that there is more here than meets the eye.  If the pin that
the lever connects to is rusty or is binding too tight,.. your
steering will force you to over correct as you drive, giving
you a weaving wandering sensation.  If when you have the front
end up on jacks/lift/whatever, grab the linkage that connects
to the lever and move it from front to back of bus to see how
much play is at the point where the lever is mounted.  I few
millimeters of play on the center pin(what the lever is
mounted on) here can equate to several inches of play in your
steering wheel.  The pin that the center relay lever is
connected to sits in a large bushing that seats into the beam.
This bushing is often overlooked when addressing steering
issues.  If you are looking for that forgotten item to
check,.. then check that bushing.  I've seen it fix a few
drunken buses (both mine).

    Ball joint Torsion arms (fm Bus Boys)
    Swing lever shaft, etc
    Damper
    Tie rod ends (rods look OK)

like tie rod ends, but not sure?)
    Shocks

Alignment
Steering coupler seems OK
Will consider steering box after above is done.
Tires when all above A-OK.
