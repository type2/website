Hi Mike,
          I remember facing a similar problem, when I was working on a rusted 
mid-60s Type 2 sometime in the 80s.  The heater controls were something like 
piano wire; they had rusted and disintegrated inside the conduits that take 
them back to the engine area.  In fact, the piano wire part rusted through 
someplace about the middle -- I say that because we were able to pull out the 
remainder from front and rear.  My buddy Gregg progressively forced through 
larger diameters of piano wire until it seemed the conduit was fairly clear; 
then downsized a bit and quit while we were ahead.  We made liberal use of 
compressed air and Kano Kroil (this was before PB Blaster was on the market).  
Over-all this was one time-burning PITA.  My sympathies to you.
