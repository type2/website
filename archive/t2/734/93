I would rate them (in order of usefullness):

Bentley
Clymer
Muir
Haynes and Cliton

But it really depends on the year of your bus. If you can only afford one book get Bentley. Muir is almost always available at the local library.

Clymer is well laid out and almost as good but they cover early buses only. Haynes and Cliton have lots of info but the images and instructions are crapola. If your bus is FI then there is no substitute for Bentley but even after you buy it you'll benefit from having the Pro Training Manual.

The workshop manuals (yellow) contain many diagrams not in Bentley especially wrt transmissions.

There are many other little books out there also but none of them are that important.
