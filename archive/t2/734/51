i've got about 4 of them scattered around the house. i find them in the
yards, and redistribute them occasionally. i'm one of the people that likes
muir alot, in spite of the few things written in the guide i disagree with.
if i had a government, i'd put him on a postage stamp. i don't always feel
like reading a technical manual when i want to brush up on vw stuff. once in
a while i look up the frontispiece, or other drawings. i'm driving thru
santa fe next week in my 69 sunroof and i hope to pick up some muir vibes,
because after 25 years, i'm still a compleat idiot. - steve
