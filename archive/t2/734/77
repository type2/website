Subject: Re: [T2] Gland nut pilot bearing

2 cc's of graphite grease if I recall correctly from an old workshop 
manual - don't know if you can still buy graphite grease - mine's about 40 
years old...

... should the gland nut pilot bearing be greased or
does it get its oil from the engine?

Grease it.  Use nice thick stay-put grease, like Bosch distributor point 
grease.
