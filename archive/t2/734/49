Subject: RE: [T2] Who actually still uses the Muir?

     I do!  I like the illustrations.  I think most people eventually 
outgrow it, but it's still useful to have around.  It's great for showing 
newbie friends how things work.  If I'm unsure of something, I just start 
reading the descriptions in my various books until I'm not unsure anymore.  
If I'm having a real hard time even getting the basics, I always start with 
Muir, because his descriptions are simple.  Also, I find he has some methods 
that work better on the side of the road, even though they may not be the 
'right' way if you have a garage and the right tools.  All in all, I can't 
think of any reason to purposely go without another resource.  I consider 
every book I have as another tool in the toolbox.
