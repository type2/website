Subject: UPDATE - can't remove my old heater cables!

I went and bought a can of PB Blaster and sprayed that in there and let 
it sit for quite a while... cables still wouldn't move.  I tried putting 
the drill to the old cable and it wouldn't budge.

So, finally I went under the car towards the back and cut a 5" section 
from each tube, but did it in such a way that I would be able to have 
some extra left over on the engine side.  I was then able to coax the 
two pieces of cable from the front of the car (because it was no longer 
attached to the seized portion in the back) and I was able to pull out 
the passenger side portion of the back cable.  I still haven't been able 
to get the driver's side out.  I'll let the PB work on that side a 
little longer.

The problem now is that there is still junk in the long tubes going up 
to the front - I think it's the rubber from the sheath.  I went and 
bought a 4' long 1/8" steel rod and I put that in my drill and I tried 
rooting the crap out that way but it didn't want to budge.  I am going 
to try sharpening the end and take a go at it again.

My goal when I get all of this out is to use plastic tubing to "seal up" 
the cut out section so the new cables can still be guided through the 
metal sleeves... I just hope I can get them cleared out.. what a PITA!!!
