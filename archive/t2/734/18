From Paul Manning:

 Gotta love this list. Thanks Mark, Karl and Greg for their nearly
identical responses of "no" in very short time. You're either all very
bright, or you're reading off each others papers :)

Hmmmm...... this reminds me of a short story......

Bubba applied for an engineering position with Corps of Engineers at a Lake
Charles, Louisiana oil refinery.

A Yankee applied for the same job and both applicants having the same
qualifications were asked to take a test by the manager.

Upon completion of the test, both men only missed one of the questions.
The manager went to Bubba and said: "Thank you for your interest, but
we've decided to give the Yankee the job."

Bubba asked: "And why are you giving him the job?  We both got nine
questions correct. This being Louisiana, and me being a Southern boy I should get the
job!"

The manager said: "We have made our decision not on the correct answers,
but rather on the one question that you both missed."

Bubba then asked: "And just how would one incorrect answer be better than
the other?"

The manager replied: "Bubba, its like this. On question # 4 the Yankee put
down: "I don't know."  You put down: "Neither do I."
