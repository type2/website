Subject: Re: [T2] Time-Serts, what size is needed for a 1700 exhaust

I've always used 11.7 (8x1.25) Time-Serts on 1700 heads as well as
1600 Aircooled and my current 2.1 Wasserboxer heads for the past 7
years.  Hmmmm....Just looked at my kit and I've only a few inserts
left - better get more and always be prepared.

You should be able to get the studs from Bus Boys.  I put them in
their product line-up back in the mid 90s.
