Subject: Re: [T2] What a Wife !!

	I too would like to sing the praises of my VW loving wife, Kathy.
Not only is a baywindow bus her vehicle of choice, but she's been a great
help in doing maintenance with me.  She's been right there beside me to pull
engines, change transaxles, replace windows, and do brake work.  She's
worked with me to remove, clean, repair, and replace all kinds of parts.
And to top all of that, it's been more than once that she's found VW parts
warming in the kitchen oven or chilling in the freezer.
	So to Kathy, and all the other wives that are, in one way or
another, part of our VW addiction......
