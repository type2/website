Subject: RE: [T2] Who actually still uses the Muir?

Bentley is great for the more bus specific procedures and things Muir didn't 
deal with very much. But it lacks alot of the troubleshooting info to figure 
out what exactly the problem is.

For doing type 1 engine tune up stuff and repairs I find myself using Muir 
more than Bentley or even the red rebuild book.
