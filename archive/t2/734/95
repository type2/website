I think that must be an urban legend.

BTW

Synthetics are on sale at Kragen right now. Mobil 1 is $3.99 a bottle and other oils at 10% off per case. Stock up.

Mobil has phased out the red cap 15w50 (SuperSyn which replaced the old Tri-synthetic) and replaced it with an "extended performance" formula in a curvy bottle with a gold cap. The good new is that this oil is far more available that the previous version. If you can wade through the messages at "Bob Is the Oil Guy"'s Forum <http://theoildrop.server101.com/cgi/ultimatebb.cgi> you can read up on the formula change. IIRC more ZDDP was added.
