Hey Dave,

No bubble bursting worries. We looked at a bunch of different busses,
and many of them were later models with A/C.

Since we have a hard top, the A/C retrofit might not be a bad option.

We don't have any real hills in SC, and if we do ever take it upstate,
or into the NC mountains, we just wouldn't use the A/C.

Options are always a good thing to have, though!

So who makes this A/C unit?

Anton
