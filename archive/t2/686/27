Bus Depot does sell the engines for the air cooled Vanagon. Been working 
slowly toward putting one in my 80 Vanagon. I would recommend you take your 
time changing out the engine for a good quality rebuild. Don't let yourself 
set a deadline to get it done and take care of EVERY detail along the way. 
This should make for a happy bus and driver.
