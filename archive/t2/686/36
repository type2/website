ACC-C10-7115 - aka unisyn is a piece of junk (at least the chinese copies
are junk).

ACC-C10-7125 - aka Synchrometer is the way to go. However, the type of carb
you have will determine what style you need. CIP has the SK style pictured
and you have to determine if it will seal with the throat design of your
carb (on it's own or via rubber adapters), or if you need the BK style.

What carbs do you have?
