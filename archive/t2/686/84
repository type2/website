Dave,

Thanks for your reply!  

1) I have a '79 Bus. 
2) Yes, the pulley is behind the fan (at least I think so, 
   as I've not yet taken the fan off).
3) I think I have a VW A/C unit - it looks just link the one
   pictured on Rob's(?) site http://www.baywindowbus.com/literature2.htm
4) Yes, it looks like an old York compressor.

Regards,

Wayne
