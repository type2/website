Subject: Rebuild Fun

I need to make up about .076 inches. I figure that what I really need is a 3
mm
washer/spacer/.

there's no listing for thickness. Maybe they're 2 mm, maybe 3 mm.
I ordered three of them, so that I'm covered in the
very worst case. If they are 2 mm, I'm in a bit of trouble. Maybe I'll
have to grind a hundredth of an inch or so off my old one and stack it
with the 2 mm. Insisting on meeting specs is a PITA!


"If you have a type 1-3, you need two shims. If you have a type 4 there is
only one." Wilson 119:6

I think the main rule for type 4s is you need to have one shim. I had to use
two in my most recent
rebuild to meet the spec and it worked without any grinding.
