hello guys    this and the way the exhust was designed are two of the biggest 
proplems with the type4 motor . I have seen way more seats come out of these 
motor and vanagon than ever on type 1 motors. early type 1 s had problems 
dropping the # 3 valve.  I have been telling everybody with type 4 and waterboxxer 
motors to run high test gas. since then ,going on about 6 years now I have 
seen a whole lot less seats come out. Not real good for work but buses arent my 
main work load.  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
