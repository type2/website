You may be right, but if you are, then Wilson is wrong:

"You want a minimum of 0.020 in. (0.51mm)
with up to 0.050 in. (1.27mm) acceptable.
What you don't want is less than 0.020 in.

"Adjust the clearance by changing shims.
You can install any number of shims of differ-
ent thicknesses to get the desired clearance as
long as you have at least two shims in Type
13 engines and one in Type 4s. Shims are
available at the dealer and VW parts houses."
