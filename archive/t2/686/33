I posted this info the other day:

This article has some guidelines on acceptable readings for your CHT:

This looks like you are within their suggestions since you are in the
400-425 range suggested for a bus.

For a second opinion, Fisher pp 89-90 has the following information
published by Chevrolet regarding Corvair head temps:

200-300 Idle
350-475 Cruise 30-60 mph
460-575 3-5K RPM full throttle

The Corvair head temp warning light comes on at 575 degrees.
