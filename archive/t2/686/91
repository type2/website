Hi Mike,

With this critical bit of information in hand, I will concede that 
Ratwell and Thomas and others gave you the better advice.

No matter how things turn out, at least you won't be paying $1900 for a 
"valve job"! Beneath all the arguing and debating, we were all agreed 
that this quote for work was preposterous.

Good luck, and keep us informed.

Mark
