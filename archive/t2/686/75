Anton,

I didn't reply to your original question as I knew it was a new bus to you 
and I didn't want to burst your bubble by pointing out that you should 
have bought a bus with a later model engine in it.

On the other hand, I just put a *new* as in NEW, still in the factory box, 
A/C in my 78 bus last summer.

The compressor and mount was changed out for a rotary compressor after 
some difficulties, but the A/C blows 44 degree air down my neck when I 
want it to.

There are more of these units available(I think), but they are overhead 
units, not underdash, and mount in the ceiling just behind the driver.  
Not knowing what your layout is, I can't tell if it would work for you or 
not.

The most important part was that these complete units were built for
68-71 buses(and upright engines).  The price, near Oklahoma City was about 
$400....shipping would be mucho extra of course.

I used to work for VPC, where we made these in the early 70's.

Cheers, dave
