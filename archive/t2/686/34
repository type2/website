Type 2 is a generic term for VW buses in general. VW buses from 1972
to 1979 are referred to as having type 4 motors to distinguish them
from earlier buses which had the beetle type engine. Vanagon air
cooled 1980 to 1983 is nearly identical to the earlier bus type 4
motor. Someone on the vanagon list could enumerate the differences
better.
