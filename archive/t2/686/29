Subject: Dual carb synchro tools

Hi all...being new to the "dual carb crowd" I would like opinions on the 
"best" type of carb synchronization tool.  I've found 2 types on CIP1 at 
....  http://www2.cip1.com/SearchResults.asp?Cat=1809   and would like 
to know if anyone has a preference for either type.
