Wanna take a poll and see how many old Chaz'tonians would've preferred it  
that way?  (Yes, I know they'd probably prefer a lot of other  
reprehensible things, a la Trent Lott.)  But like I say, A/C has been a  
disaster for Florida.  Stucco developments with groaning A/C units by the  
thousands supplanting desperately needed water recharge areas, sending  
wildlife out on the highways to be run over by breadloaf buses -- while  
people stay inside their dry/cool caves, watch TV, and wonder what all  
those tree-huggers are griping about.  I know I'm a dreamer, but if more  
people had to do a little more adapting to the climate, we'd have fewer  
Atlantas, Miamis, Jacksonvilles.  This ain't necessarily a Bad Thing, IMO.

Alas, I don't think getting rid of A/C would take care of it.  Them  
fellers in India and Africa seem to have some pretty big burgs without  
benefit of ubiquitous A/C.  Dang.  How do they manage?

Taking this back to buses, I empathize with folks who want to be cool &  
dry in their ride, and it's not complete heresy to add it to a bus,  
especially if you can get period components (& replace the York boat  
anchor).  I'm toying with the idea myself for the same reasons I'm  
thinking about buying satin sheets.  But all this booshwa about it ruining  
your clothes, making you stinky, etc. -- sheeeeesh.  Some great tips for  
you hot-climate newbies here:
