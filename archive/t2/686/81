Thank you, thank you everyone for all of your advice!! I'm bowled over
by the responses, and by the level of expertise that is obvious from
their content.

My wife and I spent a long time discussing our options, as presented
to us by this list, last night. We can see that replacing the engine
completely is the best idea - it appears that we won't have a reliable
vehicle until we do so. However, at this point, we just can't afford
it.

Please know that I mean no disrespect to those who said to replace it
- I'm not discounting your opinion. If a $1900 fix was the only
option, I would take it, only to avoid losing all of my initial
investment in this bus. However, since I can implement a less
expensive fix, that will at least get us rolling and enjoying the bus
for a short length of time, I will do that and replace the one head.
Once I know more about buses, and can tell whether this particular
vehicle is worth investing more deeply in, I can make the decision on
whether to purchase a whole new engine. Right now, I don't know if the
whole thing is about to fall apart from rust, or if the suspension is
about to collapse! (lots of knocking on wood going on right now!)

Anyway, I look forward to learning more and more, and hopefully being
able to contribute some of my own education to this list. Until that
point, I thank you all for great advice on this issue, and more in the
future I'm sure!! In fact, I'll soon need help putting together a
shopping list for this engine work :)

Best regards,
Mike.
