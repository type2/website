Subject: Re: Is a oil cooler a good idea ?

Is there anything wrong with the factory installed unit say from a 79 Bus? 
Is it too hard to ge working again? Does it provide enough cooling? I have a 
79 sunroof in storage with air and I am thinking of putting that air system 
on the 79 that I drive. Would that be a hard swap?  Cree 79 Bay, BlueBlob
