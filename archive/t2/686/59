Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Line Routing and type

Richard has extensive fuel system line documentation on his website
(http://www.ratwell.com/technical/FuelHoses.html). I picked up hose from
Bus Boys (http://www.bus-boys.com/bb13374.htm#11) and am leaving the
metal lines intact. I've added a package of brake line grommets to my
most recent Bus Depot order
(https://secured.webappcabaret.com/busdepot/details.jsp?partnumber=21161175110).
Ron also sells these onsey twosey.

Unless I had a compelling reason to replace a metal line, I don't think
I would.
