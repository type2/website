Subject: Plastigaging the rod bearing clearance on a 2.0L

Well, my idea about attaching the crankshaft to my engine stand didn't 
work out. So now I'm wondering if anyone has had success plastigaging 
the rod bearing clearances on a 2.0L. One that doesn't involve welding 
old flywheels to old wheel hubs, etc. etc.?
