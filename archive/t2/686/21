Not to mention the fact that they call it a "seal." Bad enough that it 
is called a "washer" by VW, a "shim" in Wilson, and a "spacer" by the 
people who only have parts for uprights in stock. Oy! It's definitely 
not a seal. Walrus, maybe, but not a seal.

And folks on this list think that shop for tires is complicated ...
