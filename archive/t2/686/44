Subject: Bleeding brakes... problem

Just replaced the leaky master cyl, shoes, rear
seals, and freshly turned drums on my 70 bus. 
Brakes are still spongy.  I searched the archives
and see that I have more work to do adjusting the
brakes.  Posts by Dolan and Tommy of Volkswagen
Restoration are most helpful.  I'll work on
readjusting the brakes again tomorrow.

However... I noticed whilst bleeding the brakes
that my right rear has very little pressure.  The
fluid sort of leaks out when the bleeder is
opened.  Ideas as to the cause?
