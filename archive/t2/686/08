Same reason I have already given. Suppose Mike (now a hypothetical) 
replaces or gets work done on this head, because it's only a couple of 
hundred dollars. And in a few months he needs a ring job. Another 
couple of hundred dollars. And then work on the other head. Another 
couple of hundred dollars. And then a leak in the oil cooler. Another 
hundred and fifty dollars. And then the engine throws a rod. Now he's 
got about eight hundred dollars into this engine, and it has been a 
poor investment all around.

The rods in this engine are likely to be mismatched, the bearings were 
only just in spec at 0 miles. It's a money pit at best.
