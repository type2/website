This really is an "it depends." If you are doing a two-hour commute 
each way five days a week, and spending the last half hour of that in 
100 degree heat moving with traffic at three miles an hour, you're 
doing something that our parents sure didn't have to do, or their 
parents either. And wing windows don't help a darn.

So if you can shower twice a day, great. Do without air conditioning. 
But if you work someplace without showers, and have long commutes in 
high heat, and there's a risk that you might smear 400-year old 
manuscripts with sweaty palms, then doing without air conditioning 
isn't shunning a luxury. It's just foolish.
