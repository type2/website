Subject: T4 engine for sale in Dallas/Ft. Worth area

Folks,

I am posting this here for a guy on the vintagvw list.
It hadn't occured to himthat folks on our list would be more interested 
than the folks on the T1 list.

It is *not* mine.

Cheers, dave

Subject: yet again, TYPE 4 for sale in DALLAS FT WORTH area

Since no one seems to be able to return an email or phone call, I am again
posting up this motor for sale.  

Dual webber 44 on a fresh rebuilt 1.7 type 4 motor with everything but an
exhaust.  Alternator, distributor, plug wires, complete motor just needs a
home and an exhaust.  

It is sitting over at Slug Bug in Arlington, but I need to get rid of this
ASAP and ONLY SERIOUS PEOPLE come ask please.  This is a good deal for
anyone looking to get a type 4, take advantage of my not having a job!!

Thanks
Kent
