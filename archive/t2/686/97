Subject: Distributor rebuilder???

Howdy. I was just wondering if there's anyplace that rebuilds the old
vacuum advance distributors. I'm hoping there is, and that it would be
cheaper than the $130 for the new SVDA...if not, then that's what I'll be
doing...It'll most likely be the 113 905 205T, as that seems like the best
one to go with for a 1600 SP running a 30/31...although I do have a few
others, all of which have been sitting gathering dust & crud for
years...but nothing too badly rusted or worn out.
any leads?
thanks,
