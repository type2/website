When I lived in Italy travelling in the summer in an un-cooled Beetle required siesta hours. Took me most of my stay to figure that out. So simple, yet so obvious. Besides my heater flaps in my Beetle constantly leaked hot air into the interior. Took me most of my ownership time to figure that out too... <grin!>
