$1900 is a bit much, try giving Johns VW a call and getting a quote from him
(650-574-4643)
Full disclosure: He is my uncle, but even if he weren't, he's the best VW
mechanic I have met, anal retentive and very thorough. He can give you both a
"what you need to do to keep it running" price, and a "what I would do to your
engine if you had a boat load of cash" solution.

Good luck,
