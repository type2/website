Wilson seems to have a level of insight left out of Bentley in this case, or so it would seem.

The two drive pinions are very different and I haven't measured them to compare length but two 0.60mm shims is almost as thick as one 1.30mm shim. That 0.10mm difference means there is a good chance you'll be in spec whether you add the additional Type 1 shim or not (if it fits).
