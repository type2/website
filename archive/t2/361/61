Is the transmission ground strap "nasty"?

When you turn on the headlights about 8A extra is going through the electrical system. If your strap is badly corroded then the voltage drop across the strap (the last stop on the way back to the battery) from the headlights will not be insignificant anymore. increased voltage drop there increased resistance due to corrosion) means less of a voltage differential across the temperature gauge as you reported.
