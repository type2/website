Subject: Re T2 Upper starter bolt

Hi,
          What I found works best for me is to extend the upper starter
bolt by welding  a 6 inches long 17 millimeter head bolt to the the end
of the upper starter bolt. That way, you can easily put a wrench on both
end of the upper starter bolt .when you install it.
