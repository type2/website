1982 - Air Cleaner assembly and vacuum hose layout - 1.6 litre engine

For those with a Haynes Manual (# 638) the air cleaner assembly layout
diagram is found on page 63.  I have recently purchased a Volkswagen
Transporter, air-cooled (1982) 1.6 litre engine.  The air cleaner housing
(upper part) is (according to Haynes) not the correct part.  My housing has
only 2 inlet / outlet holes which are connected to a temperature regulator,
which I doubt is in working order.  The correct housing should have 2 more
inlet / outlets attached to a temperature switch which the carburettor
intake hose and breather hose feed into.  I am also lacking the delay valve
fed by the throttle damper which connects directly to the carburettor.  The
solution of the previous owner was to leave the throttle damper open and
bock off the inlet into the carburettor completely where the delay valve
once was.

In an ideal world does any know of where I can purchase the correct air
cleaner housing (or do they have a spare one for sale).  For the other
parts, where can I purchase the delay valve (fed by the throttle damper) and
a new temperature regulator and a temperature switch (both located on the
inside of the upper air cleaner housing).

In more realistic terms these parts are now unavailable and I require the
expertise of a Volkswagen owner who would know how to bypass conventional
methods and concoct a home made system.
