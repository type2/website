I'm well aquatinted with this method of starting. :O)

It's just that my drive way is inclined in the wrong direction, and that I
nearly had a heart attack trying to push the bus when we first got it!

I absolutely have to go out this evening, so pushing may be the route to go
until I can figure out and fix the problem.

Maybe that remote starter isn't such a bad idea, Richard...
