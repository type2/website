I think it is also. Some FI  models also had a supressor at the coil:

To see if you get any noise, try both bands without the antenna plugged and you'll hear the noise more distrinctly. You can always put one in between the alternator and the voltage regulator so you don't have to go back  under there again. If you go the radio shack route you'll need one for each power lead (you may have more than one to keep the memory while the key is off).
