What?!  Maybe this was intended for another "Mike", but I simply had keys
made to fit the current ignition/doors/hatch.  The one key that came with
the bus was thin and easily bent.  I tend toward extra keys, hence the
$11.00.

Cool, nice to know that this is easily done.

> I have a wire from my solenoid going back into my engine compartment...

Neat.  Now on the list of nifty upgrades to be considered.

> I also have a toggle switch attached under my dash that takes power from
the fuse box and sends it down the same wire that my electrical ignition
switch uses.  I usually just turn the key one notch and then push my toggle
switch.

Now this is what I was wondering about.  Where did you tap the ignition wire
and the fuse box?

> Also, you can get a new keyed ignition switch w/keys pretty cheap, like
$12 or so...

Really, where?  Cool.

> Also, i tried the Bosch relay and no good.

I wasn't really excited about trying this as it involved a 3 mile round trip
walking to the FLAPS.

> Also, I 'cured' the hot start problem by cleaning the conector from the
ignition switch that connects to the spade of the solenoid...

Ah ha.  Paul also wrote about this and said:

> I just had the same problem with our bus the end of last week.  All I did
was remove the starter and solenoid, clean all terminals and wire connectors
and reinstalled the starter.  Make sure to do the little braided wire that
connects the starter to the solenoid and the terminal on the solenoid that
it connects to.

Thanks!
