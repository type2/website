Subject: Re: [T2] rebuild 2.0l (kinda verbose)

	Dear List:

	OK, OK - I have SO wanted to stay off this thread but I can't
restrain myself any more, mostly 'cause David S. and John C. are having some
thoughts on this one, and I'm really surprised that both of them haven't
called me out on this because...

	About 2 years back I got the proverbial wild hair and wanted to
build up something with a bit more nurtz than my 2055 (71 x 96) Type 4.
It's got a hydro cam (eeek - yer gonna go blind) and those "way too thin"
96mm P&C (eeeeeeeekkkkkkkk - yer gonna go insane), and a pair of 40 DRLAs
(oh, now you've really done it and yer gonna grow hair on yer palms).  It
was in a '73 914 for 55K miles and now in a bus for close to 85 or 90K miles
now, always with flaps and thermostat in place - still runs nicely BTW.

	I did my research and all roads pointed to the illustrious 2270
(78.4 x 96) or 2260 (78 x 96) as a reliable and fairly "easy" to build
performance motor.  The 78 or 78.4 crank is not the biggest you can stuff
into a T4, but if the rod journals are ground to Type 1 specs and the T4
rods are replaced with something lighter (like chro-mo T1 rods), the
clearance work gets a little easier.  Use of a reduced base circle cam also
helps with the amount of grinding on those brand new rods you'll be buying
and then butchering.  I know my hands were sweating (but not hairy) when I
stepped up to the grinder.  The 96mm piston is not the biggest you can stuff
into a T4, but unless you are going to spend grocery bags of money on LN
Engineering's 102mm Nickies, you'll have a hard time keeping the barrel tops
sealed...

	Understand this.  There's that sign on the wall that says "Speed
costs money; how fast do you want to go?"...  Near that sign is another -
"Cheap.  Fast.  Reliable.  You get 2 out of 3..."  Good stuff for the T4
that gets you "Fast" and "Reliable", is NOT going to be cheap.  Stock 94s
honed to 96mm are doable at $100-125, but I ponied up the dough for some of
LN's Biral Babies in 96mm - got 'em on the pre-production sale deal, so it
was a mere snip at $750 for 4 barrels.  JE forged 96mm pistons w/ 22mm pins
set for the 78 crank - only $450 (pins and rings included).  Reduced base
circle Web-Cam 91H + hydro lifters - $320.  Forged chro-mo T1 rods were one
of the less expensive things at only $150 or so.  John C. (Hi, John!) gave
me a great deal on the NEW "casting by AMC/breathed-on by Remmelle" heads -
by the time you have spent the good money on a great lower end, who the heck
wants to trust a set of multi-rebuilt 30 year old heads?  So, yeah for those
who were asking; new heads are out there and with some better valves,
springs and ports they'll pinch your wallet for $600 a copy, but you won't
see them "FastBugz Iz Us".  Less for stock configuration, more if you go up
another step.  They're a work of art - seems a shame to cover 'em up with
all that ugly tin work.  You also better be ready to get a new exhaust
system too, because the Remmelles have the V'gon exhaust ports.  At least I
got one heck of deal on some 45 DRLAs - traded them for a set of 36s to my
future brother-in-law...

	Any areas that money could have been saved?  Sure - Keith Black cast
hyper-yout' 96s are now available in 22mm pin at about $250 - $200 coulda
been saved there.  Stock 94s honed to 96mm - see above vs $750-1000 for
Birals.  Cylinder heads - go see Adrian at Headflow Masters and have a set
of properly rebuilt 42 x 36 T4 heads done for about $200 a copy vs $600 for
new.

	Any regrets?  I sure wish John's Super Squish pistons had been
offered when I started parts shopping - they are only $250 more than JEs
now...  12:1 CR on pump gas - the drewl starts flowing.  Oh, well - next
time.

	Was it insanely difficult?  I don't know - I've done about 10-12 T1s
and 3-4 T4s in my short life.  Measure twice and cut once.  Pay attention to
details.  Listen to your parents.  Pay your taxes on time.  If you keep
picking at it, how do you expect it to heal?  It was more time consuming
than aggravating...

	  Begin subliminal message now (Buy your aircooled parts from John
C.)  End subliminal message.  

	Has it been worth it?  I don't know just yet - I'm still running the
motor in on a test stand; if it's going to self-destruct, I'd rather have it
do it some place other than in a car.  If what all the experts say is true,
then I can expect a near stock life span and with probably double the
horsepower, and half again as much torque as a stock 2.0L in EXACTLY the
areas it can be used - 3 to 5K on the tackymeter...

	I will no doubt be posting something about this exercise, once it
gets installed into something...
