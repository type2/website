Subject: Re: Bilge blower Conversion Questions 

Do I not recall some discussion of a need to keep positive pressure in the heat exchangers (upstream of the flaps) to avoid overheating them?  When 
you route the input hoses to a blower, there is no positive pressure from the engine fan when the blower is off, correct?  IIRC someone said (this was 
sometime back) that the factory setup in <72 had a trickle of, in effect, bypass air movement when the flaps were closed.

To me this was the only real problem with going to an intake-side blower.  OTOH, I guess it can't be much of an issue if >71 models are blower-only 
(ie, no engine fan assist).

It may have been mentioned already, but one advantage to an intake-side blower is you can recirculate passenger compartment air more easily.
