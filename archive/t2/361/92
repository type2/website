It shouldn't be a problem, as another poster said. But which part of the
stud, or possibly the inner threads of an acorn nut, did you strip? (I say
this because if the nut is still on the stud and turning you may think you
stripped the stud, but what you actually stripped was the inside threading
of the nut. This is easy to do by accidentally cross-threading the acorn nut
when you put it on.)

If the acorn nut, simply replace or use another 6mm nut.

If the exposed portion of a stud, then use the old two-nut trick (or since
it is shot anyway, vice grips) to unscrew it from the case and replace it
with a new 6mm x 21mm stud, or an 6x31mm stud if it is the longer one that
also holds the oil pickup inside the case.

If, however, what you stripped was the case threading, then as someone else
said, you will need to re-tap and put in oversize 6mm x 8mm x 23mm stud.
