A really good idea for first timers (and second and third, too) is a spot
where you can lift the entire rear of the bus and look at both set-ups.
It's easy to get confused (you will not 'remember' how it came apart,
once it's apart) and a quick glance at the other side is often better 
than any diagrams or photos from the manuals... ;-)
