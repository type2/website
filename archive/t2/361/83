Subject: crank pulley zeroing out endplay?

I thought I was just getting to the end of rebuilding my
first engine, a 1600 dual port head T1 for my 71 bus. Then,
while torquing the pulley onto the rear of the crankshaft,
disaster ( or potential disaster ) struck. 

With the pulley on, the engine is slightly - but decidedly
- harder to crank by hand. (The engine is now in longblock
form). Also, putting the pulley on seems to reduce endplay
to zero. 

This isn't normal, is it? This is as far as my diagnosis
got: 
1) The hub of the new, aluminum pulley I'm putting on is
slightly longer than the steel one it is replacing - a bit
less than 1/16 of an inch longer. Could this cause the
problem? 

2) the scarier, slightly paranoid thing I've been worried
about is that perhaps I put the oil slinger ring on
backwards? Convex instead of concave? I spent better than
an hour staring at the thing through the hole for the
pulley, and I could not say for sure either way.... I don't
think I put it on backwards, and I'd sure hate to take
apart the whole thing (oil pump! heads!) to find out I was
right.


Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.
