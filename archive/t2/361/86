Thanks, Richard.  Printed them out and the very first thing to do turned up
a problem.

When I turn the key in the ignition to "start", the headlights go out (good
so far), but the idiot lights do not dim.  The sound of the aftermarket fuel
pump seemed to lessen a very, very tiny bit, but it could almost be a
figment of the imagination.

Not that I want to delve into anyone's possibly larcenous past, but is there
a non-destructive method of bypassing the ignition switch that will allow me
to start the bus?  Giacomo is my primary vehicle, and I need him running in
order to get parts.

I'm looking at possibly getting a used ignition switch from a local VW mech.
Is going used a good idea/bad idea?  Whether new or used, is it possible to
re-key the ignition to match the door keys ($11.00 last week for keys, don't
really want to waste it)?

Thanks for the help.  I don't know how I'd get back into buses without this
group of wonderful people.

Hmm... perusing dim memories of owning a car that had a starter button on
the floor.  Key on, push floor button, varoom!  I guess I really am turning
47 this weekend!
