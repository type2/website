No, it's the actual bulb glowing.  The glow fluctuates with the turn
signals.  The gen light circuit is a long way up and back and supplies
voltage sensing to the alternator.  When the headlights are on it seems
that the instrument cluster floats at a bit higher voltage causing the
glow.

Mine has done it for years, and the voltage has always been fine.  When
the generator light was really needed (due to bad brushes) it lit up nice
and brightly.
