Yeah that bus was what - maybe 5 or 6 years old at the time they crashed 
it? No rust, all factory equipment, no body damage, motor was good I 
suspect, etc. What a waste....

And see - we didn't need to go to war to find out the Iraqi military had 
nuclear weapons. They were trying to acquire them back in 1985... <grin>

Hollywood knew... <grin>

Wonder how many bomb casings with pinball machine parts the US military 
will find in Iraq???
