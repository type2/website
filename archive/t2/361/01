Subject: Transmission Woe's

We just put back a engine and transmission back into my 1971 Deluxe Bus.
The engine was sent over to a friend so he could just go over the engine
as it had sat for 2 yrs. The engine is all fine now, but when we put the
engine and tranny back together we didn't check or not knowingly checked
to see if there was a collar or not that pushed in the throw out
bearings. We are hoping that this is the problem and can be corrected by
removing the collar as we hope to let the clutch engage. My question is
there anything else that may be wrong incase the clutch assembly is
correct or is there a proper way to align the tranny or clutch to make
sure it will engage.

Thanks

Fay and Scott,
1971 Deluxe and 1976 Westy
