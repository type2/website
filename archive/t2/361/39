Before assuming the seals are bad, check the oil pressure switch, a more 
likely suspect, and the oil comes off the bottom under the cooler just like 
it would if the seals were the problem. (T-IV motor) There are 2 other 
possibles, a cracked or split cooler or a crack in the block. Actually, the 
seals are the least likely of all these sources.
