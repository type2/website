Subject: Sliding door sticks

Listees,
    I appreciate all the input on the seals, it looks as if I need to just
pull the motor to save myself headaches.
    I have another situation. My sliding door does not pop open when I pull
the handle. I have to knee it in the middle of the door and it pops open
then.
    My question is do I have to make some sort of adjustment or just grease
some parts?
Later,
Jim
