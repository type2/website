Just put the fan BEFORE the heater boxes and it will last damn near 
forever. They have a max temp allowance of 176 degrees F (according to the 
box).

The factory fan is BEFORE the heater boxes. If there is a minor exhaust 
leak worry not because any leaks in the boxes or heater tubes will leak air 
out.

Example: take a drinking straw. Make slice in straw length wise. Put your 
finger over end. You are the fan. Blow. Air leaks out. Now going into room 
with an atmosphere of deadly gasses. Still you're safe. No deadly gasses 
getting into that leaky straw 'cause it's leaking OUT.

Now if you want to put the bilge blower between you (the cabin) and the 
heater boxes (like in the main tube) and have an exhaust leak (or spend 
alot of time idling the engine with the heat on) and your heater boxes are 
like most of the ones I've seen with loose seams and connections you'll 
suck that CO right into the system - especially if you close the flappers a 
bit and persist on running the fan.

Straw example again: cap end of straw with finger either completely or 
halfway. You are the fan, your finger represents the restrictions in the 
heater system (bends, flappers, etc.). Suck on straw. Notice that you die...

Any questions? <grin>
