I disagree. Though there is no DIRECT correlation of these to one another, a
mild cam (low duration) is very unlikely to have a fast ramp, and a long
duration cam is unlikely to have a slow ramp. The reason is anyone that
want's one pretty much wants the other too. How many "mild" cams with 330
degrees of duration would you sell? How many HOT cams with 220 # .050" (not
many).
