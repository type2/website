Hey Rogelio
Brakes are a fairly simple thing to work on and your '69 isn't old enough or 
new enough to have parts made of expensive materials like unobtanium or 
m.t.walletum.  You can do your own brakes with simple hand tools, a good 
manual, and some patience.  The list is a great source of info and support. 

Once you've done a brake job and all goes well you can stop with pride in the 
knowledge that you did it yourself and that there are many other things you 
can do as well.

Oh yeah, it helps to have a good place to work on it with a fairly level hard 
floor so when you drop stuff it doesn;t play hide and go seek.  Also a secure 
place that you can leave the bus for a parts run if you find a surprize 
inside the brake drums.  It's not a good idea to drive it with metal to metal 
brakes because they don;t stop well and buses aren't known for their stopping 
ability anyhow.

You may find that the noise is just rust embedded in the shoes and if you 
aren't really a safety conscious kinda guy you could probably drive like that 
for a while but let me know where you are so I won't be there.  Either way 
it's time for a really good inspection of the entire brake system.
