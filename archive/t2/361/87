Subject: I hate to do it but ...77 Westy for sale 

I love my bus, but I haven't had time, money, patients to work on her 
in long time (my graduate degree is taking all three).  I would like to 
sell her to someone intrested in taking good care of a bus in decent 
condition.  I am located in Morgantown WV.  The bus is yellow.  No 
major rust problems, but (as always) there are a few mechanical 
problems:  The fron disks need turning, the parking break nees to be 
adjusted (the star adjuster is stuck on the passenger side), and the 
engine runs rich after t warms up, and the cold start valve doesn't 
work (its shut).  I have replacesd the mass airflow sensor,and the 
temperature II sensor.  The bus also comes with an extra ECU (BOSH 
rebuild) Bently Manual, table, origional curtains, and front seat 
sling.  The interior was refurbished before I bought it.  If you are 
interested please contact me at awoodwor(-at-)mix.wvu.edu

Thanks 

Andy
