Subject: cuts out

Hi-

Freshly rebuilt 1641 w/ dual kadrons and 044 heads. The mechanic had a
couple issues dialing in but eventually got it running great.

About 2800 miles after rebuild, it starts to cut out on me. Only after
thoroughly warmed up and at highway speeds 55-60. The first time this
happened the wrench found my points totally closed which was blamed on wear
of the nylon block that rubs on the cam shaft. IT seemed like a stretch to
me, but that's what he found. Set points, starts right up runs fine, until
it cut out on me again.

Its sitting at the shop now waiting for trouble shooting. Based on my volt
meter, generator appears to be working fine.

Any ideas?

Thanks,

Pete
