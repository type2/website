Subject: ok, i have an idea, maybe you can do it, and then sell me one.

  First of all, thank you for knowing exactly what was wrong with my 
bus, so that i could easily fix it when my less reliable, water-cooled, 
front wheel drive, american made vehicle's week old radiator blew up.  

Second, while i was driving my bus today, i was thinking about how the 
gas pours out when i make a left turn.  I know why it does it and all, 
and i really need to fix it, and i have everything to do it, but that's 
not what this is about (and i only fill it half way and don't take tight 
lefts until i fix it).  So i'm thinking, you know, it's really stupid 
that the gas even gets up that high.  There ought to be something to 
stop it from even getting up into the neck.  Perhaps a one way valve in 
the rubber hose connecting the neck to the tank.  Even if it slowed down 
re-fueling, it would be worth it to be absolutely positive that the gas 
was in the tank where it belongs, and not sloshing against the inside of 
the gas cap every time i turn.

So yeah.  That's my million dollar idea.  Revolutionary to the bus 
community.  All you have to do is figure out how to make it, and let me 
know, and i'll buy one.
