Subject: Re: [T2] Sliding door sticks

could be a bad spring on
the hinge, or need grease
look under the rail cover
when it is open and see
if it springs back when you push
in on it.



Listees,
    I have another situation. My sliding door does not pop open when I pull
the handle. I have to knee it in the middle of the door and it pops open
then.
    My question is do I have to make some sort of adjustment or just grease
some parts?
Later,
