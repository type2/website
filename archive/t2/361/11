Subject: Oil temp Guage/Curtains for Front Window??

Good day and happy monday (if there is such a thing)

I have two questions after working this weekend on my
bus(74 westy/non pop top)...

First, can someone point me to a website that shows me
how to install a oil temp guage ??? Or if this is a
simple enough procedure to tell me in an email please
do so...(however since im not a mechanic in any sense
pictures may be more helpful for me)

Secondly, my bus has all the original curtains and
curtain rods but there isnt one on the front window.
How does the front window curtain attatch? There are
no snaps or rods etc.

Thanks in advance
