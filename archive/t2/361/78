Subject: AFM story (happy ending)

The weekend before last I met a really nice Westfalia owner on the way from
my parking space (his neighborhood ;-) to the movie theatre. We chatted for
a long time and he had a great story about a one of his trips to Baja (I
think) with his son.

He decided to let his son drive and they went into a big gulley (dry) in the
"road" and the engine conked out. They started it again, and when they gave
it gas, it conked out again. They swapped seats and Dad gave it a try but it
still did the same thing.

Out came the Bentley and after 3 hours of diagnostics he couldn't figure
what it could be. All that was left to try was the stuff you're not supposed
to do ;-) so he pried off the top of the AFM and upon closer inspection
found a spec of grit under the wiper arm that was dragged along the track.

One flick later and after putting the AFM back inline, the bus started up,
responded to the gas pedal and they drove out of the gulley.
