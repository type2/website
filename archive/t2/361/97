Subject: Sensor in the engine compartment?

Hey guys,

	There is... what looks like an air temperature sensor installed in
the engine compartment of my 73 Bus. When I open the engine hatch from the
rear of the car, and I look in the upper right hand corner of the engine
compartment, there is this little sensor attached in the ceiling of the
engine bay. There are NO wires attached to it. On the other side (sensor
side), it looks very similar to the AIR TEMPERATURE SENSOR found in the air
cleaner of say.. my 1987 Pontiac Fiero SE / V6.


Any idea what that sensor is for?



Thanks,
