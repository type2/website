Subject: Alternator in question

Replaced the alternator on my '72. When I pulled it, I notice that the
condensor on the back had melted slightly. Upon purchasing a new
alternator, I learned that it was something that needed to be pourchased
spereately but  was unable to locate a new condensor from my place of
purchase or elsewhere.

Does anyone know whether or not it is important to have the condensor?
Can I reinstall my new alternator with out it?
