Subject: Radio?!

Hey guys,

	I think I may be missing something. I'd like to install an
aftermarket radio, and I've run into a problem. When I look at the radio
opening in the dash, I notice that there is no bracket behind it to bold the
radio to. There is just a rectangular opening. Is there supposed to be some
sort of a bracket behind there?


Thanks,
