If the screwdriver trick works then you've got a bad ignition switch (not 
passing enough juice), wiring problem (not passing enough juice), or a 
solenoid problem (not getting enough juice).

Dunno how well the Bosch relay trick works but I use a FORD starter relay 
on my two VW's. Only once in 7 years have I had a failed start with the 
FORD relay. Yes it uses more juice than the little Bosch relay but it 
passes alot more juice.

FORD relay has 3 terminals. Two are large diameter battery cable lugs. At 
rest these two lugs are disconnected. When you put 12 volts to the third 
small terminal on the outside of the relay then it will go "click" and the 
two battery connections are connected.

So... connect that little screw to the wire coming from the key. Connect 
the other two connections to the two bolts that you bridge with the screw 
driver.

$15 (maybe) unless you've got a friend with an old FORD sitting in the 
backyard. The relays are typically located on the passenger side of engine 
compartment. It is located in the heavy wiring between the battery and the 
starter.

YMMV.
