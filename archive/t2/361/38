Good question.

I was under the impression that the engine fan provided some of the air flow
through the heater system, and that the fan only supplemented this action.
If this is the case, then

1. Would the engine fan provide enough pressure to keep the system at a
positive pressure when the blower is off?

and 2. Is the blower going to need a air backflow preventer to keep the
engine fan from blowing air back up through the blower (if installed in the
tire well)?
