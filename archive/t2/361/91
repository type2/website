Subject: no brake lights

I have no brake lights in my 69. Brand new switches on the master cylinder. 
Turn signals work, hazards work and the brake light warning light stays on in 
the dash but goes off when the brakes are pressed. Brake light warning light 
didn't come on until I replaced the brake light switches. Any ideas/suggestions?
