Subject: Boo-hoo Bus

After much consideration, and the usual copyright precautions, I've made the
"Crying Bus" graphic available at my family website.  Along with the
original graphic, there are two modified versions available.  Both are based
on the "hemp t-shirt" graphic.

One is a "Splittie" version and the other is a "Bay" version.  All of the
graphics are available in both GIF and JPG formats, and the modified are
available in both color or black & white.

Be advised that each graphic contains a VWoA copyright notice, and that
publishing them requires a copyright acknowledgment notice similar to the
one at the bottom of the page referred to in the following URL's.

Enjoy. :O)

The graphics are available by going to http://www.melas.org and clicking on
the "Giacomo, the Wonder Bus!" link.

They are also available directly through
http://www.melas.org/other/vwbus.html, though this page will eventually
showcase all of the wonders of Giacomo.  At such time as we add Giacomo's
webpage, the graphics page will then be linked off of his page.
