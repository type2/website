The problems I've seen with these franchise shops is inconsistency. 
Sometimes the work is ok, sometimes really poor. It has a whole lot to do 
with attitude, experience and skills of both management and workmen. Too 
many times the mechanic is being paid far less than any journeyman would 
accept. Also, most all of these shops use very cheap shoes, unless you pay 
extra for higher quality. The parts market is just full of "white box" no 
name shoes designed to be cheap and are just simply junk. A good quality 
shoe is the Raybestos Graylock available through NAPA and others. In the 
long run, you will be better to use your money to get the tools and manuals 
necessary and learn to do it yourself. Otherwise, I would seek and find 
someone with a good reputation working with VW's specifically. Inevitably 
this means someone who charges more per hour than most and spends more time 
in order to insure all weaknesses are removed and excellent function is for 
sure. He wants you to come back with a problem far less than you do. I 
write maybe 200 invoices per year and average less than one come-back per 
year. This makes it very easy to instantly resolve these rare problems at 
no additional charge.
