It's due to the size of the two flow paths.  As total air flow increases
the pressure difference across the larger path (metered air) becomes
slightly larger offering some resistance to flow.  At the same time the
pressure difference across the smaller orifice (bypass air) increases at
a much larger rate.  Therefore at larger amounts of air flow the ratio
of metered air to the bypass air becomes larger.  There are equations to
prove it.  If you'd like I could go dig out my old physics books and
look up the formulas but I think that's a little more in depth than we
need for our buses.

Hi,
Isn't the ratio of by-passed (unmetered)  to metered air the same over
the 
full RPM range? If so why does  the " idle screw on the AFM " have the
most 
affect at lower flows?
