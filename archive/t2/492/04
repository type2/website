I agree. The 411/412, were an abysmal marketing flop for VW (arguably
their Edsel), but kind of a neat car. Personally I'd love to have one in
nice shape (unfortunately rust and parts unavailability have taken most
off the road). But a friend of mine (a very accomplished professional VW
mechanic who has worked on every VW model) summarily calls them "the
worst car VW ever made." Admittedly they had their flaws (i.e. a very
archaic fuel injection system and somewhat poor engine/repair
accessability). And many people hated their looks (although I'm not one
of them). 

The Type 4 was introduced with high hopes. The idea was to replace the
rather successful Type 3, and in the process broaden VW's market to
include somewhat more upscale buyers than the Bug appealed to. Now, even
30 years later, VW still finds it difficult to go upmarket - while their
current efforts (Passat W12, Touareg, Phaeton) will hold their own to
any BMW or Mercedes, even today the Bimmer/Mercedes crowd still don't
much covet a VW emblem on their car. But back then, VW's efforts to "go
upscale" were very poorly conceived and executed from a U.S. marketing
standpoint. Sure the 411/412 had "real heat," a bit more power (thanks
to the new type 4 engine) and an auto trans, making it "higher end" than
the Bug - but you still had to adjust the valves and points, put up with
meager horsepower in the era of muscle cars and cheap gas, live without
air conditioning and power steering, and drive a small car with a VW
emblem on it. This wasn't exactly what Mr. and Mrs. Middle America had
in mind. It was a car without a market - too upscale to attract most Bug
owners, too spartan to attract most American car owners, and visually
quirky enough to discourage both. The 412 was VW's last-ditch attempt to
save the 411 with a facelift, but with its other marketing flaws,
window-dressing simply wasn't enough. VW saw its hopes for a worthy
successor to the Type 3 dashed. Meanwhile, their only remaining hope for
an aircooled future, the Porsche 914 (sold as a VW in Europe), also
failed (for many of the same reasons, although again a good car for what
it was). So VW threw in the air-cooled towel and moved on to the Rabbit,
ending an automotive era. 

On the bright side, we got busses with Type 4 engines thanks to these
marketing failures, so they ended up being good for us bus owners (and
from VW's point of view at least they were able to recoup part of their
investment this way...)
