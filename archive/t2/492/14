One thing that I would do for reliable running in very hot weather like 
that, especially with the sub-standard gasoline you find in Africa is to 
either reduce compression by installing a set of copper cylinder head 
spacer rings and/or to back off the ignition 3 or 4 degrees. That should 
keep your cylinder heads cooler without sacrificing too much power.
