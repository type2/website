---------- Forwarded message ----------

Congratulations to Mark Blanchard and Kathy Meyers, who according to Kathy,
"had a weird vibe" today and stopped at a court house and got married. After 19
years and several months together they are finally hitched.
Gee, I wonder if they can live together...

Old timers from the LENTI list will remember that Kathy was (and remains) the
owner of "Her Purple Majesty", a nicely done bay window bus... PURPLE with a
billion coats of clear on it with a killer interior. Extremely nice people who
deserve each other.
