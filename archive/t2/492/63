Subject: AIRS camping spot needed in South Dakota, Iowa

I have a young lady traveling to Iowa for the holidays in her 66 camper with
her 2 dogs.  She got her from Missoula Montana last night.  She is going to be
going east on I 90 and then south on I 29 and then E on I 80.  She's traveling
all packed down and slow .  Anyone on the way?
Steve
