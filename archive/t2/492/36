Subject: Type 4 motor oil pumps

Hi all,
I know this is a NLA part, so what are you all doing with worn pumps??
In the large variety of stories I have been told while chasing extensively to
find a NOS original pump (ranging from 'they never require replacing' to 'just
whack a beetle one in') I was wondering how many people are chasing new
pumps?
I am in the fortunate position to have sourced a NOS housing. It appears most
wear takes place in the housing and the gears remain fine.
As I have a new housing to measure up, and seeing I manufacture similar parts
all the time at work (work in hydraulics) I was considering running a batch of
replacement housings if there was need for them?

I have also been sold an aftermarket high flow beetle oil pump (Melling) as a
replacement for the stock pump, so I will be checking it's suitability when I
split the case. (I also have a few old stock beetle pumps so will be comparing
them also)

Another option is if there is a beetle pump with the same output as the stock
pump I could make a type 4 style housing to accommodate the gears from the
appropriate beetle pump.

Cheers,
