Subject: Re: [T2] 412 heater boxes

I scrounged the Leistritz muffler/heater boxes from a 74 camper (the
"free one you mentioned to the list a few yrs ago) as a one piece unit
(no upipes on this assembly) and it bolted right up to the daughter's 75
bus engine- but the underneath tin between the engine block and the
heater box did not quite fit- had to do some flattening of the tin
pieces to work.....now that you mention it, the connection to the
muffler at each side is trapezoidal....meaning that when the muffler
needs to be replaced, can I get one that matches this configuration?

Quoth Ron: Yes, the '72-74 Bus heater boxes should be a direct fit on
the 412
engine. You can confirm by looking at the flange from the heater box to
the exhaust. If it's trapezoidal (rather than triangular), as it should
be on a 411/412 engine, then the '72-74 Bus heater boxes will work. (A
stock '75 bus heater box would have a triangular flange; the '72-74 ones
would still work on this but only if you also put on a '72-74 exhaust
and did a few minor mods. Which is worth doing, by the way.)
