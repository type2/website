I did not mean to imply that the crankshaft main bearings or the crankshaft
to connection rod bearings are oil splash lubricated. I was trying to say
that the rings, piston, and cylinder walls are lubricated by oil splash in
addition to the oil spray that "leaks" onto them from the outside edges of
the oil pump - drilled oil passage- oil pressurized bearings.
