Yes, the '72-74 Bus heater boxes should be a direct fit on the 412
engine. You can confirm by looking at the flange from the heater box to
the exhaust. If it's trapezoidal (rather than triangular), as it should
be on a 411/412 engine, then the '72-74 Bus heater boxes will work. (A
stock '75 bus heater box would have a triangular flange; the '72-74 ones
would still work on this but only if you also put on a '72-74 exhaust
and did a few minor mods. Which is worth doing, by the way.)
