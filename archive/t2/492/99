Subject: RE: [T2] Hydraulic valves or solid?

I check my solid lifters every 1500 miles; I can do it in about 10 minutes,
and usually only one or two needs adjustment.

I see endless discussions and debate on the list about bleeding
down/adjusting/installing hydrualic lifters...it seems like way more of a
pita than it's worth. I had AVP keep my solids. My 2 cents...
