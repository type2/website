Subject: should I oil new pistons?

Hi All,
I plan to use this product in my current re-build in the hope of longer engine
life.

In the past I have just used a light mineral oil coating on thoroughly cleaned
parts with no ill effects.

Just a quick comments on Gary Matins e-mail, the crank and rods DO NOT dip
into oil in the sump for lubrication, it relies solely on oil fed from the
pump!
