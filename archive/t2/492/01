I've used one off and on in my 78 as a backup engine
and I actuallly owned a new 74 412, it really was an underrrated vehicle

the FI on the 412s was different than the FI on a bus.. the bus FI is the
better of the two

have to agree, I have had dual solexes, and they are real dogs to adjust.

if you have the hanger off the bus it should work on the 412

that is the understatement of the day, the 412 came stock with an aux
heater  a BA-4

not all 412s had the dipstick out the top it would depend on what car it
came out of, the 412s in a sedan were out the top, but the ones in a
square back  (Station wagon) came out the back like a bus.

if yours comes out the top I would agree if it comes out the rear you will
still need a bus dipstick as the 412 had an extender and longer dipstick

I happen to think the FI in the bus is better so I try to use the bus FI
in any 412 engine swap I do....try to get a bus FI system and fuel tank
for your conversion.  otherwise learn to sychronize the dual carbs.

good luck
