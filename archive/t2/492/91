Blue is 25A.

Never "upgrade" the fuses to test a wiring problem. If an 8A fuse is not
working that's enough to know there is a wiring fault. Much of the wiring
cannot carry 25A and you are risking melting the wiring in the harness.

It sounds like you have a wire backwards at the taillight. When you complete
the circuit by pressing the brake pedal, the current is going straight to
ground instead of through the brake light which is providing the load for
the circuit and causing a short. That's my guess.

In my testing that means the voltage vibrator attached to the back of the
gas gauge is burned out. When broken, the metal can version pegs the needle
while the later zener style just seems to go dead. I bet the can will be hot
to the touch. You'll need to replace it.
