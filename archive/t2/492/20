Subject: Second Call... Go West, Old Man!

Volks,

Second notice that I will be visiting out west for the next two weeks.  I
will be flying to Las Vegas tomorrow, then to Los Angeles on Monday.  I
will be flying back to Las Vegas on the following Monday and home to DC on
1/4.  I would dearly love it of someone arranged some kind of meet for
12/28, perhaps in the Topanga Park?  Also if anyone wants to do something
in Las Vegas either this coming weekend or the weekend of 1/3-4 I woudl
love to meet any Vegas listies!
