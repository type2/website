Richard,

I would not use hydro lifters and cam, especially if the motor was built
originally as a solid lifter engine. The hydro case is different owing to
the need for different oiling for the hydraulic lifters. I have examined and
compared the two types of cases side by side, and although the differences
are slight, they must have been important in the original design of the
motor.
