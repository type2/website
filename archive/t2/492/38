Subject: Re: [T2] should I oil new pistons?

thanks for all the info on the pistons.  I got them installed with no 
problems and used some oil to help 'em in.

then I dropped a washer in the case.. UGH!  Luckily I got it out and 
figured out where it came from (sheet metal screw), however, now I'm 
scared something else might have fallen in..

time to take it apart AGAIN!

.. boy, I'm sure learning how to build an engine.... over... and over... 
and over... ;)
