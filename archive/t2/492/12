Subject: tropicalization (here's what I'd do)

we gotta talk... I am in the Virgin Islands, and after a resto my 1971 is 
coming to me here.

I'd advise PAINT or PLATE everything... as the islands (surrounded by ocean) 
everything rusts.

Get an AMSOIL air cleaner... unless you are running the stock oil bath. It's 
a two stage with foam and oil... easy to re-clean, and re-oil... use it for 
a lifetime (has a lifetime guarantee)

find a junker with a complete A/C unit, and install it

tint the windows

paint the roof white

get extra rims for the bad roads

take all the extra parts you can find

carry two spare tires

how STOCK is your bus ? (learn to dial in the alt adjustment (if it is still 
there)

check steering parts, and pivot point

better shocks

better gripping/all terrain tires

correct blinkers, turn signals, lights, and markers

stock exhaust system is always the best to get into the country with
