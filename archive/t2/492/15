Subject: Engine & Heater

Hi all,

Well, I finally got a chance to stick my head in the engine bay last night and 
poke around in there a bit -- and discovered a few things:

A few of you asked about the rear engine supports on the beetle engine in my 
bus, well...there aren't any! So, yes, all the engine weight is on the 
tranny. I suppose that can't be too good for it.

Regarding the lack of heat, I discovered that the in-line fuse that goes to 
the BN4 fan is missing. I (temporarily) bypassed the fuse (since I don't know 
what goes in there yet) and got the fan to work. Also heard clicking.

Still no heat, though. I don't think its getting any gas. When I squeeze the 
little hand primer pump in the fuel line, it looks (and sounds) like the fuel 
is squirting back into the tank. I think the PO mounted it in reverse 
orientation.

Also noticed that the (clear) plastic fuel line going to my heater is really 
hard and stiff. I imagine the fuel line should be regular rubber fuel line 
instead of what looks like fat aquarium tube?

Thanks everyone who offered suggestions on what to do with my engine. I think 
I'm going to try and find an 1800 to 2000 type 2 engine and rebuild that. The 
brother of my bus's PO wants the beetle engine back (apparently it's more 
powerful that his current engine). Any guesses as to how much it might be 
worth?
