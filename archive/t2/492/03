you actually have to take part of the rear suspension off to get it out.
it sits right above the transmission

personally I have only the BA-4 in my bus and have totally removed the
stock heat

I don't know, I think mine is more than sufficient, BUT I also recirculate
the air from inside the bus,  but at 5 below in a wind in Northern Vermont
going to Killington and I was driving in shirt sleeves.

and how, one thing that helps is to cut any of the wires near the
component but leave a few inches so you can retain the color code. the
hardest part to find is the termostat which is inside the side sill
(drivers side) and isn't very large.

thank you it is a great help

yes it is a lot of work, mine was even more so  since it was designed
differently than stock (more later)

I always shut mine down a few minutes before fueling the bus

I also added two switches to mine so I can override the safety switches
and manually shut down the fuel pump and the master power for the heater.

check and double check, it is harder to get it working wrong than right.

My heater is mounted under the front of the bus where the air conditioner
condenser was formally mounted.   I use the air conditioner blower to take
air in under the dashboard blowing the air thru the heater which is
mounted transversely under the van, the heat output is directed into the
regular heat duct right behind the front axle beam.  I used truck flex
exhaust pipe for the ducting (make sure you get the stainless pipe, AMHIK)

take care and enjoy the heat
