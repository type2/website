was in Las Vegas some months ago, and whilee I didn't take my bus there
were a few to be seen.  unfortunately I had a rental dodge, (with A/C) and
one day when there was nothing happening at the conference I was
attending, I drove to Death Valley - highly reccomended..desolate beauty
is the only description,  on the way back I was on a two lane road and was
being passed,, glanced down and I was doing over 90mph!!! I slowed down,
(mandatory bus content) when you drive a bus long enough you only seem to
know how to drive with your peddle to the floor.....

enjoy the trip
