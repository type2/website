This isn't a good technique. You should undo the screws before you remove
the rocker assemblies. It's quite possible they seemed alright until the
engine turned over once and parts you thought were tight are now loose. This
could be the sound you are hearing.

Since timing has to be done after a valve adjustment I'm not so sure things
are ok.

Make sure the lifters are pumped up, the rockers arms are on full and
torqued up, adjust the valves and redo the timing.
