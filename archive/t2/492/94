Subject: battery terminal

Where is the positive - red - plus battery post in your bay window VW.?

If the battery is on the right side, is the positive battery post toward the 
front, or toward the rear of the bus?

To put it another way, when you are looking at your battery, is the positive 
- power - plus battery post to your right or to your left???

Q2:  To what, or to where does your battery ground wire connect.  On my '78, 
since my negative ground post is toward the front of the bus, the ground 
wire is bolted to the body, just under the ECU brain connector.  I don't 
know if this is original.
