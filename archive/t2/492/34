Subject: Pre-1972 to 1974 Parts Compatabilty

Hi List,

Today I found a junkyard bus...looks like a good candidate on parts for 
my 1974 Micro. A couple parts needed are the rear right window to
replace my bad left window w/vent set-up & front driver's seat...are
these interchangeable?
Also, the engine looks great in the junk yard bus...a type 1 engine with
all original set-up. Would this mate up with my stock type 4 style
transmission?

There are some other nice junkyard bus if any one is in need... jalouse
windows, rear seat... stuff stuff stuff  thanks guys :-)

-Tom
