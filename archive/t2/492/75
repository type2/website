You might want to go on the 356 Porsche list and bring up the topic of
sandblasting or bead blasting anything on the engine that is in the oil
delivery system. You will get many reports of newly rebuilt engines being
destroyed after a few hundred miles due to glass beads coming loose from
inside a bead blasted and powder coated oil canister/filler.
