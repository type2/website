Clicking is what they do. Mine has a slight click and the other one I have 
seen here
is the same. <click click click> Very slight but still there.

Also check the different variations in control levers.. might be you have 
engaged
the fan but haven't got the heat turned up.

Hard to say, remember it's cold out and stiff is ok. Hard and deteroriating 
is
bad. I think I read somewhere that some people prefer hose that wont bend
and thus kink cutting off the supply of fuel. Odds are it isn't aquarium 
hose
since it would have been eaten away by now Im assuming.

Tell him you want an engine for your bus and trade him :) Make him do the
work. Who knows what a motivated person might find.

I'll run into you at some point in person. Could be cool to caravan some 
where :)
