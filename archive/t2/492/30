To answer a few of your questions--
 
1- The idle screw on the AFM does affect mixture at all airflow rates
but it has the most affect at lower flows.
 
2-  You are correct about the open loop method.  The tension of the
spring in the AFM combined with the preset position of the potentiometer
controls the mixture through the airflow(rpm) range.
 
3-  The only way to adjust the AFM is to go to a mechanic with a good 3
or 4 gas analyzer so you can dial it in at all RPM's while watching the
other gasses too.
 
4-  The homemade CO meter gives you a representation of oxygen in the
exhaust which is a good indicator of your mixture as long as the rest of
your engine is tuned properly (timing, valves, etc.)
 
I went through a big ordeal adjusting my AFM and the final step was to
break down and go to a mechanic with a gas analyzer.  Got mine dialed in
to factory specs and even managed to pass the California emissions test.
