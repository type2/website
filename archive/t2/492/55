Alas, that is a loaded question. The correct answer to the question, 
loaded as this one is, is it depends. Depends on what? On the quality 
of the rebuild (and therefore the reputation, probably local, of your 
mechanic -- and the number of people with that kind of money to spend 
who also know the mechanic's reputation.)

What I think you meant to ask was: can you get $2000 for this bus? 
That's the unloaded question, and the answer is: probably not. Buses in 
the condition you describe are routinely advertised in the $1000 to 
$1200 range, and bring $700 to $900 after dickering.

(I am not taking into account that your part of Georgia may be 
depauperate with respect to buses. If it is, that might make a 
difference.)

The first rule of bus ownership is that you can never, ever, get as 
much money out of a bus as you put into it unless you are very, very 
stingy. At this point, you no longer qualify for stingy.

Mike, how exactly did this happen? Did you authorize each part of the 
rebuild? Was the mechanic straight with you each step of the way?
