Hello Pete,

Here is my thought. If adjusting the clutch cable
worked for awhile and then it started acting up again,
It may be the clutch cable. I bet if you try adjusting
it again that it will fix the problem again but this
tells me that you may need a new clutch cable. What do
I know. I own an automatic. And as far as "pregaped"
plugs go, I like the stock Bosch Platinum plugs. I
would still check the gap on them though. I bought a
new set and everyone of them were gaped incorrectly
for my bus. Gaping them is easy. Most auto parts
stores sell a spark plug gaper for around $1-$2.  ;)IF
you haven't bought your cap and plug wires yet, I
would recomend Bosch. To me, they work the best with
our Volkswagens. While you are doing your tune-up,
make sure you buy new points. If you go to
www.busdepot.com they have complete tune up kits
available. That is the easiest (and cheepest) route. 

Good Luck and have a great day!
