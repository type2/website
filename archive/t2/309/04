You risk destroying the bearings with hammering. Get a 3/4" drive crossbar 
and socket and a pipe cheater. No, I'm sorry, not cheap Chinese, but high 
spec. Calculate pounds/distance to set the torque at spec, then continue to 
the next hole. Same with the cotter key. Use the right size and quality 
pin. Stay away from the $9.95/1000 pin junk kits, for cotter pins or 
anything else. It can be hundreds of dollars cheaper to pay a $1 at the 
dealer for the proper spec cotter pin.

Yes, make certain the bearings dimple the races.

Nuts coming loose when torqued properly are an indication of bearing and/or 
spacer wear. How many times have you hammered it into submission????
