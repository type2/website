Subject: BBB AZ Propane Q

AZ Folks -

I have some 5-gallon propane tanks, one of which I was going to bring to BBB 
for heat. These are "older" propane tanks without the new, California 
(only?) "overfill prevention valves".

Does AZ have the same law that a propane tank must have the OPV for a 
propane dealer to fill the tank?
