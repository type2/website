Whether your first or fiftieth rebuild, all that is required to do spec 
work is you follow Bentley procedures and specs. What Bentley has to say 
about fasteners is generic and occurs in opening paragraphs. Reject all 
hardware that show defects, poor threads or scale/pits from corrosion, etc. 
Any rust at all opens the door to stress cracking. Replacing the whole set 
is prudent, but unnecessary if no defects are noted.

During teardown it is good procedure on head nuts to loosen 1/4 turn then 
torque to spec to insure the threads will hold. You don't want to find a 
stud pulling out after the re-assembly is mostly complete. Then you have to 
tear it all down again to fix properly.
