Would that I could always follow my own advice!  :)  Read my recent brake
posts to see why!

However, when a sudden loss of oil pressure will trash an engine and
since the bullet has already been dodged once I think that it would be
best to go with the plug!  Putting the plug back in with JB Weld might
work, but to get the JB Weld to adhere the metal has to be clean-clean.
The effort to clean it would be about the same as threading for a plug,
which is a forever fix.
