Subject: Good bus shops/mechanics in AZ?

My wife and I hope to be arriving in Lake Havasu City this weekend in our 72 Westy ("Poppy") after driving from Vancouver to the tip of Baja Mexico (where we are now) then up to AZ.  After BBB we will be heading down to mainland Mexico via Tuscon.

The roads in Baja have dirtied/shaken things up a bit and we need some basic maintenance done (oil change, valves adjusted, filters changed, suspension checked etc).

Can someone recommend a good shop in AZ to take our bus to on Monday after BBB?  Or, if anyone feels like tinkering on someone elses bus in the campground email me privately.... I'll supply the beer and lots of stories about bussing through Baja Mexico, BC, Yukon, and the Northwest Territories...
