Subject: What's this part in Bentley??

Hi all:

Looking at 13.7 in Bentley, showing the flywheel assembly for an air-cooled
Vanagon, the illustration shows, in order:

"Needle bearing"
"Felt ring"
"Spacer"

Off hand, I can't remember ever seeing this "spacer" (looks to be the same
diameter as the needle bearing and felt ring) when tearing down/rebuilding
Vanagon engines, but maybe I've just forgotten.  Or maybe it's a Bentley
mistake?

Anybody know?

TIA.
