AZ Folks -

I have some 5-gallon propane tanks, one of which I was going to bring to BBB
for heat. These are "older" propane tanks without the new, California
(only?) "overfill prevention valves".

Does AZ have the same law that a propane tank must have the OPV for a
propane dealer to fill the tank?

My Wal-Mart will still exchange the older tanks for new ones.  New tank filled
exchanged for old was about $20

It is a fed law for the new valves.
