I thought about going this route to begin with but everyone was diswaying me
if I wasn't doing an overhaul. My thought is that it isn't THAT difficult to
keep the filings out, especially since the first oil inlet into the galley is
about 1.5" in - leaves plenty of room to play. Depending on who shows up in
the morning to assist with the reinstall, we may just run over to Ace and buy
the tap and plug. Hints on the size would be helpful - but I have also take
the plug I have and use it as a guide.

I haven't reattached the flywheel yet, so it's not a big deal at all ot to this.
