Subject: doghouse cooler??!!

Listees,

I dropped the engine out of my 71 Westy to replace a head that has a broken 
valve (#3 exaust valve).

Should I switch to a dog house cooler?

I won't have the time to track down the parts, i would be buying the 
aftermarket stuff....would switching to a doghouse prevent things like this 
from happening in the future.  Is a doghouse cooler really that much better 
and worth my cash and effort?

As always thanks in advance and hope to get opinions for both switching and 
not switching.
