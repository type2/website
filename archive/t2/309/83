If I correctly recall, the current California law stipulates that vehicles
1973 and older.  The portion of that law also stipulates that the 30 years
and older exemption requirement doesn't go into effect until January 1,
2004.  I will try to dig through my archives to get a copy of the
legislation and post it on my website.

I specifically remember that when the original legislation was meandering
through the bureaucracy, the sponsors originally wanted to have any vehicle
25 years and older to be exempt.  However, enough opposition ensued so that
the following compromise was made:

Any vehicle 1973 and older was exempt from the emissions testing
requirement and that beginning on January 1, 2004, any vehicle 30 years and
older would be exempt for emissions testing.

Thus a 1974 would be exempt next year, a 1975 would be exempt in 2005, and
so on.

I've been keeping a close eye on this as there have been continual
rumblings in the Sacramento legislature in regards to scrapping or
modifying the law to put the screws to 70s era and later car owners, but
nothing has looked like its gonna fly at present.  But things can change.
