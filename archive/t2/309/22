This is why I included the link for the pdf direct from the CARB and said to read page 3. I believe
you are confusing year with model year. The 1974 MODEL year came out in Sept? 1973.

Here it is:
"Here is a pdf of the new rules for the Bay area. It also mentions the 30 year rolling cutoff on
page

This is straight from the Calif Air Resources Board."
