Subject: Re: [T2] 78 bus engine in a 72

Hi Ray,
    The 78 L-jetronic system is good and much improved 
over the carb. imho an even better system is the later L-jetronic
 with Lambda (o2 sensor), used  79-83.5 on California 
buses and vans. The same years have a good / much improved 
 ignition system.  Years ago with help from Karl Von Salzen I
 installed an 81 Cal system in our 78  and can tell you it
 worked very well. The mixture on it is kept at very near perfection
 and mileage also improved, with no noticeable change in torque. 
        After many trips/ vacations from the midwest to California and 
Oregon where we have sons. I eventually swapped the 78 engine with
 200k on the clock for an Audi i5. It is much improved mountain crosser.
 My wife Jolene (a life long dead head and bus driver) complains she 
no longer has the need to talk and give encouragement to the engine.    
    We recently purchased a eurovan camper and our 78 westy is for sale.

fuel injection books at       http://www.loam.org/vw/
