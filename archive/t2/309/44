I think the pulley marks are the worst guide - unless you've overhauled the
engine yourself and _KNOW_ they are right (I speak specifically from my
experience).

Or, as I had, line up a paint mark on the scale with one on the pulley for the
best timing spot.

This assumes the distributor is stabbed correctly and the engine is assembled
correctly. After a year of never being able to time the engine right, I found
that the cam and crank were off by one tooth during an overhaul.

Another way is to watch the valves on #1. When both exhaust and intake are
closed (i.e., there is a gap under each valve), you are at TDC for #1 (firing
position). Realize that the engine goes through two full RPM for each full
cycle of the valves on each cylinder. That means you turn the engine 720
degrees between each TDC.

Check your marks by rotating the engine 180 degrees - #4 valves should both be
closed - rotate 180 degrees again (your new marks should line up) and #3
valves should be closed - rotate 180 again and #2 valves should be closed.

Once you know where this point is, mark your pulley. You can also pull your
distributor and make sure it's stabbed correctly (check your Bentley - or even
Muir - for the correct alignment of the dist drive shaft).

Now, assuming the engine is built correctly, you can adjust your timing with
some confidence!

Here's a cool website with some pictures:
