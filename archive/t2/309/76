Hello,

I have a concern regarding my F.I. setup. I have a
F.I. setup from a manual transmission bus, 79 federal
model. I am "experimenting" with it because I am
installing it on a Porsche 914 2L engine. This
required some modifications such as redrilling the
stud holes on the intake manifolds, modifying the
transmission hanger, replacing the gas tank, the gas
tank cover plate, and figuring out a way to properly
install the fuel pump. So far, so good. Here is
another variable that I have to account for. I am
using the Porsche 914 engine with a 74 automatic bus
vacuum shift transmission. I plan on trying the F.I.
setup the way it is first to see how well the engine
runs and drives. My question is what is the
operational difference in the F.I. that was used on
76-79 automatic buses from setup used on manual buses?
Would I be better off using an ECU from an automatic?
Would this ECU work as well with the early automatic
transmissions as it did with the later automatic
transmissions?  If I need to use an automatic ECU, is
there any other part of the F.I. that needs to be
swapped such as the decel valve? Regardless, I am
going to try running the engine with the setup the way
it is first, but I wanted to know what to expect. ANY
thoughts on my situation would be greatly appreciated!
Thanks and have a great day!
