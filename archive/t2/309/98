Look again at the Muir book. And look at the footnotes. I have the 1981 edition in my hand. Page 110
has the Ignition Timing Chart. At the bottom is Type II. For 1972 is says 5 degrees after with a
little 2. Now go to the next page and look at the bottom where the footnotes are. 2 says: Strobe
timing mark at idle vacuum hose(s) on.
Your 72 has a dual vacuum unit distributor. One side is retard at idle. YOU CANNOT STATIC TIME A
DUAL VACUUM UNIT DIST. TO FACTORY SPECS. You can get close by subtracting the amount of timing the
retard puts in, IF you have the correct vacuum unit. In your case close would be 7.5 before.
But to do it right, you need a timing light and you need to verify the correct vacuum signals to the
dist.
And get a real manual for your bus like the Bentley. The Muir book is fun reading when you are
sitting on the can...
