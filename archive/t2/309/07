It will take less effort to fix this correctly than it would to bodge it
with JB-Weld.

First, push a ball of paper towel material into the oil gallery a short
distance.  You will retrieve this with needle nose pliars when you are
through.

Tap the hole with the appropriate pipe-thread tap.  Anyone know the size
off-hand?

DO NOT FORGET TO PULL THE BALL OF PAPER TOWEL OUT OF THE GALLERY!  This
pulls any shavings out of the gallery.

Install appropriate flush pipe-thread plug with Allen wrench.  Use a dab
of non-hardening sealant on the threads.
