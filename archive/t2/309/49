Close, but not quite right.  Hit delete now if you don't want to learn
some physics!

The electrodes of a platinum plug are very small and small pointy things
are able to leak off charge very easily.  You get a spark, but since the
coil doesn't have a chance to build up much of a voltage, the spark is
weak unless the ignition is specifically designed to be used with platinum
plugs.

Standard plugs have broader electrodes that allow more voltage to build up
before the spark jumps the gap.

Next time you see a Van de Graff generator (that big ball thing that
throws sparks in science classes) running, try pointing your
finger straight at it.  You will draw a lot of small sparks, barely
visible in normal light.  OTOH, if you present something like your forearm
to the generator, you will draw a fat blue spark several inches long.

Platinum plugs are your fingertip.  Regular plugs are your forearm!

Incidentally, this is why lightning rods on buildings have sharp points.
The idea is not to draw the lightning to the rod, but to dissipate the
electric charge harmlessly in little sparks before it develops into
lightning.
