Subject: TIMING MARKS

Hello,

I have a 72 van with what I believe to be a 1700 engine.
On my van it is missing the timing marks or the timing mark piece that bolts
to the outer crankcase.
Can anyone offer any suggestions as to fing TDC withoout those marks?
I have heard of taking the #1 spark plug out and putting a pencil eraser end
into the open spark plug hole.
Has anyone on the list done this before? How close can you get it?
Any other suggestions?
Thanks
Darren
