Subject: Re: [T2] 78 Charcoal Canister

Hiya Richard,

I'm the yahoo who did the surgery on the metal E-Cans typically found the 
pre-72 vehicles.  I did not work on any of the later plastic units so I 
cannot give you any absolutely reliable advice. However, in the earlier 
E-Cans the pelletized carbon was "jacketed" at one end of the canister by a 
springloaded pad/filter and at the other end by a stationary pad/filter.  
Assuming that the internal structure of the newer canisters is similar to the 
older ones, it might be a good idea to drill your access hole right in the 
middle of the unit.  That would be my starting point.

And a tip for you and the rest of the List.  If your e-can is in operating 
shape you should be able to easily blow through the unit using the big holes 
on each end.  If you find this difficult or impossible, it's time to refill 
the canister with fresh pelletized carbon.  VW suggested you change out the 
canister for a new one every 30,000 miles.

I cannot speak to all the canisters and superceeded canister replacements you 
mention.  I'll bet Karl could though!  But 175 201 801A  IS the current VW 
replacement canister for my application (1970 Bus) as well as yours.  It is 
indeed, the ill-fitting plastic cylinder model.  I was very unhappy with it.  
It was what got me started on refilling my old canisters.

Good luck to you.
