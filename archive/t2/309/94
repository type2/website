Subject: static timing

I cant seem to get my car timed staticly. Could someone please go through 
the steps for me? Does the ignition have to be in the on position?? Anything 
special to consider with a 72 and type4 engine?? Thanks and I hope you guys 
can steer me in the right direction

p.s. i already looked through muirs book but im still confused about the 
whole thing
