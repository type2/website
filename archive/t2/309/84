Not correct. I answered this the other day with a link to the BAR newsletter. Here it is again:

 Not correct. It is 1974 and older starting 1/1/03. 1975 and older starting 1/104 and so on.
The original SB42 was vetoed because of the 25 year drop-off. Kopp had to rewrite it to 30 years
with a 5 year moratorium on 1973 year model vehicles to get it passed.

Here is part of SB42:

 SB 42, Kopp.  Air pollution:  vehicles:  inspection and
maintenance.
   Existing law exempts any motor vehicle manufactured prior to the
1966 model-year from provisions requiring vehicles powered by
internal combustion engines in certain areas of the state to obtain a
smog check certificate of compliance or noncompliance biennially,
upon transfer of ownership, or upon registration of a vehicle
previously registered outside the state.
   This bill would, instead, exempt from those requirements any motor
vehicle manufactured prior to the 1974 model-year or, beginning
January 1, 2003, that is  30 or more model-years old.

Here is a pdf of the new rules for the Bay area. It also mentions the 30 year rolling cutoff on page
3.
