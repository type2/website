Subject: Dipstick Marks

I have a 1.8 ltr in my 74 that was built on a GE code case. Well, I have
never been happy with the dipstick. It's the type with a long handle above
the seal. During a recent juckyard trip I found a GE code engine and snagged
the dipstick. The handle on this one is several inches shorter but the
"operating" ends appear to be the same. Anyway, there are three marks on the
stick about 3/8" apart. What do they mean? From the bottom up do they mean
LOW-FULL-OVERFULL, or LOWER-LOW-FULL, or what?

I guess a related question is capacity. Does the GE code case hold more oil
thatn the AW code that was originally in there? The owner's manual says 3.7
US quarts which brings the level to the middle mark, but that's for the AW
case.

Any thoughts are appreciated.

Thanks,
Dave
