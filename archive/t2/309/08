From Aug 1976 , you only need the key on , and the dash lever to make the blower
fan work.

prior to Aug 1976, you DO need to ensure the alternator is putting out at least
8 volt , in other words, key on, engine running, alternator working, and the
Dash lever switch to make the fan relay pull in and activate the blower fan.
