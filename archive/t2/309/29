37/64 is .578", and gives 73% thread depth.Good for steel application.
Magnesium or aluminum will tap better with 9/16 ( .562") and is a more
common drill bit. Most Type 1 and type 2 case plugs can be tapped with
a combination of 1/8, 1/4, 3/8,and 1/2" NPT allen pipe plugs.I prefer
aluminum for this application, including the plug for  the oil pump output
in a full-flow modification. Brass is next. The original plugs are aluminum.
It's more obvious how they can fail when you remove one and realize how
little
clamping force is provided. Drill a hole in the plug and remove with an
autobody
slide hammer, or thread in a screw, then claw hammer if you are very
careful.
Do not use teflon tape on the new plugs.
