Spend some $$$ on an oil temp gauge and then see if you really need an 
external cooler. I'll bet if the engine is right and cooling system 
complete you won't need one.

If you do need the cooler I discovered several years back that Pep Boys was 
selling the same fan, same fan thermostat, and same cooler as CB 
Performance. You'll still need the oil stat and the sandwich cooler. Was 
effective on my Type IV powered Beetle which did not have the OEM engine 
oil cooler due to space restrictions.
