Geez, give the guy a break.  Even if you think he's only written one good
song in his life (personally, I disagree, but I wouldn't fall on a sword to
argue the point), that's one more than I've written.  I'm going to see him
in Ann Arbor in March (I think it is), and would give a day's labor to have
the time to paint my bus red, fill it with...  and give the man a lift
somewhere.  It's about being glad you're alive.

Best to all out there, didn't get a chance to say that over the holidays.
Drive carefully, enjoy your buses and your health and each other.
