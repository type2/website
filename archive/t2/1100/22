I agree with you. I bought one of their 6" sanders (think large grinder) 
for $40. It still works flawlessly years later but I seldom use it and I 
always use it very light duty. Sanding only.

The only problem with it is that you need earplugs to run it loaded or 
unloaded. I think the sander might have been made with square gears or 
something. What a racket it makes!!! GRIN!

I like HF and Northern Tools el-cheapo tools for occasional uses. If I 
needed something for regular use I'd save up and buy some quality. Used 
to have the same experience with JC Whitney (JC Whitless a friend called 
them). The problem with JC were the shipping prices! Whew! Quality seem 
to be random.

As for Fluke meters - they are nice and I have a good one (blew 
something inside so the meter ranges up and down endlessly. I need to 
fix it). I bought a pair of Craftsman digital meters last year. One for 
me, one for a gift.

I really, really wonder if they aren't make by Fluke. Displays seem to 
be the same, switches feel the same, same weight, etc. The one I bought 
myself even came with a thermocouple for measuring temps. Around $50 or 
so off the shelf. Will last me a lifetime I think.
