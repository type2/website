Subject: too cool for school

Well, in my quest for a cool running (type-I powered) bus, I've tried a lot 
of tricks, including (but not limited to): 
  -- type-IV oil cooler in my doghouse,
  -- single-port heads (better heat dissipation),
  -- cool tin (lower head tin),
  -- oversized crank pulley,
  -- porsche 356 alternator pulley,
  -- bigger tires (lower engine RPM)
  -- less alternator pully shims 

Most of these are currently in place (other than the oversized crank
pulley and minimal alt shims) on my 1600 SP engine, equipped with a
H30/31 carb, SVDA distributor, and otherwise set up in a fairly
stock manner (other than the doghouse shroud).

The addition of the Porsche 356 pulley really seemed to bring my oil temps
down 10 degrees and/or stabilize them a bit (takes a bit longer to reach
higher temps and comes back from the quicker), and I'm generally pretty
happy with the overall setup.

Here's the thing: now that it's below freezing here in Pittsburgh, my 
engine's never warming up fully:  I'm too cool for school.  I've got
the thermostat hooked up to the vanes in my fan shroud (and adjusted
so it should be as closed as possible when cold) and I've enabled the
pre-heater hose from the exhaust to the air cleaner, but ... my oil
temps are still reading 130degF after a 9 mile, 25 minute trip to work
(albeit with stop signs and stop lights, etc).

Now one caveat is that I have a sump-plate oil temp sensor that is getting
cooled by the ambient air, both rushing by and when stopped, but my
oil pressure readings are still in the 20-30 psi at idle, meaning that
I've warmed up some, but not much.

I need to check to verify my fan housing flaps are actually acutating, 
but I was just curious if anyone else had seen this behavior with the
356 pulley.  

Oh, this is in my '67 camper...

Cheers,
   Tom
