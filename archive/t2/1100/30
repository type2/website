What's the difference? I answered my own question with the help of the 
internet. The "C" denotes continuous heat adjustment. The knob has no 
notches in it's rotation. It has infinite heat adjustment. The "T" is 
limited heat controls with ranges broken down into 7-8 distinctive heat 
ranges. Click-click-click goes the heat control as you turn it.

The "C" is a fancier machine because of this one feature. The rest seems 
to be about the same.
