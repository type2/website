Subject: 73-79 upper engine hatch question

will someone with a '73-'79 bus please open your inside engine hatch lid (the
one behind the back seat) and let me know what the hatch gasket looks like..  
I need to know if what you see is flat or if it has a profile to it.  I found
a hatch gasket but i don't know which side is up or which side is down.  the
gasket I'm referring to is part #1 in the following fiche:
