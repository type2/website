As has been mentioned most bearings are generic (and in any recent history
(damn near post 1950s) almost universally metric in dimension.)  I rebuilt the
rear diff in my '87 Quantum syncro years ago and the pinion support bearing
was $120 for VW/Audi and I paid $25 for what was likely the same FAG bearing. 
That said, sometimes manufacturers will have large OEMs do half assed things
like make the external shell a stinking 0.5mm smaller than a stock size.  When
I was working as an engineer a buddies wifes '91 Honda Accord went through a
bearing (and thereby a $175) dizzy every 100k miles (car had 300k on it
though.)  On the 3rd time, too cheap to pay for a full dizzy, we tried and
tried to find the replacement, it was a common ID, thickness, type of bearing,
the stinkin OD slightly off anything stock, and we looked at work through
scores of bearing catalogs.  Our solution, which might be the one here as it
would last nicely in this application for
 a long time was to turn a bushing from oil impregnated bronze, was still
going when she traded the car at 450k.  If you got a machist buddy, not hard
to do.  Even if you find a close bearing one with the right ID another
possibility is judicious J-B weld after spacing it with something to center
the outside, will be a PITA later though to replace again.  Anyway, get the
original out intact, take it to your local industrial bearing house, have em
measure it up and try to find something.

Anyone know besides junkyards who might carry a steering column bearing for
a 1974 transporter?
