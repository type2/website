You are correct. Mine cheap HF sander has no more than 2 hours of use on 
it so despite it's age it isn't very worn only because I seldom use it.

I have seen the same results with good tools vs cheap tools. The good 
tools pay for themselves in my experience. I buy quality too whenever 
possible, even if I have to stretch my budget a little. In the long run 
it has paid off.

I'll wear mine out this spring when we strip our bus for paint.
