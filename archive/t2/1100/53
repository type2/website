Problem with the automatic chains (all schoolbusses in AK required to have
them, and lots of rigs, ambulances, city buses, even occasionally RVs, etc
have them) is that like any mechanical device they stop working, and are very
pricey or a big PITA to fix.  I have a 14' box truck I bought up here with
them, and likely because they weren't often used (ex U-haul and most people
probably don't U-haul in the winter), they had long, long seized up.  On CL
adds up here it is rare, and people make a point of it, if they are selling a
vehicle with them where they still work.  I fixed em, but it wasn't worth the
effort compared to just putting on a set of chains (though that is a royal
PITA on a dually some times) or just having and running studs in the winter. 
You CA guys of course can't really do that...

there is a small motor and retractable arm that when activated has a wheel
with lengths of chain attached and it throws a piece of this chain under your
wheels every few inches and picks em up as you drive over them, the wheel
usually has 6-10 lengths of chain on it.
