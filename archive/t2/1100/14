Sounds interesting.  I definitely like the price.  Say, what the heck is 
'vinyl cove base' normally used for?  Don't think I've ever heard that 
term.  And how does it come, in strips or sheets?  Is it all the same 
thickness?  I have a new 3 HP, 21 gallon compressor I got at the flea 
market for $100 so I'll go with a pneumatic stapler.  Do you glue the 
strips down?  Or do the staples go all the way through to the wood?  
Sorry to be stupid.  I haven't taken the old one off and inspected the 
set-up yet.  Thanks....KR

The new vinyl strips were not as rigid as the originals, but I was in a hurry to get the top replaced. They have held up fine, no problems whatsoever. GoWesty sells a replacement 30' roll of tack strip for 20-ish bucks, but they say theirs is "a little more brittle than the original, so if you are using a pneumatic stapler, be sure to turn the pressure down to avoid cracks as the staple penetrates it", I used an electric stapler and stainless steel staples bought from the local marine distributer. The staples penetrated the new vinyl only after I "dialed in" the stapler/angle/arm-force combination that seemed so crucial to getting a staple to seat flush. Total cost for vinyl cove base at the local Home Despot, $2.76.
