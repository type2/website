Subject: Converting Interior on 73 Westy

Hello all, Is it possible to reconfigure the interior of my 73 Westfalia
from stock, with the sink unit next to the sliding door, to something more
like the Berlin configuration, where the sink and most of the storage space
is on the left side?

If I'm looking at it correctly, I'm thinking that means I'll have to remove
my passenger side closet, and move the z-bed to the right in order to make
room for the storage and kitchen units on the left.

Is this a very difficult conversion to do?

Thanks!
