I don't know if it was mentioned but I will as I have for 15 years now, the
3/4" drive metric socket set is the single most useful thing I've every bought
from H-F for car/VW transporter work.  Would it last working on heavy
equipment, probably not but maybe, for home use though indespensible for use
as a socket set, bearing race/seal driver, general press tool, whatever.  I've
passed on good C-L deals on better sets over the years, because mine is 15
years old, I've had 1000s of ft/lb on one (my 275lb out on a 8 foot extension
bar) several times, and I've not broken one yet.  The ratchet driver is
getting a bit iffy 15 years on, but the breaker bar will never fail.
 
Next would be their standard $10 set of wobble extensions.  Those things will
save your ass in a bind countless times, quality is fair, I've broken several
and have bought 4-5 sets, but for $10 a set, who the hell cares.  Can
literally, literally, save hours of work just getting a socket on something
you normally couldn't.
