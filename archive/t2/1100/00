Subject: oil sensor question

Hello all.  Somewhat a newbie here.  Received a 1970 type2 westfalia camper
(with funky non westy top) as a gift from a fan of the band I play with.
After towing it to my state and having a good bit of work done it became
anything but free but still I love her and am having a great time trying to
get her in good shape.  Knocking things out 1 at a time.

The oil light stays on when driving.

Changed the oil yesterday - full 2.5 quarts.

When I disconnect the wire from the oil pressure sensor the light goes off
so I thought maybe it is the sensor itself.  Before springing for a new
sensor I thought I may attempt to clean this sensor.  Good idea?  I assume
I'd take it out and attempt to remove any goop clogging it?  Maybe clean it
out with a shot of gas and maybe a really skinny piece of wire - into the
hole on the inside.  Would that possibly futz up the contacts in the
sensor?  Any suggestions?  It doesn't seem too easy to remove either.  I
notice that the nut is pretty rough as if it has been removed and replaced
several times without much grace.  Looking for any suggestions others may be
able to share in the matter.

Thanks,
