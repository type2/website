Google "Harbor Freight Gems". These are the tools folks have
determined to be excellent values.

The corded impact wrench is one of them. The cast iron bed lathes are
others. A few hand tools, routers are decent, the 12" SCMS is one too.
The laser thermometers are as well, but they're not much cheaper than
elsewhere.

Don't spend your own money trying to figure out which are gems. Plenty
of others have done so for you!
