Good solution from Mark as usual - kinda what VW was doing with the early 
fan housings with the annular ring that blocked the amount of air available 
to the fan until the engine warmed up and the ring rotated to a more open 
position (if I recall this correctly from 50 years ago).

Would be nice if there were a slot on the doghouse setup that would allow a 
piece of metal to be slid in and out to block the fan air.

I recall seeing vintage British cars with a blind/curtain in front of the 
radiator that could be raised or lowered remotely. Would be nice to have a 
remote operated curtain (or record cover) that could block the fan intake.

I have the over cooling problem on an old Porsche race car which can be 
solved by taping over one of the two oil cooers inside the front fenders. 
Not a workable solution with a doghouse.

Phil
