Subject: Looking for Westy Interior Parts

Hey Type 2ers-

  I've exhausted every other avenue, or I wouldn't post here.  I know there
are
quite a few Colorado Type 2ers, so I thought I'd reach out to you all and see
if you might be able to help me find some Westy interior parts.
Specifically,
I'm looking for a the full size bench without side cabinets or the 3/4 bench
with the cabinets.  If they are in bad shape, but I can make a pattern out of
them, I'd probably still want them.  I've found these items in the
classifieds
on thesamba but shipping basically kills any attempt to get them to me,
because
they are so big.  I'm hoping someone local to Colorado (I'm in Fort Collins)
has some sitting in their garage or knows someone who is just letting a Westy
rot in a field that might have an interior I could acquire from them.

  Please reply privately if you get have a lead I can follow up on.

Cheers,
Paul
