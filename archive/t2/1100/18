Subject: Clamp style meters

I'm heading across the border Saturday to go to Harborfreight. We don't have
them up here in Canada. Can anyone think of any handy-dandy tools that come in
really useful on our Westies? I'm thinking a clamp meter looks interesting. is
there any use for one on the vans? I'm also thinking one of those laser temp
readers looks good to.
