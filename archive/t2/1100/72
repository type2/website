Ned I have adapted many different set combinations and if you cut the  
mountings from the donor body you should be able to do it.  
 
There might also be away to have the swivel option the 78 's have.

My  mechanic has a 99 Eurovan he's parting out. I'm wondering how much work
it  would be to get the seats to work in a 78 Westy.

Thanks for any  input.
