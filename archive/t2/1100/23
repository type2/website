I'm no stranger to HF, and if you're tooling up quickly for a project it's
inexpensive and they have a large range of stuff.  That being said, I have to
give the thumbs down on the grinders.  We use them constantly, and I use the
wire wheels and cups for stripping paint.  My 9 amp DeWalt, 80 bucks has
outlasted no less than 7 20 dollar HF grinders my bud Jackie buys.  When you
get a spare set of brushes with your new grinder I think that is a bad sign.
