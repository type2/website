Subject: Re: [T2] Riviera pop top questions (safety?)

Well I looked the bus over, but could not pop the top (inside low garage)
though I have pictures of the tent condition.  Larry, I can't easily tell if
this is built on a sunroof or not.  The answer may be an easy one which I do
not recall off the top of my head, despite owning a '72 sunroof as my second
bus some 23 years ago now.  Anyone know when did they stop installing belly
pans on sunroof models?  '72, '73, '74?  This bus does not have belle pans. 
That said, aside for the outside slider rocker, and the area immediately
behind it in front of the rear wheelwell, again outside only, although this
bus has had "normal" bus front damage (crappy that it would cost 4 times what
the panel costs to ship a nose section to AK) it is essentially rust free. 
Even the battery tray is pretty fair.  The interior is as Chuck describes, a
copy of a similar vintage Westy, not executed as well, but would at least
clean up fair probably.  Shame I passed on 3
 '69-'73 westy's for $500 last summer, as there was one very clean interior in
the lot, but not a body among them.  Anyway, I have to see if the guy is
interested in a realistic price.  He has dreams of NADA dreams in his mind,
and is into the bus for much more than it is worth, only to find it doesn't
have reverse....   Not that I care I have 3 trannies sitting here, but I won't
pay $2k for a $1k bus.
 
Thanks all for the help, keep any more opinions coming.

the meager numbers of Westy's available, bought SUNROOF model Kombi's
to build their campers.  On most models that I have seen you can actually
make out the formed opening in the roof by looking under the tent from
outside with the roof in the up position.
