When I looked into adding an oil temp setup to my T4 engine a few years 
ago there was a wind shield for the sump plate sensor.  It was available 
new from Porsche.  I doubt the inspection plate is the same from the T1 
to the T4, but is there a similar wind shield for the T1 sump sensor? 
Not that this would help with getting your temps up any faster, but 
you'll get a more accurate reading.  As I recall the thing was pretty 
damn expensive.  I guess anything purchased from Porsche is tough.
