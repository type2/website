Hi David,

Congrats on your fan gift. We all spend money keeping our buses
roadworthy, which is a labor of love in itself, but yours will be even
more so a special memory of a fan who cared about you.

Yes, the oil sender can get gummy, so a good soaking can help. It
won't hurt to poke around in it a little. The way it works is that by
default the sender passes 12 volt current from the attached wire to
ground on the motor, thus completing the circuit to the warning light.
When the engine starts, oil pressure pushed the contact back away
against spring pressure to break the circuit and turn off the light.
So if yours stays on, it means the contact switch inside the sender is
frozen and stuck in the closed position. Those senders don't cost very
much if you want to replace it. You might consider adding an oil temp
and oil pressure gauge, and even more importantly, a quality, accurate
Cylinder Head Temperature gauge (CHT) by Dakota Digital.

Yeah, be careful on those threads. You will be an unhappy camper if
they strip. People cross thread them and install NPT threaded senders
instead of the M10x1 they are supposed to be....

Have fun!!!

John
