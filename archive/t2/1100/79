The veneer will normally just peel off. You can use a heat gun on low
with a plastic scraper on the stubborn spots. The glue is gonna be 30
years old, so it should be pretty easy. (I'm assuming you're talking
about the cabinets and such for your Westy interior?)

The low setting is to prevent delaminating the plywood used to build
the cabinets.

A few vendors have a *similar* molding trim for around the doors. None
of the available options are a perfect match, so you will probably
want to replace all of it to match.

Google "T-molding".
