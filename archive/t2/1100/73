Subject: chrome window molding

I'm finishing up on a 78 Champaign edition westy and fighting with the  
chrome window trim molding, does anyone know a trick for making this a  little 
easier...lol   Its WCM rubber and fits the glass well.   I'm doing it like 
doing the aluminum trim ...rubber on window then molding then  install on 
bus.  I'm stuck at molding staying in rubber after its inserted  in the groove.
