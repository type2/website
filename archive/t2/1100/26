Hey folks - got a quick question.

A year or so ago I bought a Lincoln MIG SP-180T (I think) for my shop at 
home. Last week I bought another SP-180 for the shop at work. This one 
is a SP-180C.

What's the difference? The carrying handle is a little different but 
most of the outside is the same. Also the temp range knob is infinite on 
the "C" vs the "T" where there are distinct heat ranges.

Thanks,
