Yeah, when you get into formal racing they really get strict with the
technical inspections and sealed, certified compliant engines.

 Wow Jamie,
        An 1835 is not a stock 1962 VW sedan motor.  I've done a bit of
 Formula Ford racing back in the '70's and we would have been called on such
 a deceit!  Pretty cool though.  Sounds like it was fun.  Gary
