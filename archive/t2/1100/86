Pretty simple.

I bought a fancy aluminum one for cheap from a catalog 20 years ago.

Was simply three brass nipples. Two screwed into the valve covers (drill 
your own holes). The third attached to the engine block at the engine 
case breather. Again drill your own hole. Rubber hoses connected the 
valve cover vents to the sides of an aluminum box that fastened to the 
firewall. Inside was a sponge. The crankcase hose connected in the 
center so whatever oil accumulated in the aluminum box would drain back 
to the crankcase. Can't remember but it might have had a fourth hose 
that connected to the intake near the airfilter so whatever leftover 
fumes would be burnt off by the engine.

Have seen many version that used large steel soup cans, those little 
aluminum Heiniken beer kegs that hold maybe a liter or two of beer, or 
those small aluminum water bottles or camping fuel bottles. Polish as 
you please. You'll have to TIG in your own connections on a generic 
bottle or perhaps JB-Weld them in.

Hope this was helpful.
