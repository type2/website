Jim;
couldn't a commercial industrial bearing supplier cross-ref this to another bearing ? I had to do that with a bearing for one of my ancient motorcycles, and the guy at my local BC Bearing Co. said he would just match it to another bearing with the same dimensions??? Or has VW cleverly built a one off bearing like the one on the sliding door??
