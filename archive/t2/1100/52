Thank you, Dan!!!  Sorry I missed that - not enough coffee this AM!!!

By the
way - I tend to go for the traditional "chain-chains", not the cable ones... 
they're a little more of a hassle to get on (until you've done it a buncha
times), but I get better traction from them, and have seen too many of the
cheapy cable chains come apart, thrashing fender wells, etc...  YMMV of
course.  Then again, *any* traction device is better than none in snow...
