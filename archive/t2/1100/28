Great idea!  The 4-1/2" angle grinder is near the top of that list.  I can't speak for others, but I used mine heavily during the build of our LeMons race car and again on the diesel conversion of my bus.  No I am not a pro, but I have gone through several ten-packs of the cutting wheels and many hours of runtime without a problem.  I have definitely gotten my $20 worth out of that angle grinder.

Previously I had the blue 4" version which I used for many, many years (maybe 10 years?) and did not take very good care of.  It finally gave up the ghost a few years ago when I was cutting some steel for trailer ramps and really working it hard - got my moneys worth out of that one too. 

You don't always get a quality tool for spending more money.  I had a Bosch 1/2" hammer drill bought ~12 years ago that got very little use, and when I was drilling holes in a 4" slab for a pool fence recently, it died on me.  Had to borrow the neighbor's drill to complete the job.  Very disappointed.

Bottom line, if you are a casual user you will probably not have to replace your HF angle grinder for many years, if at all.  If you are a pro, by all means spend for the better tool if it makes you happy.  :-)
