There are certain points in the Sierra's we're chains are mandatory,  
based on conditions.  In those scenarios, usually CalTrans (California  
DOT) will be out on the roads to enforce and assist with installs.  In  
areas where chains may be required, there are usually areas where cars  
can pull off on the side of the road to take care of installing/ 
uninstalling the chains.

Along I80 ( a route our family takes often) specifically, there are  
spots in Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming that follow similar guidelines.

Peace, Troy
