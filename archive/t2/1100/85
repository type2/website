Subject: Riviera Slider Windows

Hello all,

I have purchased a set of Riviera slider windows for my 72 westy. They are in great shape except for the "track felt" that the window slides on. Has anyone found a close replacement for these? I am in Hawaii so a RV shop is out of the question (they don't have those here). Looking for something online I guess. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

Sam
