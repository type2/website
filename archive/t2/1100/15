Kevin,
Vinyl cove base is a product used for finishing the wall-to-floor area
of a laminated/vinyl floor. Its usually 4 inches wide, 1/8 inch thick heavy
duty vinyl. It is flat for 3 3/4 of its surface, with the last 1/4 inch
curled. I cut 3/4 inch strips out of one strip (I may have bought two strips)
and got two 4 foot strips for the front and back of the canvas, and cut 4 more
strips (yep, I bought two) for two strips each for the sides. Each strip was 4
feet long, but it is also sold in 120 foot lengths. Its really inexpensive. If
I had to do the top over again, I would cut the strips 1 inch wide, since a
few areas that I cut oversize looked better than the 3/4 inch areas. Pay
attention to the amount and position of the staples when restapling, since (if
its original) the guys at Westfalia did this many, many times and knew where
and how many would make for a nice top. Do not skimp on the staples, get them
in stainless steel (so no rust leaks onto your new
 expensive canvas) and get plenty of them. I think I used 150 staples for the
top, though it could have been a bit more. Good luck!
