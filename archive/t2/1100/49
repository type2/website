Subject: Re: [T2] buses and chains in British Columbia

When I lived in Big Bear, CA, coming up the mountain from San
Bernardino there would be a CHP parked in the middle of the road at a
pullout, not letting you buy unless you had 4wd or chains.

The pullout was often populated with a bunch of young guys who would
install your chains for you ... For a price. $15 when I used to live
there, probably more now.

Depends on how close you are to a populated area I suppose.
