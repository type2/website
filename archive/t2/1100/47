Subject: buses and chains in British Columbia

When I aquired my 74 camper, it came from Long Beach California to Ontario
Canada, and was being offered for sale here.
What I found strange at the time,,, was the bus came with tire chains!

well.. since, I have learned what I should have in grade school geography..
that California isn't all beaches and sand ,, and warm weather.

I recently was asked how to install tire chains as the folks are heading
west to British Columbia

One comment that I was interested to know..  It was mentioned that there are
places you pull over, and someone installs the tire chains for you.
Is that common?  I mean,, i understand the weather changes, we have 9
weather zones in our small region,,, so you might be driving on a road that
,due to mountain conditions or something, requires tire chains,

Is it mandatory that chains are used , or your not allowed past a certain
point,

This area has used road salt... no chains, no studs allowed.  This may
change as the envinronment is showing tooo much evidence of contamination
now.

Thanks
