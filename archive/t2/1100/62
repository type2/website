Subject: Got me a Bus/truck/pickup........

Hi

I am back on the mailing list with a new Bus.  New to me that is, it is a '69
VW Pickup that I got off Craigslist in the DC area.  The interesting part is
considering what I paid for it after after about 40 years it increased in
value around 1.75 a year, so much for antiques increasing in price.  And it
was originally purchased only about 20 miles from where I live now.

Well today a friend and I drove up to where it was and I drove it back.  I
wasn't too sure if that was the smart thing to do but 80 miles later it's
sitting in front of my house so things went pretty good.  It has a vacuum leak
that give me a little trouble when it idles and likes to backfire when it
suddenly has to slow down.  And for some reason I just can't get the heat to
work, so it was a cold ride home.  When I got it home I was showing my friend
the storage compartment in the bottom and to my surprise there was a set of
dog-legs and other parts that will be greatly appreciated.  It has some rust
but that is expected, so here are a couple pics of my baby, Oh, and I named
him Rusty...

There is one thing that I had forgotten about driving a VW, and I know all of
you have experienced this many times before, but in that one trip I bet there
was over 20 people that either waved, smiled, honked, or gave me a
"thumbs-up".  Make it all worth while.
