Subject: tack strips for Pop-Top Tent

Hi guys.  I'm back from sailing around the Med. for several months.  
Don't know if this place will ever be the same without Karl, God rest 
his ornery, genius soul. 

I'm getting ready to replace my pop-top tent.  Does anybody have any new 
suggestions for the tack strips (or whatever you'd call them) that the 
staples go into?  I read in the archives about thick duct tape and those 
big long vertical pieces of vinyl used sometimes as doors.  Anybody know 
of a source for something close to the original?  Thanks...KR
