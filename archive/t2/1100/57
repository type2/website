I've tried both on the front and I like the cables best - they work 
pretty well for steering and are also easier to put on .

For the best traction in the rear, definitely chains over cables.  
Studded tires might be better, but not for those of us who live with 
intermittent snow.  I think they are illegal in California anyway.

If you are going somewhere snowy, don't forget gloves.  Without them, 
your fingers will freeze up before you get even one set of chains 
installed.  This is true whether it is -30F or +30F.
