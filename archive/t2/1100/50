yes there are places as I'm sure others will mention.  there are also 
automatic chains.  very ingenious our ambulances and fire trucks use em in 
this area.

there is a small motor and retractable arm that when activated has a wheel 
with lengths of chain attached and it throws a piece of this chain under 
your wheels every few inches and picks em up as you drive over them, the 
wheel usually has 6-10 lengths of chain on it.

not cheap but if you go up and down a mountain with frequent need it could 
be very convienent.
