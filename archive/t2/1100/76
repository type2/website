Subject: Looking for 78 Westy or Type 2 Parts Bus in Sacto, CA

Hi Volks:

It's spring and the Green Bean needs some spruce up.

Looking to strip or buy:
Good Driver's Seat
Interior hardware Driver's Door
Rear Bumper (White not chrome)
Cabinets if veneer is good. 

Ideal would be a decent tent but I will likely get that one from Bus Depot.

I do get to Redding periodically so BusBoys are not out of the 
question.  Thought I'd start local, especially of the owners of those 
two lots in Southeast Sac full of buses read this list.

Cell is below but email is best,

Thanks,

BEN
