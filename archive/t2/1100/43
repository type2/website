Dan,

I've seen the wind shield and think I need to fabricate one up,
but I haven't done that quite yet.  

To be honest, I mostly use the oil temp gauge for qualitative 
data (and trending) more than anything.  I don't know that my 
oil pressure gauge is any more accurate (I kinda think it would
be, although I wouldn't bet on it), but between the two of them 
I have a good feel for where my engine is operating/how-it's-
running.

Cheers,
   Tom
