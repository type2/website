Subject: Re: [T2] Eurovan Seats into a 78 Westy

I'm finding that even my early Vanagon seats may be too high in my '78.

I'm already looking out at the top of the door window with stock seats. 
My Vanagon seats put me another half or full inch higher.

An ideal Bus would be one that I chopped below the belt line and added 
2" in height to the whole body... Man would that mix people up - what's 
different? SOMETHING is different - but what?

Saw a '49 Chevy 3100 pickup at the hot rod shows in TN for many years. 
Looked right but "something" was wrong. Guy had sectioned the truck 
everywhere and shrunk it to Chevy S-10 dimensions and then put it on a 
S-10 chassis and running gear (I think).
