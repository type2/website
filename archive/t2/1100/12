Kevin,
I replaced the canvas on my '74 this past April. I used white vinyl cove base, cut into strips, for the replacement vinyl tack strips. The new vinyl strips were not as rigid as the originals, but I was in a hurry to get the top replaced. They have held up fine, no problems whatsoever. GoWesty sells a replacement 30' roll of tack strip for 20-ish bucks, but they say theirs is "a little more brittle than the original, so if you are using a pneumatic stapler, be sure to turn the pressure down to avoid cracks as the staple penetrates it", I used an electric stapler and stainless steel staples bought from the local marine distributer. The staples penetrated the new vinyl only after I "dialed in" the stapler/angle/arm-force combination that seemed so crucial to getting a staple to seat flush. Total cost for vinyl cove base at the local Home Despot, $2.76.

Hi guys.  I'm back from sailing around the Med. for several months.  
Don't know if this place will ever be the same without Karl, God rest 
his ornery, genius soul. 

I'm getting ready to replace my pop-top tent.  Does anybody have any new 
suggestions for the tack strips (or whatever you'd call them) that the 
staples go into?  I read in the archives about thick duct tape and those 
big long vertical pieces of vinyl used sometimes as doors.  Anybody know 
of a source for something close to the original?  Thanks...KR
