Subject: Re: [T2] Eurovan Seats into a 78 Westy

You may find the seat height a bit high with EuroVan seats.

The EV seats are mounted on sliding rails which are bolted to the  
seat base, so no cutting is needed.

If  you are wanting a swivel option, our Vanagon seat swivel adapters  
will fit on a late bay.  They mount over the existing seat rails and  
the adapter has it's own rails welded on.  The original Bus & Vanagon  
seats that swivel had a lower bottom cushion to keep the seat height low
