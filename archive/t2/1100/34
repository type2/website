Subject: Re: [T2] 1973 Baywindow Fuel Lines

on a 73,, the fuel line runs from the tank , usually to a cable tie on the
starter,, then drops to the fuel pump right below the starter,, then the
line from the pump goes up to the front engine tin, thru a grommet, to the T
at the right carb.
The fuel line doesn't go thru the firewall...  it comes out the tank at the
bottom, and basically sits in mid air to the engine.  a custom one could be
tied up to anything,, keeping in mind vibration, and heat,, you don't want
to tie to the heater box...

hope that helps
Jamie
