Congratulations!

 

I've got a '69 as well. I am up in MA if you ever make a road trip.

 

They are very fun to drive. I have enjoyed mine a lot. It is a great work
vehicle. Super large flat-bed.

 

As for the heat, I got mine working, it was missing some duct connectors. I
recently put some bubble foil insulation at the area above the pedal pan.
I'm not sure if this works too well, as I haven't really driven it much in
this weather. I try to avoid the salt.

 

It doesn't look too bad. I notice that the treasure chest doors still have
their latches/buttons/whatever they are called. Mine are missing, and the PO
put something in that works with a church key. I think they are from the
engine lid of a splittie, at least they look like the engine lid thing from
my spilttie. I've looked for these for a long time, they are very rare, and
therefore pricey.

 

Do you have a spare tire contraption in the treasure chest area? I saw one
once, that was an original. I have been looking for something so that I
could fabricate a replica. They don't look that complicated, and I know some
metal workers in the area. If I could just get an original to copy!

 

Enjoy your new friend.and take good care of it.
