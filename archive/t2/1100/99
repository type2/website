So I finally got the new engine in and running last week. Ohhappy day! 
I come
back today and bolt on the exhaust manifolds/heat
exchangers ($for sale, btw)
then go to start her up. Turn the key, I have power
and I hear the fuel pump.
Go to startb& A short turn, cough like she was going
to start, then nothing.
Literally nothing. No dash lights. No fuel pump clicking.
Key off. Try again.
No power. I go back to the engine and see the #3 wire has
popped off the cap;
put it back on but it still feels loose so I adjust it. Not
that the wire
would cause the issue but itbs odd that it was off. 
So now I canbt find
the cause of my new electrical issue. Battery is brand new 
and tests full
voltage and the fuses look fine. I crawled around and looked for the 
obvious.
I do have a volt/ohm meter but admittedly not fullyversed on its uses.
So,
uhb& help.

Thanks,
