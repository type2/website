Damn that is a good tip Jamie on working through the signal lights.  2-3 pop
rivets and away you go.  I've never personally had luck walking them out from
the outside and having them still work tightly for reuse (which as I'm cheap
of course I tend to do.)  I've gotten em out without killing the paint, but
they never seem to work tightly to me after I've done em that way.  Any way
you go the point is very accurate, you have to "walk them out" a bit with a
rocking side to side wiggling motion, even when using pliers, but particularly
when using scredrivers from the back.
 
I miss the damn special pliers I had though, stole em from dad at some point
as he didn't use them, were some special old forged AT&T set from the 60s that
they used to adjust some relays or something, but were exceptional for this
job and for pulling off valve guide seals on inline 4 cylinder VW's and
others.  I'll never find another set like em I'm sure.
 
YMMV of course.
