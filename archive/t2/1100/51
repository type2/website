Subject: Tire Chains, Busses, and Snow...

Chain installers, last check, were $25, but for bigrigs I think it was like
$15 a wheel...  It's not hard once you've done it once or twice, but its best
to practice BEFORE you get to the hills.  And READ THE INSTRUCTIONS when you
put them on - installing them backwards (yes, you can!) can cause them to come
loose, causing unloving damage to your baby!!!

Caltrans forces (California
DOT) are there to assist CHP with the closures, and to assist making sure
vehicles who go past them have the chains they are required, NOT to assist
putting on chains.  The installers wear vests with something like "Chain
Installer" and actually have a registration number now.  It's gotten pretty
tight and competitive - probably too many people either getting hurt, too many
chains coming loose and breaking vehicles, or people holding drivers hostage
for exhorbant sums of money...

Here's our blurb on chain controls - it's an
Acrobat (PDF) file, but it's what we (and CHP) use to determine if you're OK
to pass.

On our busses, you
need chains on the rear wheels, and GO SLOWLY!!!  While it's not required to
have them on the front, some folks chain all 4 just to have that bit of extra
traction.  

(BTW - I work for Caltrans,our office does both Emergency
Operations and Snow and Ice.  Pretty kewl gig...  (giggles) Just heard the
guys lifted chain controls near Big Bear, it WAS a snowstorm and a half!!!)

When I
aquired my 74 camper, it came from Long Beach California to Ontario
Canada,
and was being offered for sale here.
What I found strange at the time,,, was
the bus came with tire chains!

When I lived in Big Bear, CA, coming up the mountain from San
Bernardino there
would be a CHP parked in the middle of the road at a
pullout, not letting you
buy unless you had 4wd or chains.

The pullout was often populated with a
bunch of young guys who would
install your chains for you ... For a price. $15
when I used to live
there, probably more now.

Depends on how close you are to
a populated area I suppose.
