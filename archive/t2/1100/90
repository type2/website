Subject: Re: [T2] Steering column part

1974 is a transitional year on steering column, steering wheel and steering
lock parts.

Up thru VIN 2x4 2164 059 they only had a bearing in the steering column
tube, 211-415-585 A and VW obsoleted this way back in December 1988.

From VIN 2x4 2164 060 thru 1979 model year, there are two bearings, the one
noted above and one above it in the steering lock assembly, 211-415-585 B.
VW obsoleted this bearing just a few years go.  A quick check with a contact
in Germany has turned up zip, nada, nothing on both part numbers.

So it looks like the only chance for this is going to be a boneyard on this
bearing.  Might wanna check with Busted Bus, they might be able to help.
