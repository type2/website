Subject: Riviera pop top questions (safety?)

If anyone is still following with an ASI Riviera...
 
I'm going to go look at one this afternoon, '72 presumably, though the current
owner does not realize that for sure.  From the poor distant pics, looks like
it may actually have a '72 Westy interior with the ASI top (which I've seen
several times though I don't know if they have been converted hardtop westies,
or entirely homebrewed conversions) though it is in a single tone blue bus? 
Anyway the question is this, assuming it is a "factory built" ASI conversion
and top, what is the quality like on these with the top.  Any strengthening of
structure, or just a hole hacked in there.  I'm sure this has been dealt with
before, but I'm too lazy to search (well I did a cursory search of the
archives and samba, then got lazy) so I'm looking for opinions.
