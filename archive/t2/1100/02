Subject: What do I need....long distance travel!

Sorry,  I "prooly' arrive after the fact..but..I drove a "Captain Hook",
.."westy from here in BC Canada, across America, then up to the maritimes,
then back through Canada, and back home,..and the only thing that 'expired'
was the turn signal "switch" in Buffalo!  I see all of your 'prepares',..but
maybe ..sometimes..we just have to BELIEVE..these buses are going to get you
there and back..based on the VW Factory'engineers'!
