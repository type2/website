Sounds like you live in the Peoples Republic of Colorado.  I  passed with flying colors in TN without changing anything.  Good  luck...KR

allowed is 3.00%. We pull around to the parking lot, turn the mixture screw
2 turns, and get back in line. CO: 1.06% LOL!

Pulled back into the parking lot, turned the screw back to where it was, and
drove merrily to the DMV.

After waiting at the DMV for a while, we finally get called up. After going
through all the paperwork and everything, the lady says I can't register in
that county because I live in a different county! ARRRGGHHH!!!
