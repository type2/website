Subject: Re: Retractable seatbelts

 I am starting the installation of retractable seatbelts in my Bus.  Everything seems straight forward except for the mounting Ell.  I assume that the Retractor goes on the inside and the Lap belt metal plate goes on the outside, all held together by a bolt.  But...  Isn't the lap belt metal plate supposed to swivel?  A picture would help.
