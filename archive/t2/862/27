Get one of those tread depth gauges or use the depth function on a run 
of the mill slide "micrometer" and measure your NEW tire tread depth.
If you are overinflated  the wear will be more in the center- ie, when 
you finally go to a baldy,  the center tread will be gone before the 
sides.  Just the opposite if underinflated- then sides wear more 
quickly.  Wear depends a lot on weight applied- ie do you carry a lot of 
people or ladscape stuff, or are you alone?  As I recall, when alone, I 
only needed 35 psi in the rear or I got more center wear.  If never a 
passenger in front, then 28 was OK for neutral wear.  Thing is, check 
the depth again after 10K miles!
