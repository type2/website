Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Temp Gauge Query

Greg, Before you install it, try it in the oven. I used a 
oven temp gauge and put the sending unit in the oven. I 
then took notice that my VDO gauge is 75* HOTTER than 
actual temp. The oven and oven gauge would be together and 
the VDO was off. I've noticed that other volks had this 
same situation. Test it before it makes you pull over a 
bunch of times just to say..."The dipstick says I'm fine." 
You can mark where you consider too hot and wtch that 
marking then.
