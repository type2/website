Kinda looks plain and vanilla to me.  The least the guy shoulda done was to
shoehorn a 911 engine in the back with double stingers, wheelie bars, better
paint color(s) and Fuchs wheels similar to what Dennis Rose did back in the
days of the Bug-Ins circa late 70s thru 1984.  Then it WOULD be fun to own
and drive.

Gee, I miss those days (sigh)
