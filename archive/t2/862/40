From John C:

About 5 years ago I found something called the battery minder. In my opinion
this is one of the best things for battery life I know of.
<snip>
Anyway I like this Battery minder so much I bought one for my bus. One of
the things I like most about it is that you hook it up plug it in and forget
about it. It wont fry your battery or overcharge it and boil all the water
out of it. It brings it to a full charge and then maintains it for as long
as its hooked up. Anyway just two cents from someone who didn't like
replacing an 80 dollar deepcycle battery every two years....
