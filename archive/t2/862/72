Whats funny is there are stereos that will fit but they don't advertise the
fact. I've had stereos that were way too sloppy in a standard DIN opening
and would probably work wonderfully in a bus. So someone's doing it...

Another option is mounting brackets under the dash to hold the stereo. Holes
drilled would be hidden. Then you just have to have a block-off plate for
the existing opening.
