Subject: CD player that actually fits into VW dash?

I've had to cut dashes before in my Bug and my Bus, but this time, I'd like to
go without doing that if possible. Does anyone know of a brand/model/website
of a CD/Radio that WILL fit into the stock 77 Baywindow VW dash hole? I'm
tired of hacking these collectibles up.
Thanks,
Courtney
