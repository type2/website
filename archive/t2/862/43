Subject: Re: [T2] auxiliary battery

I picked up a deep cycle battery and it cost me about 10$ more than
a starter. Do some good shopping around because I have drained my
auxillary battery 'alot' not once or twice but many times.

Just my thoughts.

*************
it was said.... it doesn't pay to get a deep cycle.  Deep cycle batteries 
cost a
lot and don't have long warranties like starting batteries.  Starting
batteries don't have as much capacity and don't like to be completely
discharged, but most camper users don't come anywhere near completely
discharging their batteries....
