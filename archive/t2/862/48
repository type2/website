Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Temp Gauge Query

Hi Bob,

This gauge came from the cluster in a GTI. I got it as part of a set  
with a voltmeter and an oil pressure gauge. The + connection is not  
for the light, the light bulb socket is separate from the other three  
connectors.

Justin: The taco plate sender is already installed in the bus and I'm  
not draining the oil just to throw it in the oven. I am not really  
concerned about the exact numbers I get from this gauge so much as  
being able to see trends in the data.  One of the tools I plan to  
purchase in the near future is a infrared digital thermometer which I  
plan to use to calibrate my gauges.

And are you certain your oven is right?  I know that my mom's new  
oven is off by about 75 degrees compared to the one she used to have.  
Best way to tell for certain about a temp is to use boiling water,  
and even then you have to correct for altitude.


Happy trails,
