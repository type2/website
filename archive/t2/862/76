Subject: 77 Passenger Area Floor

Hi all, I am new to this list. I have been reading through the
archives trying to find a solution, but to no avail.

Here is the situation:
I have a 77 bus that I picked up a few weeks ago. I've gotten it
running and in shape so that it will pass IM and I can get it on the
road. There are some serious rust problems however. I am using WBwest
and busdepot.com for my sheet metal parts and they seem to stock most
of them so I don't anticipate too many problems. The big problem I
have is the floor, it has rusted out almost entirely through the outer
sections and the previous owner patched it with sheet metal and
silicone grease that isn't doing the job.

My questions are these:
How have you with this problem solved it in the past?
Will the cargo floor section available at busdepot.com work to patch this?
I noticed that the floor is corrugated, I assume for strength. If I am
to weld 1/8 steel to patch the floor, will this be adequate?
The rust has almost entirely separated the floor from the driver and
passenger seats, what method should be used for patching this gap?

Thank you all for your time,
Brandon
