Hey guys.  I looked in the archives and didn't find the  answer.  I got my Hancooks today.  17 days after I
ordered  them!  The plate on the steering wheel says 185 SR 14  Reinforced.  Front pressure....30 PSI,
Rear...40 PSI.  But  the tires say 65 PSI.  I've never had a 65 PSI tire before!   So what is correct?

65 is the max pressure you can put in that tire, NOT what you should run it at.

Larry Chase on the Vanagon list made a good website on tires:
http://www.roadhaus.com/tires/guideline.html

In it, he says the 30 and 40 specs were for the reinforced sidewall tires. I agree with that :)

He shows tires that were OEM on Vanagons and Syncros:

185R14C  6PR
- Min Load Index 99
- Max Load 1710 lbs
- Min Load Range C
- Max Inflation 55 psi

and

205R14C 6PR/8PR
- Min Load Index 109
- Max Load 2270 lbs
 - Min Load Range D
- Max Inflation 65psi

For these, he recommends 50 psi minimum. [all the way at the bottom]
