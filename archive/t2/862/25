>Hey guys.  I looked in the archives and didn't find the  answer.  I got my Hancooks today.  17 days after I ordered  them!  The plate on the steering wheel says 185 SR 14  Reinforced.  Front pressure....30 PSI, Rear...40 PSI.  But  the tires say 65 PSI.  I've never had a 65 PSI tire before!   So what is correct?  Thanks and cheers...KR

That was the spec for the sidewall reinforced (SR) tire that had a maximum inflation of 40 psi.

You'll have to inflate the new tires differently (liekly higher).

Someone with those tires I'm sure will chime in with a good recommendation. After you apply it, draw a chalk line across the tread and part of the sidewall on each tire to see how much of the tread is contacting the payment as you drive normally. That will tell you how appropriate the recommendations you receive will be.
