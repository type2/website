Hi Karl -
Impressive! It seems you're quite famous for being able to find hard-to-find
parts :) Would you be willing to sell one of your distributors to me?

Jim asked, "You never indicated why you need one.  Is yours shot, missing or
????"
My mechanic (I had to stop working on the bus myself for a while, when my
now-5-month-old son was born) told me that the vacuum advance was shot, and
that the timing wasn't advancing. He recommended replacing the whole
package, rather than simply the vacuum element of it. I'll chat to him
tomorrow to get more information.

I'll check for the part number that you mentioned as well.

Thanks all of you for your help! You've really made my day with all of this
information :)
Mike.
