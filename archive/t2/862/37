From John C:

About 5 years ago I found something called the battery minder. In my opinion this is one of the best things
for battery life I know of.
<snip>
Anyway I like this Battery minder so much I bought one for my bus. One of the
things I like most about it is that you hook it up plug it in and forget
about it. It wont fry your battery or overcharge it and boil all the water
out of it. It brings it to a full charge and then maintains it for as long as
its hooked up. Anyway just two cents from someone who didn't like replacing an
80 dollar deepcycle battery every two years....

Horrible Freight sells this one. Works very well and is reasonable when it is on sale:
