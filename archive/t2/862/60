Help!  My White 78 VW Westy was stolen last night from the  
underground parkade of the Holiday Inn Howe Street in Vancouver.  It  
has orange,green, yellow plaid seats and has a distinct West coast  
motif painted on the spare tire cover.  The license is BC 273 HAR.   
If anyone spots it, I would appreciate hearing from you.  Thanks  
Rhonda in Victoria, BC
