Why non walkthrough only?  Also, the spare tire in the 71 Westy went in 
the rear (I covered the hole and hung it on the front).
Back in the days of pre- marriage, I did this to our 71 Westy with 
walkthrough.  Made for cozy driving (-8
You can modify it to take the 2 person seat- (not sure where I got 
it-splitty?)- it involved 2 HD hinges along the front mounted to the 
seat pedestal top, and a slot cut into the pedestal left rear to accept 
the sear bottom bar- slipped right in.  Thus it could be lifted up to 
store stuff underneath.
