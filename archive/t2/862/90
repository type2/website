Subject: 2-Armed Engine Bench Stand?

So I'm beginning work on my 1800cc engine, but space is somewhat limited.  I
have a workbench I was thinking of putting the engine on, but naturally I
would prefer some sort of engine stand.  Like I said, space is at a minimum
so the rolling stands are right out.  I can't seem to afford the insanely
priced 4/5 armed holders either.  According to ratwell (About the 2-armed
yoke):
"it's just the cheapest version you can buy and while I might mount the yoke
by itself to a sturdy bench I wouldn't trust the welding at those prices."
So does anyone have any experience with the bench-mounted 2 armed yoke?  I'm
still very skeptical..
This yoke does seem to appear in Tom Wilson's book,  but he seems to focus
more on the smaller engines, so I'm wondering if these guys are strong
enough for an 1800cc?

Also, I don't have access, nor the tools to modify a bellhousing..so that
option is out too.
Am I better off just using the bench?
Thanks in advance for the help!
