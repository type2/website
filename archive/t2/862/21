Subject: Re: [T2]  front curtain

You can get a properly sized tension rod just about anywhere - Wally's 
got 'em.  I replaced all of my screws along the seam  there and along 
the panel edge with cup hooks throughout the bus.  Very handy for all 
kinds of stuff, and no defacing anything from original.  Any piece of 
fabric can be hung from the cup hooks.  NOT a robust solution - I use 
'em when I need a temp curtain up front.  But I've been contemplating a 
tension rod for there.  I already use one in the rear of the '79 - 
between the closet and the sink/stove surround, to keep junk from flying 
out from on top of the frig/compressor space.  I've got an ice chest 
that sits perfectly in front of the closet and will hold a case of 
bottled beer and plenty of ice to keep it good for a coupla days.  I use 
the frig for my spares cabinet - tho' I have packed it with dry ice and 
stuff like meat and cheese for 2nd week camping.  On top of that are my 
12v power pack and compressor and some junk du jour.
