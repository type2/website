 I am starting the installation of retractable seatbelts in my Bus.
Everything seems straight forward except for the mounting Ell.  I assume
that the Retractor goes on the inside and the Lap belt metal plate goes on
the outside, all held together by a bolt.  But...  Isn't the lap belt metal
plate supposed to swivel?  A picture would help.
 
Current project: 1972 Bus.
Next project: 1982 Vanagon.
