Subject: oil pressute control valve

hello,
i was able to easily remove and clean the relief pressure valve on the
bottom of my ED code engine but i could not find, see, locate the second
valve.  this valve is known as the pressure control valve in the Bentlys.
Bently shows a side view of the engine with the upper pressure control valve
on the side not pictured.  anyone know where this valve is and how i can
easily get to it?  i'm checking these because of unusually high oil
pressure, though it barely gets over 60 psi even at 60mph+.  this is with
15w50 mobil 1 syn.  the oil pressure gauge is also acting very like a tach.
this has never happened before that i have noticed.

TIA.


jeremiah
