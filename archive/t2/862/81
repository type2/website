Subject: Disc Brake Conversion: Need Hose

I have done a neat little conversion on my 68 DC to 79 Brakes while
retaining the original beam. I am at the last part where I need to connect
the 68 dash mounted Brake Fluid reservoir to the servo-mounted master
cylinder reservoir.

Since the OG plastic tubing is pre-formed, what hose is SAFE to use to
bridge the much longer gap between reservoirs I now have? And is it a FLAPS
part? Anyone come upon this one?

Thanks,

Jon

BTW: This project is looking really nice at about 90% complete. The project
turns one year next week, not bad. Chris at BustedBus has pledged three days
to get me over the final hurdle and get me running. Big KUDOS. Many photos
when that happens!
