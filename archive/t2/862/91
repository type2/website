Subject: Re: [T2] Wiring Harness

Perhaps the biggest reason why Bob (the founder and owner) of Wiring Works
in San Pedro, CA just manufactures the Main Harness for the Bus is that
unlike Beetle, Ghia & Type 3 applications, each year from 1968 thru at least
1975 is *unique* and there were so many differences between the years that
they could not be "grouped" to keep set-up and production charges down to a
level of affordability.  And we all know Type 2 Owners are into stuff being
affordable (cheep is such a derogatory word :).  This wasn't such a problem
with the "Splitties" because as unique as they were, they could be grouped
into a few year spans to keep costs down.  Talking w/Bob recently, he
indicated that if he had produced complete harness kits, they would be in
the $700 to $900 range depending on the year, they are just that different
between them (by his count, there is 68-69, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1974 and
1975 - all unique unto themselves).  Don't blame Wiring Works, blame VW for
changing something everytime someone had a moment of flatulence at the
factory :-)
