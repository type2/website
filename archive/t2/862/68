Ok, the Guac's just showing battery voltage when running. Drops over time.

Brand new Bosch rebuilt alt, several regulators, none made a difference.

I was going over the wiring and discovered the fat red cable from the screw
post on the back of the alt was wired to ground. Shouldn't that go to
battery positive? (Or the terminal on the starter? The cable is actually too
short, I tried it.)

Assuming I'm right on this, what would happen to the alt or the regulator if
it was fired up with that wire run to ground? Are they both fried?
