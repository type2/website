Subject: auxiliary battery

Sorry, I know this has been gone over a hundred times, but I can't find anything on Ratwell pertaining to the subject.
  
  So, I'm going for experience here. What is the best/most suitable  battery to use for an auxilary? I've got the relay kit and am ready to  purchase said battery, but am wondering if some on the list might  relate info about brand, amp/hour rating, size (physical), even brand  names. Sure would help me, as I was in Wally World yesterday scratching  my head over the variety of batts available. Thanks!
