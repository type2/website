Subject: Oil Temp Gauge Query

Hi Volks,

I have a VDO oil temp gauge here that I am interested in installing  
before I go to EveryBus.  There are three wires going into the gauge;  
one is marked as ground, one with a "+" and  one with a G.

Am I correct in assuming this is a powered gauge? I kinda expected it  
would have had a self-powered thermistor like the CHT does.

And finally: Does this gauge care how much wire is between it and the  
sender?


Happy trails,
