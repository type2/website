 Now that Karl has identified that the hose isn't
 used as OE, where can I
 find extended "clear tubing that is close to 1/2"
 ID"?
 
 If the Bug stuff works, then I really don't care.
 Hopefully the judges at
 the shows won't mind. :)

1/2" is 13mm...... that is the ID, inside diameter.

The blue hose is 7mm ID, inside diameter. 

In all likely hood, the blue stuff will almost fit
inside the bus reservoir nipples. 

The clear plastic tubing IS OE!
