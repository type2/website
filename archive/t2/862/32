 Hello, 
 Has anyone ever used an Absorbed Glass Mat (AGM)
 Battery?  A few guys I know 
 with sail boats use the gelled type (safety
 reasons).

Mercedes uses them and they fail quicker than the old
style batteries. When they die, they die instantly. No
warning, no nothing! And you cannot test them with a
standard carbon pile load tester or you will warp the
plates. You have to test them with a Midtronics
tester.
