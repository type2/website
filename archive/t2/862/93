      I don't know if they sell a comparable product
 at the flaps, but I know 
 this hose is specifically for brake fluid.  I also
 don't know the size of 
 your plastic lines, but this is 7MM hose, and CIP1
 lists it for 68-71 buses. 
   BD and other vendors sell it too, I just linked to
 CIP1 because it has a 
 picture, here's bus depot:

That stuff is for bugs. Buses use clear tubing that is
close to 1/2" ID.
