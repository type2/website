Subject: Re: [T2] attaching wire to distributor points' plate

Jack asked:

I'm entering new territory, for me at least.
I'm disassembling a stock distributor to learn more about how it
works and how to restore it.  The points' plate is grounded to the
distributor body via a short braided wire.
How does one reattach this wire at either end. The last time I tried
 to solder to steel, I had no success.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Either spot weld or silver solder. Regular solder isn't going to happen.....

Better choice is to find a piece of junk distributor and grab the breaker plate out of it. [and no, a 009 will
not work even though they are pieces of junk :)]
I have lots of good and bad dizzys laying around here.
