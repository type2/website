disadvantage in using a Beetle style ( pea shooter) muffler

My old 71 had a beetle muffler. The bumper wasn't on the bus when I got it but
I was (unlike some peoples buses apparently) able to get the silencer pipes to
clear the bumper, although they were touching.

You can do this in a pinch, but I an attest to the problem with exhaust coming
into via the rear hatch seal. The aerodynamics are such that it will get
sucked in, that is why the muffler for the bus spits it all out the side. If
you can't cough up the cash for a new bus one, atleast make sure your hatch
seal is in great shape so you don't breathe exhaust.
