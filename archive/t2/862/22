Subject: tire pressure

Hey guys.  I looked in the archives and didn't find the  answer.  I got my Hancooks today.  17 days after I ordered  them!  The plate on the steering wheel says 185 SR 14  Reinforced.  Front pressure....30 PSI, Rear...40 PSI.  But  the tires say 65 PSI.  I've never had a 65 PSI tire before!   So what is correct?  Thanks and cheers...KR
