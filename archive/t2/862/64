Hi.

Ron Salmon is selling 19mm black lug nut caps for the 68-79 bus.

http://busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=1111006BK

Unfortunately, there are only 16 caps for the 20 nuts...

I figure that if I can get -3- more people interested in paying $5 for 20,
instead of $4 for 16, I could get Ron to split a package and make -4-
packages of 20 from -5- packages of 16.

Are you interested in making a committment??
