I had an opportunity to get back to the bus today.  I checked the valves
which were in spec, set the the static timing to about 7 degrees btdc. 
The points were fine.  I started the engine and used the small idle window
to respray all manifold connections with carb cleaner, no changes or signs
of leak.  Once the engine began to warm up and stalled, I started it again
and kept in running with my foot on the gas for about 5 minutes.  I
purchased my own new compression gauge today, compression is only 95-100
all the way around.  I cranked the engine jumped to my running car's
battery as the bus' is weak.  Around this time the garage owner notice I
was there and came out to see what I was up to.  He has no problem with me
stopping by and fiddling.  I told him the compression results, he thinks
this is the cause of my no-idle situation.  Then he offered to do a ghetto
leak down test.  No guages just pressurize and listen for leaks.  You can
definately hear some hiss from the oil filler but more compelling perhaps
is that I seems like you can hear hiss from between the heads and
cylinders.  We're going to remove the tin so we can get a better listen. 
Any thoughts?  This was a supposedly new GEX 1600 sp long block, which had
no tell-tell signs of prior use but did sit around for a few years.  These
Kias are starting to look good.... Thanks for all replies and the kind
words and encouragement.
