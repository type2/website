Subject: RE: [T2] Disc Brake Conversion: Need Hose

I think this is what you need:

     I don't know if they sell a comparable product at the flaps, but I know 
this hose is specifically for brake fluid.  I also don't know the size of 
your plastic lines, but this is 7MM hose, and CIP1 lists it for 68-71 buses. 
  BD and other vendors sell it too, I just linked to CIP1 because it has a 
picture, here's bus depot:

Good luck!
