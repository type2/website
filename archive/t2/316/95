Subject: Primer or paint under "Art paint job"?

My daughter has a 75 bus with original red bottom and white top.  We
will deal with minor dents and rust on the roof and nose, priming as we
go and sanding to allow a final primer or base coat.   She wants to have
a white base coat applied (acrylic enamel) and then do various anime art
characters of her own design (rather talented, check out
http://www.mediaminer.org and search under Lithe-Fider)....now the
question is, will acrylic enamels appled to the base coat have any
problems sticking to the dry coat?  I suggested having a white
waterproof primer applied and paint at leisurer over that, but then the
background will have to be filled in also?  Any experts in this area?
