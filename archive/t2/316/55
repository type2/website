Subject: Re: [T2] Is my engine doomed?

As I understand it and based on my experience in 4-5 rebuilds the only 
ferrous metal is going to be in the cylinders, rods, rings, crank, oil 
pumps, etc.

The pistons and bearings are non-ferrous.

The facts that you continue to find ferrous metal tells me that you should 
save your money and buy some books (if need be) and plan on a tear down 
soon. It may save something expensive (relatively expensive). Maybe the 
crank or rod.

Meanwhile that junk is eating at your crank and rods and case. I'd get it 
out and apart.
