The pros are right - the rear brakes need to be adjusted to prevent the condition you describe.  It took me many years of bus-driving (pre type2-list) to figure this out.  My rear brakes seem to need tightening every few months to prevent the soft pedal syndrome, and it's a real annoyance.  One day I'm going to figure out how to install auto-adjusting drums on the rear.

I'm guessing you probably haven't been tightening your rear brakes every few months.  If not, and if you are missing any of those black plastic plugs in the shield, your adjusting stars are likely frozen and may require disassembly and maintenance before you can adjust the brakes and firm up your pedal.  That has been my experience anyway.
