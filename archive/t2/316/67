how is the timing? Just to make sure, you need to roll the engine over
to TDC. Pull the valve cover to verify it actually is TDC on #1. Both
valves should be closed. Actually while I'm thinking about it, have
you checked all the valve clearances? Anyway, with the engine at TDC
on #1 pull the distributor cap. The it should point roughly toward the
back (I believe it's 12 degrees turned toward the passenger side).
Also look to see if the mark on the distributor body is near this as
well. It's far from optimum, but at least with timing verified at TDC
it should start.

If the timing checks out, does it try to start w/ the throttle open?
If so it might allude to a clogged idle circuit.

I believe so. I have had run in the 80's all around
