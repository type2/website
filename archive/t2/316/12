Okay, so what about those things that are truck only...Didn't this start
as someone looking for information on a single cab?  How do the trucks
(sc's and doubles) differ from the vans in manners that aren't at first
obvious (Um,well, let's see, there's a truck bed behind the cab...).

like:
-rear corners around tailights are squared and nort round like the buses,
-engine venting through side louvers above rear wheels - is this the same
for every single cab year?
-is there a sc/dc expert out there?
