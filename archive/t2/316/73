George,

Amen on $100 bills.

I stopped at the local VW/BMW dealer before christmas to pick up
some "old" vw parts that actually fit my 78 and listen to the service 
manager explaining to an "older"(retired) couple why it cost
$175  to get their oil changed....you know..6 qts of synthetic, a 
filter...and 30 minutes of BMW mechanic time.

I was so embarrassed for all of them that I left as soon as I had my parts.

It reminded me of a guy that bought a Porsche 911 turbo more than a few 
years ago....the "make ready" charges were almost $6,000....I guess the
more you pay, the more you *will* pay for oil changes.

Makes me like my bus all the more!!!

Cheers, dave
