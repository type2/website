My mind is a terrible thing to waste.  I'm sure
this thread has been a comedy of error to the
rest of you.  It been awhile for a T4 rebuild for
me.  Am I reading this right?  The discontinued
OEM style gaskets were between the cyl and the
head.  And they failed apparently.  

The shims were between the cyl base and the
case--meaning the seal should be metal to metal. 


Now is consistent with my memory, but my memory
has already failed once in this thread.  

Dr. Tim?  Raby?  Mark?  Rivers?  Anyone who has
or did make a living at rebuilding these?
