Subject: Re: [T2] 68 only?

Forgot another one:
?) Westies. The pop top front hinges are 68 only. Yes,
they resemble the 69-72 tubular ones but they differ
where they mount to the pop top. Countersunk screws go
up thru top bracket into the wood frame.
69 and up use carriage bolts thru the top, down, with
nuts on the flat bracket. The holes in the 68 hinge
are made countersunk, 69 up are flat.
68 was the only year that used a vinyl 'gasket'
between the hinge and roof. 69 up was metal-to-metal.
