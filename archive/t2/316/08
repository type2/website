Subject: fuel injection problem

I just finished installing my 2.0L federal emission
engine back in my 79 Westy and everything is good
except that there is no charge getting to the #4
injector. I did a continuity test on both of the wires
from the injector end to the computer plug in end, and
it all checks out good. 

Anybody have any ideas??
