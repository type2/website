Subject: Re: [T2] fuel injection problem

Hi Chuck,
    The national system has 4 fuel injector voltage dropping
 resistors, one for each  injector. Your system  maybe has
 a bad resistor, wire, or connection where the cable plugs
 to the resistors.  My the way + battery power originates 
at the resistor block.  The ecu grounds the fuel injectors 
to activate them.
