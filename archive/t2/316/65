Subject: 1700 Will not start help

I am trying to get the 1700 engine in this old 72 deluxe fired up, so far no luck. Here's what I have checked:

Spark-Yes at coil and at plugs

Fuel-Yes poured some in carb and even put a drop or 2 in the spark plug hole, fule pump IS pumping.

Power to: Idle cutoff solenoids, choke, all confirmed.

Engine cranks over but will not fire.

Compression checked out at #1=80, #2=70, #3=60, #4=70, Yes they are low, but it should still be able to start, right??

Alright, guys & gals, help me out here. What am I missing? I am pretty infamiliar with the pancake engine, so any suggestions??


Peace, John Baker
