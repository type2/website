I asked the guy about retorking the heads but he said that I couldn't 
because of these metal gaskets.  He did say they weren't really gaskets 
per say, but some metal, possibly shims, that had blown through.  I got 
this bus shipped here from a used car lot in Cal. It was in 5 year old 
car shape with less then 100,000 miles on it.  The engine has never been 
rebuilt so any thing factory is still that way.  I also am not sure the 
guy said to replace the gasket, it could be just to remove them.  The 
cylinders can not be retorked while these are there.
