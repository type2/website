Subject: [T2] Vacuum lines unclear

The temp piece--
http://www.a2zautoforums.com/showthread.php?s=&postid=12245#post12245 --
seems to mount in the block on top at the base of cyl. 3 right were the tin
ends. from the fit of things, I would say that the mystery hose from the Y
in the pipe going to the brake booster goes to this temp switch (mystery
part) and then the EGR valve. Not to say this is correct, but it appears
that it was connected this way in the past.

Now, I am not sure of where to connect the vacuum retard from the
distributor?
