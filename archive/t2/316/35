Mark,

My bad I guess. If you look at the linked picture you will see the nipple to
which I am referring, which is between cyls 1 & 2. It serves the same
circuits as you indicate - fuel pressure regulator and decel valve. I have
also circled where the retard nipple should be.

Now, given that your plenum seems to be different, perhaps the vac routing
is different too. But the way I understand how the retard work, it should
not have manifold vacuum, it should have ported vacuum form the throttle
body leading edge.
