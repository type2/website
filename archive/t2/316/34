Water is hydrogen that has already been burned.  Neither the hydrogen or
oxygen will do anything to the combustion process as they are already
strongly combined with each other.

The purpose of water injection is to absorb the energy spikes that cause
detonation.  This allows the use of much greater compression ratios or
boost in racing engines.  Unfortunately, the energy lost by flashing the
water to vapor is not recovered as power.  For racing, you don't care
about the extra fuel used, but this is not acceptable for street use.
