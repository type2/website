Having had self-adjusting drums on other vehicles, I prefer to adjust
myself.  It is easier to do an adjustment every few months than it is to
try and troubleshoot and repair a self-adjuster that isn't working.

There seemed to be an expectation that the VW owner would pay attention to
maintainance.  Little touches like small oil capacity, manual valves, etc.
seem to give that impression.  A visit to your friendly VW dealer for
regular service would get all these things checked and adjusted and it was
actually economical to do it this way.  These days it seems to cost a
C-note to take a modern car into the service bay and several more C-notes
to remove it regardless of the work done!
