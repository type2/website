Subject: Horn wire long shot question

Hello,

While horn wiring questions have come up on the list from time to time, and
there's been some discussion on how the replace horn wiring, would anyone
have any quick tips on an easy way to get at the wiring at the base of the
steering column?

I have an irritating short in my horn wiring in my '74 Campmobile at the
moment ( it's set to drive in some Asian cities I've been in, the horn goes
off automatically when the wheel is turned, reminds me of Kathmandu, Delhi &
Agra WITHOUT the atmosphere that made it worth going there ;^).

We've fixed the wiring at the top of the column ( interesting connections
made by Electrician PO ), so it would appear the short is that the base of
the steering column. A quick look seems to indicate it will be a major bitch
to fix down there, but I would be QUITE happy for someone to come back and
say, "don't be stupid, you just do .......".

Any quick suggestions, or is it the difficult job I think it is?

Thanking you in anticipation.

Regards,
