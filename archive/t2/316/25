I don't think this is right. I think you mean the vacuum nipple between cyls
1 & 2? Regardless, the retard does not connect to this port. The retard
signal comes from the rear of the throttle body off a port that is opposite
the the advance signal port. A FI bus with a dual vacuum (advance and
retard) distributor should also have two vacuum nipples on the throttle
body. The retard port is difficult to see, and it is almost impossible to
install a hose on this nipple with the throttle body attached to the plenum
- I'd unscrew the throttle body to get the hose on, unless the engine is out
of the bus. There is no tee in this line, it runs from the throttle body
direct to the distributor, at least on my bus ('79 CA) this is correct as
shown on the engine door sticker. Other years may differ.
