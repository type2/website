A 5,000lb Vanagon Westy?  Day-am!

I just posted this to the TDI-conversion list this morning so I don't even have to retype it:

I think you already know this but in case anyone else is not aware, that is Gross weight.  Subtract the one-ton cargo capacity and the base vehicle weight is around 3300lbs.  Add a couple hundred for Westy/camping equipment and you have the true Net or curb weight of the Vanagon, about 3500lbs.

There are lots of people running around saying they have 5000lb+ vanagons.  They all looked at the sticker in the door but did not understand what it meant.  They all have ~3500lb Vanagons.

All weights I just described are U.S.lbs, divide by 2.2 to convert to kilograms.
