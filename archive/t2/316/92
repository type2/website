Subject: GE redline

What is the red line for the GE engine? The original rev limiting rotor
(04016) is rated for 5400pm but many of the images I've seen of tachs in VW
busses have the redline set to around 4200rpm and this is the same maximum
engine speed I manage to attain under load (in gear). In neutral I can rev a
little higher in the mid-high 4000's so I'm wondering if the rev limiting
rotor really only protects overrevs at idle.
