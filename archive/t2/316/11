Subject: Fuel injection problem

Original message********************************

 I just finished installing my 2.0L federal
 emission
engine back in my 79 Westy and everything is good
except that there is no charge getting to the #4
injector. I did a continuity test on both of the
wires from the injector end to the computer plug in
 end, and it all checks out good.

all 4 injectors fire at the same time, so try
 switching wires between #3
 and #4 and see if the problem is the injector or
 the trigger circut
******************************************** 




 Did that, and when I do the 'pull each dist wire' to
 test which cyl is the problem, the problem cyl moves
 to the other cylinder.
 My thought is maybe the resistor pack on the
 firewall.

 Could I bypass the resistors for a short time to
 test?
Anyone on the list ever done that??
