Actually it came OEM but a later service bulletin recomended removing
them & making up the difference in deck height with spacers under the
cyls. But to do this fix you will have to remove the cylinders since I
haven't ever seen a split spacer. But depending on your decicion
either replace the gaskets & retorque the heads or remove both & use
the spacers to keep the CR the same.
