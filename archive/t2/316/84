Leave the sealing ring out and have the heads cut with a step of the same
dimensions. Then lap the cylinders into the heads with valve grinding
compound, having first lapped each cylinder on a piece of thick glass. You
will get an excellent seal with this technique. A carbon buildup occurs at
the step which helps to create the seal.

Raising the CR might well make the engine run cooler. The stock CR on a late
bay bus was way low by any standard, but that is another story altogether.

The head "sealing rings" or gaskets are a potential source of head leaks.
The ones in most gasket sets are zinc plated steel. Steel is too hard to
deform enough to seal, and it introduces a dissimilar metal into the sealing
surfaces - cast iron/steel/aluminum. The three metals expand and contract at
different rates and it is difficult to get a good seal.

Head leaks are a big problem on type IV motors for a few reasons, one being
that the studs are not centered on the cylinder bores, another being that
the bores are very large, especially on a 2 liter motor. The bulletin to
lose the sealing rings had to have been made in an effort to make the heads
seal better to the cylinders. Copper sealing rings will make a good seal, so
if you want to use sealing rings in the heads, get copper ones, which are
available. The steel ones in the gasket sets are not good for your motor.
