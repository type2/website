I misused the term "racing" here.  Water injection will indeed work on
high performance street engines just as it does on race engines.  It
allows high boost or compression without detonation.

However, the energy balance will still be there,  You are essentially
using some of the fuel energy to boil the water so that energy is lost.
If the injection allows your engine to create 30% more power while
consuming 50% more fuel it will still be a win from a performance
standpoint.  From an economy standpoint it isn't.

The airplanes that race at Reno run tremendous boost ratios and inject as
much water as they burn fuel.  One wing tank is filled with alcohol/water
mixture and the other with fuel.  For ferrying the airplane back and forth
both tanks are filled with fuel for longer range but they cannot use as
much boost.
