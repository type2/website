I'd have to say it's because your gas cap isn't sealing.  I bought a new
replacement cap for my 73 several years ago and it has a rubber gasket that
seals to the filler tube.  This past Summer the seal split and now I spill
gas just like you do.

Anyone know if I can get a replacement gasket or will I have to buy another
cap?
