One solution is to fit a second battery. This is wired to a battery 
isolator or manager.

That means it only charges if  the primary battery is (first) fully 
charged. And, when connecting appliances, no current is drawn form the 
primary battery.

Here in Australia you can buy them in kit form for about $30-40 AUD.

One supplier is:

Another advantage of having two batteries is that you can wire them in 
series and do rudimentary welding.
