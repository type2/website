Bearings aren't magnetic either.

The moving magnetic parts of the engine are the barrels, crankshaft,
piston pins and clips, rods, oil pump gears, rockers and valves, and
distributor drive.

If there is damage, it is already done, so there is little harm in running
the engine further.  Keep an eye on the oil and see if the contamination
level goes up or down.

My guess is that you are seeing refuse from the original failure breaking
loose from the oil cooler and passages.
