Sluggo, and List Types, Yep, a higher output alt. is possible, but a lot of 
work. What I'm running on my ' 78 Westy is the optional 70amp. alt. that my 
local alt. guru built to 90amps using Bosch parts designed for a BMW. Not 
Cheap, and I suspect that the MTBF is gonna be about half that of the stock 
unit, as I've got that Baja thing going on. (i.e.. CDI ignition, too many 
high powered lights, evil Sony sound system, a 750w inverter wired into one 
of the three batt.'s I've got hooked up, on board air compresser, aux. 
eberspacher heater, aux. blower fans that came stock in some of the Oz bound 
and Canuk Type2's, and various other electrical gulping toys...)Also, get 
ready to have to fabricate your own cooling boot for the alt. The 70amp. boot 
has been NLA for a long time. Doable, oh yea, cheap, no way.
