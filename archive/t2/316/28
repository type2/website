The only two nipples I can find on the air distribution box are on the rear left, just behind the pipe to cyl. 4. There is the larger one that Tee's and goes to the brake booster/Decel, and very close to that is a smaller one that goes to the Decel/fuel pressure reg. I don't see any nipples on the distribution box "between" the pipes on either side.

I will remove my throttle body to better search for a second hidden nipple. 

It sounds like VW made changes to these configurations. I will edit the Diagram to match my air distributor as closely as posible and post to my Bus thread at A2Z http://www.a2zautoforums.com/showthread.php?s=&postid=12245#post12245
