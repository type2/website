George,

Your last statement is not necessarily the case.  There are several people 
on the megasquirt list that are using and/or contemplating water injection
while in turbo boost.  One guy has a scirroco that he has it on and is 
using megasquirt along with the water injection to get 199hp out of
his watercooled engine.  It is his daily driver.

Please don't ask me why!  Some of the stuff those guys talk about on that 
list are *far* beyond me in terms of engine mods.  I'm just in it for the 
injection stuff.

Cheers, dave
