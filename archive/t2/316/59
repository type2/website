Wouldn't Vanagon drums do the job (I mean the self adjusting gig?)

Amazing that as late as the end of the 70's a mainstream car manufacturer 
was putting non-self adjusting brakes on a mid-priced vehicle. Especially 
on a "deluxe" vehicle like some of the Westfalias that were equal in cost 
to a Volvo.

Anyone made any progress towards rear disc brakes? I know there was one 
fellow that had done it on a Vanagon .

I'd like to have vented front disc to while I'm dreaming.
