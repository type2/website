the lines are wide, but not very thick.  30 years of corrosion will have
converted some of the metal to oxide which does not conduct well

These grids do not really produce a lot of heat.  they warm the local
glass by just a few degrees, enough to defog the glass if it has become
misted.

If the voltage drop was considerable, then you might have a problem in the
wiring that supplies the grid.  If the wiring has all the voltage drop,
then you won't see much current through the grid.  You really need to
measure the current and voltage and compare to a known good window.
