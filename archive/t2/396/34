Ron, didn't mean to cause any offense towards your products. I've bought
alot of parts from your company without a problem and will continue to do
so. You have the largest selection for the best price 99% of the time. The
seal looks great and seems to be of high quality but just didnt quite keep
the water out the first time.

  This is very possible. They said that there was zero rust in the channel
so that shouldn't have been a problem. This is a strictly aircooled shop
that does service and resto work and is one of the bigger shops locally so I
assumed they knew what they where doing.

  Thats interesting to know. I assumed if it said "German VW"  that it was
manufactured in Germany. Not just shipped from Germany.

Thanks for the info Ron!
