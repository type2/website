Subject: RE: [T2] FRONT Window Defogger Idea?

That's a great idea. It sure beats a system that sprays warm urine on
the windshield. One that note that do make systems that warms the
windshield washer fluid to provide deicing.... and the windshield washer
fluid doesn't smell as bad.

Anyway, the point of this is that it got me to thinking:  Why not put a
defroster grid along the lower 4-6 inches of the windshield.  That would
keep the glass warm enough so the ice wouldn't build up on the wipers
and it
wouldn't interfere with your vision.  Any thoughts?
