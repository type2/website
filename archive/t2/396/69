Subject: Transmission linkage

 Coming to work, I noticed my shifter linkage was looser (and easier to
manipulate than usual, which I was enjoying) until when I shifted into
second it didn't engage.

 I have first, third and fourth (for the moment).

 Where should I start? Front or back? This sounds like linkage to me and
not transmission, unless someone has other ideas.

Thanks for the input, It's raining and I don't want to go under there...
it's dark and wet. *grin*
