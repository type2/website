side
battery tray I noticed a lot of white flakes from the battery. I washed
everything out but still can't figure out why this happens once in a while.

My 78'  Westy has the same battery tray on both sides, I just bought
another plate for the tie down from Bus Depot. I would imagine you could
use one of the plastic marine battery boxes and moutning kits. They use a
piece of nylon webbing and a buckle to strap the box with battry inside
down. This would prevent you from getting any corrosion on the metal. Not
exactly sure what causes the corosion, but I'm sure some of the "engineers"
on the list can elaborate on all of the chemical properties and exactly why
this sometimes happens...
