Subject: Re: [T2] wireing up wrong? [T2]

well the only thing that i can think that i have done diffrent was that i moved the fuel pump...
could the little black wire that5 runs from the fuel pump not being grounded right cause this kind of problem...?

this has blown my mind

the wire for the fuel pump was tightened down before to the engine skirt ....
i have moved it up the engine skirt a bit and moved my fuel filter to the top of the tranny...

igniton coil wires are connected right...
starter well the only thing i can think about the starter wires is that the two plug wires there  are on wrong spot? i might need to switch them..
