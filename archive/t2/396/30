Subject: Re: [T2] windshield seal

Well, I bought the genuine VW seal from Bus Depot which at $19.95 I am
assuming that it was Brazilian. I found a local VW shop that had NOS VW Bus
windshields and had them install the new seal with the windshield. It looked
good but leaked worse than with the old seal. I had to take it back and they
used  butyl rubber around the lower half of the seal, glass and body side,
and havn't had a leak yet. So, I couldn't tell you what the difference is
between the two but as usual the Brazilian stuff just doesn't quite fit
perfect. I'd say go with the German OEM.
