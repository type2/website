Russ,

With my 78, the problem *was* multiple breaks in the grid lines.

They "looked" pretty good until you actually started probing them
with a VOM or looked at them through a magnifing glass.  Multiple
little valleys with no connection.

That is why i ended up doing all of them.

I gently cleaned off all of the oxidation with fine steel wool and then
used masking tape to match(as closely as possible) the lines along the 
original.  Easy to then run a paint line down the middle and wait the
20 minutes or so for it to dry.

The only thing i should have done differently is to use the *really* good
paint type masking tape.  Easy to do while sitting on the porch with your 
favorite beverage and good conversation(with the window out of 
course)<grin>.

Cheers, dave
