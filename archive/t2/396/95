Subject: Combi? and introductions

Just curious, can anyone tell me what a 'Combi' is?  I'm in the
learning stage here, and am hoping to buy a Westy in the near future.
 
The reason I ask is I spotted the following ad in the local 'Magic
Nickel':
1978 VW Combi Van runs but needs work good body
$750 obo
(801) 886-3267 
Doubt I'll be buying this one if anyone wants to call.

By the way, I'm new here.  I'm in Salt Lake Utah (actually a suburb
but its all the same) and am hoping to buy a type 2 westfalia
sometime this summer.  I'm mechanically inclined (used to own a
Jeep...you gotta learn to wrench on those!).  I'm probably going to
try and buy a 'project' level van, the cheaper the better.  Only
thing I'm afraid of is body work :P
Married, son on the way, 2 dogs, into cycling, fly fishing, hunting,
shooting, camping, old and ugly vehicles :P, long walks on the beach
and sunsets.
:)
