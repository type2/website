A friend was pulling his 30' RV behind his Suburban at 70 mph, with a Reese
hitch on it (remember the front wheel drive car commercial where the car was
pulling the RV with the car's rear wheels missing?), when one of the
Suburb's rear wheels failed and separated.  As I recall, this was a regular
tire and not a retread (recap).

The separated steel belt and tread stayed attached to the tire and literally
ate away at the wheel well of the Suburban and beat the fender to death.
The Reese hitch saved them from complete disaster by holding the back of the
vehicle up as he braked to a stop.  It was chillingly amazing to see how the
flailing tire actually beat curved waves into the fender steel, sort of like
the curved waves that you see for an instant on a racing slick when a
dragster takes off from the start gate as the tire catches up to the wheel.

I've heard that "thump" that you mentioned, Terry; and I get away from it as
safely and quickly as I can!

Does anyone know how well a Reese hitch performs on a bus?  Can one even be
installed on a bus?
