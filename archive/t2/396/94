That's correct. I am speaking as an owner of one of these kits. These kits 
only have about half the engineering they need for a factory fit and 
factory function on a VW engine. True that the 911 does not have flappers 
but I'm sure the Porsche factory compensated for that in some way.

The 911 kits need a flapper system and the easier way I've found (not 
actually built this yet) is to create lower tin following the Corvair design.

Enjoy.
