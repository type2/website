Volkswagen to end production of Beetle, says report THU June 5 2003 14:30:36
ET





Stuttgart, Germany (dpa) - German car manufacturer Volkswagen plans to cease
production of the VW Beetle next month, the Stuttgarter Nachrichten reported
in its issue to hit newsstands Friday.

The last VW Beetle will leave the production line in Puebla, Mexico at the
end of July, marking the end of a nearly 70-year history and more than 21.5
million cars, the newspaper said.

At present, only 53 Beetles daily are being produced in Puebla. A VW
spokesman said the production of the car was nearing the end, but the exact
time had yet to be decided.

The last Beetle to be made in Europe left the production lines in Germany in
1978.
