From the factory the only thing that ran off the aux. battery was the
fridge. Everthing else including the front 12v socket and interior lights
ran off the main battery. I'm with you I would much rather have those things
running off the aux. battery. Make sure that both fuses are good to the
control panel. Theres one in the panel itself and an inline to the fridge in
the engine compartment.
