OK, thanks, Tom.

I don't know that the rear window defogger ever DID work, because I had some 
window TINT FILM on the inside, over the grids, and the tint film had a 
metal base to it!!  So, I guess my current got spread out over the whole 
window, and was not concentrated enough to give any heat.


But, boy, those grid line were real hunks ! ! !

It seems that there are grooves in the window glass itself that STILL HAS 
material let in it.  This makes me question, how could a grid line in a VW 
rear window be CUT or BROKEN so as to lose all continuity from end to end??

In the past, I was able to measure voltage at one side of the window, and at 
the other side (down current, so to speak) of the window, and there was a 
real drop in voltage.  [I would have measured 'current' if I had any decent 
concept of electricity]  I imagined that the grid was working somewhere, but 
not generating any heat.

People, please, what two materials am I looking for??  Any chemistry 
teachers out there have access to this stuff.  I will do a term paper on my 
work in return for material.  Or provide comparable reimbursement or swap.
