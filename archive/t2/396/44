Subject: Front torsion arm seal

 I've been unable to get any information from Just Kampers about their front torsion arm seals. All they will say is that "they sell Genuine VW or the best reproductions available".

The part number is JK8271 (repro style numner) and I'm wondering if anyone can say whether or not they fit correctly?

While surfing their katalog, I found some other interesting parts all at reasonable or very good prices.

071 905 225A - 5400 rev limiting rotor (made by Doduco)
211 905 115B - 79 CA Bosch coil
311 953 071 - 72-79 1 pin tail light bulb socket
111 905 261 - distributor o-ring
211 129 651B - oil breather hose 75-79 (the angle seems funny to me).
