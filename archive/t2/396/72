Great article. I didn't realize:

"The easiest way to know if your engine suffers from overcooled oil is a milky
white residue that forms in the breather hoses, and under the oil cap, this is
condensation."

I didn't realize that this was from condensation. I think I need to check my
thermostat, maybe advance my timing a little more...
