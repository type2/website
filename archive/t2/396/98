A Kombi is basically a passenger bus or Transporter as they are sometimes
also called. Try looking here
 http://www.thesamba.com/vw/archives/dic/index.mv  it will give you a good
start on some of the terminology of the VW world.

I have a '78 Westy and love it. It's my daily driver. Once you learn your
way around them they are fairly simple to work on and maintane.
I used to own an '86 CJ7. It was my baby for eight years before I sold it.
Just didnt drive it enough any more to justify keeping it. Got lots of pics
of it and I like to show it off.
