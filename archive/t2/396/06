Here's what scares the hell out of me--especially in the summer
months---

Ever passed a sei on an interstae--or hhave them pass you---and as they
are blowing blowing past you--and as the trailer gets along side of your
vehicle--you here Thump, thump, thump----

Either hit the hooks fast---or do some speeding up, or change lanes
pronto--

This thumping is a cap getting ready to blow of the carcass of his
trailer tire.

Semi trailer tires are usually recapped steer tires that have worn
out--and who knows who or how they capped them--
Even the best --Bandag cold caps--have beeen known to separate in the
heat--

I've seen plenty of damage to the trailer or tractor after a cap has
broken loose---
I have never been hit by one--but it sure scares the hell out of me at
the thought of eating one at speed.

later,

Terry

I backed off--just couldn't see eating a ribbon of a 10.00 x 20 cap at
80.
On the way south-bound to college back in `74 we had a peace of cap
smack our vehicle. We heard the cap pop and almost immediately heard and
felt the impact.
The interesting thing was that the tractor trailer that lost the cap was
on the other side of the divided interstate traveling north-bound, and
that the piece of cap traveled from the far north-bound lane, across the
other two north-bound lanes, across the grass median, across the two
south-bound lanes on our side of the interstate, and THEN hit our
vehicle traveling in the remaining south-bound lane, the piece of cap
remaining airborne during it's entire trajectory.
Very impressive. I'd hate to think what that piece of cap would have
done had we been along side of the tractor trailer. (Makes one
appreciate the US ban on hitchhiking/bicycling on interstates.) After
that experience, I usually choose to avoid driving close behind or right
along side of tractor trailers.
My concern with our bay would be that lovely wide windshield and the
open windows.
