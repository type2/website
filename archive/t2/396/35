   Is it that you really have play in the steering wheel or could it be that
you just have some worn parts in the front end? I had that white knuckle
feeling in the wind and when big rigs passed untill I replaced my shocks
front and rear with KYB's. GR2's in the front and Gas Adjust in the rear. It
made a world of difference in the handling of my Bus. How far do you have to
turn your steering wheel before you get any responce at the wheels? It could
also be worn tie rod ends. What tires are you running? If they are not LT
tires and not inflated to the proper psi that could have something to do
with it also.
