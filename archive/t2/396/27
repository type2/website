Barry,

I did this when I had my rear window out and redid *all* of the
lines.  Seem to work very well although I just got the bus back
yesterday from the painters and have never had a chance to test it.

Resistance seems about right though.

I think the product was made by  frost fighterout of houston.

Took 2 $20.000 kits.

Cheers, dave
