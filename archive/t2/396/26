I found another bolt down plate in a box of parts that came with the bus but
there is no metal tang like the passenger side has.

The battery tray repair panels for the driver side have no mounting like the
passenger side. I have a Genuine VW one from JK but there was only one to
choose from.

Has anyone bought one?

Another question: the owners manual says the aux battery was 45Ah, 54Ah for
the main and 63Ah for the Canadian main battery. Does anyone remember what
group sizes at the time matched each of those capacities?
