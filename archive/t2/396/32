Subject: Loose Steering

Hello,

I've remarked recently that my steering is becoming quite loose.  It is
fine at low speeds, however when I'm passed by big trucks on the highway I
feel the burst of wind will blow me off the road.  It's scary sometimes,
especially on windy days.

Apparently there's a screw that I can tighten that will adjust the play for
the wheel.  I plan on getting under the bus to see if this adjustment will
fix the issue.  While I'm under there, is there anything else I should look
for?  Any advice for setting the proper play for the steering?

Thanks,
Shawn.
