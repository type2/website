Subject: Turn Signals not working!

Hey guys,

	Quick question... my turn signals aren't working properly. When I
signal to turn left, both lights flash on and off (exactly how they would if
I had the HAZARDS on). However, when I signal right, the lights come on and
stay on, but do not flash. I'm guessing this is because of a burned out
tail-light bulb. The hazards work though.

Any idea what these symptoms would be from? A bad relay perhaps?


Thanks,
