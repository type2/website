Hi again gentlemen's,

I think i did figured out where everything goes in regards of my FI 
conversion, but! am missing the left harness of the double relay :-( , 
so i have to make one, not a problem, i can make anything! But, i need 
to know where all the pin/wire goes, Bentley is helping but some 
pictures or explanation from you guys would help 10 times more.

Please take a look at the following link and play! (a lot more dificult 
this time)

I can only say thanks! (or send you a fresh 2003 Canadian maple sirop 
bottle, he he he)

Cheers, Ben
