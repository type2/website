Subject: Insect Screen

Volks,

I am aware of and in fact possess the Westy snap-in insect screen
for my 78's back hatch.
I recall reading many moons ago on this very list that a similar
screen was available for the
sliding door.  Was this an optional item? Everyone and their mom
has old back hatch screens
on Eb(-at-)y and thes(-at-)mba, but I've never seen a slider screen
offered.

Is it one of the holy grails?  Like the late-Bay rear table that
I seek?

Cheers,
