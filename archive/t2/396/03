Seth,

I ordered the Jalousie rebuild kit from GoWesty but have not had the chance
to install them yet. What problems did you have with the glass seals? How
long did it take you? I am trying to figure if I should set aside a whole
day for this project. Any other lessons learned for the next time if the
need comes up?

Thanks
