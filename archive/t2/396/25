Just follow the current pages from page to page. Those numbers are there
only to connect the paths together (they don't exist in the fold-out color
digrams).

A(88d) fuel pump + 
B(86a) terminal 50 starter
C(88y) to 88z
D(85 ) ground on firewall
E(88z) wiring diagram say battery pos. hmmmm....
F(86c) coil to fuse, same side of fuse to DR, other side of fuse to backup
light switch on transmission.
