First off, this may or may not be your steering box. What size load
range of tires are on your bus? This will impace how it handles with
that stuff a LOT! Also worn tie rods ends will cause sloppy handling.
I would jack the front of your bus. Take the wheel that is off the
ground & rock it back & forth the direction it will move while
turning. Do you feel any movement? If so things are worn. Check this.

I doubt it will fix the issue. On my split window bus when I adjusted
the steeing adjuster It didn't help anything, just created a "hard"
spot to turn. I just moved it back out to where it needed to be so the
wheel turned freely. but check out everything else first.
