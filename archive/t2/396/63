Subject: wireing up wrong? [T2]

well i have been home on my day off today enjoying it takeing my time and have dropped the engine and tranny plus have changed the pressure plate clutch disk, and flywheel and seals...

everything weent fine till i was finished..

just worn out plain worn out but i think i wired maybe yeah wired the starter back up wrong??


the big bolt on the starter does it matter what order the wires lay on it before tightening.. thats the only thing that i think i could of done wrong maybe?

does anyone have a set way to do this?
 when i plugged the battery back up it sparked really bad and i heard it click over towards the distribitor ??? maybe the fuel pump???
 not really sire but i knew it wasnt good.....

any thought s or ideas...
the only other thing i did was put new points in !

i changed and put the old ones back in cause honestly didnt know what in the world i did...
been out there all day since this morning early...

thanks ahead of time if someone can pull the rabbit out of the hat for me..?
peace
