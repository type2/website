Subject: Air Breathers on Heads??

Sorry about that gang sent the e-mail before I wrote
anything...oops!!!

So whoever had my 73 transporter before I did clamped
and sealed the two breathers that come from my heads
at the rocker arm assemblies. I'm doing a complete
rebuild and don't know where these pipes were
connected to. He also removed the air injection pump.
So I don't have one at all. What's going on?? Are
there good reasons why he did this!? Could this be the
cause of his blowing a head gasket?
