I have always loved the VW bus because when I was 1 year old my Uncle had a
transporter converted to a camper and  I got to sleep in the pop top. I have
loved camping and the VW bus ever since. In fact when I started looking for
one I knew it had to be a pop top.

Most of my friends when asked if they had ever been in a VW camper before
said yeah, but when I show them the Westy interior they say..oh I never knew
they were like this, I thought they were like a van. Every single one of my
friends said "I have to get one of these"!! Of course none of them have.

When I told my Dad I was going to my first all bus campout he asked me if
everybody just sat around and smoked pot!  Its funny how so many people
think the bus just represents hippies. Not that I mind.

Here is a pic of me in '72 in my Uncle's bus. I am the one in the diapers.
