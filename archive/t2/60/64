Subject: Re: [T2] Front window drain holes??

The water would drain behind the dash and the kick panels.

It could be done but i don't know if it would be better or worse - from a 
rust stand point.

I think VW wanted to believe that their windshield gasket would keep out 
the moisture. maybe it did for a while but when it got old...

They did the same thing on the passenger vent windows (backseat area).
