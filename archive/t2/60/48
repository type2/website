Subject: Knob for inside spare tire cover-why bother?

Heck, put the spare on top or in front, and saw down that protruding
knee bonker spare tire cover to form a door and add hinges and shelves
inside! Made our very used Westy more livable.  See this and a zillion
other mods at:   http://www.geocities.com/mike_benthin

If you must, find a 2" stove bolt of the right threadage and twirl up a
wingnut backwards until it binds.
