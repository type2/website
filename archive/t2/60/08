Subject: Re: [T2] late Vanagon bed in a Bay Window?

 I think the seat / bed assembly will be too wide out of a GL-----better
take some measurements--

A Wolfsburg seat might fit--it's a little narrower.

Later,

Hello List, 
I was wondering if any of you knew if the back bench seat/bed from a
late model vanagon would fit into a bay bus. I have the opportunity to
purchase one locally for cheep. Thanks!
