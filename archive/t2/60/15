Subject: Late Vanagon bed in a bay??

David,

Assuming you do have a 3/4 rear z-bed in the bay already:::

Two segments of the middle seat (two passenger seat) of a Vanagon can be 
grafted onto the two pure wood panels/boards of the 3/4 bay Z-Bed.  You will 
have to take the bay's foam cushions off the z-bed.

1)  Only the foam and fabric/vinyl covering of the Vanagon bottom seat is 
stapled to the wood base of the Z-Bed.  All springs, base, etc are removed 
from the Vanagon seat bottom.  Courage.

2)  The back seat portion (after it is sawed off from the Vanagon base) of 
the Vanagon seat is SCREWED to the pure wood base of the back of the bay's 
Z-bed.  Measure many times before drilling. There is a metal frame around 
the Vanagon back rest.  It is easily screwed (like Bubba Joe's girl friend). 
  The fold down arm rest does stay with
the Vanagon back rest.

If measured and positioned correctly, it will fold out almost like the bay's 
original Z-bed, but it might be 1-1 1/2 inches longer/taller, so the bay's 
back cushion over the engine lid needs to be adjusted each time the new 
bay/Vanagon Z-Bed is unfolded/laid out (like Bubba Joe's girl friend)

It is more comfortable when sitting, but less comfortable when 
sleeping/camping.  If possible, use a salvage yard bay's z-bed for the two 
donor wood panels.  Save your original for recovering or replacement as 
needs have it.  10 minutes to R&R the seat if you have an electric screw 
driver.

(( HEY, I didn't start this thread, but I just want to put it to bed!! Like 
Bubba Joe's . . . ))
