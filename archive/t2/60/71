I think it might be the area.  When I drive my Bus around (I'm 30
minutes -south- of Atlanta) I get strange looks, a couple waves, always
waves from other AC VW owners.  When I drove a Bus up in the Chicago area,
no one ever gave it a second look.  I also remember seeing more of them up
there, which is funny, due to the cold weather and rust.  Go figure.
