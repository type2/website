Subject: Website moved

Hi folks

Just to let you all know that I have moved my website.

Those who have used it for their ignition barrel replacement or scary 
windscreen surround repiars will know which one I mean.

So from now on Spooky's site is at:

http://www.specialpatrolgroup.co.uk

So those that have it still listed as a Lineone address will see just what 
Tiscali have done........

I know that there are one or two links to it from the Type2.com website, who 
do I need to contact in order to get it changed??

Anyway, feel free to have a browse around, there will be a new 'Spooky's 
travels in 2001' section soon.

Thanks

Mike
