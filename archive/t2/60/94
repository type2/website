Subject: Re: [T2] fill a hole and then tap it

I got an idea.. don't know if it's the best,, but try screwing a bolt in
there with thread cutting screws (with larger threads than 3.5mm).. maybe
even put some epoxy in there too to make it hold. let the epoxy dry and then
drill out the hole and tap it.  Maybe that'll work better.

later,
MIke
