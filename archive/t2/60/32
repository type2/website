Subject:  Proposal for new abbreviation: NMD. (fwd)

Volks,

I am forwarding the attached because (a) it's Friday and (b) some of you
may work in systems administration and (c) I think it's an acronym we need
around here as well.

VW specific applications include:

the bus is fuschia below the belt line and yellow above it (NMD);

it was a 9-passenger but the divider was cut down to make it a
walk-thru (NMD!).

NMD's link very naturally with DPO's (dreaded previous owner), of course.

A second proposal would be to include SEP, from the Hitchhiker's Guide
SEP = Someone Else's Problem (with the subtext that it may come back to
bite you :-)

ex: "The tranny used to pop out of fourth, but I sold it to my cousin, so
it's an SEP."
