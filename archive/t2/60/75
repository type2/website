Subject: Tuen singnal switch

To the list,

From what we can figure out I need a turn signal switch at the steering 
columns the brake light still not working.  They have become hard to find. 
This is for a 71 Westy so 68 - 71 will fit.  Anyone have any leads?

P.S. 
The buses are getting few and few in the junk yards.

Thank you,

Chris
71 Westy
