I bought the stainless system that Ron sells as a "system",  it included the 
muffler, tailpipe and all the proper bolts, copper nuts, and gaskets.  I had 
an old one from a 74 that i got the exchangers from...still in good shape, 
with NO RUST!! (This is a big deal as I live in Hilo Hawaii and we get 350+ 
inches of rain a year- thats 30 ft.) I gave it to a freind, and it is working 
on his bus today...I wanted a new one...Ron sells the system for $180...and I 
beleive it is the last system I will need to buy.
