The reason that the windscreen frame rusts at the bottom
is because there are no water drains there.  If you must
use a sealant, apply it to the outside, not the inside.

Another way water may enter the cockpit area is via the
fresh air plenum drain.  To find this drain, remove the
left side kick panel.  There is a plastic accordian tube
from the bottom of the steel fresh air plenum to thru the
floor below the left headlamp bucket.  Sometimes the plastic
tube comes adrift or splits open.  

Good luck,
