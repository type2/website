I don't think it's location.  I live in the Bay Area, and I get the same
silly questions and thumbs up.  One guy asked me if I would overheat
sitting in traffic, since there wouldn't be any air blowing over the
engine to cool it.  
I have a 7-passenger, which I load full for lunch, and its the same fun
ride every time.  They just love it!  I've been at stoplights, and had
people in SUV's lean over and say they wish they had kept their 'VW van'.
 

Gotta love it.
