Subject: How does low oil pr. affect hydraulics?

As owner of a high milage (231,000 mi) engine, all this talk of
hydraulics made me wonder- does anyone know the specs for the minimum
oil pressure needed to make hydraulic lifters function to keep the valve
open as the cam pushes on the lifter?  Ie, if I'm tooling along at 20
psi on a hot day and 250 deg oil temp, is the lift on the valves
insufficient?  Can't say my power is less hot that when warming up. 
However, sometimes (rarely) there can be lifter clatter after you stoip
a hot engine and restart it 15 min later, which I ascribe to thin oil
draining out of a lifter if the little hole in the side faces down?
