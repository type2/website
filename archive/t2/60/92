Subject: Re: [T2] Does the grim reaper drive a bus?

I was involved in a wreck(not my fault) a month ago in my 68 singlecab.
I hit a woman in the backside going about 35-40(at least) although she was
still moving so the impact was probably less.
I wore my belt and am fine, not a problem, .
the truck it pretty beat. nose it smashed, the A pillars are bent but I am
fine.

I wore my belt. a shoulder and lap belt   This is the only thing that kept
my face off of the window and my ribs off the steering wheel.
 I used to belive that crap that it was better to be thrown than be pinned
in the front. But then i was young and stupid.
Wear your belts.
