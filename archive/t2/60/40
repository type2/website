Subject: A few requests... 


I'm looking for a few things (and one bit of information) I was hoping
some folks here on the list might have and would be willing to part with.

All of these are for a 77 westy.

Front table leg (mine is MIA), sink/stove top cover (my veneer is fubar)
and (I know, i'm getting reallly mickey mouse here) the screw nob for the
spare tire drawer (i've never had one so I have no idea what it looks
like)?

Also, I'm looking to replace all the T molding in the westy. I know the
widths i need but does anyone off hand know the depth of the part of the
plastic that goes in the grove? I'd hate to have to router a deeper depth.
