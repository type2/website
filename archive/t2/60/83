Subject: Re: [T2] most excellent fresh-air vent cover

Along the same lines, what do people do about the air intakes to keep snow
from accumulating in the engine bay while parked?  The last round of wintery
wonder left quite a bit of snow in there (always reminds me I need to order
that marine box for the battery).

Remember seeing previously on the list the use of duck tape (yuk) and a
magnetic furnace vent cover.  Any other clever ideas?
