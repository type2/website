(Bruce Maxson should relate)
We used to live up in Syracuse NY where the snow measured as inches per
month exceeds a lot of colder places because of the Lake Effect snow
from the Great lakes- Our 71 bus got us everywhere; we were often the
only ones out camping in winter between there and Rochester and Niagara
Falls.  I remember a run we made to NJ one weekend during a really bad
storm, having to go down a local road (Rt 17) when they closed
Interstate  81- averaged 35 mph, but with chains, chugged along with 15"
on the road surface!  Gottaq get that Ebersbacher out the the ol' 71 in
the woods.......
