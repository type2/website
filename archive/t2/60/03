Subject: List Abbreviations

As I am rather new to this list and to "listing" in general I was hoping
that someone who is savvy could knidly send me a list of the acronyms used
most frequently here. I get some of them like PO, FYI, PITA , but a lot I
have never heard. I dont want to post stuff without knowing the proper
lingo...

Thanks,
