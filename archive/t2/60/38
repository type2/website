If anyone is looking for a complete set of this in near mint condition to have an "original" looking bus for those extra show points, I have a complete system for sale...or trade for some cabinetry/rear table with leg for my 80 Vanagon Westy...

Another semi rare bay item from the vaults of the Denmiester....LOL

Make me an offer off line...it could be yours...

Den.
