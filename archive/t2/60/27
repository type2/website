Richard,

Waht do you mean "stuck"?  If the bus has been sitting while (1), then one
or more of the lifters have lost the oil that keeps them expanded.  As a
result, they are clatter like a flamenco dancer on speed.  They are not
"stuck", they are dry.  They will usually pump up and be fine in 30
seconds to 30  minutes.

Yup, they do.  The rislone is not necessary.

They are not hard to replace, but I sincerely doubt that it is necessary.
Start the engine, let it idle for ~1 minute.  Drive it around (*gently*)
for about 1/2 hour.  If any lifter is still clatering, replace it.

(1) "while" in this context depends on the age of the bus/lifter.  If they
are really old/loose/installed with the drain hole down, then it can be
overnight. Usually we are talking a month or more, tho.
