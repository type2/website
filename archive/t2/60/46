Subject: Re: [T2] Air Breathers on Heads??

Chris:
IIRC, the heads with breather holes were from 914's or VW 411's. Not a big
deal. the hoses went to the air cleaner and ended up dumping blowby back
into the oil bath air cleaner. I've got one of those air cleaners
someplace from a 411, if anyone needs it or just wants to know more. Pmail
me.
