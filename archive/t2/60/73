Must be you're not driving a "cool" bus :) I also have two J**ps; a 
sqaure-headlight Wrongler and a 2WD Grand Cherokee - talk about being 
snubbed by the locals...

Us Bussers should always stick together no matter the model. I saw a photo 
of a Bay on fire on some splittie's website - the caption read "Fortunately, 
it was just a bay." What's up with that?

Guess that's what makes world go 'round though. If we all liked the same 
stuff it would be a pretty boring place.

The people in Atlanta are always nice when they talk to you, just bewildered 
by the camper. In fact, while getting gas the other night, I had a guy tell 
me that my "car" looked pretty good considering it was one of the first VW's 
ever made.
