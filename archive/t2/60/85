The problem, of course, isn't the model - it's the type of owner. Just as 
the cantankerous older gentleman who drives a '49 Buick will snub me if I 
wave, so will the bitter old man who drives a split-window bus. These people 
are Classic Car People, and they're a totally different breed than Bus 
People. There's overlap in ownership, since splitties are fancy antique cars 
whereas my treasured bay is merely an old car; but they're both buses. A Bus 
Person in a splittle will always wave at me.

I find, too, that Vanagon people sometimes suffer from a similar ailment. I 
call them Middle-Age-To-Elderly Campers. They own their buses because they 
like to camp, they're older folks and generally retired or looking forward 
to it. They'll have nothing to do with a young bus enthusiast - they never 
were Bus People, themselves. They simply wanted a relatively cheap 
campmobile. They scorn me as well.
