Dear All.

I bought a pair of these ventilation fans complete with steel covers, three 
years ago, at a local VW Show, in Essex, Great Britain, for a total of £10 
(i.e. about US$14). They were from an early model 1968~79 VW Type 2; having 
steel rather than plastic shrouding.

I suspect they are even rarer over here!

Regards.
