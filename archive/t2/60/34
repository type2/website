Subject: Re: [T2] sticky oil piston

Hi Craig et al,

The oil pressure relief valve at the oil pump end of the case allows cold oil to bypass the cooler - that is the thick oil wont go through the cooler and causes high pressure until it warms and thins.

So if you have very high pressure when cold but it drops when hot I would suspect that relief valve was sticking.

The second relief valve stops the pressure after the oil cooler exceeding a maximum. If this sticks closed then the oil pressure would stay high even when the engine was warm. Also if it was stuck closed then the pressure cannont be relieved via the oiling of the bearings ect as there is simply too much pressure and this will strain the seals at the oil cooler (or even burst the cooler) just as much as if the other relief valve sticks.

In your case certainly check both relief valves - but as your pressure is dropping once the oil is warm it would suggest a problem with the relief valve at the oil pump end of the engine.

Good luck
