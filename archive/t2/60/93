Subject: fill a hole and then tap it

The thread on a  3.5mm bolt hole in my steering wheel is stripped. In an
attempt to fix this, I pushed JB Weld into the hole, waited 24 hours, and
then gently ran a tap into it.  No luck. The first time I inserted the
bolt, the thread gave way.

Can anyone suggest another filler or another way to tackle this problem?

Jack
