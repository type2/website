front doors with no rust at all, good front beam and a perfect dash, =
lots of the westy trim from the inside,axles with cvs, windshield and =
more. I dont want to send it to the boneyard with this stuff. YOU MUST =
COME TO MY HOME IN MASSACHUSETTES AND GET WHAT YOU WANT. If you want it =
all no problem bring a truck. I would like to get some cash or trades =
