Subject:  Headlight /turn signal ????

     I'm among the least knowledgable people on this list, so I don't post a
lot, but like several recent posters, my bus has also had problems with the
blinkers not working and only having high beams but not low beams, and I
think I just discovered the problem.  It was neither the fuses nor the
bulbs, but rather the relays.

     There are a couple of relays which live under the dash whose part
numbers I do not know yet, but when I fished them out and took them apart I
was horrified at how rusty and gunked up they are inside.  It seems my
windshield seal has been leaking directly onto them.

     So now I've got two things to fix!  But anyway, if the fuses turn out
to be fine, check out those relays.
