Michael,  Volks,

I have seen this more than once.  Points seem to come in two varieties and
I do not know whether it is different manufacturers or different specs for
different distributors....

The contact arm on a set of points is always a sheet of metal folded into
a "U" channel.  The direction of the fold can be toward or away from the
center shaft/cam.  If the channel is folded toward the cam, then the
rubbing block must be high enough to clear the "U" and reach the cam -
usually ~1/8"-3/16" tall.  If the legs of the channel are folded away from
the center shaf/cam, then the rubbing block can be very short - usually <
1/16" tall.  More than once (three times!!!), I have come upon (or been in
:-) a dead VW by the side of the road and it turned out that the rubbing
block had simply broken.  The points either closed completely and the
motor died or the engine ran *very* poorly.

I always look and far prefer a short rubbing block set of points, but I do
not know if my luck in finding them has to do with my insistance on Bosch,
the model distributor I have, or if it is random. Any answers out there?
