Subject: rubber hoses in engine compartment

Hi,

As with the rest of my '78 westy, I expect the rubber hoses which 
connect the metal piping for my fuel injection system at the corners 
as it runs around the engine is probably factory.

They do not look like they are cracking and I wonder if I replace 
them, if I am not simply looking for trouble?

VW sold me some hose clamps which you use an older "CV" joint clamp 
tool on to cinch it down.

Is it better to use mini hose clamps or the dealer's hose and hose 
clamps for this job?Alan
