I'll field this one...

Jacki,

First, all caps is considered shouting...  Please don't shout.

A '69 is a good first bus. It has the older upright engine and the later
gearbox.  It's about the simplest bus to work on.

1.) I'd start with the brakes.  The most important part of any car.
Following that, assuming that this bus runs, would be changing both the
oil and the gearbox lube.  For the gearbox, you'll need a 17mm allen
wrench and make sure you remove the fill plug first. (There's nothing
quite as distressing as draining all the lube out then not being to get
the fill plug out to fill it back up again.)  You'll need 3 quarts of
GL-4 gear oil. Do not use GL-5. This is one case where the newer spec
stuff isn't as good as the old stuff.

2.) First, get a copy of John Muir's "How to Keep Your Volkswagen
Alive", commonly known as 'the idiot book'. While what John wrote is not
gospel, it will get you familiar with most of the parts and pieces and
it's a good introduction to basic VW care and feeding.  It's also an
entertaining read. BTW, you should be able to find an early edition in
your local used bookstore. Look for the wire spiral bound editions.  In
your case, older is better.  Later editions added a bunch of stuff that
doesn't apply to your bus. Next, you should pick up either the Haynes or
Bentley manual for your bus. The Bentley is a (kinda) reprint of the VW
publication and assumes a fair knowledge of mechanics going in.  The
Haynes is, IMHO, better for a beginner in that what they do is actually
take the bus apart and photograph it as they go.

3.) Hang out here for a while.  If you get stuck, there's about a
thousand folks here willing to help. Also, you might go play on the
Type2 webpage. You'll find tons of good info there. <http://www.type2.com>

Have fun!
