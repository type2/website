Subject: RE:ignition lock failure

The inability to remove the key from the ignition lock is not a common 
failure.  I would suggest trying to liberally lubricate the lock with a 
silicone or teflon based lube after flushing it out with WD40.  Just squirt 
along both sides of the keyway.  It might pay to also have a new key cut by 
code...not a copy of an existing key but a new key to factory specs.  Most 
of the VW lock trouble is really key trouble.  Feel free to contact me if 
you need more information.
