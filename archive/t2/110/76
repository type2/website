HI EVERYONE! MY NAME IS JACKI. I DONT KNOW A DAMN THING ABOUT CARS, BUT I 
HAVE A 1969 VW BUS AND I PLAN ON RESTORING IT INSIDE AND OUT WITH AS LITTLE 
HELP AS POSSIBLE. DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS ON:
1. WHERE IS THE BEST PLACE TO START WHEN RESTORING A BUS?
2. WHAT BOOKS WILL HELP OUT THE MOST ALONG THE WAY THROUGH THE 
PROJECT?(REPAIR MANUALS, UPHOLSRT,ETC.)
3. ANY HELPFUL HINTS ?
THANKS SOOOOOO MUCH!!!ANY INFO IS DEFINETLY APPRECIATED!
