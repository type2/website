That would be I77 and I70.  Southeast of that
interection as I recall.  Access to it was via
the next exit south of that intersection on I77.
Name escapes me.  Someone else suggested beetle
barn, but that just doesn't ring a bell.  Lotsa
lotsa busses though.  Mostly loafs.

You cannot miss it.  It is visible from I77.  In
fact, if you are a true vw jedi, you should be
able to feel all those vw's for miles ahead of
the yard.  

Another suggested source is to find any of the
rail buggy idiots in your area.  They can be
found buying chrome 009's at your local vw shop. 
They tend to buy a delapidated (read deadhead)
busses for cheap and cut the tranny out for their
buggies.  The bus is then left to rust behind the
trailer, pulling occasional outbuilding duties.  

Happy hunting,
Ray
