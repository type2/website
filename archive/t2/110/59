For some of you pros and VW old-timers out there, would like to ask for y=
our advice: =20

-A few years ago I replaced the fuel pump in my 71 Westy.  Still had the =
original pump.  I replaced it with a sealed Brazilian made pump.  The ori=
ginal worth anything?  Should I keep it?  The rubber diaphram (if that's =
what it's called) is shot.  Any rebuild kits for these?

-What's it cost to get trim parts re-chromed?  Like a mirror?  Is it chea=
per to just buy new?  That is, buy the quality parts, not the el-cheapo s=
tuff.  Made the mistake of buying a really cheap-made replacement mirror =
and antenna.  The antenna shakes and vibrates every time I hit the slight=
est bump.

-I live in Southern California.  What's a fair price to pay for a decent =
paint job?  I don't mean anything fancy.  Just the basic "good job," if t=
here is such a thing.  My bus is nice but I never want to make it so nice=
 that I'm afraid of a few small dings or scratches.  Currently is has a v=
ery cheap paint job--at least 10 years old--over the original.  Original =
owner had it done.  There's some flaking and it's about time for new pain=
t.

-I want to upgrade my engine.  I have got about 26K miles on a rebuilt en=
gine I had installed 10 years ago.  Paid $6-700 (?) for it.  Had all the =
bolt-ons.  Everything standard.  1600 in a '71.   Case number (U5071232) =
on the rebuilt engine says it was a Type III 7.7:1 compression?  Has ran =
great.  Only recently did it begin to leak more than a few drops (literal=
ly) of oil a week.  Now it's up to a few drops a day.  Really doesn't bur=
n any oil either.  Less than half a quart to drive cross country.  No bad=
 sounds.  A real solid engine.  And I have ran the heck out of it.  Regul=
arly up to nearly 4K rpms in 3rd gear to pull hills, trips through Death =
Valley in August.  That sort of thing.  No sloppy or deliberate abuse.  R=
egular oil changes and valve adjustments/checks every 2K miles.  Very rar=
ely driven over 60 mph.  Have only had to adjust a valve four times in te=
n years/30K miles.  I have been real lucky.  Anyway, the problem with the=
 engine is it just isn't engine enough for the driving I like to do in th=
e hills and mountains.  I'd like to have at least 25 more power.  What's =
the best route to take?  I'm willing to spend some $.  But I want to have=
 a very reliable engine.  Not something that I have to pamper.  Bigger en=
gine, better cam, dual carbs--what's the best...or a good way to go?

-Ready for a new trans to.  After 31 years the original sometimes pops ou=
t of 4th gear and is kind of overly "sensitive" to poor shifting into 2nd=
.  Have heard a lot about "Freeway Flyers."  Good in a bus?  Most of my d=
riving is for weekend trips, often to the hills and mountains.  Recommend=
ations?

Thanks in advance.
