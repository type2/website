Subject: The perfect VW house! (f)

Volks,

On something of a side issure, I invite your attention to the  following
story that appeared in last Saturday's Washington Post:

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A53197-2002Feb22.html

Is this not *the* house for the VW owner?  They are all steel and a bit
too small :-)  I am seriously going to pursue buying one!  I have a lot
nearby with a very restricted building area and I have spent enough time
living in my VW tin can that I can easily imagine living in a tin can w/o
the wheels!  And imagine a Dove Blue VW out in front of one of these pale
blue enameled steel houses!
