My old 75 had a heliocoil that came out when I took the old plug out.   Here's what I did:
I left the heliocoil on the old plug and applied some "JB Weld" to the outside threads of the heliocoil and then I screwed it back into the case.  After the JB Weld had a chance to set, I then removed the plug as usual and the heliocoil stayed in the case where I could simply screw in the new plug.  worked like a charm.
