Subject: Auto tranny parts value?

Hi all,
      As soon as we get the snowstorm cleared out here in Wisconsin, I am 
going to pick up a rusty parts bus.  This is a 75 with an automatic tranny.  
The bus has not been run in years, so the condition of the trans is unknown. 
(which makes it worth no more than core value, I know). Rumor is that bus was 
parked 4 years, and 3 owners, ago because of bad motor, which makes sense 
because it has an incorrect motor partially installed at the moment.
     I am buying this bus for parts for my two buses, but I have no need for 
anything automatic tranny related. 
     What I am wondering.....what should I all save?  Shifter?  Rods? C/V 
shafts? Trans itself (core)?   Are any of these parts hard to get?
     I am not looking to get rich, just do not want to send any parts to the 
dumpster that could be used on another bus. 
     If anyone is looking for any of this stuff, be forewarned that it'll be 
awhile before we dissassemble this bus, just trying to get my ducks in a row 
ahead of time.

     Thanks to everyone for this great list,
