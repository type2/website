 Mmmm, I think you need to pull those carbs OUT & have a good look at them.
It appears that the fuel isn't getting into the engine enough to warm it up & those surges that are making it backfire could well be from the engine leaning out.
Strip down the carbs, or better still, take it to a VW specialist.......you're in Germany, for Goodness sake, there must SOMEONE who is a guru on them!
As far as transfering that 1600 in, it really isn't that hard a job to do.
The bell housing & starter motor you should be able to get from a wreckers & as I said before, the starter motor from a 1303 1600cc Beetle is exactly the same.
Once the 1600 was in you would probably find the bus much easier to work on.
In fact if the 2.0l is so much trouble & you're much more comfortable with a 1600, sell your 2.0l box as well & get the complete driveline fro the 1600.
You'll probably end up with spare change since 2.0l boxes are in demand, although it won't be real flash on an autobahn.
If you can sort out the carb situation, because it does seem to be a fuel flow problem, you should be out of the woods & not have to deal with the engine change.
Oh, & make sure that the fuel pump is doing it's job as well.

The 2l motor still runs ok if it warms up for like an hour and even then its not 100 percent but still running.  It starts up and it feels like only half the motor is running.  Then as it runs I give it gas and it starts to backfire repeatedly.  Then if I'm lucky the longer it runs the less it will backfire and the other half of the motor seems to come to life and it will run.  I thought it might be the carbs so I bought a syncronizing tool, but it doesnt run well enough I think to get a good reading.  So if I can avoid the engine swap and make the dual carb motor run thats the choice I already dumped the 2l fuel injected motor when I got here.  Its not like back home where I can just let it sit, all vehicles have to be inspected and tagged over here and it kills me when they arent running well enough to get plates for the year.  Thats it, like I said any advise or memory on this problem is welcomed.
Peace Out
