Subject: Where to get fuel tank??

Unfortunately, here in Ohio, finding a bus in a junkyard is a little difficult, the old needle in a haystack comes to mind!  Anyone ever use that fuel tanker sealer junk from Por 15??  Any advice.  So what's the deal, is it ABSOLUTLEY IMPOSSIBLE to find one of these from a vendor?
Peace, John baker
