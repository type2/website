Way to go. One thing you will need to get used to on this list is
trying to give as much information as possible about your bus. If you
havent already go and write down as many numbers as possible from the
bus. this includes the chassi (or vin no) engine no, etc. There are
several links in the type2.com library that will allow you to
interpret these numbers. I would also suggest trying to determine what
you need to do & what you mean by restoring. (this is a personal
deffinition i.e. restore it to stock,good running order, or just the
way you want it). I would imagine you can do it, just take you time &
learn as much as possible.

determine what needs to be done. A great resource is metwiz.com. Kelly
works on older VW's. good pics of how to do many things correctly.

The bentley manual is very informative & you can most likely gleem
some good info from the muir book as well since you have a Type 1
engine in your 69. There are several on-line vendors who reside on
this list which would be more than happy to trade currency for those
products. These aren't restoration books though. Any generic
restoration book from a bookstore should for the most part help.

Pleas don't shout :)
