Subject: 75 BUS spark plug needs helicoil

Hi gang the wifes bus has a heli coil in the number 4cyl. The plug and the rethread part came out, while i got it back in I need to fix it so I can replace the worn out plug and let her start driving it daily.  Any suggetions on the best way to do this would be much appreciated.
Thanks
