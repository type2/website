Subject: Hot Starting problem; Breakerless Ignition

Bus: 78, 2.0L FI

Problem with starting after the engine has only been
off for a minute or so.  I remember this being
addressed before, even earlier this week, but now I
have the problem.  If someone could direct me to what
the solution is, I would appreciate it.

I am also contemplating going to a breakerless
ignition, something along the lines of a petronix or
Compufire.  I have also come across one called
Accu-fire that was described as a copy of the
Compufire, but at least $20 cheaper.  Nobody has it in
stock though.  Anybody use a breakerless module and
would like to comment?  Also, I have perused the 'net
and there has been talk of swapping a electronic
ignition distributor from an 84 jetta into an 81
points jetta.  Is there something similar that can be
done with our busses?  just a thought.

Other than that, the list has been a wonderful
resource for me getting this bus going again (6 years
idle)  

Thanks all, and I look forward to seeing many of you
at Everybus.
