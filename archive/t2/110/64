Subject: Front Bench Seat

 From time to time the subject of front bench seats in buses comes up. 
There are two setups available. The first is a kit that was available 
from the dealer. There was a filler piece for the walkthru section 
and a 2/3 seat replaced the single passenger seat. The filler panel 
is obvious and the spare tire is housed in the rear cargo area in the 
well. The factory front bench has a solid bulkhead behind the front 
seats and the spare tire is stored in the center of the front bench. 
There is no well in the rear cargo area in these buses. I ran across 
a bus for sale on thesamba the sports a factory front bench and 
wanted to post a link for those that are interested.
