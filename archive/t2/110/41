Subject: '68-71 style bumper beading???????

Howdy all,

Took off my front bumper, and disassembled it, looks
great, except for the "beading" or seal between the
main bumper and the end pieces.  Does anyone know
where to get these, and/or what the part # is?  If
they are not available, what have others done to
combat this?  

Thanks
