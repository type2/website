You may be on the right track. I didn't have precisely the same problem with 
my blinkers, but when I first bought my bus the blinkers had to be operated 
manually - that is, putting the lever arm to one side turned the light on, 
but it didn't blink, so I had to put the arm on, and off, and on, and off...

As it turns out, it was the relay: the windshield seal had been leaking 
right onto the fusebox. I had to replace the windshield anyway (had a chip 
about the size of a dime, and the Connecticut DMV failed me on it!), and 
that fixed the leaking problem. I got a new relay at a Napa store (I think - 
maybe JC Whitney?) for about $6, and they've been working fine ever since.
