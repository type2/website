Subject: Correction: Warm Starting Problem, not Hot  Start

Hey Everybody.  I have searched the archives and what
I have has not been classically defined as a hot start
problem.  I found a hot start problem to be when the
starter does not have enough juice to turn the motor
when the motor is hot.  Am I right?

My problem, I have seen spoken about in the archives,
but I have not seen a resolution yet.  It is warm
related.  When cold, the motor fires right up.  If
stopped, like filling for gas. It is a real pain to
get her to start.  It is like she is not getting
enough fuel.  She turns overfine, though.  But she
will start after holding the starter for at least 20
seconds (which is bad on it, I know).  I am leaning
towards either the cold start valve timing sensor or
some kind of temp sensor.  Anybody have any leads? 
Can anybody help me solve this boggling problem?

Thanks
