I have finally done it!! I just purchased my first VW. It is a 70 Bus pop 
top.. I have been researching VW's for around 6 months now. I am from 
Jackson, Mississippi, and will be traveling to Sarasota Flordia to pick the 
van up. I have purchased the Muir manual and have read pretty much all of it. 
Anyways, I wanted to send this to everyone who will be on the route I will be 
taking home. I would appreciate anyone along I-75 and I-10 to send me their 
numbers so I can keep just incase something were to go wrong...

Thanks-Look foward to talkin to everyone as my first VW project comes along.
