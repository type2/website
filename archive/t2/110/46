Yes.

Gas in the oil reduces its ability to lube the engine properly and will
drastically reduce the life of components like rings and bearings.

It could be coming from a sticking carb float, bad mixture settings or
incomplete combustion. Change the oil ASAP and keep an eye on it until you
determine the source of the fuel contamination.

You might also want to check the archives for details on this problem more
particular to your engine configuration. (ie, single/dual carb, FI, etc)

Happy trails,
