Hello John,

    I'm parting out at 70 bus, and have a good used fuel tank for sale.
Contact me off list, if you haven't found one yet.

> Unfortunately, here in Ohio, finding a bus in a junkyard is a little
difficult, the old needle in a haystack comes to mind!  Anyone ever use that
fuel tanker sealer junk from Por 15??  Any advice.  So what's the deal, is
it ABSOLUTLEY IMPOSSIBLE to find one of these from a vendor?
