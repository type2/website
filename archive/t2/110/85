Subject: window seal for a riviera


Hi,

Ok here is a question for all the riviera owners out there.  I am in the
process of gathering up seals for my van and I need to replace the ones for 
the sliding windows.  What should I get and where should I go? It seems the 
vendors only have seals for solid, or louvered windows.  I have a buddy who 
offered to sell me a set of westy windows that I could install and keep the 
original ones for later.  And what should i do for the seal for the poptop?  
What do you think?
