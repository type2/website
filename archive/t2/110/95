I agree.  Bentley, Muir, Haynes Type2 book and
maybe Haynes restoration of beetles and
transporter books are all required for those of
us with very little mechanical ability. 

I have a spare Muir Idiot manual, and this is
truly the first book the inexperience owner
should have.  

Received free engine tin earlier and I've been
waiting for a chance to return the good karma, so
pmail me (that means offlist, directly to my
email address) and we'll work it out.

Peace, grace and blessings
Ray
