> Unfortunately, here in Ohio, finding a bus in a junkyard is a little
difficult, the old needle in a haystack comes to mind!  Anyone ever use that
fuel tanker sealer junk from Por 15??  Any advice.  So what's the deal, is it
ABSOLUTLEY IMPOSSIBLE to find one of these from a vendor?

I find them here in the self-serve wrecking yards in central California.
However, lately all the yards are starting to punch big holes in them. Part of
the 'detox' the EPA requires, so no gas leaks into the ground and contaminates
the water.
I guess I better start grabbing the ones they miss.....

and cannot find the fuel tank I need for my 71 Westy (mine was leaking
buckets!).  They have tanks for everything but 68-71 buses.  Anyone know where
I can get one???
