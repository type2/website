Subject: Wheel Bearings and Disk Brakes

Right:  71 bus

I pulled my passenger tire to fix a suspected bad wheel-bearing,
and, if nothing else, adjust my axial play -- which there was 
too much of -- and adjust my calipers, which had my brakes rubbing
slightly.

First:  I replaced my wheel bearings, only to find that after
replacing them accoring to Bentley with brand new (albeit Chinese)
bearings, I have the same amount of noise coming from my bearings
as before.  Hrm.  It's not a *bad* noise, or a *loud* noise, but 
more like a sound that bearings would normally make, good, greasy
bearings, but I guess I was surprised at the amount of noise that 
they *DO* make.  

Second:  No matter how hard I try to adjust my calipers, the discs
rub a little bit against the pads when I torque them down.  Now,
the caliper, disc, and pads are new as of 4000 miles ago, and, given
my driving style, these pads still look new -- will they "wear in"?

I spent a good 45 minutes last night getting disc to spin without
rubbing, torquing the calipers down while holding it in place, 
loosening it again because the pads were rubbing, getting it to 
spin without rubbing, tightening it, then loosening it because
it was rubbing, ad infinitum.  I tried tighening one of the two
bolts at a time, then the other, etc., to no avail.  

Any ideas?  I figure:

a) I've got a warped disc (!)
b) the pad will wera in after a few miles

any thoughts are appreciated...
