> Thx for the info.  So what's it cost for a 1640 you describe? 

 

Mmm, well here's the catch as usual.

I'm actually in Australia but I can give you some idea as to the cost of a long block 1640 or 1641(which is practically the same).

Here are some prices from February 2002 Hot VW's.

 

Strictly Foriegn in Grants Pass, Oregan has 1641 long blocks for US$1299 outright, only $40 more than a straight 1600.

 

Closer to home for you is Audirac Headflow Masters in Vista, California.

They do a 1641 with counterweighted crank, Engle or Schneider race cam, shuffle pins(whatever they are?), 8 dowel flywheel, solid rockers, full ported& polished heads & full balancing for US$1395 exchange....a great deal if you really want a well built engine.

 

There is also Strictly VW in Irwindale, California who do exchange 1641's for US$689.

 

And Rogers European Engineering in Downey, California does a 1640 exchange for US$610.

 

Here is where I say "Caveat Emptor........let the buyer beware."

All of these companies may be reputable & you may well get a good engine from all of them.

Having said that, check your sources VERY carefully.

Unfortunately there are also cads & one particular Australian firm who builds exchange engines are the most unscrupulous operators I'm aware of still in business. 

Anyone on the list I'm sure could point you to a decent engine builder in the California area(Yes, I know it's big) & if you are going the after market FI/supercharged route, you will need to discuss carefully with anyone who is building the engine what specs will give you the most power to engine life ratio.

The supercharger & FI may seem like a big outlay to begin with, but once you have them you can go on using the system practically for ever & if you use a late model Japanese s'charger from a Toyota, for instance, they are clutched & can be programmed into the FI management computer.

As I say, what may seem a little crazy to begin with, may with some custom made items become an amazing set up that suits the bus much better than the later model engine.

I must stress at this point that while Judson's are cute, they are little better than a gentle breeze compared to modern superchargers & were made to placate the 1950's US market, not make VW's into fire breathing monsters.

 

I run a 2.0l engine that cost me AUD$4500 to have rebuilt at the end of last year.......a devastating figure that I still have trouble explaining & I know that my mechanic lopped a lot of the labour off the price to keep it down.

The engine runs well, but it is no beast despite the fact it has some internal tweaks to make it run better.

Standard VW engines are over-engineered, a characteristic that makes them perfect daily drivers, but it also means with the low compression that you can do things with low boost forced induction (say between 4 & 6 pounds) than with higher compression engines & still keep the longevity & reliability of the engine.

The case remaining standard is also a fundamental factor in this set up & as such the extra 41cc should be a gain without a catch.

Check it out & see if you can find a mechanic who has done this sort of thing before........there are certainly turbos out there so there should be someone who knows about this kind of build.

 

Please, is there anyone else who can say a yay or nay to this or at least make some suggestions.

The parts situation in the US is much different to Australia & there may be other options or kits made for this express purpose.

 

Good luck & I really hope this works out.

 

Cheers
