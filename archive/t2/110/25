Wasn't it the Lustron Corp that was given the Tucker plant from under their
feet?  I believe the government owned the factory and when Tucker made too
many enemies around Detroit, the government with pressure from certain
Senators pulled the lease contract away from Tucker and gave it to Lustron.

The Tucker was a rear wheeled drive, rear engined air cooled car that had
features on it in the late 40's that most cars didn't have until the 70's!!
Fuel injection, disk brakes, padded dash, safety glass windshields, seat
belts to name a few.
