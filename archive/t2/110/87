Subject: Re: [T2] window seal for a riviera

Window seals I can't help you with... but the top seal I can.

First of all, on the Riviera 'Penthouse®' roof, that's not a seal, it
just edging to cover the raw fibreglas.  You might be able to find it
locally at your FLRVPS (Friendly Local RV Parts Supplier).  You will not
be able to find the exact stuff though.  What you may find will have a
pebble grain. The smooth stuff isn't available as far as I have been
able to determine.

If you cannot find it locally, I have a source here that does have it. 
It's available in Black (my choice), white and brown.  Costs $1.50/ft
and you'll need 23 ft. IIRC. It goes around both sides and the back of
the top. The seal across the front is just a high density sponge rubber
seal that you can find at Home Depot, AutoZone and the like. 

The 'seal' around the luggage bay is just more of what goes around the
Penthouse. As near as I can tell, it doesn't really 'seal' anything.
