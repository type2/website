Subject: Re: [T2] Where to get fuel tank??

It's been about nine years since I lived in Ohio so I don't know if they 
still exist but there were two places that I remember.  They are, or were, 
Coyne's just about a mile or two east of Kirkersville, U.S. 40 east of 
Columbus, and the Beetle Barn, about a mile south of Cambridge off of I77.  I 
got a lot of parts for my '72 Westy at Coyne's and sold a '72 Bus to the 
Beetle Barn.

But, like I said, I don'y know for sure if they are still around.  Anyone 
else know?
