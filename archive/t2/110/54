I have two 76's for sale here in Germany.  The first is a white 76 non-pop 
westy American Spec.  It has the two liter dual carb motor that is running, 
just not right.  The interior is complete and in fair shape for the year.  
The two front seats kinda look ugly but no springs in the butt.  The second 
is  a  green 1976 European model, old enough to be shipped without 
conversion, passenger bus without the seats in the middle and a very small 
westy conversion, a bed and cabinet to be exact, this one has a 1600 dual 
port motor, runnig good.  The both need to go ASAP and I will let them both 
go for the whopping sum of $750.00 please email privately or call
01149-6221-796491 from US or in Germany 06221-796491
Peace Out
