John-

I hear you, buddy!The "junkyard" answer is no answer at all for me.  Here in
western KY  air cooled VWs of any kind are rare, and busses are almost
non-existent. The junkyards are rapidly eliminating their stock of older
vehicles of all makes, like anything older than about '85. Everytime
somebody says "go to the pick-and-pull" I cringe because that just isn't an
option for me, or for a lot of us I imagine. I'm considering upgrading my 74
to FI but I won't be able to just go to the 'pick-n-pull' for a set-up. The
nearest significant swap meet I've even heard of  is once a year and over
four hours away and I'm given to understand that it's mostly for Type 1
parts. I guess I'll stick with the Weber for now.

Anyway, Have you tried Joe at BustedBus? I've had some good luck with him
before.

Thanks for letting me vent,
Dave
74 Riviera
