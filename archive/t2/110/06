Well not to object but that clear factual post sure does assume the
top end of the "by the book" advance curve.  By the book, either the
'75-'78 Bus or Vanagon Bentley advance on those distributors is
28.5 to 32.5 at WOT and then another 8-12 by the vacuum advance
for say a range of 36.5 to 44.5 at part throttle cruise.  Those are the
numbers.  Now taking the happy average as I'd be inclined to do that
is say 30.5 at WOT and 40.5 at part throttle cruise assuming the 7.5
BTDC and an average centrifugal of 23 and vacuum of 10.  Which frankly
has been my experience with the 15 or so '76-'83 T4 distributors
I've owned or had close experience with on other peoples cars.  The
newest lowest mile stocker I have had had 30 at WOT and about
41 at part throttle, it will just dance off the scale and that is what I
get with my cheapo adjustable advance timing light.  This has also
been my general experience with the things.  I have a couple dizzys
that make about 32 at WOT and 43/44 at part throttle cruise (by the
timing light admittedly) and they seem a bit peppier but also run quite
a bit hotter in the pig of the '82 auto westy.  I stick to my opinion on
the things though, I fully agree with John the 009 has no place in a
T4, the 050 can work just marginally, but 44 total off throttle is a
whole pile of advance.  My original point was that if you can run it and
the engine stays cool and you have no signs of pinging which can be
damn hard to tell in a Bus, feel free, otherwise if you are satisfied with
the performance you got at a bit less, run a bit less.

YMMV
