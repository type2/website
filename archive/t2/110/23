Subject: vacuum ports on 30/31 PICT

 I would like to replace the 34PICT-3 on my 160DP with a recently acquired
30/31 PICT.  I'm running a stock DVA distributor.  On the 34, there is only
one vacuum port facing the rear of the carb so it is simple to connect this
to the distributor. On the 30.31, I find three ports facing the rear and
one on the left side.

Can anyone tell me the function of those three rear ports? Which of these
do I connect to the distributor vacuum advance module?

Thanks, Jack
