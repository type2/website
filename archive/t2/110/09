Rob,

Well, it is fersure not any VW fuel pump I have ever seen, on a carb or on
FI, but the "form factor" more closely resembles an FI pump than a carb
pump.  It may well be a junkyard pump from some other manufacturer and it
just might do for your 2L FI settup.  My instinct would be to hook it up
and see.  You would need an FI fuel pressure tester to be sure you had the
requisite 30+psi pressure rather than the 2-4psi pressure needed for a
carb.
