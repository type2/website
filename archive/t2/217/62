*I would assume that Berg's cow magnets don't have enough pull to move
paper clips, but these 'rare earth' magnets have got to cause some paper
clip
attraction, wouldn't you think? *

I don't relate to the term rare earth magnets.
I've been using magnets all my life for various simple tasks and have
wound many electro magnets for special applications.
The cow magnets is an interesting use but every telephone and a half
dozen other things on your desk use magnets and I don't see the magnets
in the computer monitor affecting the operation of the phone or the
electric pencil sharpener.
In reference to your *My Kymco sump plate magnet*. I get less magnetic
material inside my strainer plate as miles have gone by and my cylinders
are probably seated fully at 10K miles. I want to think that the magnet
collected enough of the abrasive iron particles to have improved my
overall engine life but proving it is beyond me.

*It will also magnetize that big ol' spinning thing in there called the
crankshaft.*
 
The magnets will not attract a paper clip from 6" away, I don't think the
crank will be affected.
