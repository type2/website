Subject: help needed on installing camper seats

I bought my 71 Transporter about a year and a half ago.  I have been
doing A LOT of work to this thing...complete brake rebuild, overhauled
engine, etc, etc.  The other day, I was rummaging through a box that came
with the bus, and I noticed some brackets.  Come to find out, the person
before me was going to build a seat that folded out into a bed!  Does
anyone have pictures that they would be willing to share of their camper
bed/seat, so I have an idea what I'm up against?  Any diagrams, or
instructions, or anything would help!

Thanks in advance, 
Kyle
