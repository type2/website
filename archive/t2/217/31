I had a coil (bosch) actually catch fire it got so hot from sitting while
I was working on something that I needed the power on for,  fortunately I
didn't have to use the fire ext I had grabbed as it went out as soon as I
pulled the terminal off the battery.
  every wire in the area was melted too, those things can get hot if the
points are just right and the power is left on too long.
