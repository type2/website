Subject: Re: [T2] Oil cooler leak / Trip report

You are exactly right.  

About 14 years ago I repo'd the oil cooling in my 71
without removing the engine.  Just start at the back of
the engine and keep taking stuff off.   

If I remember correctly I had to use a pry bar to move
the engine back on the mounts to drop the air shroud. 
Then its all right there.

Mine was a blown cooler.  I just put a new one in.

Good luck
Logan
