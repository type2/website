The reason that most modern engines are equipped with an oil cooler is that the motor is desigined to the least possible specs.When that motor is packaged in a vehicle with bad underhood airflow,beauty covers,skirts,combined with barely fitting it gets HOT.It is then easier and cheaper to add a cooler then redesign the engine,also many internal engine systems run off of the lube system like cam phasers(VVT)and chain tensioners that like lots of oil to operate properly.Underhood real estate is a finite space that many people are bucking for with the feeling of I am the most important so screw anyone else.

Did a 68 Country Squire with a 7 Liter(which probably has a higher GCVW than an '03 F150) have an oil cooler?Hell no it didn't,it had tons of space in the engine compartment and a radiator and grill opening the size of a football field to keep it running cool.

It is hard to compare modern engines to older engines because of the different schools of thought in engine and vehicle design,it is also hard to compare North American,Asian and European modern engine design based on the design(engine and vehicle) directions the various automakers.
