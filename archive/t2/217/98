Ben:

You're well on your way with the tune-up tools and book, though I'd forget
Muir and go for the Bentley manual specific to your vehicle.

(http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0837600944/qid=1028063551/sr=1-18/re
f=sr_1_18/104-9717172-6691954)

Do a comprehensive tune-up and get everything "spot on."  Since it's "new"
to you I'd spring for new consumables (e.g., spark plugs, points, rotor,
etc.) just so you're sure everything's OK.

Make sure you do a complete inspection of all the air and vacuum hoses (some
disassembly required) and fix any leaks.  Again, since the car's new to you
I'd do a comprehensive vacuum leak test in addition to the inspection.

Do a complete inspection of the exhaust system and fix any leaks you find
there.

Change the oil and filter.  This is good advice for any recently-purchased
car but also can help you pass smog.

Since you probably don't have an O2 sensor you can't really check the
air/fuel setting yourself but you'll need to go to a shop with an exhaust
gas analyzer to have that done.  Make sure they insert the "sniffer" *in
front* of the catalytic converter instead of just ramming it up the tailpipe
like they'll most likely want to.

Take the car in for it's smog check with the engine *as hot* as possible.
Take a 20-30 minute high speed run on the freeway and then drive directly to
the smog station for inspection.
