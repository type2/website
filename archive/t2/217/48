One key to having an efficient unit is to have the door on the top, not
the side like your home refrigerator.  Conventional ice chest design is
pretty close to ideal.  A side door lets all the cold air dump out every
time you open the box.

I use a medium-sized Coleman ice chest in my bus for summer trips.  7
pounds of ice cubes will keep it cool for 2 days in
summer temps if I keep a towel dampened with meltwater over it.  The
evaporative effect of the damp towel keeps the outside of the cooler below
outside temperature.
