--Though the list is handy, it is "staffed" by volunteers, and is not a "service". You aren't garanteed a reply. Try posting again.

Make sure your posts are as clear as possible, try your best to use correct terminology, p/n's, etc. It helps to get a clear answer.

>not to complain, but I'm wondering what I did wrong on the last two posts that I submitted about the brake regulator mount problem I had.  No one replied!  Did I breach some etiquette?
