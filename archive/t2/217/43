Subject: Re:making your own coolers-poly-foam

I am very familiar with polyisocyanurate foam, having insulated our post
and beam home with panels using 3.5" of this stuff sandwiched in.  We
heat our home in middle NJ for less than a cord of wood per winter. 
I've taken 1" of this and lined a suitcase with it, put in frozen steak,
and flown to Germany to visit a relative and it was still frozen a day
later.  The sectet is to prevent ANY gaps by taping it together
tightly.  Many coolers have voids in the corners or in the lid.  This is
the same stuff that is sold in home depot as the spray foam to fill gaps
in your house ("Great Stuff" is an example that doesn't expand too
much).  You can use this to improve your own coolers- but id doesn't
spread much more than a few inches from the tip of the nozzle (Drill
holes for the nozzle tube).  I'ver also filled gaps in rocker areas that
I wanted to completely keep moisture out from.  Wear gloves as staining
of the skin with this will remain until your epidermis renews itself!  
Once cured it's nontoxic.
