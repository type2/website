Subject: Re: [T2] Installing window glass

Mike,

in some cases it might be really helpful to have 2 sets of extra hands.

a few months ago i did the rear window seal. with me & one helper it must
have taken at least 10 tries with no success.

once i got a 3rd helper (both helpers pushing from outside), it went in
the first try in less than 5 minutes.

i saw posts on here with people saying they did this as a one-man job.
whew, i wouldn't even want to attempt that!

anyway the point is having 2 helpers on the outside seemed to make
window rubber installation a breeze.

good luck,
