Do you mean 86b to 85?

I understand. I've now hotwired the pump to a house lightswitch in the cabin to bypass the relay. Bus still won't start.

Can anyone address the swinging double relay issue? This thing clicks like crazy when key is in #2. Replaced relay and afm. Must be a wiring issue but what? No good test procedures known.
