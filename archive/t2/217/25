Hi Everybody,
    I'd like to add my 2 cents on this one.   I like to have on hand a few
plastic, bicycle tire irons to serve the same function as Chris M's plastic
knife.  They have rounded edges and one end has a bend in it for levarage.
Best of all, you can get a set of 2 or 3 for cheap at your local bicycle
shop.
