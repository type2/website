Subject: 68-70 Bus Towbar FS $150 + Shipping

BusFolk -

I went and bought a Tow Dolly so I could use it for all my vehicles. I 
therefore have a bus towbar FS. It's made to fit years 68 thru 70 (no brake 
booster). I used it once to tow Itch (a procedure, not a podiatric disease) 
to Los Angeles from BBB-VI and all went flawlessly. This thing is beefy, and 
made by the list's very own Rich Kimbrough (serial# RK-13). I think it's 
about $30-$40 to ship via Amtrak. Was $225 new. Still looks new. Asking $125 
+ shipping from the Los Angeles area.

Thanks -

Mike & Itch
