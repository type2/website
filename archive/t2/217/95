Subject: Getting my 78 Westy "Smogged" in Sacramento   Help needed.

This Spring I bought my 78 Westy from a co-worker who had been not 
using it for over a year.   I need to get this bus "smogged" under a 
California Law, (it had been before until last year).   Can any list 
members assist me in getting this engine ready for "smogging" and 
helping me set it back afterwards or direct me to someone who cqan do 
this wiithout costing me a month's pay?

All help appreciated!  I've learned so much about my Bus on this list!

BEN

PS, I do have Muir Book and tune up tools coming this week.
