Subject: HCBF 6 newspaper article

there was an article writen up in the Watauga Democrat on the Friday of the 
festival.  The author called buses "bugs" in the title, misquoted me, and 
misquoted the camping cost at 35 bucks in stead of 5 
bucks.............none-the-less a pretty good article

and a pretty bus Dave!!!

here is a link to article if you were not able to see the paper at the 
festival.
