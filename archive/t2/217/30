Subject: Temp Gauge and various q's




 I want to verify, before I do any damage, are you positive that I am
supposed to "bend" the sender out of the way of the gen pulley?  This is a
dip stick sender I am referring to, it is touching.

 I hear a distinct air sucking sound.  I am sure it is supposed to, but the
best I can figure is from the carb.  I pull the air cleaner off, and really
noticeable.  Rev the engine(air cleaner in place) and the sucking goes away.

 I am searching for a vacuum leak, using gumout, and spraying on what I
figure to be vacuum lines.  What exactly am if looking for?  I have shot the
obvious lines from the dizzy, the servo assist, the orange manifold gaskets,
what else??

 I removed the bottom(rear facing) vacuum line from the carb, nothing
noticeable, maybe even ran better, possible my imagination.  Shouldn't it
have really run rough with this disconnected?

 Any helpful hints on  a starter?  Gone!  Just clicks, need to touch it with
a hammer to start, and I need an extra person, it wont just let me hit it
and start.

 Hows my day going???
 Made it to and fro HCBF!!!!
