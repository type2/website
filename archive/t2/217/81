Subject: Re: [T2] Oil temps after cooler

Depending on the size of the cooler and the location of it in an 
airflow.  a medium sized one is supposed to be good for 25 degree drop 
in temperature.  Adding a fan (or having it in a hight air flow 
location) is generally good for another 10 to 15 degrees.  The ones 
mounted on the sides of buses would be in positions where they could be 
getting 35 to 40 degree drops and they are small ones on most buses. It 
is the mass air flow that gives them a boost.  What i call the medium 
one is the one i found most associated with vanagons and is normally 
positioned in a way that drops should be in the 25 to 30 degree range 
with out a fan.  A local installer concurred with the vanagon and bus 
figures i give here.
