Subject: Re: [T2] Some painting thoughts

 all my glass work is done by a glass guy----
I broke way to many to even talk about, and the profit margin dwindled.
So it's the glass man for me--if he screws up it's on him--not me.

Yes, this is the advice that I have heard else where. The bay windshields
are kind of scary.. too big! I seen one get broken by someone who thought it
would be easy. He thought better later on.
Thanks for the advice! Jan B
