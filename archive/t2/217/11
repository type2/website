Subject: Magnets

The Berg outfit advocates strapping a cow magnet to the oil pickup tube. A
cow magnet is a large capsule shaped magnet that is swallowed (I'm sure not
willingly) by a cow to collect nails, barbed wire and other metallic items
that an indiscriminate cow eats. It then passes through and out of their
system ready to be cleaned up and reused (yuck) Agri-supply places sell
them, or order them online, or order it from the Bergs. If your not going to
drop the pan then you can try to stick some very strong magnets to the
bottom of the oil pan or even around your filter. I think Boston Bob
mentioned doing this not too long ago. Before you sell out good money for
weak magnets, check out this website.
http://www.wondermagnet.com/dev/main.shtml They sell Rare Earth Neodymium
magnets cheap. These magnets are extremely strong. Their size is deceiving.
You can easily injure yourself if you don't give these magnets the respect
they deserve.  They're not toys for your 6 year old. They're not toys for
your 36 year old either, but that person is on their own.
