Anther major heat factor that comes into play with type1 style engines 
is compression.  Most bus people dont play to much with souped up 
engines it seems but this was my favorite with my beetles.  The higher 
the compression the higher the temps.  This is another one of the 
reasons that most aircooled engines have rather low compression ratios.  
It is actually written into vw manuals that the compression should be 
kept within certain ranges to avoid damaging the heads.  It isnt the 
pressure that would damage them but the extreme temperatures. many 
modern engines are now in the same situation.  oil temps climb extremely 
fast in some of them. You are seeing more head failures on newer cars 
than ever before.  If i was running a type one bus and worked the engine 
i would probably switch heads to 044 type heads and add a sump and oil 
cooler.  Overkill for sure probably.
