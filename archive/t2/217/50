Yes Janice, 

I have a good book I highly recommend you read regarding replacing
rubber seals and glass--real excellent reading too--



The phone book---

Other than Mack truck glass which has a locker bead in the rubber seal,
and makes the job easy when removed, all my glass work is done by a
glass guy----
I broke way to many to even talk about, and the profit margin dwindled.
So it's the glass man for me--if he screws up it's on him--not me.

It cost me $135.00 for PPG dark tinted windsheild glass on my 74 Westy
and he installed the new moulding I supplied.

Why do it yourself for that kind of money? 

Later,

Terry

Thank you for that tip. It sounds really good! Now, does anyone have a
good reference book or site to recommend on replacing window glass and
rubber seals? Jan B
