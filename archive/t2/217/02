Subject: RE: [T2] Brakes squeal after 15 mins.

I have used a pouch Permatex disk brake quiet
http://www.permatex.com/auto/autouc.asp?f_call=get_item&item_no=80729 on the
back of each set of pads with good results. It or something like it is
available at about any auto parts store. The stuff out of the pouch goes on
much thicker than the spray-on stuff. Its pricey for the amount one gets but
its worth it to me.
