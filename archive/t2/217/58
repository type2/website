Thanks for all your input.

Im "stock boy", so complete removal thing is not for
me.  Consider it a character flaw.  

The insulation in mine is not in very good shape, so Im
going to spend a few minutes on that! And I have found
two small 12Vdc computer fans that will be hooked up to
a) circulate inside (micro cooler), and b) force air
through the venting (old printer fan).  If it does not
work too well I will can remove them later.  

Thanks again 

Logan
