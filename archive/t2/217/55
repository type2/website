*It will also magnetize that big ol' spinning thing in there called the
crankshaft.*

The magnets will not attract a paper clip from 6" away, I don't think the
crank will be affected.
Your opinion is appreciated and I don't discount that there could be
other effects but I've seen a lot of commercial compressors and other
industrial applications that have magnets laying right in the oil sumps.
