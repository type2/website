Subject: Re: [T2] Some painting thoughts

Clear coat and base coat is the most modern paint today and much more 
durable than OEM.

I believe these are urethanes. Well worth the money.

I have acrylic enamel + hardener on my bus and it is 3 years old. Looks good.

If you are doing it yourself and your labor is cheap and if you are on a 
budget - the enamel is a good budget paint. If you are paying somebody to 
do it for you so that huge bill only comes around once every couple decades 
- use the best stuff you can afford.

If you want really, really cheap paint - check the local Co-op for farm 
implement paint at $15 a gallon.
