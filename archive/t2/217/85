Folks,

You can get a hard start relay kit (bosch) from:

www.autohausaz.com (800) 240-4620

This kit comes with relay/wiring/instructions (at least mine did). It was <
$7. I don't recall shipping costs.


Just a relay (bosch) and socket can be had at partsexpress.com for just
$0.99 and $1.50 respectively:
