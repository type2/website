I checked and we have a copy here in our University library so may I 
suggest that if anyone is on a budget and needs to do some studying - visit 
your local library and get this book for a few weeks for free!

Many libraries like ours has their catalog on the web where you can search 
for the material you want and see if it is available for check out. Saves 
you a drive.
