Subject: Got the 'cant get the new engine to work right' Blues

Hello everyone!  Good to be back! Wooooooo!

After 2 years of denying my inner greasemonkey, I bought a 70 singlecab with
the vow that I would get it going quick, do it right, and not spend the next
5 years of my life greasy and tinkering.

So I bought a shiny new VW Mexico engine.  Put it together with the weber 40
and a 009 than came off the old, dead motor.  Worked, but not well and the
oil smelled like gas. Trained the oil twice, ditched the weber for a rebuilt
30 pict 1 and traded the 009 for a 205P - vacumn advance jobbie.

couldn't dial it in, couldn't dial it in....couldn't get the idle high
enough, carb adjustments did nothing.  I figure its a worn throttle plate or
bad carb so I buy a new 34PICT3/4 from the local VW shop.

Well, darn it, I can't adjust the idle high enough - with the tach, I can't
get past 500.   The carb adjustments have almost NO effect. Its tuned right
otherwise, valves, points, plugs, filters are fine -and there are still less
than 100 miles on the engine and less than 500 feet on the carb.

Everyone I talk to says that a vacumn leak will cause a high idle, not a
slow one.  Still,I tried the carb cleaner test and it had no effect.

I have set up the carb per instructions at least 5 times, all per
bentley/archives. I have the Muir, the Haynes, the Bently, and even the
Hoover files, but I am lost.

What on earth could it be?
