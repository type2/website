The ammonia fridge adds heat to the Westy in summer and adds more bulk
than its capacity is worth.
I completely removed the Dometic fridge in my 78, put in a 74 triple
bedseat, and carry a separate Coleman electric 12v fridge for keeping
stuff cold when traveling or at campgrounds with hookups.  This is a
well insulated fridge, and I put ice in it if I plan to be at non-hookup
sites or do a lot of leave it parked most of the day at tourist places. 
Can be stored behind the front seat or placed outside (in the tent)
once camped.  I have pics on a geocities web site for this and can pmail
the site to you (too many hits at once shuts it down).

..In light of all that.  Has anyone considered putting
 thermoelectric fridge guts into the dometic body
 (either as a swap out, or an add in).  Since the
 thermoelectric unit is motion immune, it should be
 colder at the site, and therefore should last longer
 too.
