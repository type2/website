Subject: High Country Bus Festival 6 Pictures

.........as some people have already said, the High Country Bus Festival was 
a super time.

There were 155+ buses in attendance and the weather was near 
perfect........no rain this year :-)

I am still unpacking and recovering, I will give a more complete report 
soon, and I have a ton of people to thank.............but I wanted to go 
ahead and get some pics online

you can see pics at:
