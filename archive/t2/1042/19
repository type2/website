Subject: Green 78WESTY Virginia Tag, spotted in DC!!!

Hey guys,

     I'm at a conference here for work in Washington D.C. and happened to notice a mint condition avacado green Volkswagen Westfalia. It had a Virginia license plate (probably Fairfax County) that said "78WESTY". The bumpers were white, and the entire body was green with a white fiberglass Westy top.

Anyway, I thought it was pretty cool... I was walking by the Hyatt or the downtown convention center when I saw it drive by.

On a side note, I used to live in downtown DC. I grew up in the Wardmen Towers (Then called the Sheraton Washington Hotel and Wardmen Towers) off of the Woodley Park subway stop. I think it's a Marriott now. My father was the assistant manager of that hotel when I was like 5. I also lived in Northern Virginia (Vienna) and went to James Madison HS between the ages of 14-18...

It's nice to be back in DC.

Anyway, just curious if this Bus belonged to anyone on here!!!


Todd,
73 VW Transporter
