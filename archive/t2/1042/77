Subject: Automatic Transmission, or fix manual?

Hey guys,

      I guess this is a two-part question. First is, I'd like my wife to be able to drive our Volkswagen Bus. She can't get the hang of 2nd gear and reverse being in a similar location. So I was wondering... do the currently made Khombi's in Brazil come with automatic transmissions as an option, and can they be fitted to our air cooled motors?

Second question is, why is my transmission so hard to shift? Could it be the transmission?

I've replaced the following:

1 - Shift plate
2 - Springs under shift plate
3 - Bushings under shift plate
4 - Rubber bushing (the block thing) in the shifter.

I haven't replaced any of those plastic pieces yet.

When I drive, I can put it in first easily. I can accelerate fine. I really have to be very gentle, and finess it into 2nd gear. I've learned how to do it and it works 90% of the time. Shifting to third and fourth are NON issues, it's flawless.

If I'm making a turn and I need to downshift from 3rd to 2nd... it's almost impossible. More often than not, I have to end up coming to a complete stop, then putting it in first and going from there.

What could be wrong?

There's no slippage, and the motor runs awesome. I took it for a quick spin at 75mph to see how everything was working (body stability, suspension, motor, etc..). Not in an abusive way, I just wanted to make sure everything was together.


Thanks!!!
