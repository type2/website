Subject: Re: [T2] vent window

hey Bob
start by getting the the inner door  panel  off
there should be 4 or 5 10 mm bolts around the window crank  remove those 1  
is 
for the vent post.
There are 2 more 10 mm bolts  under plastic caps on the front edge of the  
door where it meets the  windshield post remove those. you also remove the 
13mm  
nut at the  bottom of the post and it helps to screw the adjuster in all the  
 
way.   
There is a Phillips machine screw under the rubber of  the vent frame (  
always a pain to remove) pry up the rubber at the  bottom to  locate.  
after all the hardware is remover you will  need to slide the window  
regulator back to make room to bull the vent  window out.  feel free to  
email me or 
call 336 212 2663 if this  isn't enough info
