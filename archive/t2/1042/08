Yes, they are in-fact different.  I had a 76 door and the mount was 
different from my 78.  The door strap (that keeps it from opening too 
far) is also slightly different.

For the hinge, I took my old 78 door and pushed out the pins.  Then I 
pushed out the pins on the 76 and put the 78 mounts on the 76 door.  As 
for the strap, I just used a grinder so the 76 strap would work on the 
78 pillar mount.
