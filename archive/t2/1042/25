Subject: Master cylinder reservoir

Hey everyone, I finally got my brakes all worked out on the 77
Westfalia, new steel lines, flex lines, pads, shoes, cylinders etc all
back together.? I found a replacement reservoir on the samba
because the one I had was leaking, and found new grommets.


I got it all back together this week and then added brake
fluid and got my wife to help me bleed the system. ?I
couldn't believe it when brake fluid started dripping at a
large rate from the top of the master cylinder.


I took the master out and sure enough, the little feet that
go into the grommets in the top of the master were
cracking  can't believe I
didn't notice it when I got the piece back in
April.? I am kicking myself.



So the reason for this post is a request for anyone who might
have this part in their stash and would be willing to part with it. ? Shipping would be to
01430.

Thanks!
