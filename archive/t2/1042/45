Subject: Re: More on high hydrocarbons failing emmission test-

Mike said: Not one person commented on why my HC was so high (1128) with 0.25%
CO- the latter suggests mix is OK? I pulled the plugs, no carbon fouling. The
compression shows a weak #3 (117 PSI with others being 1=150, 2=140, and
4=150. I added oil to #3 and it went to 133 PSI. The hydraulic valve
adjustment is correct. Rings? Not enough down to suggest oil burning and I do
not lose oil. Air cleaner is OK.Further checks- timing is OK, plugs seem to
fire based on timing light. Dissconnected the Cold Start Valve and all
injectors, lifting rail enough to see tips. Nary a drop with a full minute of
running pump! So what gives? I can replace Air Flow Meter, or set it to be
really lean at idle? Can a rich screw setting really give that high a HC
reading, andf my milage of 16 does suggest rich running?I had better
emmissions when the engine had 250,000 mi on it! Rebuilt last July, run 5K mi.

Honestly..... your CO is too low. Bring it up to 1.0 % and see if your HC
drops.  Too low = too lean = misfire = high HC
