Does anyone have experience with the slip-in kit CIP1.com sells to bump 
a stock 2.0L Type4 up to 2.1L? I believe the stock barrels are 94mm and 
the 2100cc kit supplies 96mm barrels and cylinders. I'm just curious 
what complications this would cause. I'm guessing the first problem 
would be the heat, depending on the cylinder barrel wall thickness. Also 
-stock- FI would run lean, but this is fine as I'd be running dual 
carbs. Basically I'm just looking for someone with some related 
experience moreso than theory on how it would work.

Thanks,
-Nathan
