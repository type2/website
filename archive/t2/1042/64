You mention:
*
New Pistons and Cylinders showed up this morning along with intake and
exhaust gaskets for the project.
*

How about using either the HEAD gaskets (four) or BARREL shims (four).  You
will want to put the BARREL shims on BEFORE you load on the BARRELS/LINERS

I don't think either the head gaskets or the barrel shims come with the
standard P&L suite.    Could someone chime in??


Also, if you are doing either the fan hub seal, or the flywheel seal, you
would want the corresponding O-ring, definitely.


And I keep crying about the push rod tube o-rings . . .
and the Fuel Injector  lower seals, the small ones . . .



Also you said:  I'm  still trying to source out the little air deflector
that clips
into the  underside of the head

and Mark D said:  hey Jules   those should be already on the new heads.

how about Karl tell us what the heck they are talking about!!
