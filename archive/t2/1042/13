Well I was downshifting to go up a hill when I released the clutch the
engine didn't sound right - so I pulled over. She was still running at
this point but making a loud tapping.

After I pulled the valve covers and looked at the valves (#3 exhaust
looks sunken) I started her up with the valve covers removed - looking
at the drivers side valves while running, they all looked like they
were opening and closing correctly.

Then it started making a loud clunking. At this point I killed the engine.

Now when I try to turn over by hand I only have about 180 degrees of
motion before she hangs up.

thanks
