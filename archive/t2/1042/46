Subject: My bus is driving me up the wall

Hi everyone,

First time poster, long time reader. I have a 1972 Type 2 Kombi. My bus is
really weird. I bought it a few months ago and it ran flawlessly. Two times,
while I was still in my parents town, the bus just died and would not start.
After a while, it just fired right back up and ran great again. I drove it
about 250 miles on the highway with no issues. After being in my town for a
week or so, the bus just wouldn't start again. Sometimes it wont even turn
over. It just clicks once. I first figured that it would be the battery or the
starter, but they both check out fine. When it does turn over it sounds great
except that it wont start. I changed the fuel filter, the plugs, wires, cap
and rotor. I can tell that the fuel pump does work because it is electric and
I can hear it working when I try to start it. Also, the fuel is making it past
the pump, I can see it clearly making it to the filter. I went ahead and tried
pouring some gas down the carbs and had no luck. After it wouldn't start for a
few weeks of little trying, I went out and it fired right up again and ran
perfect for a few hours of errands. At the last stop I came out to head back
home and it started but then died and hasn't started since then. Sorry if this
seems drawn out, I just want to give as much info as I have. At this point, I
am looking for any possible solutions. I look forward to hearing from you.

I believe it is a 1600 cc motor with dual webber carbs.


Thanks,
Colin
