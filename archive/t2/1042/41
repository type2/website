>I also need a dipstick boot and a left side heater hose grommet

On the suggestion of a friend at work, I made a relacement left side heater
hose grommet using a piece of fuel hose (though any similar heat, oil and fuel
resistant hose would do). I simply cut a slit down one side of the hose and
fed it around the hole so that the slit went over the edge of the hole in the
tinware. I then marked where to trim it and took it off to trim the excess. It
doesn't completely fill the hole but it is a lot better than no grommet!
