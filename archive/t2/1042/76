Hi there,

As others have said, replace all P & C's together for proper balance and
power.  As for the little air deflector, yes I would try to locate some "IF"
they don't already come attached to your new heads which are about to arrive.
If you need to, perhaps you can located a pair of 'em on old heads in a local
junkyard, carefully remove them (I think they are wedged into the passage) and
wedge them into you heads.  I will be doing this also to a NOS pair of VW
Brazil 1600 cc single port heads that I have.  My heads do not have those air
deflectors either.  Hopefully you new heads will.  Without them, your heads
will work, they'll just cool even better if they have them.  They are fairly
important, VW updated their heads with them at some point in history...

The best of luck to you, I'm in St. Louis, MO but not close enough to really
help.  Call anytime today if you need advice (636) 949-BILL
