Subject: Rewiring '72 main harness

I tried posting this once and think I messed up because I received no
response.

I have a 72 sunroof van that has had extensive rewiring, and not the
good kind.  I drove it into my garage, so it worked, but there were 3
different switches and knobs you had to use to start it.  Nothing on the
column(blinkers, key, etc.) worked and there were more switches and
buttons mounted on Dashboard.  Every wire has been spliced or repaired
at least once. The whole van was like this.

So I removed and renovated the dash and ordered a wiring harness
(bus-boys.com.)  I now have the harness and am ordering blinkers and
lights, etc. because many are not original or even close.  This job
keeps getting bigger.

Has anyone done this before and can give me a few clues as to what I do
not want to do?  I am installing the new main harness, and would like a
better idea of where all these wires go (I have the Haynes schematics,
but I would think there would be more detail available). No wires are
marked or labeled, and many of the color codes in the schematic do not
match the existing wiring or the new harness.

My biggest problem right now is that the main harness drops out of the
engine compartment below the floor and then goes into a void or dead
space created by the floor of the cargo area (top of void) and a plate
about 4 inches (maybe) below it (it continues out of the front of this
void and then back up into the van and the dashboard area).  Can I just
pull the harness through or is there something connected in this void?
Anyone know what I am talking about?

Any help or advice would be appreciated; I am going to start on it this
weekend, hopefully.

Thanks everyone.
