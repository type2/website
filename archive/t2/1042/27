Thanks for the help with my speedo problem.  I've disconected it and all
is well.  Had a bit more trouble though yesterday.  I smelled gas, which
is never good.  It was raining hard so it was hard to trace but I thought
it was the line to the fuel pump so I tightened the claps (they were
loose!?!?).  This morning, still smelling gas :-(.  Found it dripping off
the fuel filter, the actualy filter was leaking.  I'm in Cheticamp
NS...there is nothing here...fortunately the NAPA had a fuel filter for a
carb bus and a skilled (read: old) mechanic at the Goodyear place was able
to fit it with a bit a fuel line re-sizing.  It looks solid...so I hope
that's the end of that.

Pictures coming...sometime

Cheers,
James
