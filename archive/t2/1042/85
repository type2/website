I don't know much about thermodynamics, but this might be interesting 
regarding exhaust wrap:

"Its purpose is twofold. First, to insulate the exhaust tubing so the 
waste gasses do not cool immediately after leaving the heads, thus 
maintaining their velocity. This is important. If the exhaust cools 
suddenly on leaving the heads, it slows down, making the motor work 
harder to push it out the exahust tubing, muffler, and tailpipe. Don't 
forget, it is the force of your piston that has to do the job of pushing 
that exhaust out, wasting horsepower."

This came from

Whether it's right or not, not really sure.. but if it is, a hotter 
exhaust path might be better for the engine...
