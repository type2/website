VW made an automatic transmission for that bus, problem is that the
frame was also somewhat modified to hold it, and retrofitting can be
difficult.   you also could put the latter 010 auto transmission which
is more reliable and would fit.. but it also has the modified frame
issue.

something is wrong, I haven't driven a manual bus in years but it was
never very hard to shift.  sounds like you would be better served by
getting your transmission "right" it also would likely be a lot
cheaper
