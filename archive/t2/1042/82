If you're looking for cheap and easy, fix the manual tranny.

First thing to try is clutch adjustment. Even if you think it's good, double check anyway.

There's a very good chance that you just need to replace ALL shifter bushings that have not already been done and re-adjust everything. The job itself is not hard, bit I think you may need to remove the tranny (and engine) to disconnect the shift rod from the nose of the tranny. Maybe you can just loosen the tranny attachments?

Worst case, you might need a rebuilt tranny.  In the grand scheme of things, even that would not be too expensive compared with a modern vehicles.  

It's possible you have a worn synchro on second gear...that would be caused by misadjusted shift linkages or possibly really unusual utilization of the vehicle at some point in it's life (low speed, excessive shifting between middle gears?).  Only fix for that is a rebuilt tranny.
