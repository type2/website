Subject: Re: [T2] Stranded in Nebraska Update

Hi Mark D is right on,

The new P/C's all came with the rings pre-installed. I wish I knew, as
now I've got extra rings. Well one thing I've learned so far in the
past few days is there is nothing wrong with having spares of
anything.

I've current;y got the 3/4 side completely stripped down, heads are
off and the p/c's are removed.

On the advice of some list members I'm going to go ahead and strip
down the 1/2 next. So, what initally looked like a single p/c and one
side head replacement has become a full top end rebuild. This is
probably better in the long run and once done will hopefully impart
the necessary confidence to continue westward on my journey to Wyoming
then back home to new york in a few weeks.

I've gotta say, despite the current challenges this has been a great
trip. I've crossed almost 3/4 of the country on state and local
highways alone - no interstates - and although this isn't my first
x-country drive (my first in my bus), I've certainly seen and
appreciated more of America than ever before.

And of course all your help, advice, and assistance has helped me get
to sleep at night.

I'm sure I'll have some more questions as I go, and I'll keep you all
posted on my status.

A hughe heartfelt Thank You to everyone!

peace
jules
