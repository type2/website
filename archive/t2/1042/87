Subject: Re: [T2] CarbDilemma

On my previous motor, an 1800cc,  I used Weber 34ICTs. They ran pretty
well....they were easier to tune than the stock '72-'74  dual solex
setup, but still took a bit of tweaking to get it just right. I got
maybe 1-2mpg better with the weber setup over the solexes, no
noticeable performance change. I eventually replaced that motor with a
rebuilt fuel injected 2000cc and got much better gas mileage, maybe a
5mpg improvement. I know installing fuel injection on a non FI bus is
not the easiest retrofit, but I'd do it 100 times before going back to
carbs. There are lots of benefits other than the mileage.
