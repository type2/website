Subject: Removing the ignition switch

So, you all probably remember my post recently about removing the  
ignition switch from our westy.  The archives and Bentley seemingly  
cover any info needed for doing this, but I am worried I may break  
something.  Specifically, I am stuck at the process of removing the  
two flat head screws that sit within the screw lock plate mounting  
holes.  Should be very hard to remove?  The only screw drivers I have  
that fit up in that hole are apparently not strong enough to handle  
the job.

Any thoughts?  Pic of the hole am talking about is at http://calivw78.com/2008/06/25/removing-ignition-switch
