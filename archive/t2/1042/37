Subject: Stranded: Possible Causes

Hi,

Still here in Valentine Nebraska waiting until monday, tuesday and
wednesday when the parts show up.

Just checked my connecting rod, to be clear this is the part that
connects the piston head to the crankshaft, correct? It seems to still
be straight.

I did notice that the little piece of cooling tin that "clips" under
the head had dropped off somewhere along the way. I'd imagine this is
hurting the cooling on the 3/4 side, and could be a possible cause of
my dropped valve. I am still taking a look at the entire cooling
system to see what went wrong.

Does anyone have a part number for this item? Know where I can get one
on short notice?

Perhaps someone could help a brother out and drop one in the mail
today? I will gladly reinburse you via pay-pal for your efforts.

It will get to me via the following:
