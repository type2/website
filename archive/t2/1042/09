On earlier '71-'72 models, there is a metal center brace that pulls both
cables together, which helps the cables clear the booster. This solid metal
piece is usually missing because it is discarded when people change the
cables, but some still exist. (bustedbus.com or bus-boys.com or busco.com)

When swapping boosters, the later ones are of course bit larger which cause
rubbing. By finding a brace from a '71-'72 you can keep them from rubbing.
Also some higher quality replacement cables have plastic sheathing over the
cable which keeps them from rubbing.

One other thing to consider is the emergency brake cable. I have a the
later, larger booster in my '74 and the e-brake cable rubs up against
it when engaged and disengaged. It started to wear the cable. I had to
do some adjusting and ended up encasing it in a rubber tube to prevent
damage to the cable. it hasn't given me much trouble since.
