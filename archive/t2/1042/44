Don't know which hone they are using in the videos Jack, but Sunnen hones 
have been used for years to refinish cylinder bores in engines. These are 
big floor machines that are set up like a milling machine and nowadays are 
computer controlled. Fantastic to watch, and yes .001 or even finer 
tolerances are attainable. In the world of high performance, no expense is 
too great. :-) I have rebuilt many engines using low tech hones that are 
powered by your drill. The best hand held ones use small "balls" of 
carborundum or similar material, and do a great job for the home handyman. 
Re-ringing cylinders that are still within tolerance for standard pistons is 
an easy job.
Take care,
Courtney

 I'm just fascinated by the cylinder honing videos on YouTube.
