One more note on the noise level in my bus.
I purchased a digital noise meter from Radio Shack.
As a result of the carpet padding on the panels in the cab, the noise level 
at 70mph on the freeway dropped from a nominal of 100-104dbC down to 95dbC.
Note the dbC designation. It covers lower frequencies than dbA.
