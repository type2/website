I once took a not too bad running Type1 engine apart to rebuild and found a 
bent connecting rod. So I guess they can run this way.

If his is the case, am I dead in the water or will I be able to
 continue on my journey. Basically how bent is too bent?

 In order to replace the connecting rod I'd need to split the case, correct?

 thanks
