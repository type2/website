Hi Everyone,

This morning I pulled the 1/2 head and cylinders. I'm glad I took all
your advice and did so as the top rings on both 1 and 2 were falling
to pieces. Everything is now prepped and ready for P/C and head
installation when my heads arrive (hopefully) tomorrow. I'm getting a
little excited at the prospect that my bus might even run better than
before when this saga is over.

Here's another question for you all, keep in mind this is a 1600 DP engine:

My heater tubes that go from the fan shroud through the tin to the
heater boxes is falling apart. Rather than try find replacement tubes
or patch these with duct tape I'm considering capping off the air
ports at the shroud and on the tinware, thereby eliminating air going
to the heater boxes and heating system. My first instinct tells me
this might not be the best idea, but I've seen it done on a few
upright engines in the past. What's the conventional wisdom here? I
would think this would mean more cooling air going to the cylinders
and heads, BUT of course now I've got extra-hot heat exchangers with
no air passing over them. I would think that the action of cool air
over the HE's serves some cooling effect, but I'm purely speculating.

Thoughts?

peace
