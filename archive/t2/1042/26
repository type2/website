Thanks to everyone for all the help and suggestions so far.

Here's an update.

Pulled the head, I did indeed drop the #3 exhaust valve and I've
successfully embedded it in the top of the piston. Doesnt look like
any damage beyond the head and the piston thankfully.

I've ordered a new DP head and a new P&C and rings, which are all
being dropped shipped here and I should be recieving them on Monday or
Tuesday.

Anything other parts you folks think I might need for this repair?
I've got intake and exhaust gaskets on the way too...

Caveats?

Well nothing to do now but go find something to do in town for a few days.

Will gladly buy anyone a beer if they want to come to Valentine
Nebraska and hang out and talk VW's with me ;) If you want to help me
put my engine back together I'd gladly offer you dinner too.

peace
