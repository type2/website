Subject: Sound Deadening and Insulation

I found this stuff on JC Whitney and thought I would ask if anyone has used
it. User review seem to give it pretty high marks!

I was thinking about using it for all of my floor boards in the front,
middle and back of the bus. I figure that the "insulation" factor might work
to keep it a little warmer in the winter as well as cooler in the summer.

Anyone familiar with it? Seems reasonably prices as well, I could do my
whole bus with 2 rolls of the 4x6! Only $60!!!
