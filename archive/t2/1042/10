Jules,

What were the symptoms before it seized? Was the motor pounding, knocking or
tapping?

Sounds ominous.

Hi,

So here's a few of the syptoms:

Turning the engine by hand (forward) I hit a dead stop a just before #1 TDC.

Turning the engine by hand (backwards) I hit a dead stop just before
(after really, just that I'm turning backwards) TDC on #3.

Bottom end stuff is new to me. Am I screwed?

peace
