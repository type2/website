Hi,

New Pistons and Cylinders showed up this morning along with intake and
exhaust gaskets for the project.

Two new heads should also be here on wednesday.

I figure while I've got the engine out I should just ahead and refresh
all the parts that may be prone to failure.

Not sure if I'm going to replace all 4 p/c's, I may, since I have them
and I've got plenty of time on my hands.

I'm still trying to source out the little air deflector that clips
into the underside of the head, not the lower cylinder air deflector
that all the vendors keep reffering me to.

A part number would be of great assistance, or if anyone knows where I
can get one, or will send me one, that would be beautiful too.

I think this is the last part I need to to a complete roadside top end
rebuild. This should be fun, and once I've secured this last part I
will be able to rest much easier.

Can anyone help?

Thanks!
