Are you talking about the vacuum hose that runs up to the booster or the 
brake booster itself.  If you're talking about the hose, it's just 
manifold vacuum, nothing more.  You can take off the t-fitting and run 
it straight to the decel valve.  It's just an auxiliary line to help the 
booster out.. if you don't have a booster, no help needed..
