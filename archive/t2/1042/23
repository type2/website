Subject: Type 4 for Baja

I'm in the process of setting up my spare (GE) type 4 2.0 bus motor for 
use in my baja bug. Right now its in the rebuild & theorize phase. One 
of the questions I have is this: What do I do with the break booster? 
Can I just plug it off without causing harm/poor running conditions? Or 
say, use it to power an air horn.....

Also, I know that sandrails do this so its been done... but what must be 
done for the engine to sufficiently cool itself when in an open air 
atmosphere? As far as I can tell I'd just leave all the engine tin but 
the perimeter pieces on and bolt it on as-is, but I could be wrong.

Thanks,
-Nathan
