Eddie:

Sweet trip report!

Nothing like a bus to take to a concert.

My wife and I were at a Blues fest back in 2004 in our '87.  I had just
washed and waxed it, had the ShadyBody and Nancy was inside making salmon,
aspargus and new potatos.  I was sitting under the awning with a glass of
white and a dude under the influence of some happy stuff wandered and said:
"Dude - is that a VW?"  I said:  "It sure is!"  He said: " I thought weren't
supposed to come out with a new van until 2005!?"

We had a good laugh on that one.

Taking the '79 to Dunegrass this year.  Outfitting it with the Bopsax Ozark
Trails 11x8 Canopy and a Yakima bike rack.

It's the only way to go!
