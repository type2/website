They certainly work as they are pretty much identical in throat size to the
stock carbs. This similarity is I suspect the main reason why they are not
seen as an improvement over stock. Of course new carbs will be better than
leaky old ones. Dual twin throat carbs are generally regarded as the best carb
solution but are of course the most expensive option!

Having replaced my single weber with weber icts I can offer some words of
wisdom if you go down this path :). Firstly you will need to have a balance
tube between the carb manifolds (probably part of the kit). Secondly you only
need to attach the vacuum advance to one carb - just block the other one off.
Thirdly you will need to get a "snail" type synchrometer to synchronise the
carbs. It measures the air flow through each carb. Finally, as you have no
chokes in these carbs, I would try and adapt your stock air cleaner to the
weber icts to get some warm air in. Probably more critical to you in the UK to
me in Australia! This is on my "gunna" list i.e. I'm gunna do it someday.
