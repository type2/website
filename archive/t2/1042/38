Subject: CarbDilemma

I had made up my mind to buy a new dual ICT kit for my 72 camper (73 model
with replacement 1800) while on vacation in New England next month.   Buying
from Weber Carbs Direct.   I actually live in London England - the UK one.
This decision was taken to cure the problems of worn and troublesome original
carbs.  Then I found the archive on this site, read everything I could find
about webers, and now I'm so confused about whether they will even work - let
alone improve things - I just don't know what to do.
Has anyone actually succeeded with such a mod, and what were the results?   In
other words, can they be made to work really well, and is the result better or
worse power/fuel economy.   Remember we are paying $10 a gallon over her and
it's still rising.
It seems as if I have to be very careful to get certain jets etc in the things
initially, and then buy lots of others to get anywhere with setting them up -
something I would have to pay high labour rates for as I am unable to do it
myself.
Should I continue to suffer my stock set up and leave room in my suitcase for
other goodies?

Sincerely

Ches Cole
