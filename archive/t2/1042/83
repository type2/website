Subject: 70 single cab engine is missing like crazy

Guys,

Hello, it has been a long time since i have been on the list, but i finally
got my 1970 single cab back from the paint shop and got it running, well sort
of.

It has a 1776 with dual kadrons on it.  I pulled the motor to freshen it up
and repaint the tin, and prior to that it ran fine .  I put it back in the
truck this week, and it is missing like crazy..i thought it was old gas, but
but premium in it, and still missing and backfiring like nuts.  I checked the
timing, it is ok, and it looks like the plug wires are on right. Any other
easy fixes?  I think i am missing something obvious.  It has been a while
since i tinkered with a vw motor. I did have to remove the kadrons when
p[ulling the motor, and pout them back on when i reinstalled.

Thanks in advance for any obvious troubleshooting ideas i have missed out on.
