Subject: Alternator Sealing Ring

I have a 76 bus 2.0 and need an alternator sealing ring.Anyone know where to
get one?How hard is this to put in?I also need a oil pressure sending unit
boot or grommet the little round rubber piece that seals up the hole where the
oil pressure wire comes through the engine tin.I have been unable to find
these at the usual suppliers.I believe they are probably NLA.Good used would
be fine.I also need a dipstick boot and a left side heater hose grommet
although I believe these two are available but if you have an extra you want
to get rid of let me know.
