Subject: Re: What's under that front seat? 9 passenger Loaf

Joel asked: Anyone have a picture or a description of what is under the MIDDLE
part of the FRONT bench seat in a 9 passenger loaf? I've had a few loaf
westies with just two seats up front and a walk-thru space in the middle, but
in the 9 passenger vans with the bench in front, is that area under the seat
filled with something, or can it be used for storage? Joel in Philly

That is where the spare tire waits for you to have a flat :)
