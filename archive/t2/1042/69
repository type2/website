Jules said: Two new heads should also be here on wednesday. and I'm still
trying to source out the little air deflector that clipsinto the underside of
the head, not the lower cylinder air deflectorthat all the vendors keep
reffering me to. A part number would be of great assistance, or if anyone
knows where Ican get one, or will send me one, that would be beautiful too. I
think this is the last part I need to to a complete roadside top endrebuild.
This should be fun, and once I've secured this last part Iwill be able to rest
much easier.

Are you referring to little piece that is between the two cylinders of the
head and has a hole in it for the thermostat to go thru?  If yes, it is not
available separate that I know of. It is not pictured here at all:

I believe it is part of the head and since you are getting two new heads, it
should be in both.

I think a lot of people thought you meant #9 here:
