Single port or dual port? If single port, I can FedEx you a used head from
Colorado. Dual port, I may be able to get you a used one in a couple of
days.

Thanks Mark,

I just pulled the rocker arms and the #3 exhaust valve stem pulled
right out, it appears to be snapped in half.

Guess this verifies your theory, I have indeed dropped a valve.

I only ran the engine like this for a few moments, initially pulling
over and once for a few seconds while doing diagnostics.

I'm crossing my fingers that this is only a top end problem. Won't
know for sure now until I pull the engine and head and take a closer
look.
