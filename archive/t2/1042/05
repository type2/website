sealing ring is obsolete. we bought the entire world supply about a  
year ago. it wasn't very many, by the way, maybe 20 or so, but it was  
all that were left. they are now all gone except for one which i kept  
so as to be able to make a repro some fine day. left side heater  
grommet is also obsolete.

the oil switch boot is widely available as is the dipstick boot.
