What are you guys running a Weber progressive
setting your distributor to... ?
It's a bitsa engine...2L with hydraulics and vacuum
advance dizzy...
It's in an immovable position...The front beam rusted
and collapsed but the engine turns by hand so I'd like
to see if the engine runs before removing it...
