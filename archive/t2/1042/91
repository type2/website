Subject: use Ps & Cs as received?

Just curious. Do you use new pistons and cylinders straight from the box?

In the past, I've removed each piston and given the cylinders a 
Hoover cleaning with bon ami.
I just received a new set. I no longer have my scale, so there is no 
need for me to remove the pistons to balance them.
So I'm tempted to dispense with the cleaning and just mount the 
assemblies on the case.
Thanks,
jack
