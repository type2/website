Pull the valve covers.
Check the valve stems/rocker arms for obvious clearance/alignment issues or
damage.
Pull the plugs and shine a light into the cylinders, look for evidence of
something pounding into the top of the cylinder
Turn the engine by hand with the plugs out. Any liquid present? Has the van
been sitting, or is it a driver broken down?

About how many revolutions, or degrees, do you turn the crank from stop to
stop?
