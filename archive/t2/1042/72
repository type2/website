the HEAD gaskets (four) or BARREL shims (four). Youwill want to put the BARREL
shims on BEFORE you load on the BARRELS/LINERS I don't think either the head
gaskets or the barrel shims come with thestandard P&L suite. Could someone
chime in?? Also, if you are doing either the fan hub seal, or the flywheel
seal, youwould want the corresponding O-ring, definitely. And I keep crying
about the push rod tube o-rings . . .and the Fuel Injector lower seals, the
small ones . . . Also you said: I'm still trying to source out the little air
deflectorthat clipsinto the underside of the head and Mark D said: hey Jules
those should be already on the new heads. how about Karl tell us what the heck
they are talking about!! ------------------------------

Hey guys..... you need to look at Jules signature on his posts:
He has a 1971 1600DP engine.

Do NOT confuse him with type 4 head gaskets!!!

On type 1 heads, there is a pressed-in metal plate with a slot in it. It is
between the two cylinders.

I just took a picture of it and put it here:
