I ran one for years using the standard settings for that carb from
http://www.oldvolkshome.com/ and it worked fine. In my case it was an idle
setting of 7.5 deg BTDC.

You will need to check that the distributor is advancing properly. I had to
strip mine and free up the advance mechanisms because the grease had dried up.
I eventually replaced it because the timing scatter at high revs was too
great.
