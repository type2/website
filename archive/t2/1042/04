Subject: RE: [T2] Door question

You want a late 76 to 79 door, due to a hinge change. Karl will give you the
VIN cutoff point.
If you get an earlier door, you can use your current hinge and the
conversion kit that busdepot sells.

I want to replace my front doors the the 77.  Will other years fit?   
I'm guessing that any bay doors will be the same, but thought I'd  
better check.
