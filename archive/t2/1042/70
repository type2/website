Karl,

Yes I think thats what everyone thought, but I have both of those.
What you describe, the little pice that goes between then two
cylinders on the head and has a slot cut in it - well I never knew
this was for a thermostat because (blushing) I don't have thermostats.

Yes I know, I know. And now I really know. Thermostats and flaps are
important. I could blame the PO but I've owned this bus long enough to
take responsibility for my own stupidity.

Now since I know those are for the thermostat and since a few folks
have mentioned that they aren't part of the air deflection/cooling
system I will stop losing sleep over one missing.

To comment on the head gasket debate, I plan on using the paper gasket
between the jugs and case (with permatex 3H as a sealant)  as
illustrated on page 133 of Wilson's "How to rebuild your VW air-cooled
engine".

I also plan on lapping the jugs to the cylinder heads and purchased
lapping compound here at the FLAPS.

There never were shims on this engine, and I'm not going to change
that at the moment although a full overhaul, including recalculation
of the CR, when I finally get home is long past due.

To comment on the other items, I'm not planning on replacing the oil
cooler seals or any other seal I haven't had to remove to this point.

thanks
jules
