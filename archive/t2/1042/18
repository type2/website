Subject: What's under that front seat? 9 passenger Loaf 

Anyone have a picture or a description of what is under the MIDDLE part of the FRONT bench seat in a 9 passenger loaf? I've had a few loaf westies with just two seats up front and a walk-thru space in the middle, but in the 9 passenger vans with the bench in front, is that area under the seat filled with something, or can it be used for storage?
