Subject: More on high hydrocarbons failing emmission test- no one

    Not one person commented on why my HC was so high (1128) with 0.25% 
CO- the latter suggests mix is OK?  I pulled the plugs, no carbon 
fouling.  The compression shows a weak #3 (117 PSI with others being 
1=150, 2=140, and 4=150. I added oil to #3 and it went to 133 PSI.  The 
hydraulic valve adjustment is correct. Rings?  Not enough down to 
suggest oil burning and I do not lose oil. Air cleaner is OK.
    Further checks- timing is OK, plugs seem to fire based on timing 
light. Dissconnected the Cold Start Valve and all injectors, lifting 
rail enough to see tips.  Nary a drop with a full minute of running 
pump! So what gives?  I can replace Air Flow Meter, or set it to be 
really lean at idle?  Can a rich screw setting really give that high a 
HC reading, andf my milage of 16 does suggest rich running?
I had better emmissions when the engine had 250,000 mi on it!  Rebuilt 
last July, run 5K mi.
