Hey Mark D,

That dummy must have been me as I put that head on my engine. I'm just
thinking that if this is the case then there's an old head sitting on
my bench at home with this important piece on tinware on it, instead
of on my engine.

Looks like I'm going to need a new one. Can anyone suggest a source?

thanks
Jules
