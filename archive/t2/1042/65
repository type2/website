Hi Nathan,

Stock Fi will not run lean with larger P+Cs. L-Jetronic FI meters fuel 
according to airflow, so the system would automatically deliver more 
fuel when the displacement is increased. The only time it would run lean 
is at Wide Open Throttle, and in the real world no-one's running at 
5400RPM on purpose, so I wouldn't worry about it.

Plenty of people have been running 1.8L FI on 2L engines, and no-one has 
complained about it around here that I've heard of.

Happy Trails,
