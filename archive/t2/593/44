But David, is the resulting vehicle a "bus"? That's the question. Seems 
to me it's a counterfeit.

When you buy a bus, you sign on to the limitations of the thing. 
Swapping in a watercooled engine isn't like installing a Pertronix. 
It's a decision (IMHO) that you don't really want a bus.

Anyway, I am getting worried now that two of the most senior and 
sensible members of the list -- not to mention the fact that they are 
list admins -- think that these conversions are a good idea.
