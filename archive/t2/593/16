Subject: Re: [T2] PUSHROD TUBE SEALANT

T-4s use solid PR tubes, while T-1s use accordian tubes. Accordian tubes
change width as the engine grows/narrows with temperatures. T-4s have
o-rings, which "roll" a little bit to seal. If you silicone the crap out of
them and make them solid, you'll only make a huge mess, AND the o-rings will
stop rolling in the head and case bores, and it will start leaking.
