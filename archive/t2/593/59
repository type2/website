> Why is it that so many bus's are sold with the engine out?

Well one of the reasons is because of the ^%&% sandrailers!! They rob the
"old buses" of the engine and tranny so they can make themselves a dune
buggy vehicle. I have heard tales of a lot of buses being sent off to the
crusher after they rob the engine. I did run across two ads on the Samba in
the last 6 months or so, where the ad stated they had robbed the engine for
their bune buggy, but would like to keep the old bus alive. Ok so why not
just find an engine like the person who saved the bus would have to do. It
frustrates me greatly!!!

Another reason might be because the engine went bad, was removed and then
sold to raise cash for a "new" or rebuilt engine. Plans go astray and they
are left with a good bus that has no engine.
