Subject: Heads for sale?

With all of this talk of replacing heads, I've still got that pair of new,
unused heads for sale if anyone's interested.  Here's the dope from my
earlier message:
-------
Part number 029 198 075, in the original packaging.  It's a partial kit, 2
complete cylinders with pistons, a 94mm piston kit for a 2L.  The pistons
are in their original wrappings and have never been used.  There's also an
open set of seals and gaskets, a Victor Reinz gasket set for a 2L 914.

I was told that $100.00 for each cylinder would be acceptable (Thanks,
Richard), but I'm open to offers.  The partial gasket kit goes with the pair
(no cost).

Someone offered me $80.00 for both cylinders/pistons/gaskets, but I was
hoping for something a bit higher.  Anyone interested?
