For the same reason that many Ford model A and T owners have Pinto engines
under the hood and (gasp!) hydraulic brake conversions.  They like their
cars and want to make them better and safer for driving.

I never said anything about "defacing" a bus.  The best conversions are
invisible and reversable.

No conventional minivan provides the interior space of a VW bus on such a
small footprint.  What's wrong with improving on a good thing?

Have you checked out a KEP subaru/vanagon conversion? It's done so cleanly
that VW should have done in the first place instead of inflicting us with
the wasserboxer.

Yes, a 1600DP has pushed my bus around for over 300K miles, but with the
demise of the Beetle in Mexico these engines are going to become rarer and
more expensive.  I see no harm in investigating reliable alternatives to
keep our buses on the road.
