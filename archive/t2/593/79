Subject: Re: [T2] Buses with watercooled engines

Since it was my post that sparked this, let me reply first. In fact,
Mark, you gave me my best argument:

"Aircooled buses make the world a richer, more diverse place. Buses say
loudly that "there is no one right way" to make a vehicle, and they do
that (again, IMHO) better than any other vehicle on the road."

There's no right way!

My way isn't right for you. Your way doesn't have to be right for me either.
