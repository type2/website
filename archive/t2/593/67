What happens just as often, I'll bet, is that some guy decides to sell 
his bus because he needs the money to pay the rent. A buyer shows up 
and says: "I'll give you $300 for the whole bus, or $300 for just the 
engine and tranny." Smart buyer. The guy thinks he's ahead, but is 
stuck with the bus-no-engine. Then he has to wait around until someone 
else is willing to buy that.
