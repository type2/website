Any location will work if:

1. the radiator has sufficient capacity
2. sufficient airflow is provided
3. Hot air is not allowed to recirculate through the radiator

Numbers 2 and 3 seem to be the hardest for engine swappers to accommodate.

Direct ram air is best, but some don't want to hang the radiator on the
front or on the roof like RoadCow.  Other viable locations are under the
bus between the frame rails, at the side of the engine bay, and replacing
the rear hatch.  Each has advantages and disadvantages.  My personal
favorite is placement at the side of the engine bay as this doesn't change
the outside look and takes advantage of the existing ducting to prevent
recirculation.  A fan will be needed, as the air vents of the bus are
designed for a fan-forced cooling system.

Recirculation is the problem most ignored by swappers.  I recall seeing a
bus with a 1.8 liter Subaru installed that had a radiator that could have
cooled a small block Chevy, but it was simply bolted on in place of the
rear hatch.  With no ram air and no shrouding to prevent hot air from
recirculating back I wasn't surprised that he experienced overheating.
