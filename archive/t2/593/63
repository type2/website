Mark I see your point....I guess if you go to the junkyard you might say
"hmmm that bus has a good engine, I could rebuild it as a spare for my bus".
I guess the next guy that comes along says..."hmmm that bus could be brought
back, just needs an engine". haha

The engine I have "in the box" to be rebuilt fortunately came from a bus
that was going to the crusher the next week, so I gave the guy $200 for
everything I could pull off or out in 2 days. I got most everything!!! They
had to drag the poor bust up on the truck, but it's spirit will live on in
my bus, once I get the engine rebuilt.
