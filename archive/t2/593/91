Subject: Time to rewrite the charter?

I quote, from the second paragraph of the charter (emphasis added)

"This list is only about AIRCOOLED Volkswagen Transporters, Vanagons 
and Caravelles, model years 1968 through 1983. If you have an earlier 
bus, or a WATERCOOLED bus, you are on the wrong list."

Looks like it's time to rewrite this to read:

"This list is only about originally aircooled Volkswagen Transporters, 
Vanagons and
Caravelles, model years 1968 through 1983. If you have an earlier bus, 
or an originally watercooled bus, you are on the wrong list."

Although I would prefer:

"This list is only about originally aircooled Volkswagen Transporters, 
Vanagons and
Caravelles, model years 1968 through 1983, along with zombie buses that 
have had their souls removed and replaced for convenience. If you have 
an earlier bus, or an originally watercooled bus, you are on the wrong 
list."

But since I seem to be a minority of one, I'll settle for the first 
rewording.
