I actually looked at the 7 piece set at Harbor Freight in its SAE version.
They are
the same thickness and quality as the wrenches I got at ACE which appear
identical to the Sears/Craftsman wrenches. The are not the Harbor Freight
brand. However I know of no application for the 18 mm size wrench. But at
$29.99
it would still be only $5 a wrench even if you threw the 18 mm away. Much
less than
I paid at ACE.
