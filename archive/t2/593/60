Is it just me or is there a reason for this?

Because it's not '69 or whatever year the particular bus is...
If it was, the easiest thing would have been to pop over to
the local VW mechanic and drop in another engine...Even 
J. C. Whitney carried VW engines for really cheep...And
the boneyards were full of VW's ripe for the pickin'...
The exact same thing was true for my Bugeye Sprite
when I first bought it...$50 Spridgets were plentiful
with body damage that might make them undriveable,
but with complete drop-in mechanicals...
I imagine the same is true today for any Honda or
Toyota or other common vehicle...
