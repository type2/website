Question???
I have a  VW beetle motor on my  VW trike ...I get alot of backfire threw the 
exhaust  ...when I give it throttle and then let back on the throttle it 
backfires something terrible... most of the time ONLY when I let up on the 
throttle 
other then that it runs great ...I have a baja exhaust on it so I'm able to 
see the flames shoot out the top...
once again it runs great I'm just alittle bit concerned if I'm doing damage 
to something and not even realizing it...and help will be appreciated...
thanks !
