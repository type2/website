im pretty sure you could switch out the heads,
manifold, etc. and slap them on the bottom end of the
dual port, but you will have to take the top, inner
studs out of both sides of the case, and switch them
with the top, inner ones from the single port case as
dual ports use different studs. if you are in
nashville, get on thesamba.com under the classifieds
section, and look for an ad from a guy called J, he
has splitties and the motors and stuff so maybe he
could help?? good luck with the motor, and i hope i
helped a bit.
