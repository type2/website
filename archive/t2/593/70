...trying to figure out the best way to construct a hitch for my '71.  I have 
a good idea but I can't figure out the bolt size...

Hey Jamie, I posted a couple of days ago, looking for a Gibbes trailer hitch -- 
designed to put a tow ball at the rear of a Type 2; connects around the tube 
for the rear torsion bars.

You can turn the Gibbes around, using it on the FRONT of the bus, with a couple 
of simple steps.  Much easier than fabricating a towbar from scratch.  Got my 
69 Bay safely thru ~700 miles of towing.

But if you have a good idea, how about sharing some images??  Thanx, Glenn
