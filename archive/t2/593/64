Subject: Hineline cries "uncle!"

The offlist traffic to my mailbox overwhelming supports engine 
conversions. It has even crossed the line from a sort of libertarianism 
("if I want to do this no one has the right to stop me") that is sort 
of the soul of this list over to a matter of logic ("the conversion 
makes sense").

So I cry uncle. I'm a retro grouch.

I do hate to watch the decline of an appreciation for what VW achieved 
in these vehicles, though.
