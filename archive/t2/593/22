For that reason oil is the best installation lubricant and nothing else should go on.

I wanted to recant some advice I left in the archives. I've recently found out that Dow Corning 111 Valve Lubricant & Sealant isn't a good idea to use on the o-rings. Some porche engine builders use it but I've found out that it will shrink Viton 5% and cause regular silicone o-rings to swell.
