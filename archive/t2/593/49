I already answered that question in my previous post.  Just so there's no 
ambiguity, if a yes or no answer is required I believe the answer is "yes".

I didn't sign anything.

I disagree.  There are people who are so anal that they don't advocate ANY 
non-stock items at all *cough*TPStephens*cough*.  I will assume you're not 
in that vintage-n*zi camp, but you're somewhere to the right of where I am, 
which is somewhere to the right of the people who would put a radiator in 
place of their engine hatch.  We're all on the large sliding-scale of 
bus-conservatism, and each entitled to hold our position where we please 
without open expressions of resentment from our peers, which do nothing but 
create bad blood in the bus community.

And I'm getting worried about the lack of tolerance shown by other senior 
and sensible members of the list on certain topics.
