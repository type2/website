Subject: Continued AIRS drama/Nashville TN...help please

Listees,

Still trying to help Danny get back on the road to Arizona, he's trying to 
get that engine out of the 71 up and running but ran into some issues. He 
says it does have endplay which is weird because when we looked at the bus I 
made sure it was in neutral and checked for endplay and couldn't find any. 
Something is weird. Also he tried to adjust the valves on that engine and he 
can't get #1 to adjust, he was sure it was in firing position so I'm 
thinking busted/sunk valve or something.

My big question for the list is can we take the heads/manifold all that 
stuff of Dannys single port and get it to work with the dual port bottom 
end? I mean I guess we won't know for sure until we try (I'm going to try 
and help tomorrow, but I was hoping for some friendly advice from fellow bus 
owners more experienced than I.

Also he said his carb wouldn't find on the other engine's manifold (the dual 
port carb is suspect).....what's up with that? I thought they all fit ok but 
apparently not.

If anyone can help us out tomorrow that would be great, we are in over our 
heads. I usually do engine work at a snails pace refering to the Bentley the 
whole way through (which nether of us have a bay bentley) and whenever I run 
into something weird I research or ask for help....but he needs to get up 
and on the road ASAP so time is of the essence.

Alex? Faster Laster? Have plans for Sat???? Chris in Cookeville?

Thanks in advance for helping me attempt to help this guy, I/he appreciates 
it. And thanks those who have replied to recent posts.
