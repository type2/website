For what it's worth, though probably not much, I've never been an exact 
purist per say.  I've seen Scirraco (sp?) engines in baywindows and even the 
occaisonal v-8 and I've thought: well, that's interesting and certainly a 
creative feat of mechanics to cram that thing in there, but the aircooled 
flat-4's...the sound of one purring down the road...the marvel that they are 
among the modern cars...I can't imagine wanting to replace mine with 
anything less or more.

On a side note, the disappearance of engines from buses tends to be the act 
of small plane-kit enthusiasists and fan boat owners around here, since 
sandrails in this area are infrequent.

Oh, and for the first time in 4 years, my bus and I will be out camping next 
weekend.  I can't drive the thing myself anymore, but my new girlfriend is 
eager to, so off we go! woooohoooooo!  The bus may be lookin' ugly in 
primered bits, but I can tell from the way it jumps to life at the turn of a 
key that it's as eager as we are to hit the road and camp all weekend...
