thanks richard i respect your experience and opinion so do you know if the ones from busdepot are silicone or not those are the ones that i put on my tubes....
i tried the oil as a lubricant before but for some reason still ended up with bad leaks after a few hundred miles on the engine~!~
ever since we put sealent on my new engine though i havent found any leaks knock on wood....
should i expect trouble down the road?
thanks alot

For that reason oil is the best installation lubricant and nothing else should go on.

I wanted to recant some advice I left in the archives. I've recently found out that Dow Corning 111 Valve Lubricant & Sealant isn't a good idea to use on the o-rings. Some porche engine builders use it but I've found out that it will shrink Viton 5% and cause regular silicone o-rings to swell.
