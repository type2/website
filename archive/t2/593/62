Well, in this case, there is the right way, and the wrong way. There are a
lot of great aircooled mechanics out their in the eyes of many that throw
away thermostat flaps, they get a car with FI that is running poorly they
convince the owner to throw that fi crap out, and there are also those that
tear down an engine, merely eyeball the parts, KNOW the case does not need
bored, and that the crank is in spec, and start caking sealant on places it
should not be.

I am not one of those mechanics. I try my darndest to do things throughly,
and correctly. I have made my mistakes, but by gosh i learned from them,
and i also pay a lot of atttention to the repair manuals and the advice of
those that rebuild these things for a living.............

30 or more years doesnt know nothing either?

Pretty good chance of that IMHO.
