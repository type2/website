Yeah, but don't buck the tiger.  Make friends
with these guys.  Occasionally hang out where
they do and make it known that you look for old
buses.  Offer to pull the engine and tranny for
them and "dispose" of the rest of the bus.  They
don't want it anyway.  I've seen many trannies
and engines cut out of the body with a torch.  

Also, these guys often know alot about tuning and
tranny repairs.  Maybe you can eventually
convince one or two not to destroy our buse.
