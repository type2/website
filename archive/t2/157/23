Subject: '71 campmobile oil leak, steering clunk, problematic 1st

Hello all; 

Thanks for all the replies re: the poptop seal replacement. Got that on no
problem - the particular seal I ordered had a metal band, encased in
rubber, all the way around - it was so tight to push on that I would have
never been able to use any weatherstrip adhesive anyway...hope I didn't
miss something! 

A few things on my new (for me) '71 - as I said, I'm fairly new to these
vehicles (at least mechanically), so any help/tips is greatly appreciated
!  After it sat gleaming in my driveway after driving it 2 hours home, it
had dropped about a fist-sized oil spot onto the driveway, then stopped
when it cooled down (it didn't keep leaking all night...). A crawl
underneath the bus revealed some oil dripping from (and sorry for my lack
of technical knowledge here) the area where the round disc-shaped thing is
on the bottom of the engine. No obvious oil leakage when looking at the
engine bay from the back. Nothing leaking from the valve covers, etc. Is
there a common thing I should try looking for? I know this is vague, but...

Second thing - When steering to the right and bringing it back to center,
there is an obvious "clunk" somewhere in the mechanism. Any thoughts? 

And finally...1st gear is a bit of a bitch to select - the engine was
rebuilt by the previous owner top to bottom, but 1st remains rather hard
to find. Much harder than my previous '79 van. Also, when cruising in 3rd
gear, there is an audible whine from the motor. 

Thanks again in advance; 

All the best
dan
