I strongly suggest the engine and transaxle be very carefully inspected for damage.

The crankshaft is often bent in collisions of this type, even absent damage to the heat exchangers such as you describe.

Same with the transaxle.  They often sustain internal damage even without obvious leaks, cracks, etc.

the rest of traffic.

...The exhaust and the engine took the brunt of the crash unfortunately, the muffler was destroyed, both heater boxes were bent, broke an exhaust
stud, and caused a transmission oil leak.<<
