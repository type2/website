Chris,

What you have is a defective distributor!  Don't worry, tho, you can
certainly use it. If you look at the bottom of the distributor (the drive
dog), you will see it is held to the shaft with a pin.  If you punched the
pin out, and rotated the dog 180 degrees and drove the pin back in...
well, the pin would probably not fit because you mushroomed the end
driving it out (ask me how I know :), BUT.... can you see that the rotor
position would now be fine and normal?

OK, so that is what is wrong, and you could fix it (or bust it :) as I
just described, but you don't have to!  The thing is that from 1946 thru
?1963?, the distributors had a bit of extra retard cast into the dist and
cap for #3 cylinder, and could only be used one way... Since ?1963?,
however, the four spark plug wires in the cap and the lobes on the shaft
are all at 90 degrees to each other and do not give a hoot!  You can hook
any wire to any tower on the cap and it will work !!!IF!!! you have them
in the right sequence starting in the right place.  The way to accomplish
this feat of mechanical ingenuity is to:

remove spark plugs (all 4!);

remove the left side valve cover;

crawl under there and watch the valves while a friend rotates the engine;

your friend should turn the engine *clockwise* (this ain't no corvair! :);

when you see the intake valve for the forward (#1) cylinder close tell
your friend to stop!

at this point continue to rotate the engine another 180 degrees 'til the
mark on the pulley comes back to TDC;

You have reached TDC!!!  Nirvana!!!  (sorry, I am feeling slightly
hippyish tonight :-)  If you want to be sure, stick a pencil or other soft
stick in the #1 spark plug hole and rotate the engine back and forth.  You
can feel the piston come up and start back down.

If you have a degreed pulley or T4, you can set it at the proper timing
spec, but TDC is close enough for now;

at this point insert the distributor and engage the drive dog in the
drive gear;

fasten the bracket down, loosen the adjusting bolt/nut;

note the direction that the rotor is facing, and put the cap on, see which
tower is closest/most convenient (this is going to become your #1 tower);

rotate the dist body until the rotor faces that tower;

set dwell and do a static time per St. Muir;

Attach the spark wire for #1 to the previously determined #1 tower, then
2,3,4 going *COUNTER*clockwise or 4,3,2 going clockwise if you are a
traditionalist :-)

At this point, it should start and run. Please do recheck dwell and timing
before you drive off into the sunset.
