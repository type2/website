Oh, Mike: Been there. Acted like that. After successfully building 
maybe ten engines, the past three  have been disasters.

The same painstaking cleaning and assembly that you describe. Run for 
an hour on a test stand. The sound that was not there gradually 
becomes a banging.

It gets worse. I disassembled each one and could find absolutely 
nothing to account for the noise. Nothing. "Miced" the crank, rods, 
and all else. Found the weights of the pistons to be within .4 grams 
of each other. Meanwhile, the bus has sat for 14 months while Geico 
just smiles. A jinxed vehicle?
