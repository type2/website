Mike,

Last time I had a situation like this(type 1) bus engine...it turned out 
that I had a loose flywheel.....I had 40hp over stock and onyl 4 
dowells...it was my 2nd ever rebuilt engine.


My first one managed to break the crankshaft in half in the middle of the 
worst blizzard pennsylvania had seen in years.....I thought I was just 
passing thru...

Cheers, dave
