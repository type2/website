Dave,

I am nothing like an expert with leak-down tests.  It is something I have
always wanted to to but have not yet gotten the "round tuit."  But my
guess on your 1/3 problem is that your cam may be worn.  The lifters for
both cylinders 1 & 3 ride on the same lobes of the camshaft, so if they
are worn, you get the same problem on both sides of the engine.
Specifically, if your intake lobe is worn, then the duration of the
opening is not long enough for the cylinder to draw a full charge of
gas/air mix.  The check is to pull a lifter and have a look.  If you see
any obvious wear, then that is probably what is happening.
