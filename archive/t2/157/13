I cannot imagine using one on my type1 engine without a mirror arrangement
of somr sort.

Colortune has been around for at least 25 years that I know of, and it
just doesn't seem to have caught on.  I suspect that it would be useful
with a uniform fuel and squeaky-clean fuel delivery system.
Unfortunately, this is seldom the case it the real world.  Trace amounts
of some elements, such as sodium, can greatly alter the flame color.
