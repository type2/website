Subject: [T2] Welding fabrication???



	Hello listees,
I am currently looking into transplanting a VR6 watercooled powerplant into 
my '70 Deluxe.  Aside from the obvious modifications necessary(which I feel 
confident I can tackle alone), there is the single issue of rear(which would 
be side form the original vehicle) motor mounting.  Is there anyone in the 
Boise,Idaho/SE Oregon area who knows of, or can themselves handle the 
fabrication necessary to create a custom mounting mechanism for such a 
transplant?  The last time I looked into this, I was given websites with 
information on a Vanagon-VR6 transplant, and a Chevy Vortec V-6 into a Bus, 
but these projects were different enough that I couldn't use either as a 
reference.  Any help would be appreciated.  If anyone knows of anyone else 
who has tackled this also, perhaps they could point me in their direction as 
well?  Thank you all(in advance).

	Eron Crites
