Michael, and everyone else...

The FI engines have the perfect vacuum port built in...  between the
intake runners for cylinders 1 & 2 on the intake air  distribution box
there is a port for the fule pressure regulator.  Each of my buses has a
"T" cut in there for convenience.  I *ought* to have the vac gauge in the
pod up front, but I figure I am enough of a hazard with my curent lack of
HP... if I started driving to the vacuum gauge, I'd *never* get across the
US :-)
