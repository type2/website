Subject: Re: [T2] Type4 distributor question:

Sounds like the distributor isn't engaging in the drive.

Loosen the clamp on the distributor body and try to reseat it. It will only 
seat in one position - there will be another position 180 degrees out that 
will feel like it MIGHT seat but it won't.
