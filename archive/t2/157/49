Subject: Re: [T2] Simple(!) Horn Question

The horn gets 12 volts positive all the time.

It is grounded through the steering wheel and horn button.

Check to see if the horn is getting 12 volts.

If it is them make  simple jumper for the other terminal.

Every time you touch this jumper wire to the frame (a clean metal spot) the 
horn should honk.

This will verify that the 12volt source is good and the horn is good.

Then you only have to verify that the ground wiring is good.

Basically the ground wire runs from the horn to the steering box, through a 
small jumper wire to get the ground around the steering coupler, and then 
there is another small jumper wire under the horn button.

Hope this helped.
