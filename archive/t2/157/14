Bill,

Lazy scut that I am, I don't have to :-)  If you Google "vacuum gauge
engien diagnostics" you will turn up hundreds!  One I liked is:

The only mod i would make to all of them is that, by water-cooled
standards, our engines *do* have the timing very retarded.  On a
water-cooled engine, you advance the timing until the engine stumbles,
then back it off a hair.  If you try that with a VW, you will toast the
engine in short order!  If you get 17" of vacuum at idle with the
distributor properly set, then be happy.
