An in-dash vacuum gauge is very nice to have IMO, and amusing on long 
trips.  It can also alert you to a potential problem with your 
engine.  I've been running one for several years - here is my installation 
for anyone that's interested.  There is also a picture of the Vanagon 
speedo (6-digit odometer plus resettable trip meter) installed in my 
baywindow dashboard.
