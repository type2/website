Subject: Re: [VB] How do you remove oil filler piece?

Thanks, Dave and Karl, for the advice on the oil filler sleeve nut. I was
just struggling unsuccessfully last night to remove mine, using various
improvised "tools" at hand. Even though the nut is on really tight, the oil
filler head is loose and rattles around a bit. I want to fix this since I'm
trying to get the above-tin half of my engine (and the engine compartment)
to be more oil-free, and I suspect some of the oil spray and dribble comes
from this area. My '67 bus has a '73 AH-series 1600DP engine. (Anyone have a
spare OG '71 bus air cleaner set-up, with the 2" air pre-heat inlet?)

I asked Ronnie of Old Volks why my oil filler head might be loose, and
whether there should be some sort of gasket in there. He sent along a metal
gasket ring in my order, which I'm guessing goes right under the rim of the
filler nut (once I get it off...). I'll look into the EMPI tool and try
again.
