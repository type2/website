Call (or maybe not ;-( your local property
maintenance dept. ...Chances are a law
similar to this is already on the books
of your fair city.
Closer to home (for me at least) a once
working class city was yuppified a few
years ago and among the new ordinances
the BMW/Volvo/SUV - ers passed was 
that a commercial vans could not be
parked "in public view" i.e. in the own-
er's driveway. Seems the sight of elec-
tricians, plumbers, carpenters, etc. 
vans disturbed the gentle sensibilities
of the new residents. Someone took
it to court and it was thrown out e-
ventually. The same town also banned
those basketball hoops nailed to the
front of the garage...My guess is that
they wanted the town to look like a
Lionel set...Complete to grass nazis
running around with rulers measuring
the height of everyone's front lawn.
