Subject: Re: [T2] Welding fabrication???

What tranny are you using? Just curious.

Every transplant I have been involved in - hot rod or VW has involved the 
same process.

Position the engine in the body where you want it to sit, create a cross 
member our of square tubing with gussets between the OEM engine motor 
mounts. Then we created gusset-ed square tubing to connect the cross member 
to the frame - in this case the OEM baywindow locations would be easiest 
because they are already braced for engine weight. You might have to create 
new cross member attachment points too.

You can pay somebody to do it at $50 an hour or you can lean some basic 
welding, buy a miter saw for steel, and a basic welder - and then create 
the brackets and crossmembers with spot welds and have an expert properly 
finish weld everything. Lastly paint or powdercoat it all.

The whole process will require alot of careful engineering to ensure that 
you don't obstruct exhaust or intake or control cables or anything else 
that can't be relocated on the engine.

Sure would be nice to have that engine access panel uptop. It maybe 
required to complete the task.

I'd look at the Tiico conversions because the brackets will all be very 
similar - but will aim for different frame mounting points because your 
vehicle is different. Basically you've got to create a stronger moustache 
bar. The other existing engine conversions tackle the exact problems you 
will with the VR-6 but the shape and size of the brackets will be a bit 
different. No patterns for VR-6 engines in baywindows that I know of and if 
there was it might be difficult to get the owner of the design to release 
it to you - if it was a money maker for them.

Once it is welded/bolted it correctly, connect electrical, fluids, and 
controls and you are ready for exhaust and radiators.

No small task.

Have you considered the weight of the engine as compared to the vehicle's 
weight distribution? If the VR-6 is alot heavier - I dunno - you're going 
to have to deal with that. Assuming it is - have you tried loading sandbags 
in the rear most of the passenger compartment and driving it around to see 
if it pulls too much weight off of the front that it affects the wet road 
braking abilities? Have you considered disc brakes since drum brakes 
overheat so easily? Have you considered how the low geared VW Type 1 
powered bus tranny will deal with 200 horses and how much nicer a higher 
gear ratio would be - less noise, more durability, better mpg...

I'm not trying to aggravate you but it is a big job with alot to consider. 
Kennedy offers conversion parts and guidance, dunno if they have done this 
type job. You'll need custom flywheel, clutch, and an adapter plate to bolt 
the VR-6 to a early baywindow bus tranny.

I am working through a Corvair transplant which gives me 110 unrefined 
horsepower - more if - even 200 - if I want to really build a special 
engine with combustion chamber refinements and modern engine controls. Most 
of these topics to consider that I mentioned above were topics for me to 
consider as well - as would any person doing a custom transplant. I've 
completed my armchair engineering and am simply waiting for the time to do 
the work. 101 things taking up my time so that I can't work on it.

Good luck and keep us updated.
