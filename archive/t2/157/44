Don't know why but I can explain the circuit you would have the create 
using a $6 Radio Shack relay.

My guess would be that the rear window defroster doesn't care whether it 
gets 12 volts or 10 volts - it just won't melt the frost faster at 10 
volts. So VW used a slightly heavier duty switch and skipped the added 
complication of the relay. Probably cheaper when you consider assembly cost 
and materials.

Why would VW worry about the defroster relay when they didn't worry about 
heaters and sound proofing or sway bars? Amazing considering the original 
cost of the Westfalia which is much like the current Westfalia - expensive!!!

I didn't know that VW used a relay for the Beetle rear window defroster...
