You know that you have reached a new plane of conciousness when your
painstakingly rebuilt,
 spanking new,  shiny 2 liter longblock  that you only installed 2 weeks
ago begins ticking,
 quietly at first,
then it gradually gets louder and louder until it  sounds like the Hammers
of Hell beating the very life
out of the engine.
The engine that has become like your baby over the weeks that it took you
to transform it
from it's dirty, neglected beat down condition back to a like new
condition.
 The Hammers finally getting so loud inside your baby that you run to kill
the ignition
 before something comes flying through the case and really puts an end to
it.

You know that you have reached this state when this happens
and you don't
yell,
scream,
kick the dog,
or yourself.
You know when you have reached VW Zen when you just quietly pack up
your toolbox, lock up your bus for the night, and go to bed.
Tomorrow is another day...

That said,
Does anyone know of a reputable and experienced aircooled VW mechanic in
the New York
City area?

Time is not on my side on this one so I think I'm going to have to seek
professional help (No pun intended)
and let someone else do the work on my bus. My last experience with taking
my bus to a"VW experienced"
 mechanic was  bad one and I was hoping that someone could point me in the
right direction.
                                                Thanks,
                                                Mike Leddy
