Subject: RE: Fuel Filter question, re-usable

>>I have the glass fuel filter and have used them in the past.  No complaints, not prone to clogging or leaking, but I have broken one.  Glass can be problematic.<<
------------------------------------

It certainly can [be problematic]!!

This is why US Coast Guard regulations do not allow glass in the engine room/compartment/space of US-registered vessels, regardless of size.  Their concern is for breakage and fire potential, just like air-cooled VWs.

I used to think the CG was pathologically conservative on this issue.  Genuine "marine" fuel sediment bowls, filters, and pumps are expensive.  But after observing a few boat fires I became pretty paranoid about fire safety issues myself.  

I thought the same way about VW buses for a while.  Then the fuel inlet fitting on the carburetor blew out on a bus I was driving ~50MPH on a rural highway, drenching the entire engine and compartment with gasoline.  Incredibly, there was no fire despite the huge cloud of fuel vapor pouring out the back of the bus.  If it had ignited the bus would have been a total loss.  There was no fire extinguisher, and no help for miles in all directions.

As far as I'm concerned glass components have absolutely no place in the engine compartment, or anywhere else in the fuel system, of an air-cooled VW.
