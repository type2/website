	Hi Chris,
I just ordered a New VW front beam from Bus Depot for the purpose of adding 
the disc brakes.  I even have plans to add power-assist to the steering.  I 
have a '96 Passat w/VR6, so I've checked the dimensions pretty thoroughly, 
and I believe it will be a pleasant(as pleasant as they get) transplant.  
The engine height and width seem well within the space limitations of the 
engine comp.  I have checked out Kennedy's website to find the flywheel and 
adapter info on this swap.  The tranny is out of a '79 Type2 and will need a 
thorough internal update when the time comes to drop in the V6.  As far as 
weight in the rear is concerned, it will be heavier, but with 
coilovers(already installed) and some tweaks to the spring-plates, I think 
it will be fine.  The radiator will offset the weight up front, as this is 
the only place to mount the thing.  I alrady have the A/C lines and 
condenser mounted toward the rear.  I know what you mean about the 
access-panel.  I nearly bought a later-model for this reason, but I love my 
'70 too much to part with her. Thank you for your outlook and advice, 
perhaps you could tell me about your Corvair swap.
