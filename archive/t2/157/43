Get a color wiring schematic. Bentley has them in black and white but 
labels every wire so you can still follow it.

I don't have it close at hand so I can't tell you facts....

In short from memory - the terminal on the solenoid is from the key. If you 
apply 12 volts positive here the starter will try to engage. That is what 
you accomplish with the key. The key switch will fail about every 20 years 
or so and fail to supply 12v+ to the solenoid. Also from time to time the 
solenoid will bind so despite the fact that the key is supplying 12v+ the 
solenoid will still fail to function. In that case a few light whacks with 
a hammer on the side of the solenoid will usually get you moving. In this 
case build a starter relay as per the plans in the back of the Muir book. 
The VW catalogs have them in kits but you can do the same with an old Ford 
starter relay (much more heavy duty than a headlight relay found in the 
catalog kits) and you might have a Ford relay laying around. I am assuming 
that when you short the terminals on the starter with a screwdriver the 
engine starts cranking 'til it fires up (normally)... if not then you have 
your symptoms mixed up.

Also any other wire on the solenoid will be hot only when the key is in the 
start position.

I can't think of any other thing on a carb bus that needs to be doing 
something only while the bus is starting.

With a test meter and a friend you can pull the wires that connect to the 
starter solenoid and with the key in the start position one of these wires 
should be hot each time the switch is turned to "start".

The starter itself has a large cable from the battery. I think the 
alternator also may be connected the starter cable with a smaller red wire 
(larger than the wires on the solenoid).

Safety: do not lay in front of the tire - you don't want the bus to move 
forward or backward and run over you.

Make sure that your helper knows how to pull the main coil wire to kill the 
engine should in your experiments the engine start and the helper somehow 
discover that it won't shut off (they break the key)... Make sure that your 
helper knows that they can push in the clutch and the van will not move 
when the engine is running.

I know some of us use young family members and girlfriends (or boyfriends) 
that either might not know what to do if there was a shadetree mechanic 
emergency or they panic and forget what to do...

Neutral, brake on, etc...
