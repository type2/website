Subject: Bus wanted for photographs


Paul Tieger (paul(-at-)personalitytype.com) is looking for a
bus to photograph.  He's in Connecticut and is a former
bus owner.  He's looking for a 64-66 pop-top camper,
preferably green.  Please send email or call him directly
at 860-233-1396.  I'm just doing him this favor.
