  In my 71 Westy, I placed a permanent vacuum gauge in the clock hole,
with a stiff tube (nylon) running all the way back to the carb.  As I
recall, 17" was the norm!   I made a game of driving effiecently, since
every step on the acc. pedal showed up on the gauge!  Where do you hook
this up to in a 78 FI engine??
