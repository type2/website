Greg,

Yep, they have those at the flaps for cheap....the only problem being that 
the bleeder valve can still let a little air come in around the 
threads...or you can buy the expensive "speed-bleeder" bleeder valves for 
each wheel....depends on how you feel about teflon tape on your bleeder 
threads....

Cheers, dave
