Grasshopper!!!!  When you  reach the end of one level, it only means it is
time to go for the next level!  Descend those stairs! Slay that Balrog!
(whoops... mixed metaphors :-)

What is happening sounds like it will be *very* simple to fix, honest!  It
sounds to me like one of the adjuster screw lock nuts has come loose and
the adjuster is backing off.  Pull both of the valve covers off, look at
all the adjusters, try to turn the lock nuts by hand.  Did one or more
turn?  If so, rotate the engine until that cylinder is at TDC (write if
you need instructions) and readjust that valve.  In less than 10 miles, it
is near certain you have done no damage.
