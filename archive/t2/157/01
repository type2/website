Subject: 1972 square "pop-top" delivery

 Hey all, new to the list here, but have owned my
wonderful 1972 bus for about 8 years now.
 I have a couple questions.. I searched through the
archives but these questions are kinda hard to filter
I think.  Could use a couple tips...
 
 My bus has no windows on the sides (except driver and
passenger, windshield and rear-hatch). I'm wondering
what these are called normally?  "delivery van"?
"panel van"? or what?

 Next, and more important, where can I find more info
on my particular machine?  I've herd there were only
about 500 "panel vans" shipped to the US in '72. Out
of these, I'm wondering how many have a factory
installed pop top.  I'm not talking about the long pop
top, but a little square one centered over the sliding
side door. About 3'x3' like on some earlier models. 
This bus was a special order from a coffee company in
California, and I'm thinking it's almost one of a
kind.  
 I've been looking around for more info for the last
few days, but haven't found anything really about
these type of "panel vans" from '72. 
 Could really use a point in the right direction!

 Many thanks,  Dave
