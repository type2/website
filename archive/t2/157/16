true, if you replace the whole thing it is quite easy,
i was talking restoring the old ones which is a little
more work but not much really.  if you just need new
locks the those are available NOS, reproduction and
junk yard.  i really can't wait to tear into it on the
bus but not until after i get off this work scedual.
