Subject: vent wing wind noise

someone had previously mentioned that you needed a
whole new window to eliminate the wind noise.  this is
quite untrue.  all it takes is removing the wing
frame, replacing the seals and bending the pivot
points until you have a complete seal.  i have done
this on my bug and am going to do this on the bus when
time permits.  it is a relatively easy job for the
beginer, the hardest part being getting the wing out
of the door.
