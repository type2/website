Subject: Oil leak follow up

A few days ago I posted to the list for  help about removing my fan
shroud to fix an oil leak.  Several people suggested I first look at the
oil pressure sender. I went by the local dealership, picked one up for
$5.25, stuck it in and no more leak.

What would I do without this list??
