yeah happened to me many years ago on my 60 deluxe microbus, never did
figure out why but has never happened again...I never allow the folks at
the garage to use the air wrenchs to put my lug nuts on, they have to do
it by hand and the place I prefer actually puts em on with a torque
wrench, to spec
