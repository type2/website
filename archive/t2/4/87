Subject: Re:[T2] Backwards dist. drive (was: George Lyle--He de man.)

Hi.  Well, "doing it" is fresh in my memory but that was last August (damn, 
I've been a Bus owner almost a whole year) so remembering exactly without 
looking at it will be tough.  The drive is down about an inch (sorry I'm 
still  metrically challenged) inside the case and you can pull the dist. off 
without disturbing it.  The drive is a circle with a slot that's off center, 
which forces the dist shaft to go only one way.  IOW, it's keyed so the 
rotor can only point one way.  That's the piece that you pull out and rotate 
180 degrees.  I did it with hand tools, a flashlight and no manual or guide 
or help.  It made itself obvious, I remember that much.  I hope someone else 
answers your question more clearly.  Sorry about that.  If my memory is not 
accurate, please someone correct me.  One thing for sure, don't turn the 
engine while the dist is off, and mark the dist body with a Sharpie where 
the back of the rotor is pointing to help you line the rotor back up 180 
degress opposite from before when you drop it back in.  This helps you with 
initial static timing to get it started again.  Of course you can turn the 
engine to TDC #1 before you start the process.  =)
