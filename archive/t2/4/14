Tommy-
If you are following the thread, you are now lost as well.
My response to the question of proper torque pressure
of a lubricated bolt was a question regarding whether that
was an accurate spec in light of the fact that a lubricant
allows the fastener to tighten easier, whereas a torque spec
is generally posted for a dry fastener. This was not a  suggestion
to only torque dry thread fasteners, but rather a " twist" ( pun )
on the subject insofar as i prefer to use locktite on critical
fasteners ( connecting rods and cylinder heads ) and no specs are
available for lubricated fasteners. The "run-on " torque adjusted
spec for fasteners which resist  turning can be generally reduced
by cleaning those fasteners, and the previous post pointing at
how engineers come up with these specs indicates that the torsional
stresses of various sizes and hardness and material of bolts is already
factored into the spec, and there is also some indication of the effect
of a lubricant, but it remains unclear if the torque spec is factored for
a lubricant. i believe it is not, it is for a dry fastener. I recommend
locktite and anti-sieze, and believe the torque spec is not accurate
for lubricants.see below.
