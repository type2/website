haha.. it's far from.  Go look at his site.  They've got some pretty
impressive T4s.  I honestly wouldn't mind hooking my bus up with a more
powerful engine in the future :)

Hey Jake.. question.. 
Have you guys tried your engines with FI?  I understand you're goal is
power and I guess you get more with carbs, but I'd be more interested in
having more power (than I do now) and good fuel economy 20mpg+.  What
kinda MPG could your engines get with an FI system and electronic
iginition/distributorless ignition, etc..

later,
Mike
