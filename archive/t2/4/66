I tend to agree, although I never use it on lug nuts/bolts.  I've never had one of these sieze on me and I really don't want to make them 
easier to get off!

On spark plugs, I make _very_ sure that the anti-sieze never gets close to the insulators or electrodes on either end.  I use a small dab 
located at least one thread in from the end.  Some have reported  misfires while using antisieze on spark plugs, but I've never experienced 
it.  Plug removal is always a fingers-only exercise once the plugs are broken loose.
