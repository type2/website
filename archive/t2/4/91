Subject: Fuel Pump Relay

Finaly Thanks to all the help i've gotten from type2.com my bus is running.  I have another question.  I put a fuel pump in my bus, I remove it from a parts bus that I have.  I want to add a relay before the pump but I dont know what type to buy or how to hook it up.  Any suggestions?  Also the pump seems to make a lot of noise, is this normal?  and now that is in the bus the pump remains running while the key is in the run position, is this normal?  Thanks
Mike
