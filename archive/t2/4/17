I hope it's not compression. Try these: Squirt some oil in tho hole and try
again. If it gets better it's rings. If not, switch plugs with another
hole. If the hole with the #3 plug is now NG, you've got a bad plug. If no
difference, switch plug leads. Sometimes the leads transmit enough juice to
spark, but not under compression. If none of these work, try a compression
test. If low compression, you've got a bad valve.  Good luck.
