Subject: Re: [T2] Timing 2.0 litre engine.

dave:

having a conglomerate bus (76 body/79 cal. engine #GE053238) it took me a
while to figure out what to do.

I recently timed mine to 5 degrees atdc with both hoses connected and it's
running really well. The 5 degreees is per Muir, I don't have any idea if
the hoses are correct.

Verify you distributor p/n if you haven't already.

List?

Billy
