Hi Gang,
I need a favour ... (please note; "favour" is Canadian for "favor")

I'm looking to borrow/rent/trade a reliable bus or vanagon for a week in November.

I'm coming to SD for a scientific conference, and bringing my family for a couple of days before. Thus, we need a people-mover for some short trips around town. I could rent a brand new minivan the traditional way, but it would end up costing close to wha
t I paid for my '78 and would spend most of the time parked. Then the idea struck that I could put out a call to The List for help. Can anyone lend me a bus while I'm in town ? I'm a responsable guy, and have been playing with VWs of one sort or another f
or 15 years now. I can set up my own insurance, I won't put many miles on it (we are staying in town) and would realy appreciate it. I will pay a fair price, or trade the use of my '78 in New Hampshire. 

Another option - I have a friend who just moved to SD and likes my bus, but is not what you call a "car guy". He has asked my advice on purchasing a bus. If anyone is looking to sell a solid, drivable smog-legal bus or westy in SD, maybe you would be will
ing to let me "demonstrate" the fine art of Bus ownership to him for the week and then give him the option to purchase (consider it a one week lease with a buyout option)?

If neither of these options pan out - any ideas how to get an inexpensive van rental in SD ?

Thanks

Mike Harris
