spark plug wires on wrong terminals of dizzy

check the TDC with the timing marks.
   pencil through the #1 spark plug hole,  turn til piston is at TDC
verify that the timing mark is at TDC
verify that rotor is set at plug #1 
verify that spark plug wires are on the right positions on dizzy cap

...

also using timing light with it set at 28btcd does the timing advance from
there when you rev up??

this should give you some simple checks.  I suspect that is where you will
find your problme
