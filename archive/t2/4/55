Chris:
You are right, this is  a normal job for most mechanics these days, changing a
CV.
I really doubt the axle is shot, just the CV.
This is really a case where a little preventative mainenance would have gone a
long ways. These damn CV's will almost last forever if they have boots and
grease.
I bought 4 new ones in 1986 for my 78 bus, put 2 on. Stopped driving the 78 due
to rust. I've put a total of 250,000 miles on 4 subsequent Vanagons and have
only had occasion to use one more of my original 1986 spares! Oh, I've put a
lot of grease and boots on, but often long after I should have.
BTW, it's a major PAIN to get to the outer bolts on a Vanagon without a lift
and an air wrench, so this is definitely a job to tackle before leaving home!
