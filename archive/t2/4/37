Hi Volks,

I only just realized I futzed the link to the right carb... It should have
read:

http://www.geocities.com/vw_type2/Carbs/RCarb.jpg

...But that doesn't matter much now. David Kelly has told me he'll be
sending me the part I need, and I took the following images to hopefully
help him sort out the plumbing on his. If anyone is able to look at these
and see if *I'm* doing something wrong I'd be glad to hear about it.

Here's the new pics, I shot each carb from Top with and without the air
cleaner in place, from the front, and from the side. (3/4 view)
