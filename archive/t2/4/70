Any Napa store can supply genuine Bosch Reman Starters if they want to.
They prefer to sell their in house brand rebuilds at less money and more
margin than they get for the Real Deal, so many tend to not mention the
higher priced, higher value for you option. Surely a web search can find a
Bosch distributor in your area, most certainly a one day UPS ground to you
from Pheonix.

Shoot might take 3 days from me to you if that would work for you. At least
you would be guaranteed it would fit properly without jury rigging with
spacers. If you have to go with another of the "Lifetime Guarantee" pieces
of junk, at least have them bench test it 20 times before you accept it.
Let it fail before their very eyes then demand your money and a proper core
back.
