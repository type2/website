Never heard of this problem.  Heating the engine should have made it harder to remove the plug, not easier (yes, the hole gets larger 
relative to the plug, but it also get _longer_ relative to the "reach" of the plug)

Anti-sieze is supposed to seal the mating surfaces so that corrosion cannot take place in the mating region.  Therefore, only a dab of 
anti-sieze is required.  I've never seen a case where anti-sieze jammed anything, and I'm a fairly liberal user of the stuff.
