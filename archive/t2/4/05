Subject: Re: [T2] Anti-Seize

The type of anti sieze that you're discussing is used in brick furnaces,
lime drying tumblers, petro-chem plants to install valves, fasteners and
onter apparatus that comes in constant contact with high heat.
Its been around for the last twenty  pluss years and was offered by SPS
since about 1955.
The automotive specialty anti sieze may very well have safety factors of
two or three hundred percent built in.
Since many of the industrial uses involve iron to iron couplings I think
I'd stick to the anti sieze that is specifically designed for steel to
aluminum applications. I've used a variety of stand automotive brands of
anti sieze compounds on exhaust studs, spark plugs and other locations of
extreme heat and the standard automotive brands have proved to be very
effective. I've never broken a locked stud or frozen exhaust crossover
pipe bolt that I used the standard automotive anti sieze on.

 Whoops, iron melts at 1535 C (not F) which would be 2795 F, steel 
melts 
 around 2500 F, withal this potion is wondrous stuff. =^)
