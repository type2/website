The theory is that part of the torque is used in overcoming the friction between the threads as the threads rotate against each other.  
Another part goes toward overcoming the friction of the thrust surface of the bolt or nut against the part.  The rest goes toward pulling the 
threaded parts toward each other.  If the thread/thrust friction is reduced, the extra torque available goes toward pulling the parts toward 
each other.

However...

I am unconvinced that anti-sieze works as a friction-reducing lubricant in this situation.  The pressures between the threads and between 
the thrust surfaces are enormous (approaching the yield strength of the weaker metal) and would easily push the grease into the voids of 
the threaded fasteners.  There is no mechinism for re-introducing the grease between the sliding surfaces, as there is in bearings.  

The way that anti-sieze works is by filling the voids in the fastener and coating the surfaces so that corrosion cannot start in the region 
where the threads are in contact.  Without corrosion, the fasteners are much easier to disassemble later on.

One could test this simply by tightening a few dozen fasteners to failure using an accurate torque wrench.  If the failure torque of threads 
treated with anti-sieze is seen to be predictably lower than that of untreated fasteners there is probably some lubricant effect happening.  
If not, there isn't.
