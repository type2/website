many distributors retard the #3 spark to keep that cylinder cool.  The spark is probably arriving too late for #3 to contribute to idle power, 
although it is probably firing.  When the distributor advances, #3 will take up its share of the load.

Try the same test at, say, 2000 RPM and you'll probably find that disconnecting #3 slows things down as it should.
