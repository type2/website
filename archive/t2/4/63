Be nice to Chuck, baywindow guys!  He was a great help during my recent generator/alternator conversion, pointing me at good sources 
for original VW parts.

As I recall, there is a button on the reverse side of the speedo, or on a box on the speedo cable.  Push the button, and the light goes out 
for another XX,000 miles.  It's just a reminder to maintain the EGR system.
