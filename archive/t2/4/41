Subject: distributor/valve setting question

Hello list,
The distributor driveshaft was installed 180 degrees off in my 79 bus.
(80 case, 79 distributor)  After reading the archives I understand this is 
just more of an annoyance than any real problem. (except the fact that my 
mechanic thinks this is *correctly* installed)  My question is then, when I 
set the valves for their initial setting (they are hydraulic); to do the #1 
cylinder I should align the rotor to where the #1 cylinder wire currently is 
and not where it *should* be, right?
Just looking for some reassurance.


From the archives:

/I would either pull out your dizzy and take off the drive dog and spin
/it 180 degrees and put it back on or just deal with the crossed wires.
/Here's the reversed order that you should have:
/
/1 4
/2 3
/
/instead of the normal:
/
/3 2
/4 1
/
/double check my numbers here making sure you have the correct firing
/order.  I believe it's 1-4-3-2.. I don't have my book in front of me.
/(SOMEONE CORRECT ME IF i'M WRONG HERE!)
