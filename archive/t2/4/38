Hi Karl,

I was wondering if anyone would ask about that. Here's the story...

My heater boxes aren't connected under the bus, so we didn't hook up the
blower overhead either. The boxes are completely and utterly shot, and the
flapper valveswere gone as well so we didn't see the point of connecting
them to anything. I now have a replacement set ready to go but will be
swapping engines soon so it's a moot point anyhow.

While coming back from EveryBus this spring, Denmeister suggested that the
heater box inlets were letting hot air from the heater boxes get sucked up
into the fan. Not good. Since the best heat-proof substance on hand was
tinfoil, I used a bunch of it, crumpled up tightly to plug each inlet. There
was some in the right side too, but it must have blown or fallen out.

Happy trails,
