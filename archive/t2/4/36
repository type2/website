74. He is in my ballpark, about two hours west, heading west from Manhattan.
I e-mailed him about two weeks ago, suggested he do Niagara Falls for the
"classic " honeymoon. He thinks he stripped out a new axle / cv but i'm not
so sure. I told him i have everything to repair it, including a trans, but he seems
to have it under control, while currently being towed to an unknown destination
by an unknown shop. He's actually not that far from Willoughby ( Ohio) , the
famous "Twilight Zone" destination.
