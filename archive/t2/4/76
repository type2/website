Subject: George Lyle--He de man.

Let it be known that George Lyle is a scholar and gentleman and a friend to
Volkswagens and their owners.  His diagnosis was spot on.

Thanks,

George responded to my q. about #3 not giving power at idle:

> many distributors retard the #3 spark to keep that cylinder cool.  The
spark is probably arriving too late for #3 to contribute to idle power,
although it is probably firing.  When the distributor advances, #3 will take
up its share of the load.
>
> Try the same test at, say, 2000 RPM and you'll probably find that
disconnecting #3 slows things down as it should.
