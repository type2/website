Run in torque double hmmmm!  Torque preload is calculated in to the factory
spec given termed tightening torque.  Don't believe it?  Try torquing a T1
engine strainer cap nut (6 ft lbs) or a T4 strainer nut (10 ft lb) with some
"other" method.  You'll be wondering why something broke.

http://www.torqueleader.com/specify.htm gives you the math if you really
want to see how engineers figure out the spec. It also includes the
variables to the equation for oiled fasteners.

Unless noted otherwise in Bentley, the spec is clean and dry and, yes, in
this case all torques are accounted for in the spec. This assumes they can
be turned down with fingers
