Subject: Re: [T2] Anti-Seize

I have merely stated what a correct torue process should consist of, within
this post. I'm totally hardcore when it comes to torques, and specs, and
probably go off the deep end with my applications of them......I'm sorry to
have started an unrelenting thread of confusion, I will keep doing it my
way, maybe everyone else should do the their way. I will change my processes
and standards when I awake to 150+ engines that show up for warranty
repairs, until then........Not a chance.
