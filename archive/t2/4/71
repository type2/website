I would tend to agree.  If you are in a highly-sensitive application you might expect a technician to do the run-in torque calculation, clean 
the threads with a specified solvent, have the fasteners at a specified temperature, ad nauseum.  In automotive applications, this would be 
a lot to expect of the typical mechanic.  Remember that VW specs were designed to give good results with the worst mechanic that could 
simply read and follow instructions.  The best they could do was to figure out what the typical run-in torque was, add that to the actual 
torque they wanted on the fastener, and hope for the best.  Since there is some safety margin built into the engineering, a couple of 
pounds difference in the torque wouldn't make much difference.

OTOH, if the run-in torque has already been accounted for in the torque spec, you would run the risk of over-torqueing if you added the 
run-in value to the torque specification.  Unless this calculation was specifically called for by the manual, I wouldn't use it.
