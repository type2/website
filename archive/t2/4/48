Check in boat shops and you may find the brand "Caframo" as a fan that
will include a suction cup base.  It is a Canadian co. Though they used
to be made in Ca they are now made in China and the quality of the
suction base has gone down, and the motor has gotten smaller.  I clip
mine right to the middle of the windshield.  MB 78 Westy
