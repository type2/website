There is a guy broken down between Erie, PA and Jamestown, NY on Route 17 
with a broken axle.  He contacted me via AIRS info, but he is about 4 hours 
west of me.  Anyone that can send me some info immediately re. someone to 
help him get off the highway would be appreciated.  I have his cell numbers 
and hopefully someone can help him and his new bride out.
