The distributor only goes in one way, so you can rest easy about removing it.  When you put it back, you push down while turning the 
distributor rotor.  When the drive dog matches the offset slot in the drive gear in the case it will drop into place.

The distributor drive gear (which stays in the case) has several teeth, so it has several different possible orientations, only one of which is 
"right".  If it is positioned wrong, you simply lift it up off of its mating gear, rotate it, and drop it down in the correct position.  The 
complicating factor is that it takes a special tool to get hold of the drive gear.

This could be.  Just get it to TDC on the compression stroke (both valves closed) on #1, and check the drive gear orientation against the 
picture in Bentley.  Note that there are different orientations for the type 1 and type 4 engines.
