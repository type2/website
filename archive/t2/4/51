Well, the original starter finally gave up.  So, after calling every =
where in town we found a place (O'Reilly's) that stocked them.  No, they =
are not Bosch (I only wish).
To make a very long story short, we have replaced it 4 times in as many =
weeks.  The first one only lasted 5 starts, the next was about 12 =
starts, the next ;asted 3 days, and the last one only 1 start.  I only =
wish we had kept the original and rebuilt it.  We cannot find out what =
is going on with these starters, except, that the mounting hole that the =
weird, half moon bolt goes through in the casting on the new starters, =
is  a little larger than the bolt hole.  We figured this could make it =
move, so we made a bushing for it and it did not help.  Does any one =
have any ideas what is going on with these starters?  Are they all just =
cheap rebuilds? =20
Thanks
