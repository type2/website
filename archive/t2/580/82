It happens at idle and also at RPM.  If I hold higher rpms, the beats 
get faster, but there is no particular pattern.  The thumps are about 3 
every 5 seconds so it is somewhat noticable, however it's no really 
enough to affect the engine speed.

I am going to replace the plugs now...

I'm gonna give this a try and see what happens.  I wasn't sure if this 
would really help cuz it would make the engine run funny anyways, but I 
might be able to identify the "thumping" cylinder.

They're grounded to the MS which is grounded to the body.  I should 
probably ground to the engine, but I'm wondering if that would really 
cause this...  maybe I'll try running some grounds to the engine anyways.

Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.  The MS and injection may be working 
perfectly, but it could be something after them in the electrical path 
that's havin' problems.

Well, I'm gonna do some of the tests you suggested and see what I can 
figure out.  I'll keep ya posted.

thanks,
Mike
