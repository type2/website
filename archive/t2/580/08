Well, turns out it is the AFM.  :(  I pulled the cover and found 2 wear
areas.  One is a little wear on one track where it sits at idle, the
other is at about 2/3 of full open and both tracks are worn and spotty
enough to see the circuit board beneath them for a good 1/4 inch of the
track.  Doohhh!  Guess now I'm looking at a little over $100 for a Bosch
reman unit.  Thanks for all the great info, everyone.  See you on the
list.  :)
