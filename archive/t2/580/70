Subject: Instrument Panel experts?

Hello,

On the back of the instrument panel of my 72 westy, near the bottom, there 
are two ground male prongs. Is this, according to the Bentley manual, point 
31 opposite the speedometer light?

If this is the case then this is the ground for such things as: the switch 
for the heated rear window, turn signal and the door contact switch.

Thanks in advance for your assistance,

Phil.

72 westy
