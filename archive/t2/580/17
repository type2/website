Subject: m code help

Does anyone if there was an M code for a trip meter odemeter? I got a call
and email from Ted about his. Very cool. I cannot say that I have one. EDKA
has nothing that I could find, maybey it is under some funny heading.

Thanks for the link reminder Ted. I just sent you a present.
