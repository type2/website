Subject: endpay problem

hello - i am rebuilding a 1600 upright, and am having an interesting
problem with the endplay...  now, this motor has been together before
(just replaced  rod bearings and checked all other bearings for
wear), and the endplay was fine: .11mm.
however, now it will go to zero endplay with any 3 shims!  without
the shims,  i get an endplay of .45mm, which means any combo of 3
shims will lock it up. even 2 .24 shims are too much!  so i am at a
loss as to what could have changed, and how to fix this... only thing
off the top of my head is shaving the flywheel surface, but that
wouldn't answer my question of why it changed *and isn't gonna happen
on my budget!).
