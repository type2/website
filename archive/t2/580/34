To everyone who replied, I'm not dead and I'm not being ignorant.  That old
favourite, family duty, called me a few hundred miles south and I've been
incommunicado for a while.  And my old Citroen decided to blow its head on
the way home, so I'm going to be rather busy in the coming week or so,
whichever way you cut it.

I won't be scrapping the van until next weekend at the earliest,  In the
intervening time I hope to get back to those of you who expressed an
interest in parts.

Cheers,

Chris Reece.
