Subject: "American Le Mans at Mid Ohio" race (Bus sighting)

I'm watching the "American Le Mans at Mid Ohio" race on the local CBS
affiliate, and  spotted a bus parked at the fence where the pole position
car came to rest due to engine problems at the race's start.

Looks like a white bus (maybe a camper?) with the number "53" painted on the
driver's door.  Parked next to a motorhome.

Listee, maybe?
