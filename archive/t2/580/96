Subject: RE: [T2] Voltage drop on a gas heater, other concerns?

I believe a 6volt gas heater would draw enough current that most volta
drop would be overheated or destroyed, and having a quailty regulator
that COULD keep up would cost nearly as much as the 12v heater at
premium costs.

I would aslo recommend finding a new place for BATTERY number 2, rather
than move a compbustion heat device somewhere else, unless it's the
under bus, ba6? That Vanagon westies use, plumbed into the heater tube,
and are also 12v of course.



....
     I am looking into gas heaters for this winter.  If I purchase a 6v
gas 
heater can I simply wire it with an inline voltage dropper?  Are there
any 
special concerns using these voltage droppers with a gas heater?  Is
there 
any great disadvantage to the 6v heaters?
     Along the same lines, is it possible and worthwhile to convert 6v
gas 
heaters to 12v?  What parts would need to be changed for it to run on
12v?
     I have read some of the things in the archive and library.  I would

like to use the other side of the engine compartment for a dual battery
set 
up, so I will be placing my gas heater in some other (as yet to be 
determined) non-stock location.  Any suggestions?  Anything I should be 
concerned with in placement of the gas heater?  If I am correct, I
should be 
okay as long as I use common sense and make sure the exhaust goes
outside of 
the bus, right?
