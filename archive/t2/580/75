Alan,

I wouldn't use vasoline anyplace on a vehicle, and surely not
on any rubber type parts.

Ever see what vasoline does to latex???

Spit is always good<grin> or just a little soapy water.
I understand that glycerine is an excellent choice as well.

Glycerine can be had a any local pharmacy of wal-mart...sometimes you have 
to ask.

Cheers, dave
