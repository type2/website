They're readily available. The two main chains are Safelite and PPG,
which have locations nationwide. The wholesale cost is about $75
installed at your location. You can often get one for around $100
installed if you call around and press for a good deal. You should
replace the seal at the same time. (This price does not include a seal
but we have new genuine VW ones for $19.95.) Also look for signs of rust
below the seal, as this will be a good time to repair (or at least
POR-15) them while you're at it.
