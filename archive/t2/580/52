ya know, i am FAIRLY sure the mains are he same... but i started work 
on this motor a year ago (built up shortblock, sealed it up, moved 
across country, finally got back to it), so i am trying hard to 
remember if maybe i did swap em. i remember that #2 rod bearing was 
going due to a clogged oil passage in block, and being a cheap 
b*stard, i am likely to have inspected the mains and just put them 
back on. this was just supposed to be an emergency spare, not a 
cross-country hauler, so i was going for minimum cash outlay.
