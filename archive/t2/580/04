It DOES fit in the bus. It's just that to adjust the timing to where I need it to be, I need to twist it further than it will twist. 

Maybe I'm turned around as to where #1 cylinder is? Looking into the hatch from the back, isn't #1 on the Right (passenger) side, and to the front (towards transmission)? Then on the same side is #2, then on the Left (drivers side) on the front is #3, then in the back is #4 right? 

Almost seems that it's wanting to get twisted around to point to #4 instead of #1, but if I have my position turned around, and what I thought was #4 is REALLY #1 that could explain it. But then again I DID already try moving the Plug Wires around by one position, in each way, and this way seems to be the only way that really works, or at least comes close. 

Thanks for the Schaffner #. I'll give 'em a call. Still gotta check on the Z-Bed too. :)
