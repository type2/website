Mike,

This is at idle?...or load?  WOT? cruise?
How often are the thumps...1 every 10 seconds, 5 a minute?
Does it do it when cold or hot, or in between.

It is a long story, but I have seen spark plug ceramic "poisioned" by 
wd40...it starts conducting at odd temperatures and loads.

Pull each injector connector and see which one makes it go away...same 
with spark plugs.

Triple check the injector grounds.

I have had a spark plug bakelite internal resistor go bad while on the 
road...power loss on acceleration, but would idle all day long.

If you really have an o-scope, watch the tach signal and see if it is 
weird when you get the "thump" same for injector signal, but remember you 
probably won't be able to tell much by watching the injector signal....it 
might be going out to the injectors very nicely, but unless the grounds 
are good and the connectors good, ya really don't know.

Cheers, dave
