I just thought I'd post my thoughts so far on the Compu-Fire ignition 
replacement.  I just purchased one from aircooled.net and delivery was 
quick.  I took the day yesterday to install it and it was very 
straighforward.  Take old points and condensor off and install the 
module and magnet disk.  I did have to shorten my rotor by a 1/4 of an 
inch but that was easy with the disk sander.  It runs really nice! 
Definately blows away points.

I chose the compufire module over the pertronix because I've heard about 
problems with the pertronix failing (both on this list and on the 
aircooled.net site) and also because there no gap adjustment or anything 
like that.  Anyways, it seems like a cool upgrade.  I'll letcha know if 
I ever encounter any problems...

later,
Mike
