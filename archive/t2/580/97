Hi Mike,

I've seen your Bus firsthand, and I like it.  However, my '79 needs a lot of 
work, and I need to finish it up before I can consider other Buses.  If 
you'd like to trade your 914-powered, 5-speed Bus for my '79 (currently) 
non-runner, you've got yourself a deal.  Perhaps yours just needs the right 
buyer.

Good Luck!
