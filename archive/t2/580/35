It is M-code 25. It came in combination with the
clock. M025 was available from modelyear 1973 onwards.
Because of this it has been available for one year
(1973) with the old type of speedo-design (grey with
light grey centre)

Haven't seen this option on a USA bus so far but
according to the parts-fiche it has been available in
miles as well as in kms.

Are there any more M-code questions?
Anyone wants info on the M-plate in their bus perhaps?
:-D

Just drop me a line.

yours,

Vincent
