Subject: beware of a squeal

Hi Everybody,
    I'm sure you've all heard a vehicle that had a squeal do to worn
or slipping belts.  Right?  Well, I had that same squeal with our 71
bus with a 1600DP engine,  so I ordered up a new belt plus a spare.
Installed the new belt after cleaning the pulleys real good and STILL
had the squeal.  So now instead of assuming (you know what happens
when you assume) I know what the problem is I put my good ear into the
engine compartment to locate that noise.  OK, it's coming from the
left side valve cover.  Uh oh, that can't be good.  So I take off both
valve covers and have a look around paying particular attention to the
left side.  Since everything looks and feels good I put the covers
back on.  Once I start that motor up the squeal is still there.  What
now?  So I stick my good ear back into that noisy engine room and I'm
still sure the sound is on the left side.  The only other thing I can
think to do is see if the intake is leaking.  So I put a wrench on the
intake manifold nuts and give them a snugging.  I start the bus up and
sure enough the squeal is gone!
    I'm sure there must be a lesson or a moral to this story but it
escapes me right now.  So let me conclude by saying things are not
always what they seem.  But we all knew that.  Right?
