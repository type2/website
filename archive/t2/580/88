Subject: CHT sensor installation

I recently installed a VDO cylinder head temp gauge with the sensor 
under #3 spark plug.  The readings seem to vary strangely.  For 
example, I will be on a long road trip, then I stop for gas, and when I 
get back on the road and temps equilibrate, they can read 50 to 75 
degrees lower.  I think that I may be getting some current leakage from 
the sensor.  I installed the sensor recently when the engine was out, 
before the top sheet metal was installed.  I routed the sensor wire out 
between the sheet metal and the head.  Now I'm thinking that maybe that 
was not best, and maybe I'm getting current/voltage leakage at that 
pinch point.

Can someone suggest the best way to route this sensor wire?
