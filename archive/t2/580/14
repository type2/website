Nah, nah, nah - for emergency use - take a #2 pencil, cut the end off blunt and force it into the center of the gear drive. 

Pull gently upwards and allow the gear drive to twist. 

I CAN get it out this way. I sent the same info to Muir's people who actually published it in one of the editions. I was in Italy with no access to the right tool and "invented" that... 

I think the next one I pull will get tapped for threads to I can remove it with a bolt...
