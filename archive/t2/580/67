Subject: RE: [T2] 71 gas door questions

Thanks. The drain is pretty plugged up. I tried following the drain down to
see where it ended up, and lost it in the dirt clods on that side of the
underside.

  The hole is a drain.  For rainwater and gas overflow.  It leads down and
through the frame.  If you crawl under the Bus and closely inspect the
bottom of the frame you'll see the hole.  Mine (as yours probably is) was
plugged up.
