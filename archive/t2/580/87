The Bentley has a full pinout of the harness so you can run a continuity 
test on all of the lines.  I believe it's in the FI section of the 
manual.  I'd also highly recommend getting a product called ProGold to 
spray on all of your connections.  Great stuff that is much better than 
standard contact cleaner.
