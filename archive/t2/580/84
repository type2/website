Subject: Fuel Injector Question

A couple of weeks ago someone posted a message about loose pintels(I think 
that is how it was spelled). I checked mine out and two of the four are like 
that.

Ref.: This is the small plastic/ceramic piece at the outlet side of the 
injector. White/Beige in color. They are loose. If I pull on them they pop 
out a little maybe 1mm-2mm. But they pop back in as well.

I could not find any responses to this in the archives or the original. But 
is this a problem? I know I should go ahead and have them rebuilt to be on 
the safe side, but cash and time are restricting me. If they don't work I 
will have to resort to something else. I just wanted to know before I 
install them this week if it would be wasted effort.


Thanks,
