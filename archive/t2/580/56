Subject: Re: [T2] Gas coming out of filler neck?

i am not sure about your bus but mine has a rubber neck at the top of the filler tube behind the gas cap ... 
check to see if this has given way or came unattached?may have came loose or could be rotted?
bus depot has them for 20 bucks or so i think?  just without looking~!~
take your finger and run down inside filler hole and feel around (gently) see if you can tell if there is any bad places cracks etc..?you should be able to feel far enough to feel metal after rubber>?
 you can kinda feel around and see if the filler pipe has fell? this could be casued from whatever reason but more than likely the boot if the pipe has fell? i had to replace mine cause i was pouring gas everywhere coming down the road one day. scary exspecially since i just had filled up and topped the tank off. fell when i left gas station. poor ole boot just gave away and was rotted pretty bad. i had to find something to hold the pipe up till i got home easy ride n.
if it is one of the vent hoses it will more than likely do that once you fill up but not much after a little driving after fill up or shouldnt?
good luck

Hello,

For some reason, while I am driving, gas is coming out of the filler neck 
and running down the side of my van.

Is this a ventilation problem? I have not hooked up my charcoal canister 
yet, could this be causing the problem? Faulty gas cap? The gas cap I 
noticed is not vented, should it be?

Thanks in advance for your assistance,

Phil.
