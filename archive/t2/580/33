Subject: i have the wrong motor

Just tore into the motor out of my bus. Case said 2 liter and it's fuel 
injected.
Well, it turns out to be a 1700 with 914 heads and higher compression 
pistons.

I have a choice between the 1700 or a straight 2 liter.
Hows the comparison in power between them?

<sigh>
