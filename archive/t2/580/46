I'm pretty sure that Pretronix does *not* make an Ignitor II that is 
compatible with VW vacuum-advance distributors.

That said, there is a Pertronix Ignitor (non-II) that works great in 
vacuum-advance VW distributors.... 1847V is the model #, I believe.  I 
have one in my Bus, and I am quite pleased with it.

I suggest you return the II and get the appropriate non-II version.  
Swapping out your stick distributor for one of those centrifugal-only 
types is going the wrong direction, and I believe you would be unhappy 
with the results if you did so.
