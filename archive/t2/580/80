Subject: Koln side tent instructions

Hi All,



I bought the Koln side tent form Bus Depot and got the quick shipment
without the inserted directions. I had printed the instructions from a
site that Bus Depot provided, but have since lost them and the original
file on my PC (I thin kit was a .pdf). Can anyone please p-mail me the
file or send me a link to the instruction site? My search attempts on
the web have not turned up anything.

Thank you all very much

Jeff
