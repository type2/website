I will make that assumption for now, especially because the megasquirt 
is reading a very clean tach (cleaner than points).

Cleaned.  Didn't look too bad.

Also inspected and cleaned it and it looked ok.

They're new plug wires that only have about 4000 miles on them.

New bosch blue coil.  However, I will go through and clean the 
connections and make sure there isn't a short.  I might also just 
temporarily pull the reverse light so that there isn't anything else 
messin' with the circuit.

MS is getting 13.8, but that's off the battery, though.  I will check 
the voltage at the coil.

These only have 4000 miles on them, but heck, I'll go for new ones anyways.

140-145 all around

Holds rock solid.

I'm going to trace back through everything again and see what I can 
figure out.  I'm also tempted to send off a set of injectors to get 
cleaned and see if that helps out... I'll keep ya updated!
