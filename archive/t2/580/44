Subject: Pertronix ignitor II installation

Hi!

I have purchased a Pertronix Ignitor II as well as a Flamethrower II 
coil. The ignitor II was from california imports and says it is 
compatible with 050 and 009 distributors. I have the stock distributor 
from a 1700cc engine (with big mushroom advance on the side of the 
distributor). My problem is that I can't find a way to put the ignitor 
in the distributor. I have removed the grommet and condensator as well 
as the advance (just to figure out if it will fit in if I remove it!) 
and it always blocks on a small pin in the distributor (the pin that 
the advance locks on). The other holes (for screw) seems to fit but I 
can't fit the ignitor in the distributor because of this pin...

Any ideas? Should I still try to fit this in or I really have the wrong 
piece?

Thanks!

Marck
