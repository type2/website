it could just be a small intake leak those intake runners are so close
to each other, a small leak could easily show up on both cyls, but the
exhaust would be trickier to have both leak. But anyway, to track down
an intake leak, I put a shop-vac in the exhaust on "blow" and
pressurize the system, then use you hands to feel for any leaks.
