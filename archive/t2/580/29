Subject: Jamie Auch broken down

Type 2 folks,

This is Christina Auch, Jamie Auch's wife.  

Jamie has broken down on his way to BBTF and is south of Erie by 30 minutes, near Meadville.  
(Happy 41st birthday, Jamie!)

He's at Mile Marker 134 headed north.

Rear Driver Side Wheels are wobbly.  
If you push the tire at 12 o'clock, there is a metal on metal sound.
Jamie's cell phone # is 304-261-8430.

Can anyone help and/or get a message to folks at BBTF?
I got him a Meadville AIRS number, but if there's anyone else with ideas, please speak up.

Thanks,

Christina Auch in Harpers Ferry WV
