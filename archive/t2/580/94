Subject: RE: [T2] Injector Rebuilder?

That Cruzin Performance place charges twelve bucks for cleaning, not counting shipping. What I'm wondering is, wouldn't it be about the same to just buy a couple bottles of fuel injector cleaner and cycle it through with a spare fuel pump or something for a few hours? Or do they actually take it apart and do something special with it? 

Cheers
Chris
