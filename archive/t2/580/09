they aren't :( But if installed incorrectly it causes some problems in
the orientation of the distributor.

phil already mentioned this. unfortunately it's not that easy. Plus
make sure you have the correct TDC for #1. It's the point where the #1
cyl (yes the one you described is correct) is at it's highest point on
the stroke the spark plug files. If you roll it to #1 TDC and roll the
crank back/forth the valves should not even attempt to move, if to
just rotate the crank another 360 and you will be a happy person.
