Subject: Re: [VB] NEATO Newsletter??

    I had heard  that one was supposed to go out a few weeks ago (the classic news letter), I won't hold my breath. A 
couple people are working there ass's off to save NEATO but that's it in my opinion. They tried to save it, it got decent 
for a while and is back on the track of SOTO. I heard the news letter editor passed it on and someone else has picked 
it up, he's a good guy and I hope he can get it going and back on track. I have gotten a couple NEATO short e-mail 
news letters in the last 6 months, but haven't seen a news letter in 2004, paid in full 3 times in 2 years.
   At least they could send a letter to the members to let them know they still exist and are working on getting it back 
together again. 400 members X's 38 cents for a stamp, 15 minutes to type a letter, go to kinkos have it copied, folded 
and stapled, print out the mailing labels and everyone is happy, some news is better then no news
