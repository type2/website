Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Injection Harness Testing

Hi Michael,

I have the wiring diagram at home from the Bosch "ProTraining" manual, 
it does a great job of explaining the layout of the harness. It also 
tells how to test the components of the system with the harness still 
attached.

I put it online a few weeks ago but we're having a glitch with the 
server, so I'll try to dig it up and temporarily re-post the pages you 
need tonight at www.pottsfamily.ca.


Happy trails,
