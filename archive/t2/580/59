Subject: Windshield wiper blues

I have a problem with my bus's wipers not pressing hard enough on the
windshield.  If I get out and press on the arms while they operate they wipe
correctly, but by themselves they miss the middle part of their swing across
the windshield.  I just replaced the blades, so I assume that it's not them.

Could the springs that hold the arms against the windshield be weak from age
('77)?  Would it help to twist them around one turn to increase their
tension?  Has anyone tried this before?
