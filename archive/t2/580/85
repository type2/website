Subject: Fuel Injection Harness Testing

One more for the FI Savist out there. I am finishing up my FI rebirth on "el 
Verde" and I want to test my wiring harness. It is not installed and I need 
some direction as to what pins to what wires to check for what resistance, 
etc. Bentley touches on this but shows only one test being performed and 
does not list results or others. Anybody have any quick links to this 
process or have any guidelines general or specific that could help me out.

Thanks,

Michael Knight
'77 Westy Deluxe AT, "el Verde"
