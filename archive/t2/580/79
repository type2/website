I'm probably going to do that myself, Alex.  The blade assemblies have seen
better days and I'm hoping that replacing them will solve the problem.  The
ironic thing is that light finger pressure on the arm causes the blade to
wipe correctly.  Weird.

(Glenn, I actually thought about giving the springs a twist to tighten them
up or maybe squeezing the clip to shorten it's length.  I'll probably try
the solution above first, though.)

Thanks.
