Subject: RE: [T2] Injector Rebuilder?

Chris,

Click through the site they actually do a lot more. They even make them 
"pretty". Good asthetics that your engine will enjoy. But it will also help 
keep them protected for some time to come. This is a hands off aproach that 
tests them and rebuilds them. Specialty tools etc. used to disassemble them 
and clean them. You basically get your four done for less than the cost of 
one single new Bosch injector. I have tried to contimplate many ways to do 
this myself you could run a bunch of cleaner through them. But to open the 
valves in them at a pulsed rate that will not burn out the injectors seems 
to be the problem.

Later,

Michael Knight
