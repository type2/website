Hi Volks,

It's overdue, but  at least it's done.  For those who want a full 
report of my clutch-busting adventure attending BusFusion 2004 two 
weeks ago, you can get your fill here:

Many thanks to Frank Condelli, and the BusFusion committee, and to Ben 
Huot, Cory Petrie and Collie Corner for their assistance with my 
"Technical Difficulties".

Happy trails,
