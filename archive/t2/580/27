This bus is so awesome.   I don't know why anyone has not ponied up the 
cash to buy it.  When I flew out and took over guardianship of Zorm 
(Mike's old 58 SC), he picked me up at the airport in this bus.  If I 
wasn't busy with multiple jobs, full time graduate school, and two 
little kids, I would just go get it myself.

If you have thought to yourself...this is a bus that would be fun.  Go 
buy it.  I promise you will love it.

Shameless plug for this amazing bus...out!
