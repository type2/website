Subject: Gas coming out of filler neck?

Hello,

For some reason, while I am driving, gas is coming out of the filler neck 
and running down the side of my van.

Is this a ventilation problem? I have not hooked up my charcoal canister 
yet, could this be causing the problem? Faulty gas cap? The gas cap I 
noticed is not vented, should it be?

Thanks in advance for your assistance,

Phil.
