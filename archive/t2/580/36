Subject: Drop-centre wheel =?iso-8859-1?b?NL1feDE1?=

I've got two 4= x 15 drop-centre wheels; don't know what year 5bus they came 
from; am hoping to find two more.  FYI... 4= is the rim width and 15 is the 
nominal diameter, both in inches; these numbers are stamped on the wheel inside 
the area normally covered by the hubcap.

Here's my problem:  Local VW shop guys tell me there never was a 4=x15 even 
when I show them my two.  AYMK the common wheel on very early buses was 4x15.  
Around 1968/9 the wheels were 5x14, where 5 is the rim width and 14 is the 
nominal diameter.  Can someone tell me what year/s the Type II was supplied 
with the 4=" rim width??  Thanks!  Glenn McCcomas, Queenstown, MD
