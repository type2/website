Subject: 71 gas door questions

Hello listers!
I have a couple of questions about the fuel door area on my bus...

1. My 71 bus has a lock on the fuel door. Is this the handy work of my
previous owner or was this a option way back when?

2. There is a little hole right beneath my gas neck. What does this drain
to? I ask because when I wash the car or when it rains, water pools around
that hole. I'd hate to have water draining into the gas...

Thanks for any info you can shed.
