Hey folks,

I have been trying to support the list by replying dirrectly to folks
becuase for some reason my messages to the list don't come thruogh. Anyway..
this did.

Our website doesn't proccess credit cards still, yet (you'll have to call
the toll free number 1-877-897-3211 877-TYPE211), and has been neglected for
the last year or so but all that is changing. I have been busy getting stock
back up and we are now offer a ton of new parts. Fair warning to all other
venders out there. We are growing! We have some new supplier accounts up and
running and can now start to compete with the big boys. Not to mention we
don't sell that other stuff for those other things. Just bay window bus
parts.

Oh yeah and we had to change the name ahhhhh. don't get me started. Anyway
both domains still work www.bustedbus.com and www.mitchellmotorworks.com.
Again there is still allot of stuff to be added. Give us a call and we'll
let you know price and availabilty.

We'll enough cheap marketing, drop me a line if I can help, I know a thing
or two about these things.
