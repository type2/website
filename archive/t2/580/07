 Ahh, wrong, the gear on the bottom of the distributor
must be left alone, the big gear below the distributor
is the one that is being talked about, it must be
pulled out and positioned at the correct angle with
the engine at #1 TDC, don't be pulling that little
gear off the bottom of the distributor... Phil
