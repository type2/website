I just rebuilt a TypeIV 2000cc and I had the same oil pressure problem of
*Excessive*. Found a bur on my plunger, checked it with a micrometer,
filed it down and reinstalled it. Oil pressure now at 70 PSI at 3300
RPMs, 20-22 Psi at 8-900 RPMs about 40-50 Psi normal driving around town
at operating oil temps around 210-220.
You just never know what the last owner did to an engine until you've
fixed all the things he screwed up.
