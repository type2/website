THAT is a really good idea! Maybe ensure a supply of parts for a bit longer and
maybe even fix some existing bugs?
And being non-manned it probably doesn't need to be certified like a regular
aircraft engine. I remember a few years ago Porsche made some of their engines
into aircraft engines. Turned out they had to build a completely separate assembly
line. That musta taken some of the glimmer off the coin!
