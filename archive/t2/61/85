Wow Jake! Lots of questions. Thanks for the input!

The cam and lifters were both new. So were the adjustment screws and I noted
that the ends on some of them were not uniform as some had a dome and some
were more "pointed" on the contact surface. I actually filed the point down
a but on a couple of them before installation.

>>>>>>>Ws this a new case? used case? what machine work was done if it was a
used case?

The case was used from the 1971 DP bus. Universal Mexican case that was in
that bus when I bought it around 1983. It was bored .020 for new bearings.
Does that sound right?

>>>>>>>Whats your compression ratio set at? ignition timing (-at-) full advance?
how black is the tail pi[pe or plugs?

Compression ratio 7.5:1 Timing set at 28 degrees maximum advance. I did not
notice the tail pipe or look at the plugs yet.

> >>>>>>>>What weight oil are you using?

Run in was done with straight 30w oil. I put it straight 40w after the run
in (Paranoia again).

The crank was balanced dynamically on a machine. I asked about marks when I
picked it up and the shop owner explained that the parts were balanced
individually. That troubled me some at the time, but what do I know? The
pistons were balanced on an electronic scale as were the rods. The shop has
a good reputation but they *did* press on the wrong timing gear which cost
me one days work. Now I wonder if there was some mix up and I actually have
someone else's crank. No way to find out at this point. What will the mild
rpm dependant vibration mean in the long run?

Thanks!
