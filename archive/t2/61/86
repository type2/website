I mark all parts before sending to the machinist and check them when they
get back. You only learn to do this kind of thing if you do more than one
motor every 10 years.

Propogation of cracks at stress risers is the worst case senerio. They can
part your crank into more than one part. After verifing compression
balance, valve adjustment, ignition and mixture to confirm it's not
something else, I would discuss it with the machinist. If he was paid to
balance the components and they aren't balanced, I would give him the
engine complete, not stripped long block, and have him do the dissassembly,
correction and reassembly. You will have to eat the engine R&R.

If he won't agree to do this, hire a better machinist to tear it down,
weight everything, and put the empirical numbers in a report with a
statement of the adequecy or lack thereof of the work. Dated and signed
before a notary. Then to small claims.

Or, eat it and hope for the best. Do make sure you let others know where
not to get their machine work done, if you prove it's a machinist problem.
