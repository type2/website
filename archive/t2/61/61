Subject: Re: [T2] Three oil changes

As thick as the oil was I'd say it could have has a fair amount of Snake
Oil, FuFu, STP or other additives that are available through farm and
ranch supply stores.
I'm thinking that it may start burning oil and quickly become a smoker
now that I've unclogged the pores.
Bentley manuals just don't excite me. I've worn out several Hayes Manuals
and I have a few others but I just never got turned onto sorting through
1240 pages to get my answers.
