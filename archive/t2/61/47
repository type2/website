It distresses me to do this but I must sell my 1972 Westy which has just =
finished a 2.5 year restoration from ground up. This was lovingly done =
with attention to detail. Some of you have helped me with this project =
(Busted Bus and Oldvolks to name a few) and the labor was one of love. =
There is too much to describe in detail but I would gladly send pics of =
the entire process, copies of all work and references. The first bidder =
over $10,000 gets it. Health reasons force this decision. If you feel =
compelled to respond with advice feel free. I have had a great time =
reading all the interaction on this site.
Thanks,
