Billy,

Down here in Arkansas, *all* the air cooled folks wave.  The "new
Beetle" folks just stare or act like they have seen nothing at all.

Maybe I'll jack up my 68 dbl cab like those bajabus folks and then we can
see how the 4wd folks take it.  

On my 78 maiden voyage last weekend(before the ice and snow here), I had
forgotten that you are actually sitting higher than most of the SUV
folks...feels good to look down on them every once in awhile after driving
a bug<grin>.  Now maybe I can get some r*e*s*p*e*c*t!

Just remember that most buses have a higher clearance than jeeps!

My girlfriend just bought a 67 camper....she was exceptionally thrilled
when someone shot her a peace sign...hahaha


Cheers, dave
