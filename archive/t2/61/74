Subject: Re: sticky oil piston




took out the relief piston today; had a few microscopic slivers of engine
in there from the infamous shim-in-gears event. sigh.
anyways, the piston was a little scored, and was also the short kind,
similar to the pressure control piston. i replaced it with a 'vw' stamped
one that has the deep groove near the top, and is longer (they look like
the weights you put on an old-fashioned scale!).
when fired up, oil (which was warm at this point) went to about 70 and
stayed there for a bit; took my foot off the gas and it dropped to 30.
drove it around - would go to 65-70, stay there, no wobbles. dropped back
to 20-30 at idle.  didn't go above 70 no matter what the rev, but it is 70
degrees out today. i'll try first thing in cold am.

does this sound right, or is the longer piston doin' something funny? it is
the one in the muir book drawing, but i notice that all the aftermarket
ones seem to be just a plain, shorter cup. maybe they are just too cheap to
do the machine work and make the 'correct'piston.

anyways, i'll drive it around and see what the gauge does in varying
circumstances.
thanks for your time!
