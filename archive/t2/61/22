Subject: Single Cab Weight Distribution

Can anyone tell me what the weight distribution (front/rear) for a 1971
single cab is.  Specifically, I going to pick up the truck tomorrow with
a 16' tandem trailer and I'm wondering whether it be better to load it
nose first or vise versa, for handling considerations.

I pulled a single cab home one time using a dolly with the front down,
couldn't manage better the 40 mph because the whole assembly started
swaying from side to side.

TIA,

Chad
