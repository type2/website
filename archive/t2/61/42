Subject: antiques of all kinds

By definition a car that is 30 years old or older is
an antique.
  That has been my understanding  of the definition at
least... right? wrong? anyone?
----------------------------------------
are Classic Car People, and they're a totally
different breed than Bus People. There's overlap in
ownership, since splitties are fancy antique cars 
whereas my treasured bay is merely an old car;

 I see a lot of comments about hippie culture these
days.. some positive some negative. As with any other
"group" there were the good, the bad,& the ugly.
Most were/are good people. Many you may see every day
"at the office" and will never know they were/are.
In general, lumping people into one catagory, in my
opinion, is a result of a thought process that is
lacking in real information. (ignorance) 
  Unless you were there during that time it probably
is best to educate yourself on the subject first.
  Peace!
