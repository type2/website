Subject: YAHOO! Gene Berg Shifter Back in Service

'Morning Folks,
        Took my '77 Westy out yesterday for its weekly cruise-this time =
with my newly reinstalled Gene Berg shifter. I obtained this shifter 4 =
years ago when I bought my Westy, a '76. The cable for the reverse =
lock-out was broken, and that made it very tricky to shift into second =
without hitting reverse by accident. I replaced it in the '76 with a =
stock shifter from a junkyard, and the Berg shifter ended up getting =
buried in my garage, where I found it about a month ago. I sent it off =
to Berg to get it fixed ($36.95 plus shipping) and got it back this =
week. What a joy it is to drive a bus with this shifter! Very solid =
feel, not the "wobbly" feel of the stock shifter. On a side note, after =
the drive I gave the exterior it's weekly once over, checking for any =
scratches, paint chips, etc., and was dismayed to find some light rust =
creeping out from under the seal of the &%^$# crank out window on the =
drivers side. Lifting the seal  with a wooden stick revealed some gouges =
in the paint that occurred during the reinstall of the window. I nearly =
had a stroke trying to get those damn windows back in after the repaint =
last summer. Looks like that window is going to have to come out again =
<sigh>.=20
