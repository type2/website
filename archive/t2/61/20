Subject: CD ignition and the rotor

I just installed a Tiger CDI unit to go with the 1776 in my '71 Westy. I'm
running it with a stock DVA distributor.

That night, thanks to a list member's post,  I came across the beautifully
detailed site by  Erin Huelsmann that describes how to rip the resistor out
of the stock rotor and replace it with a piece of wire.

Now, I bought a CDI because Bob Hoover recommended it so highly in one of
his articles. Funny, I thought, that he didn't mention shunting the
resistor.

What is the function of that resistor in the circuit?  Has anyone had his
rotor fry from the use of a CDI?
