Subject: Very Intermittent Loss of Power

I just wanted to thank everyone for your ideas.  Thanks!

Based on the collective responses - I'm going to go after the fuel 
tank/debris hypothesis first.  It's cheap, I'll learn how to take the tank 
out and I'll replace all of my rubber fuel lines at the same time.  The work 
doesn't seem too tricky - just smelly and possibly explosive! - I'll heed 
the advice to keep a helper and extinguisher nearby.

When I'm done, the fuel system should be eliminated from the problem.  If 
the loss of power events return, then I'll go after the air 
control/electrical components.
