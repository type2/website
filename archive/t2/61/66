Subject: Re: [T2] More looking at vans....


More on this van - one of my cousins saw it for me today as he lives in
the area. He thinks the ticking or clicking may be the drive axles, but
that they will go that way for a long time.

He thinks there is a vacuum
leak or bad cylinder head as there is a "sh" sound while it's starting up
- and that all the hoses should be replaced as well as the head.

He said if I'm really into the "scene" it would be a great van, otherwise
I might have it in to a mechanic once a month for repairs (which I doubt.)

He liked the body and anterior, new tires, etc.

Sounds like I should get a compression test? And take it to another
mechanic as I wouldn't want to get into a new head that early in the
game...

 Aside
from  that he thought I'd be better off buying a new Azuzu trooper.
