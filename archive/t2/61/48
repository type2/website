Subject: 82 Westy for sale (again)

Hi all,

     Due to our continued financial problems I am forced to put my 82
Vanagon Westy up for sale again.  I am in need to sell this quick.  I have
lowered the asking price but I am still negotiable.  I would like to get
$4000 if possible.  Make me a offer.  Here are the particulars.

      82 air-cooled Vanagon Westfalia. 2.0L FI engine.  The following have
been replaced in the last year.  Tires, windshield & seal, propane
regulator, clutch, pilot bearing, clutch slave cylinder, muffler, catalytic
converter, cold start valve, AFM, injector seals, air tube seals,  all small
vacuum lines, fuel tank sender, vent lines & grommets, front brakes with
hardware kits, fuel filter, plugs, wires, Pertronix, air filter.  I have
these & many more receipts for this van.  All the camping equipment works
great.  Fridge lights quickly & works in all modes.  Propane tank is full &
ready to camp.  All screens, curtains & cushions are in very good shape.
There are a few dents in the body.  The link below will take you to all the
pictures I have.  If anyone is interested please p-mail me as soon as
possible.  Thanks.
