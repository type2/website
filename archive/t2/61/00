Subject: alt vs.gen

While endlessly pondering motor the impending motor build I was 
wondering if I should upgrade from a generator to an alternator. I 
have two currently working gens still in the fan shrouds. Aside from 
move amps and the built in reg is there any other advantage to going 
with an alt? Is there any disadvantage to the alt?
