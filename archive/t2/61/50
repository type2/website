[wiper wires fixed snip]

i owe the fact that i have my vehicle for life to the list. a year ago
today a listee dropped the classified2000.com advert on the list. another
listee in the area 10 hours drive away from me sussed it out 30 minutes
away from him. he sent e-photos, put me up and fed me at his house,
introduced me to his friends, took me to work all day before the deal went
down, got the non-running garbage-laden beater rust bucket to idle, and
finally on a very steep muddy slope driveway along a dark wet dangerous
double curve stretch of u.s.101 and logger trucks, he helped me get the
doublecab onto a trailer, which in and of itself was a circus nightmare i
won't rehash. (only took out a mile marker - none of the 10 people involved
got seriously injured) and during that trailering time he had to meet a
special 'nam buddie he hadn't seen in years. but he put that off to make
sure i was on the trailer. then he took me with him to his scheduled
appointment near the guiness tap. shining listee/airs example. alas, this
knowledgable extremely caring and talented engine rebuilder, 'cause of the
silly feuding that goes on here infrequently enough sending these special
kinda folks "back up to the hills", quit the list. ugly ending right?    -
