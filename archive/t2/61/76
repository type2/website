Subject: Westy Tent for sale


Hi all,

Just ran into a Westy tent, that has had very little use.
The tent is very clean,and according to the PO, only used it 3 times,
because his vehicle burnt up, at an early age, due to a cooking mishap.

Anyway, I did find three minor things wrong with it.
There is a hole the size of a pencil in the froont door screen, two of
the rubber bands, that mount the top to the frame are gone, and the bags
for the tent and poles are gone----he told me his son went to college,
and needed them for something ----Other than that, it is very nice, and
clean, and all the zipper's are operable, and the rubber drip moulding
connecting peice is in like new condition.

P- Mail me if any of you are interested--

Thanks,
