Ok   We nailed that one pretty quick but,

What is hanging off of the cabinet on my '69 Westy?

It looks like a bag. It has gold snaps that match the curtain straps, which
leads me to believe it is original. I was thinking maybe for the side tent
or something?

By the way Rocky Mountain Motor works sells the swamp coolers new...but they
are around 400 bucks!!!
