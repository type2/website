Subject: Paranoid maintenance pays off again.

Paranoid maintenance pays off again. Just as a routine I readjusted my
hydraulic lifters on my new Air Cooled 2000cc engine (5,000 miles). In
the process I found my rocker shafts to be loose enough that the
retaining nuts could be loosened by just slight pressure. I didn't find
any damage to the rocker assemblies or adjusting screws but I'm just real
glad that my thinking directed to get this valve adjustment done rather
than putting it off.
Since I know these nuts were torqued properly at installation time the
only reason that they might have gotten loose would be the poor condition
of the spring washers that appear to be pretty much no longer spring
washers.
