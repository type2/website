Stir the bile with your fingertip while shining a light on it. See little
flashes of metallic dust going sparkle, sparkle??? Gauling will come with
further running. Have you checked the crankshaft endplay??? Get ingenious
somehow and measure it at the fan pully. Just grab it best you can and pull
it in and out. If it goes "ca-chunk" every time you push or pull, don't
waste another dime or any more time on less than a longblock rebuild. God
knows it has the right to go "ca-chunk" any time it wants to, as long as
its soon.

If you want to risk the core value, I'm willing to wait and see what
happens, as long as I have tried with diligence to advise the client
otherwise. Also, don't forget to mention the risks if you do the big
CACHUNK!!! in an unknow area and you get towed to TSFH (The Shop From Hell).
