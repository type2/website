When you turn corners, you can hear the tide come and go with the surf.
On a really plus tide, your clutch foot might get wet when making sharp
right turns.  DO NOT ask me how I know this.  ;-)

Look in that gully below the left headlamp bucket.  Find the plastic
drain hose for the fresh air plenum.  Pull it up and out of the hole
in the gully and the swamp will drain.  Then put the plastic hose
back in the hole, find and stop the leak.
