Mike ,

Where in the Chicago area were you?

I've seen maybe 6 Vanagon's, and 4 Buses in 5 years-----( Not counting
the Crystal Lake VW show )

These vehicles just don't seem to be a popular item around here. 

When I come upon another Bus of Van, I do usually get a high sign, from
the driver----

Later,

Terry

I think it might be the area. When I drive my Bus around (I'm 30 minutes
-south- of Atlanta) I get strange looks, a couple waves, always waves
from other AC VW owners. When I drove a Bus up in the Chicago area, no
one ever gave it a second look. I also remember seeing more of them up
there, which is funny, due to the cold weather and rust. Go figure.

I know that we're all a bunch of bus-nuts who eat, drink, and sleep
these things; but there seems to be a group of people out there who have
never seen a camper bus, nevermind ride in one. 
I just took five people to lunch in my bus, three of which are well old
enough to remember when air-cooled VWs reigned supreme. Based on the
sheer awe, and silly (to me) questions - you would think they were
riding in a space ship. It was as if I had created this thing in the
garage, and it was the only one of it's kind. The biggest suprise to
them all was that I had a closet in my van. 
They spent the entire ride (20 minutes each way) opening all the doors,
playing with the sink, and asking where the bathroom is. 
This is not the first time I've had this reaction to people seeing the
camper. When I drove my bug, everyone stopped me with a "I used to have
one of these" stories. With this, people just seem amazed. Is it my
location, 30 miles East of Atlanta, or are we just the lucky ones?
