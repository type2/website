Subject: NW VW Vendors

A more thorough listing of Seattle area VW savy businesses. No personal
experience with Oval's, but I've been to Autovice Lynwood, and they are
truely well equiped and support the VW croud with extra efforts to the VW
clubs. Berg's reputation preceeds him. Just hanging around his Dad for many
years puts him in possession of very high level knowledge in some cases
beyond that of the factory. The factory never build a 300hp T-I, so knew
not of case web creeping warping the crank at 7000 rpm.

NW ConRod I've said before, quality work and righeous assembly every time
I've used them. Personal service, good communication, and even good
tolerance for helping newbees, and such as neandereers who skipped a step
in the correct procedure in haste and are in need of correction.
