Subject: where is this oil coming from?

Ok, put the oil cooler in with new seals..... new points, got the timing
set.... all is running fine.... except for the small trail of oil when
running down the road, and the puddle of oil when stopped for any reason....
be it stop light or whatever....
Does any one have any idea where it could be coming from.  When I check the
oil before pouring more in... it is on the bottom mark on the dip stick..
(1600DP engine).
Thanks
Gail Doles
