Subject: Junk Yard Find

Hey List!! Wonder of wonders..I found a 72 Sportmobile in a LOCAL
pull-a-part. That has never happened before, not around here. There was also
an 85 Vanagon with a complete engine.

Speaking of the 85, the fron seats are in really nice condition, albiet a
bit faded. They're the captains chair style and I'm thinking of getting them
for my 74. I checked the archives and didn't find the specific info I'm
looking for, so here goes.  I know I'll need the tracks and all from the 85
seats to put them into my 74. How do I get the tracks out? Are they bolted
in? Welded; spot welded, I hope? If spot welded, can I drill out the welds?
This yard doesn't allow torches and the bus is too far from a power source
for a sawzall or angle grinder. My cordless drill is probably what I'll have
to use.  Any suggestions? Don't be shy!

Thanks in advance,
Dave
