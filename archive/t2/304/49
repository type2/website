Subject: Air conditioning for a bay

I have a complete air conditioning system from my 73 bay that I would 
like to sell.
It is everything from the compressor hoses, both evaperators, 
condesnsor.
I got this buss as a project and the engine/compressor was out so I 
never had it working but the parts are all in serviceable condition.
If you have the horsepower to spare or just can't stand the heat this 
is the VW of Americas answer to your prayers.
Respond if you would like to be cool next summer.
