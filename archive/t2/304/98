Subject: Re: [T2] headliner vs. windshield dilemma

David,

Bite the bullet and do it!  The windshield and all side
windows *must* come out to be able to install a new headliner.

I am about 95% done on mine(78 std) and after I finally figured out
how I was going to install it, it went pretty well.

The front windshield *must* be out in order to stretch the headliner
properly(my method).  It will be about the last thing to go back in
when you are done.

The biggest problem with the headliners available now is that they are
*not* correctly manufactured.  You will need to take your old headliner
and the new one to an upholstery shop and get new and better bow holders
that have the correct drop from the roof sewn on.

My local upholstery guy knew exactally what I was talking about when I
went by and explained what I thought was wrong with mine.  TMI just told 
me that none of their "professional" installers were having any problems.
What a bunch of BS!  The local guy said that TMI made pretty good stuff, 
but that he had problems with their attitude and some of their products
like the headliner.

One of the other list members has an ACME headliner from Bus-Depot and
theirs are not made any better in terms of the bow holders.

Sew-fine gave me the specs on theirs and they are not any different/better
either.

Make sure you number your bows when you take them out as they are not all 
the same!

Cheers, dave
