Subject: Re: [T2] Ignition power usage

This may sound too simple but just get out the ammeter and  measure the 
total current required in the line you wish to fuse.

  Does anyone know how much power is used by the coil, chokes, and solenoids
powered by the ignition wire on a '77 2L bus (dual carb)?
