Hiya All,

Thanks to you all who helped straighten me out on Roberto's predicament down 
in sunny Venezuela.  
Yes, I was aware of the General Strike.  Yes, I was aware of the long waiting 
lines for gasoline.  
Unfortunately, I either misread or misunderstood Roberto's original post.  I 
believe he had mentioned that, due to the strike, the only gas available was 
uncertified.  That started me off on the track of, "perhaps this uncertified 
gasoline is lacking in some qualities".  And following that track I was 
wondering what adding oil to gasoline would accomplish in terms of improving 
the quality of the gasoline.
I realize now that poor old Roberto is just trying to stretch his supply of 
gasoline.  Sorry if I got anybody's nose out of joint - it surely was not 
intentional.  I promise to work on my comprehension in the coming new year.  
And for that matter, a Happy New Year to All - especially to Roberto.  I hope 
things get back to normal for you.

Mike
