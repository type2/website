We don't have any roads or highways that you can go over 55 legally, and 
none that you can go that fast any ways - Maui is a pretty slow, lazy 
paced place and the tourist are all looking at the scenery and not the 
road.   Although some do try to make it into the 24 hours at La Mons 
(sp?).  

We do have the "Road to Hana".  This is a 53 mile stretch of winding 
road that'll take you 3 to 3.5 hours to drive.  The local curitisey is 
to pull over and stop when a faster car comes up from behind.  This 
allows those who want to drive fast, on a narrow winding 1.5 lane road, 
to do so - while you maintain a safe speed.  I will sometimes pass 
slower cars because my bus cruses best in third at 30 while using little 
of the breaks.
