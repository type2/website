Subject: Re:  tapping sound

>So I start my bus up and i notice this tapping
sound comeing from the rear. I give it some more
gave and it hesitates. Then i keep giving it gas 
and it smoothes out (takes a couple of seconds
and a bit of gas), but the taping sound is much
louder at the higher rev. 

Not alot of information.  You have a 72, so it
should have solid lifters, but who knows.  Does
it go away after you run the bus some?  Is it
worse when the bus sets for a long time?  Maybe
hydraulic lifters are stuck.

No matter what, check your lifters.  With solid
lifters, you should be under that bus every few
thousand miles.  Every oil change at least and
any time the bus engine performance or sound
changes.  Read Muir for the philosophy and
procedure.  Learn to love the valve adjustment
procedure.  Your bus will appreciate you for it. 


Differential diagnosis should also consider
almost any moving part, such as the fan.  Before
you get under the bus with a stethoscope or long
handled screwdriver, try pushing down on the top
of the engine (use the alternator or some other
handy place).  Noise stop?  Check the engine and
tranny mounts.  

My last vanagon had both lifter issues and bad
engine mounts, so it could be both.  Have fun.
