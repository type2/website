Warren- OK, then:
A woodpecker in your engine is a cheap problem.
A little peanut butter would shut him up :)
A rod knock, however, is a rebuild, complete with
crankshaft / rod- repair / replace and new bearings.
Usually involves the purcha$e of many new components.
That's the expen$ive $ound. Do you feel Lucky ?!
