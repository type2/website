Subject: Re: [T2] 1st year sunroof

I just looked in my 68 and 69 sales brochures...
Both say "Get a wagon with a sliding roof* and settle for open space."

*optional at extra cost

Then I went to my 68+ parts book. Steel sunroofs came on models 225, 228, 235,
241, 244, 251, and 285 from chassis no. 228 133164. This means 68 models.....
sorry, I do not know when in the production of 68's #133164 was made.

And all 68-72 pop top Westies were built from sunroof buses.
