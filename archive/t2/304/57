Dave,

I have one of these also(68 DC) and got my front floor pans from
RMMW a couple of years ago.  They were made by Vinge...I think.

Alan Scofield in England has them also, but I think he gets them
from the same Danish source(some he makes himself).

The drivers side one was kinda funky and did not match the original
stampings very well, but looked as if it would fit ok...I only needed part 
of it and ended up cutting it so that it matched what i cut out pretty 
well.

The passenger side one is still awaiting installation.

Cheers, dave
