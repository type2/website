Hello All      I told Craig about making this tool. plain metal bar 2 feet 
long bend a 90 degree at one end about 2 inches long. cut out a U shape on 
the end thats bent. drill a oversize hole in the bend. use air in the cly. to 
hold valves attact the tool to the rocker studs and press the spring. use a 
small magnet to catch the keepers. After getting apart check the groves on 
the valves. seen a whole bunch of these wore out. Means pulling the head at 
that point. The rope in the clys. works but is a PITA compared to the air 
power. The valves tend to give making re-atttacting the keepers a job.    
Later guys and have fun  been there done that   Mark Dearing  Salem Import
