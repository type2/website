Hey,

That October bus-commercial van is from Melbourne Australia, Toorak Rd,
Toorak, dry cleaners.  Must be a Rob King contribution!  The Aussies
used to do funny things with their busses.  I used to see lots of them
when I lived there for two years in the late 60's.

Why buy as calendar when you can have one free from here?>?!!.  Little
personalized for Buskatiers but there are some good busses there too. 
No
Vanagon's though.  It is a PDF based calendar so you need Adobe's PDF
