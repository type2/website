Subject: Re: [T2] Outdoor Storage Options

  Your best bet is a breathable cover.  One made for storing cars outside.  
I opted for a big green tarp.  I find that if I pull it off about 1 time a 
week, she dries out.  Best thing is to coat the underside, and rusty spots 
in oil or grease (after washing salt off, and letting it dry).  I have seen 
surplus Russian fire arms that have been packed in grease since the late 
50's, some in very moist places, and they fair excellent.  I use vasaline on 
all of my chrome until winter is over.  Since grease, and oil repel water, 
they work well to keep rust away.  My whole chassis is covered in axle 
grease in the driveway.  I can tell you the next door neighbor made a 
temporary garage with some framework, and tarps from Wally world.  We had 2 
feet of snow on Christmas, and it did not collapse.  His car is nice and dry 
as well.  I think I may look into this option myself next year.  I like it 
because it can be taken down in the summer.
  Hope this helps.             Bus Gypsy
