Subject: Timing marks on crank gear

After splitting the case completely so we can get the bearings lined up right,
 my father noticed that the timing marks on the crank gear and cam valve gear
were off by one tooth. We reseated the gear as it should be:

Is there any reason these gear would be set one tooth off? Or is this just the
source of our mysteriously difficult timing problems?

P.S. That's a '74 1.8l pancake
