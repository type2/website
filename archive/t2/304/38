Subject: Leftover parts for sale

My '82 Vanagon still doesn't run (current suspect is a bad
computer/injector control unit).

Anyway, I've a bunch of leftover NEW parts for sale if anyone needs
them:

1. Fuel filter. This is the square plastic white one that sits between
the fuel tank and fuel pump. You cannot replace the long metallic
round post-pump filter with this.

2. Muffler plus tail pipe. I got this as part of Bus Depot's "Complete
Exhaust System" kit for '79-'83 Bus/Aircooled Vanagon (Bus Depot part
number 071 251 053CK). I ended up using only the crossover pipe with a
cat convertor and a cherrybomb glasspack.

3. The "clamp, catalytic or connecting pipe to muffler" (Bus Depot
part number 023 298 051)
