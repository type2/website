Subject: Re:Smog and EGR 

I just finished a total rebuild of my 1976 two liter engine, and I have 
been through the EGR system and the problems with the "S" boot. You already 
have some very complete advice about the EGR, so I'll address the "S" boot.

The "S" boot takes an enormous amount of vibrational punishment because one 
end is connected to the engine, which bounces around considerably, and the 
other is connected to the air flow meter/mixture control unit, which is 
locked on to the chassis and which doesn't move much. The "S" boot has 
taken all the vibrations of the engine and has absorbed them, ever since 1978.

It is possible that about 25 years of vibration and heat has caused a crack 
in it, at the end of the boot that attaches to the throttle body. Mine had 
such a defect, and the crack opened and closed  rather randomly, based on 
engine vibration, temperature, and other factors.   I replaced the "S" boot 
and obtained consistent sealing of the system, which allowed for adjustment 
of the mixture.  With the cracked boot, mixture requirements were subject 
to change, at the whim of the crack in the boot.

I think you might benefit from removing the boot and checking it outside 
the engine compartment, on the bench. There you can flex the boot by hand 
and watch for any cracks that might open up.  New boots are available for 
reasonable prices.

I noticed that the molded hose from the s-boot to the decel valve had come
off slightly so I pushed it back on and adjusted the idle with the screw and
it runs smooth again but the vacuum is still way too low at 12".

Any suggestions about what to do? I have zero experience with the EGR valve.
