Some sort of EGR add-on?  It appears to feed into the manifold just below
the carburator and have a valve to control flow.

That is one heck of "Sherman-Williams Refurbishment" on that manifold!
Look at the severe rust pitting on the heat riser under the pretty silver
paint!

Ah, well, the seller says that he's buying a GEX 1800cc engine.  What goes
around comes around...
