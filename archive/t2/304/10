Subject: Seats and Headrests for Sale CHEAP

I have driver's and passenger's seats from 73 bus.  They will fit earlier Bays.  They need new covers but the frames are in excellent shape.  They are probably too large to ship.  I am in Connecticut and can hold on to them for a month or so until someone can pick them up.  FREE.

I also have the light tan headrests for each seat.  I will consider shipping these for postage and small handling charge if there is no interest in the seats.
