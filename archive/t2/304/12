More than likely, the holes are not there until you cut them and then put in
the plastic guides.
Since you say you have a 79 bus and you put in a childs cot, I am assuming you
do not have a Westy?
If the seats you have are brown vinyl and they are in good shape
otherwise..... you can push in the plugs that take the place of the headrests
for the rear seats. I have a bunch of those plugs......
