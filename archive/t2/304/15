Craig, my understanding is that if you have compressed air and your valves
and rings are in good shape, you can use a sparkplug adapter to blow
compressed air into the cylinder (like a leakdown tester does), when it's on
it's compression stroke at TDC, and this will keep the valves against their
seats. You then can compress the springs with (here's where it let's me
down) a spring compressor that uses the rocker arm studs to brace against,
and remove the keepers and springretainer. Hmmmmm, that spring compressor
might be the fly in the ointment, trying to locate. In any case, that's how
I've seen it done, maybe that helps a little??
