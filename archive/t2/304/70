Hiya Roberto,

I'm no petrochemist so I cannot give you an answer to your question.  But it 
does seem to me a that any sort of "heavy" additive you might add to your 
gasoline may have the tendency to be hard on your injectors.

By the way, I'm interested to know just exactly why you want to add oil to 
the gasoline.  What is this supposed to accomplish?
