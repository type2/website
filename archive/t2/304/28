Subject: Bus for sale

No, none of mine.  While on a quest for a legend, I 
happened across a really nice 68.  No underneath rust, 
very little surface rust, 82kmiles, in all a really solid 
bus.  Red paint faded a bit.  If I hadn't such good luck 
chasing a legend today I would probably have bought this 
one myself.  The guy is asking $1800 but I bet you could 
pick iy t up for much less if you tried.

I can provide pix and contact info on request.

THIS BUS IS WELL WORTH THE PRICE AND IS VERY RUST FREE 
(for an east coast bus) yes I was yelling so you guys 
would hear it.
