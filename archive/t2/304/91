if you haven't pulled the windshield you don't really know if its rusty
under the seal or not imho.  pull it and check for piece of mind and while
you are at it put a little grease on the metal frame before
reinstallation.  i say this because i had a friend that worked for several
years at a glass shop.

the common approach they took in replacing most windows was this.  if
they pulled the window and there was rust underneath they would wire
brush the rust and goop the rusted area including the pits.  then slap the
whole thing back together, this was as long as there was no rust showing
outside of the seal area.  they had about 10% come backs with this method
and most of those they just squirted a bit more goop under the seal.  most
glass customers are looking a "economical" repair that looks good from the
outside.  so if you really like this van pull the windshield and check.
