Oh the horror, the horror. 
My mom gave my 4.5 year old son one of those Barbie VW microbusses, at least 
it's blue and not one of the pink ones. Despite my disdain for the new microbus 
and barbie dolls, I felt compelled to give him a couple of small Grateful Dead 
stickers for it. 
OTOH, Mom more than made up for that by getting me a Craftsman 30 gal. 150 psi 
air compressor :-)
