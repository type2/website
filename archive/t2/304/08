Dear Listtes.

Please be advised, that yet another VW Bus book has
recently been announced, this time in the January 2003
issue of Volksworld magazine.

It is:

How to Modify Your VW Bus Suspension, Brakes and
Chassis for High Performance, SpeedPro Series Book,
written by James Hall, if I remember correctly.

Regards.
