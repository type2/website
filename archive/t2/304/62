Jeff,

Are you going to be re-bushing the rods yourself? These parts would usually
be sourced by your machine shop. There are lots of bushes that will work,
they don't have to be a vw-specific part. I don't know what kind of bushings
Rimco uses but I had my rods done up here in toronto and the new bushes were
bronze. Rimco charges 15.00 per rod to recondition.

The holes are drilled in the bushes after they are pressed in, by the way,
there are no holes in the bushes until this is done.

The pelican bushes don't seem to have a split, but I don't know what they
are made from.
