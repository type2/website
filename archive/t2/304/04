Some people are intimidated by other drivers passing them on the highway??
Then why in the world would they even consider driving an air cooled VW? I
drive my 74 everywhere, from lonely country lanes late at night to major
cities (like Nashville, Louisville, and Detroit) at rush hour. I stay in the
right lane and do my best to be considerate of those who wish to get around
me, but I don't speed up just because everyone else is going faster. That's
what all those lanes are for--to accomodate a variety of drivers and
vehicles.

On a deeper level, if you speed up just because other people are driving
faster than you are, you're allowing your actions to be defined by the
actions of those around you. Keep that up and you're headed for trouble, and
not just on the highway either.
