Subject: Mix in gas tank

--Guys,

Before this get's any farther out there, oil is mixed in gas for small engines like two-strokes(chainsaws/leafblowers). The original poster has some on hand for his small engines, and is in venezuela, which is having a general strike right now, and is not getting supplied with gas as usual. It was all written in his post.



i would assume adding oil to the gas is like adding water to milk when you dont have enough milk left over and cant get to the store right away or cant afford to... it just prolongs what you have. although oil here isnt cheaper than gas per gallon, so it wouldnt do much good for me.

or:

By the way, I'm interested to know just exactly why you want to add 
oil to the gasoline.  What is this supposed to accomplish?
