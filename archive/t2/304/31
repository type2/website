Subject: 1st year sunroof

can any one tell what was the first year for factory sunroof editions, 'cuz
i hardly rarely ever maybe never heard of a 68 or 69. and last week i saw
that a pilot was selling sunroof cables on that dasterly son of the devil
auction site for 70 thru 90 buses. could 70 be the first year on that?    -
