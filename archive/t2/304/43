Subject: Re: [T2] Timing marks on crank gear

Timing marks move when you split the case
without first removing pistons.
You didn't save any time there, either.
Maybe you haven't given the books a fair chance to help.
How many cam bearings fell from their original locations?
Any main bearing locarting pins missing too?
Previous photos don't show the dizzy drive thrust washer.
Post a photo of all the extra  parts when you finish !
