Subject: Ignition power usage

Does anyone know how much power is used by the coil, chokes, and solenoids
powered by the ignition wire on a '77 2L bus (dual carb)?
I see in the archives others have brought this up, but didn't find any
values.
I'm setting up a relay to power them directly from the battery as I have a
number of other things I want to run from that cable. I will add a fuse into
this cable but I don't know the power draw from the standard coil, chokes and
carby solenoids.
Thanks,
Richard.
