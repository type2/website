Subject: 1978 Bus- slipping out of gear/stalling after mile or two

hi volks!
It has been a long time since i have had to post to the list. A bunch of you 
helped me get my bus up and running three years ago, and I have managed-- 
with help-- to keep it going.

Here's the "buuuuuut..." part   ;O)

My 2.0 '78 pancake engine was replaced by Pacific West Imports (Portland, 
OR) this past summer. After a couple of visits back, a couple of tweaks, 
etc., it was running very well. I spent most of Aug->October traveling 
around the Pacific NW (when not at work) with no problems at all. I guess 
you can say I was due for one of my quad-yearly "issues."

Early Symptom: When driving along for a few minutes, or sometimes just after 
warming up for a little bit, I would be driving along, and the bus would 
"jump" or chug as if it was having trouble getting gas, or running out of 
gas. Strange, I thought. This went on *intermittently* for weeks. I had 
begun to think I might need to replace the (1) fuel filter or (2) the fuel 
pump. Heck, I still might need to!

Then: One day I am heading home from band practice. I am headed on Hwy. 26 
in Beaverton, coming down into the city. I am traveling at roughly 50mph in 
4th gear, when suddenly I slip out of gear, although the shifter stays put 
and hadn't popped out. Then the bus stalls out! I coast down the highway, 
into the tunnel into the city, and manage to restart the bus, and get it 
home, carefully going through red lights for a mile or two. 4th gear wasn't 
working; I used 1st`-3rd, and was forced to keep revving the engine to avoid 
a stall.

So I immediately am bummed and think the clutch is shot now. I park it at 
home, and leave it be for a week or so. Then I decide to start it up. It 
starts right up,and idles just fine. I engage 1st gear, make it about 
30feet, and 1st gear goes out. I back up back down the driveway, and park 
it. Argh.

3 weeks later, I try again, thinking that if it was going to magically heal 
itself, that would be a sufficient amount of time <g>. It fires right up, 
idles well, so I decide to take someone's advice and slightly adjust the 
clutch cable a couple of twists. I get in and, it drives! All 4 gears where 
working, and no chuggs. I make it a mile, pick up abuddy, then continue to 
the store, when I am idling in the parking lot and it stalls out again.

I then restart itand start retreating back to my buddy's house, and it 
starts to jump again-- that chugging part I told you about above.

I have let it sit now and really want to get it taken care of. Anyone have 
any ideas? Are all these problems related? Think it might be the 
transmission? I thought a new clutch was installed with my new engine...I 
guess I cannot explain how a gear would go out, then after sitting a bit, it 
would work fine, mechanically.

Well, I am stumped, so ANY help would be appreciated! Thanks all; happy new 
year.

Best,
Pete
