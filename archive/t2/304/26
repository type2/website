Subject: New Sliding door screen

Hey all--I just discovered something I totally forgot I had--

I had a custom made screen for my sliding door made for my 74 Westy--and
have decided that I am not going to use it--
It has a brown naugahyde border---with the snaps mounted in it--
 
This is a brand new set up and never used.

I paid $125.00 fo it--you want it--$100.00 plus shipping.

A good deal at twice the price--:>)

Thanks,

            ______________
