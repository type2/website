Was the EGR system blocked at the valve output prior to hooking the filter 
back in?

If so does the vac go to a high value (~15in.Hg.) with the block back in 
place? (I have made the case that 15 in. Hg. is normal in an earlier post.)

The way the EGR was checked on a smog test was by pushing the valve open 
(moving the coupling rod by finger)with the engine at idle. If the idle rpm 
drops the EGR was deemed to be working since this a sign exhaust is being 
introduced into the air manifold via the valve.

When I took it to another shop for retest the EGR was ignored.

The valve has a rubber bladder/seal that fails over time and lets air in 
when the valve is opened. The seal will rupture under shop air pressure in 
case you try to blow air to "clean" it out. Exhaust pressure is less than 5 
psi.

At idle the valve should shut off exhaust flow (or air for that matter). At 
full throttle the EGR valve also cuts off flow. Crud collects in the valve 
and it can stick open. It can be disassembled and cleaned. I had to buy a 
rebuilt one ($200).

I hope this helps.
