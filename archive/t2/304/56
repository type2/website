Subject: Late type 4 bus engine tin needed!

Either from a 72-74 or a 79 -83.5

I have 2 vans I am working on that both are missing some tin.........I need
the piece on the right (passenger) side that you remove to access the
thermostat, more or less protects the pushrods....

Also need from an air-cooled vanagon, the left hand solid piece that often
is butchered for the dealer installed a/c.

I expect to pay a reasonable price, or a possible trade could be worked out!
