Subject: Re: [T2] Wanted source for solid rod bushing

Hi Scott:

No I am having a local shop do the rods. Experienced with all sorts of engines,
but very little VW work. The problem of living in the boonies.

I had thought about sending mine to be done, but I don't want to exchange the
rods, as my stock rods are closely matched in weight and in length. Plus the
shop estimates $40 for the job which is less than the cost of reconditioned rods
plus shipping. However if I could get solid bushings then it might be worth it.
I am suspicious of the seamed versions.

Look carefully at the top left one and you will see that they have a seam.

Thanks for the info. That is what I thought, but i did find a German page that
advertised bushing and showed them with holes.
