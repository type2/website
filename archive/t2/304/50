Subject: Automatic trans for sale

I just finished swapping out my automatic trans from my 73 and putting 
in a 4spd.
I would like to sell the automatic to someone who likes to drive their 
bus but wants the ease of an automatic.  This gave me trouble free 
operation for the 10,000 miles since I got the bus.  It was not hard 
and I could give you plenty of tips.
I have the axles, flex plate and linkage and all you'll need to make it 
an easy conversion.

Please respond if your are interested.
