 Same reason an M-16 has the distinctive sound it does.
 To scare the bejesus out of any person in range...
 Tolerances have been lost, and the bearing is disintegrating.
 Mak a brrrumm-brrrumm sound with your lips. Is that the
 sound of a good-running engine ?!
 OK, then-
 rod knock comes from engine condition, improper maintenance
 schedules, and improper driving conditions. Dirty oil feeds the
 old bearings with grit, and loss of oil pressure combined with
 a lead foot will do the rest. Do not exceed the engine's capabilities.
 Use this as an opportunity to explore the inner circle of
 engine building, and do some male bonding w/yer dad.
 Nobody's blame here, just the inevitable facts of vw life.

  Don't continue to run the engine.
 Drain the oil into a clean white pail and remove the screen.
 Go mining for metal.( flakes like gold are just cheap bronze
 from the dizzy drive gear, but those silver ones are the
 $tuff you are looking for. These are bearings. They are
 not magnetic, unless you get to their core, and steel is
 the wor$t part of a bearing. Don't find any and you're good to go.
 But look real hard, they are now small shiny flakey fragments.
 Hey, it could just be a valve adjustment....
