Well, if *you* don't know that it's been ruined in some way, why replace it?
I found no '73 VW bus specific wiring harness on the "painless" site.
What makes you think doing this will be more painless than fixing

If you're desperate to replace something on this bus, why not start
with the fuel lines, all fluids, and the brake system?
