Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Everybus

guess it's my turn to file an Everybus report

I rarely get to go to any of the get togethers out of town because of
working on Sunday mornings..took off this weekend but still didn't really
get my bus ready, thursday got a quick oil & filter change, loaded up the
dirty bus,,
  Early Friday Morning finished throwing the last things in and got on the
road only 15minutes later than I planned (for me that is
amazing) mapquests says it's 330 miles ahead of me, the "trashwagen" is
running strong, quick stop at Dunkin Dounuts for some driver fuel and
start picking em up and putting em down....stopped once for fuel near
Richmond VA and off again, was cold and drizzling when I left Baltimore,
had shirt, sweatshirt and skicoat on, shed the skicoat in Richmond,
sweatshirt near NC/Va line...rolling thru the pine forests of I-85 I
notice engine is getting warm, near 240!  slow down some and temps come
down, finish trip at 58mph, coming into The park I still haven't seen
another bus wonder if I am in the right place and then See Chris's Yellow
everybus signs...whipped into the site and there are dozens of other
buses, grab one of the last sites with power back in and throw my tarp
oover the bus and crash!  

 Sign in and start meeting all the people that up until then were only
sigs on an e-mail...dinner was a tuna sandwich, then crash into the back
of the van...not a Westy so sleeping on an airmattress and sleeping bag,
hour later I'm back up, air mattress has a slow leak!  not much sleep,
amazing how loud a VW clock is when you can't sleep.  Had put my world
famous chili on to slo cook before going to bed, smells so good I wonder
if any will make it to tommorrow evening

 Saturday dawned gray and drizzly, wandered over to the Tenn Mechanized
and bummed a cup of coffee and sat and talked was fed breakfast,  later
Uncle dave and wife come by and help me find the leak in the air mattress.
  Success will sleep tonight!
  grabbed my prepaid Tshirt before it is sold to someone else

sun comes out day is beautiful

 met more great folks picked up a couple parts for my bus,  while the
folks were chosing the van contest winners or losers someone looks at my
van and exclaims "your floor has rusted out" I am mortally hurt ;8*}  had
to explain "it was made that way" it is an HPBus (Bilrica Mass) low floor
conversion done only on 75-79 auto tranny busses, only one I know still
in operating condition.

 still ogling the other buses, can't decide each is better than the last
one, the double cab Vanagon is awesome...finish up my chili and then see
the competition.....don't have a chance...but ate more different kinds of
chili than I thought possible...didn't even have room for that neat
bus cake.  
  prizes are awarded and my chili takes second,,,my head swells, didn't
win any door prizes but go to bed with a smile,   

  get some real sleep air mattress stays up, Sunday start packing, saying
goodbyes and hitting the road.  the Trashwagen runs smooth and strong and
cool all the way back to Maryland.  temp never goes over 225, ????? 

 Stop in Brandywine and drop seats off for Barry, feel like the pony
express relaying seats to DC....get home still haven't stopped talking
about Everybus....CHRIS it was Great...glad you wrote the riot act wasn't
going to come until I saw it, can't say enough about it, only complaint
about it is the 350 miles away it is....but worth the trip.

 Still the iconoclast I can't post my photos until I get the slides back
from the processor and scan em, (anyone have space to let me post em??)

thanks again to all the folks that worked their butts off to put this on
everyear...I have done things like this and the work is mind boggling,
again thanks again to all the crew
