Subject: Webcam #107i for sale with lifters

First $60 and shipping gets it and matched lifters.  Iused it about 5k
miles........I pulled the lifters and have marked them for each cylinder, so
no worries........basically it is a new broken in cam.

I swapped my motor to mechanical lifters, and may as well pass this on to
someone else.  I do paypal and can ship same day payment is received,
priority mail.

Here is the info from the webcam site...3rd one down.   Look at the grind
