going to be nearly enough to keep the batteries charged while you drive.  An 
electric bus will draw 30-40,000 watts or more during acceleration and maybe 
10,000 watts while cruising.  I guess a small generator could improve the 
range somewhat but it isn't going to make the vehicle self-sustaining.


No but maybe you could recharge the batteries. For a commuter vehicle this
really doesnt seem that half-baked. maybe you could have the generator on
a timer to cut it off automatically. >>

While I have nothing against electric vehicles, this "hybrid" seems to offer
not much in the way of economy...Using gas to produce electricity with a
generator is the same thing the bus engine does anyway. The Honda (or
whatever) is only a small engine running a small alternator. The electrical
"mileage return" from this two step process is probably a lot less than the
actual gas mileage the VWde engine alone would get. I also can't see any
decrease in pollution, since it still uses a gas engine (with few controls)
to produce power. I'm sure there's an electrical engineer on the list who
could work out the formula for the generator output...But having worked
with a few generators on construction sites with no electric service, I'm
sure the efficiency is pretty low...Electrics work best when plugged into
the grid, at least one hopes the central power plant is more efficient and
cleaner than a local gas generator...
