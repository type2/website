What the heck is a farfignugan?  :-)  Since VW only came up with that neologism (Deutsch for something like "pleasurable driving experience") long 
after they abandoned our vehicles, I'd stay away from fahrvergnugen unless referring to waterpumpers.  What you have is an actual Volkswagen.

>Even though everyone that sees me working on it thinks I'm a tree hugging hippie... I still think this car is totally cool. 

See, you're missing the point.  That's *why* it's totally cool!
