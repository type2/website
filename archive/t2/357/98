This can be a religious discussion - but the general attitude is that oil temp
is the most important. Head temp, especially if you get  both heads, can be
useful for preventive maintenance and closer monitoring of the engine
conditions.

Yep. The PO must have put in the VDA fuel guage. Parts can be had for the
factory gauge and it sounds like you might just have a ground problem.
Personally, I've never seen a bad fuel gauge in the dash (but I'm not that
experienced) whereas I've seen a few bad senders on the tank. To get to the
send, you essentially have to drop the engine and remove the tank. There is
another way - cut a hole in the bed of the bus just about the sending unit.
Worked great for me - but if you don't want to molest your bus that way,
taking he engine and tank out is the only way to go.

A tach is nice. You can get the VDO tach and an adapter to mount in the space
tot the right of the speedo (where the factory clock would go). Other than
that, oil temp, voltage and/or current, and oil pressure - in that order - are
relatively easy. I ran four wires from the engine compartment to the dash when
I installed my tach and oil temp. This way I can add oil pressure and
something else without the hard part.
