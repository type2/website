Subject: Re:Electric or Propane conversions

Hi All,
    A couple of years ago, at Transporterfest, I met a fella who had
converted a Vanagon to electric.  With the entire floor of the main
cabin filled with batteries the useful range was only 35 miles.  That
doesn't seem too practical to me.
    The propane conversion has much more potential.  In 1980 I spent 6
months in Holland working for KLM airlines.  For use on and around the
airport grounds they had quite a few baywindow buses running on
propane.  It seemed to work just fine, but I don't really know any of
the details on their set up.
