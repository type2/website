as far as rekeying the locks. If you are patient and just a little
mechanical you can do it yourself. save all the old locks for parts. In
the type2.com library there should be info that will get you going on the
locks also just ask questions. they are pretty simple. you wont need
blanks. just make all of the door locks match the same key that your new
handles have. If you dont want to do it yourself there are a couple
locksmiths on the list that do it.
