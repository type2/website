Cleaned up my hard drive last night and found some stragglers I thought I'd
share:

* Clogged EGR port on plenum from, you guessed it, simply using it

* Shot of fuel filler neck from inside the body (behind paint can lid). You
can still make out the anti-corrosion coating from when the body was dipped.
If you can't make it out, it's beside the rust. ;-)

* These are the all important grounds for the FI harness under the air
plenum. Pretty easy to see how they can corrode and cause you a ton of
grief.
