Is there anything I can do? I've worked on engines before.. mostly GM V6/60s
and small block chevies, so.. worst case scenario, I could assemble and
dissasemble it myself, having only to pay for the new parts and the machine
shop. But are they REALLY that unreliable?

	Actually, like I was telling that other guy, the car is in REALLY
good condition. I saw the car 6 years ago before it had any of the paint
work done to it.. and the only place where it was rusted was in the middle
on the drivers side roof gutter. The underside of the bus is original, not
rubber coated or anything, and is completely rust free.

	I think you're right. Thanks for the advice. Where can I get GL4 oil
by the way?
I'd like to try to pick some up before this weekend. I'd like to try to get
it running sometime then.
