I'd not worry about it.  Make sure as much oil is drained out as possible, 
and that
the outer surface of the engine is as clean as possible.  The technique only
involves lightly heating areas of the case with the torch--not bringing it 
up to high
temperature.  Keep that fire extinguisher handy though................

Do you know anyone that works for a company that does non-destructive
testing of aircraft?.............thought not.  Best get the torch out.

That said, personally, I doubt a crack on the *top* of the case would cause 
much
of an oil leak.  I'd be more likely to suspect a connection leak where the 
generator
pedestal mounts to the case, or the oil filler mounts to the generator 
pedestal.
I had these problems, until I started using red RTV on the gaskets in these 
areas.
