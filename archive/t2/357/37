Rekeying isn't all that much of a trick.  All you have to do is remove the
cylinders and swap the wafers around to match the key you have.  Work on a
clean smooth surface (you don't want to find those little springs in shag
carpet!) and keep a key in the lock while disassembling to keep the wafers
in place
