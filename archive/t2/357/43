Subject: RE: [T2] Cold-hot idle mystery

hi,

when cold, the valve is open.  i took it out an looked at it and the opening
in a slot in a plate.  the plate moves to close the valve when hot?  even
when cold, the valve is not open to a round hole, only to the slit in the
plate.  should this be totally open so you can see a round hole?
