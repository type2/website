when I have a screwy electrical problem I take and wire an ampmeter into
the circuit I'm having trouble with, usually taking the fuse out and
wiring the ampmeter accross the fuse location, and then putting the
ampmeter in front of my face in the center of the dashboard.

carefull with the power, an inline fuse can be usefull
