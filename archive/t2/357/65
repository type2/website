Subject: `77 locking gas cap

I'm ready to order that new-style locking gas cap (with the "normal" looking
keys).  Any suggestions as to whom to send my money to, i.e. who still has
them in stock/best price, etc.?  Preferably someone on the east coast,
simply to keep shipping and time delay down.  I'd like to get the money on
it's way on Wednesday (9th).

Ron?  Got cap?

Thanks!

(BTW, Ron, you're located within an hours drive of my folks place near
Philly.  If we move up there, you'll be seeing more of us. [grin])
