Subject: Out of Gas!

Hi Folks,

I ran out of gas on my way to work today.  Fortunately, I was only 3/4 mile 
from work, so I walked the rest of the way.  The frustrating part is, I ran 
out of gas on the other side of a hill from a gas station!

I remember something about the FI system causing trouble if it's run 
completely dry.  Is this just my overactive imagination, or is there 
anything I should worry about when I finally get back to my Bus and try to 
get it started again?  I imagine it'll be a little sluggish starting, but 
I'm hoping I can just fill it and go.

Thanks in advance for any advice or suggestions...
