Kind Bus Peoples,

Where can I input a part number and be presented with a description of the
part?

I've honestly tried the archives, and looked through the fiches, and cannot
find this part.  It's probably not an important part, but it would be nice
to know what it is before I pull it out and toss it in the parts pile.

If my series of desperate inquiries on this topic were irritating, I
sincerely apologize.
