Oh well... that kinda sucks. Either way it shouldn't be too bad. I've
assembled motors myself in the past, and I have a really good machine shop
that I know about nearby as well. They're slow.. but they always get the job
done right.


As for the body... it's actually in SUBSTANTIALLY good condition. I am VERY
impressed with the condition of the body. I knew the guy before I bought the
car. He was a friend of a friend.. and I had seen his Volkswagen Bus for a
while now. He's had it for almost 6 years... but never had it running. The
rust that he had before that was repaired.. was all mostly in the gutter in
the middle drivers side. There's a little rust hole in the cargo area where
it looks like someone pierced the floor with a large screw driver or
something. The support beams and frame underneath look VERY good. There's no
rust on them at all. And the front floor boards and the front valence are
also very good.

I got a whole stack of books with the car.. one of which was called VW
BUSSES Customization, Repair, Restoration, Buyer's Guide.. or something like
that. It has a big grey and cream colored "splittie" hehe I guess on the
front. I'm still learning the terms.. but these books provide a lot of
information. I hastily threw away the "Sport Compact" magazines though.. :)

Yeah, you're right. A lot of other people have told me that too.. it makes
sense though! Unfortunately, I do not have the glass that I need.. and down
here in South Florida... I have only seen ONE Volkswagen Bus down here...
and that was before I had any idea that I'd be buying one (looked fairly
complete too!).  For the mean time, I ordered the rear window gasket so I
could at least put that other rear window in.

When you say re-keyed... where would I get them rekeyed? Would I need to
take them to a lock smith? I didn't realize you could do this. Since this
e-mail, I went ahead and ordered a set of matching drivers side and
passenger side front door handles with the matching locks. I'd like to get a
set of blanks (they also sell them) and then have the rear hatch and the
sliding (commando door) door re-keyed.

Yeah... the thing is, the ones I have now are all rusty. I figured a set of
new ones would at least make the Bus look much nicer. I don't want it to
look like it's spent the past 30 years out in the woods with some hippies.

r 1/2 1/1   is the gas gauge
I think you should start by going through all of the wiring.
you can find a diagram at www.vintagebus.com
