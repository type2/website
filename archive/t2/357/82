Subject: BUS "Gutters"

Hey guys,

	Quick question... I'm trying to think of a way to protect the rain
gutters on the Bus (I guess that's what they're called.. rain gutters).
Right now they're for the most part, perfect.. with new paint on them. But I
wanted to make sure that they don't start to rust out. Is there anything
that I can do? Should I put any kind of sealant, silicon gel? Anything?


Thanks,
