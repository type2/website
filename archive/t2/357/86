Subject: Converting 71 Deluxe Sunroof to Ragtop

I have a 1971 Deluxe that originally came with a sunroof. When I
purchased the bus one of the PO had removed the sunroof and attached a
large piece of sheet metal over the hole on top of the roof. This was
done with not a lot of love or attention to detail other then to make
sure it didn't poor rain down the middle of the bus. The bus other then
the metal sheet on top with some screw heads sticking out looks really
great and was a extreme steal as the engine was working and didn't need
much work to get it purring again. But I want to get this bus fixed up
and turn it into my daily driver. As I live in the desert and
occasionally go to California I want to convert the sunroof area into a
ragtop. I was wondering if there are some good kits or is there a
poor-mans way to do it. Also, is there a way to hide the slot that the
sunroof retracted into. I see a lot of other busses with the sunroof and
they all have that slot, but the headliner is made of a more one piece
vinyl that continues down the door jams and around the windows including
the sliding door. I would love to talk to someone who has ran across
this problem.thanks
