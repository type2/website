one problem you might have however is when you drive,  the early 003
automatic transmission (73-75) had a vacuum modulator for shifting, on
drivers side of transmission (left hand drive) it is near the bottom pan
and a tube runs to the "Carb" for vacuum the Fuel injection doesn't have
the port for the vacuum line, not sure where to put one either, although I
would probably put it in the air distribution box and adjust the tranny to
spec  see section 4 in auto tranny chapter of the Bentley manual for
details
