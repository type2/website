Subject: Strange electrical gremlin / Everybus

A funny thing happened on the way back from Everybus. When the carabus hit
Boone NC, we hit some rain. When I started the wipers, the gas gauge started
"wiping" as well. Teddy thought it was funny, "We need gas, no we don't, we
need gas, no we don't, ..etc. It actually moved in unison with the wipers. I
have had problems with my wiper switch so I suppose it is there. Has anyone
seen this before?

EveryBus was great! Thanks Chris!
I carabused with the TN Mechanized division on the Full Moon Bus Club. We
arrived Thursday just after noon, and spent the weekend relaxing and
socializing. It was very nice. We won the coveted best campsite award thanks
to our competition from Canada voting for us!

My engine is running cooler since the addition of the stock vacuum only
dizzy (thanks mad uncle dave), but have no power on hills. I spent a long
stretch in second gear coming up the mountain, and got temps a little over
250, but that was the only time I was nervous. I need to check the timing
again.
