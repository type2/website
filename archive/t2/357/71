I'm sure someone has tried it.  Know that a "small Honda generator" isn't going to be nearly enough to keep the batteries charged while you drive.  An electric bus will draw 30-40,000 watts or more during acceleration and maybe 10,000 watts while cruising.  I guess a small generator could improve the range somewhat but it isn't going to make the vehicle self-sustaining.
