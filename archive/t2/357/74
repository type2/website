An electric bus will draw 30-40,000 watts or more during acceleration and maybe 10,000 watts while cruising.  I guess a small generator could improve the range somewhat but it isn't going to make the vehicle self-sustaining.


No but maybe you could recharge the batteries. For a commuter vehicle this
really doesnt seem that half-baked. maybe you could have the generator on
a timer to cut it off automatically.
