Subject: Transmission Oil Seal

Hi all.

I sent a note to the list about a week ago asking for help in removing this 
seal.  Most notes in reply commented about what a PITA removing this seal 
is.

One list member named Rick was nice enough to take the time to write and 
tell me to remove the bell housing and push the seal out from the other 
side.  I was afraid to do this, since I'm transmission-ignorant and afraid 
to mess up something that's working well.

I talked to an old mechanic, who told me to go down to my FLAPS and get "an 
old brake tool".  I went by my FLAPS and got what they call a brake spoon.  
It has offsets on each edge you can use for prying.

When I first started prying with the brake spoon, there was so little room 
for prying the seal.  When I was able to pry, the metal in the seal was 
pushed outward toward the sealing edge of the transmission.

I got frustrated, then realized that if I pried enough metal toward the 
outside of the sealing area, then I could fit that brake spoon in and 
actually pry the seal out.

I've suffered several scratches on the outside of my hands from the edge of 
the bell housing, but I have successfully removed the transmission oil 
seal!!!  I'm very excited, as this was the last step before engine 
installation is ready to begin.

If you'd like a pic of my brake spoon, pmail me and I'll get one to you.

Thanks for the help,
