Subject: Re: [T2] Painless Wiring??

I just redid the main wiring harness in my 71 Single cab with a replacement
from Wiring works in Cali.  It was nice (correct colors and all) but I was
really hoping for more. The rest of my wires are toasted also..

Trying to track down why my gen light stays on now!!!  Short somewhere...
:(  Starting to replace all the wires one by one....

Hope this helps..

Peace,
Snoopy
