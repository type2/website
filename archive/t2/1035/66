 **** Help for Majordomo(-at-)ns1.crestcommunication.com:
 
 
 This help message is being sent to you from the
 Majordomo mailing list
 management system at
 Majordomo(-at-)ns1.crestcommunication.com.
 
 This is version 1.94.4 of Majordomo.
 
 If you're familiar with mail servers, an advanced
 user's summary of
 Majordomo's commands appears at the end of this
 message.
 
 Majordomo is an automated system which allows users
 to subscribe
 and unsubscribe to mailing lists, and to retrieve
 files from list
 archives.
 
 You can interact with the Majordomo software by
 sending it commands
 in the body of mail messages addressed to
 "Majordomo(-at-)ns1.crestcommunication.com".
 Please do not put your commands on the subject line;
 Majordomo does
 not process commands in the subject line.
 
 You may put multiple Majordomo commands in the same
 mail message.
 Put each command on a line by itself.
 
 If you use a "signature block" at the end of your
 mail, Majordomo may
 mistakenly believe each line of your message is a
 command; you will
 then receive spurious error messages.  To keep this
 from happening,
 either put a line starting with a hyphen ("-")
 before your signature,
 or put a line with just the word
 
 	end
 
 on it in the same place.  This will stop the
 Majordomo software from
 processing your signature as bad commands.
 
 Here are some of the things you can do using
 Majordomo:
 
 I.	FINDING OUT WHICH LISTS ARE ON THIS SYSTEM
 
 To get a list of publicly-available mailing lists on
 this system, put the
 following line in the body of your mail message to
 Majordomo(-at-)ns1.crestcommunication.com:
 
 	lists
 
 Each line will contain the name of a mailing list
 and a brief description
 of the list.
 
 To get more information about a particular list, use
 the "info" command,
 supplying the name of the list.  For example, if the
 name of the list 
 about which you wish information is "demo-list", you
 would put the line
 
 	info demo-list
 
 in the body of the mail message.
 
 II.	SUBSCRIBING TO A LIST
