Subject: Alternate Power Plants (was RE: [T2] ADMIN: Kill This Thread

Michael (and Volks),

No apology necessary, and I should probably clarify.

I think that alternative power plants can and should be discussed 
on the list, like the talk of natural gas conversions and fuel tanks, the
trials and tribulations of putting a diesel engine into your bus, etc.

However, I think discussing how to gasify wood (coffee grounds, or
whatever) or, for example, how to make biodiesel (completely doable
as a DIY project) are beyond the scope of the list.  There are
ample resources out there on how to do these things, but they go
beyond the "converting your VW to use a different power plant" in
my mind.

Hence Robt Mann's post was still On-Topic (mostly) because it talked about 
a specific conversion option that had work on a bus-like application, 
describing how it could work on a bus, etc.

Does that make sense?

And Tony talking about the Tesla electric car is just off topic because 
it did not talk about viable bus conversions or anything of the sort, 
just an existing, new, electric car.  The fact that the last gasifier 
post did not have any specific bus powerplant conversion info and that 
the emergence of the electric car thread (which I know from experience 
means the whole thread was about to veer widely off-topic), was why I 
killed the thread.

Cheers,
     Tom
