In addition to the switch, while you've got things apart take a look  
at the tang on the end of the lock cylinder that operates the switch  
(contacts).  It wears over time, sometimes to the point where they  
won't reliably turn the switch to the "start" position.

Had it happen a couple years ago; though the switch was shot because  
it wouldn't always crank.  I got a near-new electrical switch from a  
Golf at the wrecking yard, took everything apart in the parking lot  
and discovered the worn tang.  I went back into the yard, got the  
lock cylinder from the same car, swapped the tang from that one onto  
my original lock (it's held on with a screw), put it back together  
and it's been working beautifully every since.
