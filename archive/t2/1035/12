Is shown in the pictures I have posted, the "T" is fixed for now. I guess I
should also follow the lines on either side as they head up to the vents and
see how they are.

I am curious though... if I smell gas because the line is broken inside the
engine compartment, why wouldn't I smell gas as it was coming out of the
vents? Same difference right?
