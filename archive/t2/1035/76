Subject: Type 2 Gasifiers

I know I have seen brief discussions about Gasifiers several years ago on the
list but was wondering if anyone know of any recent implementations and could
anyone give any helpful implementation suggestions?

For those who haven't heard of gasifers before, what I am talking about is
what has been done in some specialized areas recently but was done to a large
extent, especially to German vehicles during World War II, where the gas
produced from controlled burning of hydrocarbons such as wood, coal, etc... is
used as fuel for vehicle.

With gasoline prices appearing to increase with no end in sight and ethanol
not being really viable for us VW users (seems like it isn't really cost
effective anyway) these alternative fuel options might be worth exploring for
us individuals who want to keep our old VWs on the road.

Heck, if things keep going the way they are, converting my VWs to electrical
is becoming a more and more attractive option.

Thanks,
