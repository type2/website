Hi,it is fuel injected, I put four brand new fuel injectors into it when I put
the new engine in it, when I had the plugs out they looked like they were are
firing the same (nice light tan on the electrodes and they still looked like
new) although now that I think of it I heard of a sparkplugs crapping out
under higher rpms.
I'll go outside now and try unplugging the injecters one at a time and monday
I'll get new plug wires, cap, rotor, and plugs. Can't hurt to replace all that
anyways.
What and where is the 'resistor pack'?
How do I know if the plug wire end is good?

  A cylinder that does not change means you lost either spark or fuel.

  To loose spark, I would look at the plug wire end. It is a built-in
resister.

  To loose fuel, I would look at either a dead injector or a bad resister
pack.
