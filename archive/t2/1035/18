Jeremiah,
 
I think Anthony and George nailed it - you have a loose or probably broken  
dimmer circuit wire in the stalk.  The wire is stranded, and has an extra  
layer of insulation or sleeve applied over the regular wire insulation.  
 
On the switches I have repaired, the wires run in a groove along the back  
side of the stalk at the pivot or hinge location, which is good because  that 
gives you access for repairs. The purpose of the sleeve is to distribute  the 
bending of the wire that must occur every time you move the stalk, which was  
good design on VW's part.  
 
However, no matter how well designed or well made, nothing lasts forever,  
and eventially, the insulation gets hard and cracks, and the strands in the wire 
 begin to break.  When that last strand finally goes, you often have a  
situation where, with the stalk in certain position(s), a strand or two will  
"reconnect" and your dimmer switch works again, for a while, until the broken  
strands pull apart again.
 
I have fixed these myself.  It takes time and patience, and some deft  work 
with a low wattage, fine tipped soldering iron - the kind you would use for  
working on printed circuit boards.  You can (or used to be able to) buy  these 
and the necessary fine gauge rosin core solder, at Radio Snack.  I do  alot of 
this kind of work and use a Weller WP25 iron, like this:

Before you start soldering, trim the damaged insulation off the ends of the  
broken wires (use a SHARP X-Acto knife), determine if you will need to splice 
in  a new piece of wire if too much of the original wire is gone, and put a  
piece of heat shrink tubing over the end of one broken wire, to be used to  
re-insulate the repaired wire.  Dress the ends of the stranded wire, apply  heat 
and a small amount of solder to "tin" the ends of the wire.  Carefully  align 
and solder the new piece of wire in if needed and allow to cool.   Push the 
heat shrink over the bare, repaired section.  If you have an  ohmmeter, test for 
shorts between each of the wires and between each wire and  ground (ground 
being the switch housing).  If you don't have an ohmmeter,  install the switch 
and test for proper operation.
 
Good luck, and be patient.  The reward will be a reliable dimmer  system.
 
Rusty
