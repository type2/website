Subject: Free air-cooled parts available

I came into possession of a 71 Type 2, and a wooden crate of air-cooled 
VW engine parts, on the passing of my father-in-law about 10 years ago, 
I drove the bus daily  for perhaps 3 years, as well as changing the oil, 
adjusting the valves and doing other minor maintenance jobs according to 
info garnered on this list. The condition of the body, deplorable when I 
first obtained the vehicle, became so poor that I traded it for a 
bicycle, but the bike shop owner didn't want the crate of parts. Now the 
time has come to clear some space in the garage. Here's what I have;

1cylinder head with valve cover
1 intake manifold with Solex 34 Pict 3 carburetor
1 cooling fan assembly
1 crankshaft
1 camshaft
1 starter motor with solenoid
2 distributors
3 or 4 plastic containers holding sundry small parts such as push rods 
and tubes, valves and valve springs and so on

I really don't know anything else about the parts, such as 
serviceability or suitability for a particular engine. Free to a good 
home. Parts come in a handy  (but handle-less)  wooden crate. Available 
for pick-up only in west-end Toronto until June 1, 2008.
