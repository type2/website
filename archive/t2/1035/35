Well crap.  I've got the engine all bolted up and will be starting it up
sometime in the next couple days.  I'll go ahead and order up a couple to
have though and will be prepared to have to install one sooner than later.

Thanks for the info.  This engine/transmission combo has been a fun
learning experience.
