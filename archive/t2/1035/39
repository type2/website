<d1ea44890804251007u21efd0d5i4857ae0b58365d4f(-at-)mail.gmail.com> I see that BD
has two different brands of rear brake cylinders available.Both seem to be
pretty good. One is $5 cheaper than the other (as it is onsale). Anyone got an
opinion of one verses the other?

made.....  http://www.busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=211611047FOR
