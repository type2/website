Subject: RE: Starting Problems

BTW, someone suggested the switch may be the problem...

I thought that too but when you turn the switch the lights (dash, radio,
etc...) do dim.  Does that mean anything?  I am assuming it means the switch
is sending power (especially since I hear the solenoid "click").  I haven't
checked how much voltage at the spade connector on the starter, however.

Thanks again,

Michael
