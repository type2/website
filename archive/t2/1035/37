Subject: Re: [T2] Tuning the AFM

Saw your query, Jason- "I messed with it" refers to just turning the 
idle mix screw on top or did you play with the coiled spring tension 
inside the box? The top screw is often turned (out?) to lean the idle 
mix for passing inspection.  The spring resists the air measuring flap 
that opens as air sucks in past it due to throttle position/air being 
pulled into cylinders. More open the flap, more gas is given by the 
"brain" interpreting the resistance of the slider position on the 
resistance track.  Decrease the spring tension and the flap will move 
farther, enriching the mix while running- typically what happens with 
age.  Wonder if anyone out there has strain gauged the slider to see its 
proper tension in a "reconditioned" AFM"? The black toothed wheel can be 
turned to tighten the spring and lean the mix.  An exhaust analyzer/O2 
sensor would be required.
    Thinking out loud here- I suppose a later AFM (7 pin) for a 2000 cc 
bus could be used on an early 1800 cc bus if you dremyl away the 7th pin 
(#27?) so the 6 pin plug would fit over it.

  know that my AFM is out of adjustment just because I have messed with it a
  few times. I just want to get it back to where it needs to be.
