I don't know if this was mentioned, but if the noise goes away when your 
at speed and press the clutch (and/or take it out of gear), the issue is 
not the CVs.

What you might try is rev the engine at idle and see if you get the 
vibration.  If not, drive it till you get the vibration and then just 
pull it out of gear (no clutch) and let the revs drop.  Then you might 
also try driving until you hear the noise and then pressing the clutch 
and letting the revs drop.

Having people in the car might just absorb the resonance, but not fix 
the problem... well, unless you don't mind toting the family around 
everywhere ;)
