Subject: RE: [T2] ADMIN: Kill This Thread (was Re: [T2] Type 2

I love this listserv and have received more help than I personally could every

desire to kill discussion for those interested in finding alternative means to
fuel their buses and other VWs.

I guess previous discussions such as...

...were also undesirable and off-topic.

My apologies.

Sorry,

Michael Martin
