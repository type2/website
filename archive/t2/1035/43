Kostal is ORIGINAL Equipment, same as what the dealer sells.  The best
period.

I've had some problems with the Meyle (made by Electrix, whoever they are),
primarily with intermittent contacts.  Its no fun having your ignition
failing at 75mph in traffic (whoops, that's right I'm on the Type 2 List
here, not Vanagon <grin>).

In addition to Bugs, Buses & Vanagons, it fits most inline watercooled
Audi/VW at least thru 1989, some into the 90s, even a few Porsche models.
The list is very long
