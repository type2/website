Subject: Re: [T2] re, '77 WESTY (vibration) (CVJoints)

When they wear, they seat at a particular relationship
of all the relative parts to each other. When the ride
height is changed and the CV joints are not replaced,
they are running in a different relationship of
relative pieces and in areas that are  not worn
compatible to each other. They are also quite probably
running where there is no lubricant. Normally I would
advise against swapping end-for-end, but since the
change has already been done, you may find there is a
difference in the vibration and that may lead you to
the solution.

I had a new set of CV joints that I installed a few
months prior to raising my bus (too much, btw!) and
the CV joints were ruined within the next 3 months.
The ramps were cracked and some of the balls were
actually crushed.

A few years later, I dug up those damaged CV joints
and bought all new balls at a bearing supply, then
re-assembled one working set, paying close attention
to not have them run "on power" in the direction that
would put stress on the cracked parts. I actually got
about six years out of that set and still have them in
my spare parts collection. -BaH
