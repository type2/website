   Unless you've got an alternative power source for the electricty to
   charge those batteries, you've just moved the cumbustion source
   further up the chain...I'd do some research as to the cost of elec-
   tricity vs. gas...An electric Bus could cost more to run than the
   gas Bus...
   BTW, if you're using lead acid batteries, how long will it take to 
   give them a full charge? And what kind of charger will you be using?
