Subject: Re: [T2] Replacing the torque converter/tranny seal

I agree with Mark, nearly new or not, this seal should ALWAYS be replaced.  It is less than $3 (or used to be) and routinely starts leaking and throwing ATF off the converter, particularly when you are in a location where there is true winter.  Will start leaking first think on a cold morning.  This is the same part for all late bus, vanagon, and is actually a T3 311 part number.
