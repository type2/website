I have been giving this a lot of thought lately.  I am collaborating 
with a friend on building an electric car and one of the top candidates 
is a bus, because of their excellent cargo capacity.  A passenger bus 
can swallow 1,200lbs of batteries without breaking a sweat.  Such a 
vehicle would not be a rocket and would not be designed to exceed 45mph 
but would be good for running errands around town and with the large 
battery capacity should have a reasonable range (perhaps 50 miles).  We 
have discussed some interesting possibilies such as having two smaller 
motors with one driving each rear wheel with a single gear ratio and 
enough voltage to achieve 50mph...probably 156v or maybe even 180v if 
the controller can handle it.  We would like to eliminate the transaxle 
to increase efficiency and save weight.  With enough voltage I think 
this might be possible.
