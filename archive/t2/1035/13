Ginny... there is an interesting way to lock an engine hatch,,, even if
there isn't a factory key button available..

you get a gate bolt... or window catch bolt .. what ever you call them..
mount it to the inside of the engine lid, so that it falls down to latch.
the engine hatch has an area that is double thick.. so rivets work, and
won't protude  outside
it will catch against the seal lip iirc... or you can drill a small hole in
the body.
you need to drill another tiny hole in the ceiling of the engine bay.. or
the floor of the rear cargo area.. just inside the rear cargo door
threshold.. and run a small wire up thru that hole,, that attaches to the
Bolt latch.

you lock the upper door.. no one can get to the wire...
when you open the upper door... you can lift the wire,, lifting the latch
bolt.. so you can open the engine bay door.

hope that helps
