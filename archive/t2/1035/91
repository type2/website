Somewhere out there are still a few baywindows converted by the TVA I
believe - 79 models, several dual sliders, and some still with the bateries,
motors, controllers, etc intact...I've seen one, and seen pics of
others...interestingly enough, they came with a gas tank for the gas
heaters...
:)
might be a good reference, or even a good start...
there's also the voltswagen conversion, but that may be for rabbits...
