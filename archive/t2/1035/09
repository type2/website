Torque Convertor seal, replace everytime engine is out. too easy to
damage taking engine out

NOTICE  it doesn't tell you anywhere but that seal should be flush
with the front of the housing it fits in. DO NOT PUSH IT ALL THE WAY
IN OR SEAT IT BELOW THE TOP OF THE LIP.  this is one of those things
they never tell you and will drive you to drink.

also be carefull putting the engine in to make sure the torque
cornvvertor seats all the way onto the shafts. one often hangs up and
if you force it, you will damage the torque convertor. it seats very
far into the bell housing.

it isn't hard but take it from someone who has made both mistakes it
is very easy to do.
