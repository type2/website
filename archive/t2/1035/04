I am  just about the put the torque converter back in the bell housing of
our  automatic transmission.  I noticed a seal in there though and  wanted
to be sure that it wasn't something that should be replaced every  time its
exposed or if I should be good to go and just leave it in.   This unit was
rebuilt about 2k miles ago.




hey Troy  Whats up with this. didn't they rebuild the torque convertor  while 
it was out?? I would wonder on the rest of the work if they skipped that  
part/  The torque seals are cheap and easy to do with everything out.   later
