As you can tell from the replies, it is hard to
describe a vibration to aid in online diagnoses! The
first place I would have looked is in the front pulley
area - the caged area where the cooling fan resides -
mine had a habit of sucking in the rags that I had a
habit of leaving nearby to wipe the oil dipstick when
checking oil. The pulley could also be loose.

Another thing to check, especially on a new install
is, when the vibration is felt, push the clutch in and
hold it for a bit and see if the vibration changes or
goes away. If a new pilot bearing was not installed,
the clutch disc could be misaligning. By releasing the
clutch, the vibration should go away or at least
lessen.

Here's probably the most common one: Firing order
wrong. Even the best mechanic at some time has crossed
the wires plugging them into the distributor cap.
Often there is backfiring and it is obvious. I have
not played with one of these for years and forget
which two usually get crossed and there are no obvious
indications except for a lack of power and a
vibration. The order is 1-4-3-2. #1 is RF (front of
bus) #2 is RR #3is LF (positioning of cylinders on
engine just in case you're unsure.) -BaH

  Hi, just wondering if any of you have any
 suggestions. My 2.0L engine was
 rebuilt a year ago and I just put it back  on the
 road again (boy is it nice
 to be driving it again!) but when it is under load
 at 2000 - 4000 RPM there is
 a very definate vibration in the engine like having
 a dead cylinder.
