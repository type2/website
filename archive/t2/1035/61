I would re-pack them with grease....grab in the middle
of the axle shaft and try to push pull back and
forth..(wheel to trans)...If you can do it easily
...they need to be re-packed....dry C.V.'s can make a
big vibration at a certain speed...also check that the
6 cv joint bolts are not backing off...I have seen
that one more than a few times....T
