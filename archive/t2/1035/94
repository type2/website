Subject: Starting Problems

OK...before I go on, I know this is a little off-list-topic since it is
directly about the 72 Beetle I drive every day, but the principles do apply to
Type 2s as well.  Also, I know the list, and the library, is full of people
who are frustrated with similar problems but no two problems seem to be
exactly the same.  Besides, I have been trying to find the solution to this
problem for weeks and I may be stranded here at work unless I do a "Little
Miss Sunshine" push-off in a few hours.

Here is the situation:
1. Turn ignition switch...click of solenoid but does not turn over.  This is
intermittent.  Sometimes would not happen for weeks.  Gradually got worse.
Then wouldn't start once or twice a day.  Now more persistent problem.

2. Thinking it was the solenoid on the starter, I replaced the starter with
another one I had on my bus (Type 2 reference)

3. Problem still exists but is intermittent.

4. Jumpered connection between battery connection on starter to spade
connector that goes to switch.  Solenoid engages and will typically start
afterwards.

5. Put battery on charge last night.

6. Got up this morning and wouldn't start at first but on next try did.

7. Got to work and upon turning off engine, tried again but would not start.

8. Got Voltage meter from work (can't find mine at home) and battery reads
12.6v.

9. Managed to keep trying and engine started and got 13.7v with engine at
idle.

Help.  This is driving me crazy.  Could it be the battery keeping marginal
voltage?  Do I have two starters with solenoid problems?  Arghhhhhh!

Thanks,

Michael
