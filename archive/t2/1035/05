I second that. Mine had the original felt on it when I bought it. I
see that they have recently become available, and ordered one from
CIP1 (waiting for it to come in). They also sell the cables which have
been unavailable for some time.

Keep in mind that this is not really a "seal" but rather just a method
of keeping out the big stuff that would clog the drains, and some
wind. The drains must be kept clear or water will find its way in.

As for the plastic parts, I've seen them at one of the online VW parts
vendors, but I can't find them now for the life of me. And I need one.
