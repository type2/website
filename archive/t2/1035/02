If the seller is unsure about the usability of their item, they should
put "AS-IS, no refunds" in their ad so the buyer knows the risk.
Otherwise the parts should be assumed to be in usable condition.  I
don't think that age should have much to do with this, particularly when
the part is advertised as being in new condition.  If you're going to sell
something as new and usable, then you should be able to stand behind it.

To do otherwise gives carte blanche to unscrupulous sellers and encourages
otherwise honest people to keep selling the defective parts to recoup
their losses.
