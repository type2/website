Subject: Re: Alternate Power Plants

I have a 78 passenger bus I've considered converting to something 
alternative. I have most of the parts for a low power electric from the 
spares for my electric tractor, just need the time and the money for 
engineering and batteries. Lead/acid batteries have jumped tremendously in 
price but are still cheaper then the alternatives and the bus chassis has 
the room and carrying capacity for them. It would be 36V system so I only 
need room for 6 6V batteries, but the range would be pretty limited.

I also heat with wood and gasification seems a decent alternative, the 
room is there in the back for the generator, except the 78 does not have 
an engine. Need that first. 
Google HOLZBRENNER for Volkswagens that used gasification during WW2 but 
for current information go to Mother Earth news as they have plenty of 
information.
