"As for the plastic parts, I've seen them at one of the online VW parts
vendors, but I can't find them now for the life of me. And I need one."


Thanks for the info - you know...  I bought a plastic cover for the gear box
made for a beetle from an online vendor despite the fact that they and
others told me it wouldn't fit.  It was about 20 bucks and I don't have any
other options, so I figured I'd give it a shot.  Well, after making the
screw holes a little bigger and cleaning up some of the casting marks I
found that it fits great.  The only difference I can see between the bus
peice and the beetle peice is that the bus part should have a slight curve
to it where the Beetle part is petty flat.  Once you get it screwed down
though it matches the contour of the roof line and the cables move freely
through it.  Once I get the seal on, I'll put the roof panel on, adjust it,
and let you all know what happens!

Thanks - Nick
