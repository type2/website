On this subject what ever happened to all those electric buses out of TN, GA, or KY or wherever from back when the list started, back when off topic posts were a frivolous fun daily adventure...   One of them sold on the "bay" a few months back, I didn't follow what it went for.  I recall at the time when they initially got sold off somebody from the list snagged 2-3 of them before I think a big west coaster grabbed the rest.  I actually thought it was David who grabbed one, but apparently not so.  There wasn't much weight to be saved by driving each wheel separately as they only had a bare housing with a diff, no tranny bits, just an empty housing though the axle shafts would be gone I guess.  Come to think of it for that matter an interesting idea might be to use the electic motor on the tranny side of an automatic tranny diff housing.  Would be easier to mount a good size flat face flanged motor to that surface (a cheesy to machine adapter plate would probably be all it
 would take or even less maybe just facing and drilling the diff housing)  I figure if it might fit and would give the entire engine bay for batteries as well to free up the load compartment at least somewhat.
   
  Just some thoughts anyway, and even on topic.
