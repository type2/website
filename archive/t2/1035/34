Subject: Re: [T2] head light relay

Sounds like there is a problem with one of the wires that feeds from the  
relay to the headlights.  Try wiggling one wire at a time to see if that  will 
identify which one is a fault - i.e., wiggle wire and lights go on and off  in 
response = bad wire and/or connection.  Besides the possibility of  having a 
connection problem, you may have a break at some point in the  middle of a wire.
 
Good luck!
