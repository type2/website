Subject: Re: [T2] head light relay

the dimmer/blinker switch is brand new.  i have traced all the wires
and all connections are good.  replaced several just to be sure.  the
dimmer relay then worked with no problem.  when i put the fuse box and
the wires all back in place i was back to sqaure one.  the dimmer
relay clicked but did not keep the brights on.  i am flumoxed.  guess
tomorrow or some time in the near future i will look and see if a wire
popped off a connector.  siiiiigggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhh.
