What about LP (propane)?

Someone on this list told me to look at the Mother Earth News article on
converting your bus to propane.
https://www.motherearthnews.com/Green-Transportation/1972-05-01/Convert-Your-
Car-To-Propane.aspx

I read the article last night and am VERY intrigued.  After I get my 71 Westy
fully running it may be a next step especially since the article describes how
to use it basically as a hybrid (gasoline and LP).  I know we are merely using
one type of gas for another but I want to use my bus for a long time and this
seems to be a good intermediate step.  I just wonder what the cost comparison
would be... gallon for gallon... mileage for mileage.

Anyone out there doing this successfully?  What has your experience been.

Thanks,

Michael
