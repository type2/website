   In mine own defense, what I meant but obviously did not convey, was
   the amount of technology that the Tesla used as well as the weight
   penalties that "just" converting a Bus to electric power might entail...
   Not to mention the cost of the 6,800 lithium ion batteries... ;-(

   If you go to Mother Earth News website and look up "converting to
   propane" there's an article with DIY directions to convert a Splittie
   (Bus content...?-) to propane power...And yes, there's a tank mounted
   to the rear of the roof, so I'm not advocating this particular conversion,
   just passin' the info on... ;-)
