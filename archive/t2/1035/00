Are both relays the exact same part number, including the last letter?
There were some minor internal changes over the years that might affect
the operation if you use the wrong relay.

You might also have a poor connection on the turn signal stalk.  It
provides the "switch" signal and if the signal isn't strong enough the
relay will click but not switch.
