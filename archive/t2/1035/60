Subject: CNG VW's?

With Gasoline headed for $4 (and much more if you believe in Peak Oil)
has anyone on this list done any research into CNG conversions.  I'm
told that Mexico had a conversion policy for Combi's.

I see that VAG is producing vehicles in Europe:

I would like to look into this for either one of my Type 2s, Caddies,
or Vanagons.  Any info would be healpful.  CNG sells for $.65 in Utah

Thanks in advance
