Subject: Replacing the torque converter/tranny seal

I am just about the put the torque converter back in the bell housing of
our automatic transmission.  I noticed a seal in there though and wanted
to be sure that it wasn't something that should be replaced every time its
exposed or if I should be good to go and just leave it in.  This unit was
rebuilt about 2k miles ago.
