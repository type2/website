We had a blast last year, so we're doing it again this year. The event 
will be Mother's Day weekend in beautiful Golden Gate Canyon State Park. 
That's in the mountains above Golden, Colorado. The State Park fees are 
$6 per day per vehicle and $18 per electric site. Last year there were a 
small handful of us. In addition to those pictured below we had a 
Squareback with us. We'll miss having Foster and his owner around this 
time.  This year we hope to have more in attendance. Come early. Come 
annually.

a couple of pics from last year.
