 Hi, just wondering if any of you have any suggestions. My 2.0L engine was
rebuilt a year ago and I just put it back  on the road again (boy is it nice
to be driving it again!) but when it is under load at 2000 - 4000 RPM there is
a very definate vibration in the engine like having a dead cylinder. I had the
hydraulic valves readjusted by a mechanic and did a compression test on it,
#1 - 110 psi
                                                   #2 - 120psi
                                                   #3 - 120psi
                                                   #4 - 120psi
 Could that one cyl. with 10psi lower than the rest cause this vibration? Any
other ideas?
Thanks, Bernie
