Hi Scott,

It was there in all its glory.

I'd say that Star Trek's Mr. Spock would sum that contraption up best: 
"Fascinating".

Jamie Rivers and Mark Dearing and the owner were pouring over it for 
well over an hour. There were quite a few technical hurdles represented 
by the project and as far as we could see, they had all been addressed 
to one degree or another. One thing for certain: that engine was 
extremely maintenance intensive.

I will have some pictures of it online as soon as I get time to upload 
them to facebook. (free hosting!!!)

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
