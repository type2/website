Subject: re, '77 WESTY (vibration)

Hi, thanks for all your ideas and suggestions. I now have some idea of where
to check and where to start looking.
Someone had metioned to check the cv joints... well before I actually started
driving it this year I had a mechanic raise the rear end back to specs and it
looks and handles way better now. But after someone mentioned the cv joints I
realized that their angle had changed now. So this could be a possibility too.
Although it really feels like the engine to me. Today I went for a drive with
the whole family in it and with the extra weight the vibrations seemed less. I
guess I'll check the cv joints.
Are the inner and outer cv joints the same? If I just turn each one
around(flip the whole axle)  and see what the difference is in the vibrations,
would that tell me if it's them?
Bernie
