Subject: Re: [T2] Had to change my underwear.

I had that happen on a bus I was towing with a dolly. it had me jack-knifed  
across three lanes in Charlotte, good thing it was at 2am. I have never towed  
with a dolly since.
 
I do a lot of tires a year and I make sure the valve stems get replaced by  
removing the old ones before sending the rims.  On drive ins make sure you  say 
it twice to the counter person.
