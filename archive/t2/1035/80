Subject: ADMIN: Kill This Thread (was Re: [T2] Type 2 Gasifiers)

Volks,

Gasifiers are not VWs and do not pertain to the operation of air-cooled
VWs.  We don't talk about oil refineries which produce the gasoline for
you VW either.

And certainly, ELECTRIC CARS that are not VW buses do not qualify as a
topical thread.

So: KILL THIS THREAD.  (Both on gasifiers and electric cars)

Thanks for your continued support in these matters.  :)

cheers,
     tom
