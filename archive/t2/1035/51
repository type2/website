<007d01c8a7c8$9563e9b0$21dc71d8(-at-)widescreen> Hi, just wondering if any of you
have any suggestions. My 2.0L engine wasrebuilt a year ago and I just put it
back on the road again (boy is it niceto be driving it again!) but when it is
under load at 2000 - 4000 RPM there isa very definate vibration in the engine
like having a dead cylinder. I had thehydraulic valves readjusted by a
mechanic and did a compression test on it,#1 - 110 psi#2 - 120 psi#3 - 120
psi#4 - 120 psiCould that one cyl. with 10psi lower than the rest cause this
vibration? Anyother ideas?Thanks, BernieFort Langley,BC

Is it still fuel injected?

10 psi is not going to be noticed.

You need spark, fuel, and compression.  You tested for one of the three.

Idling at a fast idle, unplug each injector to check for a drop in RPMs.

A cylinder that drops has spark and fuel.

A cylinder that does not change means you lost either spark or fuel.

To loose spark, I would look at the plug wire end. It is a built-in resister.

To loose fuel, I would look at either a dead injector or a bad resister pack.
