Subject: Re: [T2] Replacing the torque converter/tranny seal

Hey Mark.  Looking at the work log for the tranny rebuild, everything was
rebuilt.  I was just making sure that I shouldn't replace it while I had
the opportunity.  The seal was very pliable with no noticeable wear.  I
left it in there.

Peace, Troy
