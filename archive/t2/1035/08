You can return a 30 year old part to most parts houses if they are
selling  it as new.  Old stock does not matter.  I could have bought
this same part from three other parts vendors I know of and they would
have fixed the problem.  Not said "Tough Luck"   "Go take a flying
leap"

I would have agreed to paying the freight.  No problem.  But that
option was not offered.  Just don't bother me with your problems.  When
parts leave his hands he accepts no responsibility.  I just wish I had
asked a head of time what his after the sale conditions were.  My
mistake.  I learned my lesson.  Hope others, on this list and elsewhere
don't run into the same situation.  A few email messages ahead of this
type of transaction would be advisable.

By the way does anyone on this list know the ramifications of the UCC
in this matter.  This guy made me mad!  The next time I go to Portland
I intend to file a small claims court action.
