Bob was wanting to do a propane conversion. The biggest drawback was
the tank:  one large enough to give you a useable driving range. Problem was a
tank takes up too much area inside the bus. It defeated the usefulness of the
bus!  Sure, in the UK buses use propane..... but the country is small.
Unlike gasoline, propane is not sold on every street corner. It is a long
drive from Barstow Calif to Las Vegas......
