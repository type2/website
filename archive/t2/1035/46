Please correct me if I am wrong, and for that I humbly appologize...., but
when I was 'knee high to a grasshopper", I seem to remember that today was
'Arbor Day", where the sole purpose of the occasion was to plant a tree on
some place you owned, to remember some one from your past!  If it was...did
you?  I planted one in my yard for all the VWs I have owned, "killed", or
resurected.  Cheers
Syd
