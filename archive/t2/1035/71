Subject: De-greasing New Brake Shoes

I did a rear brake job this weekend and managed to get grease on the
surface of the new shoes.  Gads I hate drum brakes!  Anyway, I used
brake-cleaner to clean the grease as best I could, but am wondering if
that's enough.  Is there some better way to clean the shoes?  Have I
ruined them and should just get new ones?  Will the heat generated
during break-in burn off any remaining grease?  Any suggestions greatly
appreciated.
