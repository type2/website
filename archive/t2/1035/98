Subject: re starting problems

You changed the starter and the problem remained the same?

I've had some bad starters...a rebuilt one may make a big difference.

However, I worked through this problem on my bus and found...

Pull the wire off the spade terminal, and put a voltmeter on it. Have 
someone turn the key to start. Read the voltage being delivered to the 
starter. It should be 12 or more volts, which will energize the solenoid. On 
my bus, and many other buses, the wire was delivering about 6 volts!

The connections in between the ignition switch and the starter get oxidized 
and corroded and loose.

I ended up running a brand new wire from the ignition switch right back to 
the starter. I soldered it to the wire that came out of the switch.

Problem solved that day...then it came back. Turned out it was the rebuilt 
starter had died.

It's usually a combination of several things. But the low voltage being 
delivered  is a biggie and quite easy to check if you have a voltmeter.



Also, have you replaced the starter bushing? They get egg shaped and the 
starter gets unreliable. Rebuilt starters usually come with a new one, or, 
you can buy an SR17 starter that doesn't use a bushing at all.
