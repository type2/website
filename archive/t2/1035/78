   The hottest 'lectric car, the Tesla Roadster, uses 6,831 lithium-ion cells
   weighing in at close to a ton and it's own charging system...3 1/2 hours
   for a full charge...With only a 220 mile range between charges...;-(
   That's gonna cost a bunch and we haven't even priced a motor, yet...
   
   OTOH, the Tesla's very fast...0 to 60 in under 4 seconds...Quietly... ;-)
