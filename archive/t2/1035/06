Subject: Re: [T2] head light relay

the turn signal is brand new.  the old dimmer relay has no numbers
stamped on it just says bergson and ind. brassialle.  both relays are
five prong and have stamped on the bottom next to each prong the same
numbers.  the new relay also has the code DNI 0127 on the case body.
brazilian made, also.


should i check were the wires come into the steering column?  what
would i look for?

thanks,

jeremiah
