Hi All, 

Whenever I see or hear talk of an electric vehicle, I usually refer the
person to carefully inspect a golf cart.  They're the pinnacle of
electric mobility engineering.  Quite simply, they're built to haul 4
very fat men, plus 4 sets of clubs and a loaded cooler of beer for 18
holes of golf, only to return from progressively wilder driving with 4
loaded very fat men, nearly 4 sets of clubs, and an almost empty
cooler.  

They're hard to beat, insofar as "how to get the best use of the
available power" goes.  

With an electric VW bus, or any other vehicle, the problem is the energy
density of the batteries.  Gasoline has an extremely high energy
density, vs a flooded lead acid battery.  By the time you get enough
batteries on board to get decent range, you're looking at a *lot* of
batteries, and still very poor range.  Recharging the batteries is also
an ordeal.  A fast charge abuses them badly, making the life of you very
expensive battery pack shorter.  A more gentle charge takes longer.
Usually meaning overnight.

A hybrid bus would be a slightly better solution, but still false
economy.  What you'd save in fuel would be offset when you shell out
several grand to replace the battery pack in a few years. 

And, while a bus does have an excellent cargo carrying capability, it's
not the best candidate for converting to electric.  Even the passenger
bus is edging up on 2 tons curb weight, and another 1200 lbs of
batteries is that much more weight to shove around.  

If I were to replace the engine in my bus again, I think I'd opt for a
diesel engine.  If I *had* to make it electric, I'd have a small diesel
running an alternator head to drive the traction motors (like a diesel
locomotive), with just enough batteries to kick it along when need be.
Either way, it'd be much more expensive than a good rebuilt T4 engine
and gas for a couple of tankfulls at least...


Here's an IOU for my $.02 ...... With gas nearly $4 a gallon, I can't
afford a real $.02 to put in.   ;)
