Subject: Vapor Recovery Lines on a 71

I'm getting a fairly strong gasoline smell in my 71 westy.  Usually  this is 
not a problem, but, since my bus is basically parked over the winter, I  leave 
the fuel tank full to hopefully minimize any condensation issues.  It  seams 
like I get the smell when it sits with a full tank.
 
Yesterday I replaced the two large vapor recovery hoses that connect from  
the charcoal canister to the fan shroud and from the canister to the air  
cleaner.  There is also a smaller hose that goes from the front of the  canister, 
which I did not have a replacement for, so I cut the cracked end off  and shoved 
it back on the tube the goes into the body of the bus in the  area in front 
of the charcoal canister.   Does anybody know what size  this smaller hose is?
 
I'm thinking that there are also some hoses in the fuel tank compartment  
area (in front of the tank compartment bulkhead thing) that I should deal with,  
but I can't find any information specific to 71 and earlier in either Bently 
or  Ratwell. Anybody know where I might find a diagram and/or other  
information?
 
I'm thinking of doing an engine pull soon to install all the missing  
thermostat parts, and at the same time replace whatever fuel tank vapor hoses,  fuel 
level sensor gasket, and any other stuff in that area I should replace, but  
I'd like to try and have all the parts on hand ahead of time so I don't get 
into  a situation where my bus in in-op, waiting for parts.
