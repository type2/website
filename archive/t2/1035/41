Hmm.. So I took the model number from CIP1 and did a search on busdepot 
(because cip1 has a $25 minimum order) for 171905865 and came up with these:

http://www.busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=171905865
http://www.busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=171905865MY

The second is a Meyle brand and is cheaper.  The first is Kostal.  Any 
difference between the two?

Thanks!
Mike
