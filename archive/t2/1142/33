Bob,

Can you smell fuel?
What about when you shut off the engine. Any fuel smell coming out the 
tailpipe as the engine shuts down?

With mileage that low, fuel's gotta be going somewhere it shouldn't.

How is power? feel about the same as before the rebuild and your trip to 
buses of the corn?

I had a carb float problem at one time and was getting about 14mpg and the 
plugs were so loaded up with carbon I was surprised they fired. Yours must 
be far worse. Can you post a photo somewhere we can see the plugs?

Have you run a sensor up your tailpipe to check the air/fuel ratio?

Is your fuel gage moving downward overnight?
Is someone draining your tank when you aren't looking? ( sorry, hate to ask 
that one)

Regards,
Chris
