very true but the numbers are a mix of idle 90seconds then 2500rpm 90 
seconds then repeat...

I "Think" the computer is calibrated for adjusting for this when dyno 
can't be used.   heck they have pulled the rollers out of most bays at the 
test facility since so few vehicles left have to be run on them for the 
smog test.

I take my wifes new car down and they turn off the engine then turn the 
key back on to see if all the lights are correctly lit and thats it
