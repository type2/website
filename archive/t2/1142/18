sounds like a fun weekend, wish I was there, but was replacing a leaky 
brake cyl (loads of fun) and trying another new temp sensor.

this high fuel consumption is driving me nuts, have the fuel injection 
book and have followed the trouble shooting diagram and checked, or 
replaced everything right up to the end.   all new vacuuum lines, all new 
fuel lines.  new kyle wiring harness fuel presure checks on the money. all 
the ohmage readings are on the money.  this engine should be running like 
brand new I've done so much to it... and actually it doesn't run bad at 
all seems like that rich it should be complaining.

oh well enough friday kvetching, go have  a great camping trip
