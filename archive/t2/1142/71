Hi Volks,

This sounds to me like it's definitely a 1972 model year. The main 
question is whether it was a north American market model that has had 
its pancake engine replaced with an upright, or if it was a foreign 
market import that was originally built with that engine and found its 
way to the US. My guess would be the latter... esp. as it was not 
uncommon for US soldiers posted overseas to bring back european vehicles 
"back in the day".

If we could get a look at the engine tinwork it'd help decide the 
issue... the factory issued 1972-79 upright tinwork is pretty distinctive.

It might also help if you could send the engine case numbers. If they 
are a match to the VIN then that would pretty much tell the story; 
though if they do not match it doesn't rule anything out.

Happy Trails,
