This is assuming that the cam is in sync with the crank.  Follow the 
guide here as this is how you want to find the *piston's* true TDC:

The problem with the cam method is that it doesn't verify the piston's 
timing, and that is what's really important here.  Cam timing is 
secondary because incorrect piston timing could potentially destroy the 
engine - incorrect cam timing will make it run like crap.  Like you 
said, question everything :)

That link above also tells you how to degree your cam, so that should 
help you verify that you cam is in-fact installed correctly.
