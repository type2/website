Hi Mike and others,

Thank you for all of your guidance thus far. I removed fuses 7, 8, 9 and the
bus will not start.  I get no power to my instrument panel until Fuse 9 is
inserted. At that point with the key moved one notch I get my alt and oil
light, moving it to the start position it will crank and start.

Here is how I have it currently wired... I am using the Bentley "D" wiring
diagram for August 1970 (1971 Models).

The solid red wire from the ignition switch harness  goes to the bottom of
the fuse block at fuse 9 in the diagram. Spliced into that wire is the red
wire that goes to the headlight switch E1 terminal 30. Also spliced in by
whoever installed the radio is an orange wire. Without fuse 9 the radio does
not work in my bus.

The bottom of fuse 10 has the wire that goes to the coil. I replaced that
entire wire about 4 years ago.

Now, my fuse box is clipped under the dash and the bottom of the box is
inaccessible. The wires I moved were all on the top of the box. In the
paragraph above, the black wire on terminal 10 is hooked to the back of the
fuse box. The terminal furthest towards the front of the bus. Do I need to
actually plug wires into the bottom of the fuse block?

Thanks again,

I'll see if the shop I use is open on Monday and will get this checked out
asap if I can't solve it today.
