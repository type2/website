Hi Mike,

Finding TDC with the valves on #3 side is surprisingly accurate; they 
are both closed for such a small increment you have to work hard to get 
the engine to the sweet spot. I'm thinking it's maybe 3 degrees or less.

But to *really* know what's going on inside that engine we need to check 
in three places, not just two. If the timing mark on the pulley agrees 
with the piston it's still quite possible the cam could still be wrong. 
Right now I'm thinking that's the top contender in my book, but I am not 
going to be all that happy for Bob if I'm right.

Happy Trails,
