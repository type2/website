I haven't commented on this thread because most of it is way over my 
head technically but I've thoroughly enjoyed it.  I sincerely hope it's 
not the cam problem.  The only thing I can offer to ask is are you using 
a cheap Chinese calculator?  That may sound stupid as they're all 
probably made in China these days but I'm an accountant (now) and I have 
one at the office that I'm ready to throw in the trash.  Sorry, that's 
more tongue-in-cheek than anything but I know you've grasped for every 
straw you can find.  Too bad it's not Friday.  :)  I hope you find the 
problem.  OK, I'll shut up now and just start reading again.  Best of 
luck...
