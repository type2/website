Hey Bob ,  the wind speed is in Km ... still enough tho!
right now it feels like a chinook .. sort of mild ..

The nice thing about the camping location is the protective landscape small
hill, and large compact forest of pine trees.
The wind actually sounds cool when it blows thru that forest..
but by the time it gets to the site,, it isn't there...  and if the flurries
arrive.. it will be an awsome setting for those who enjoy the outdoors in
the winter!
My thermometer is reading 10c  [50F] right now.. noon fri... I am only 15km
from the camp.
