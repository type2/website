What country? If US, then pancake is correct.

If US, it would be an owner changeover, which is not common. If not
US, the upright is more common, but the pancake sometimes offered as
an option.

 The turn signals in the rear seem to be the newer rectangular shape that
 are kind of fitted into the body vs. the older flush mount oval ones.

72 is correct with these turn signals.
