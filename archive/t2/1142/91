Hey Bob,
I'm gonna get a bit more specific on some of the unknowns (or stuff I've 
missed):

- what is the fuel pressure at idle with the hose 
connected/disconnected.  You can also do a simulated disconnected-hose 
test by turning the engine off and just deflecting the AFM flap and 
looking at the pressure gauge.

- what is the manifold vacuum at idle?

- How long did you say the fuel pressure held after you shut off the engine?

- I think you said this before, but did you measure the standing (room 
temp) resistance of the temp sensor II (head temp sensor).

- Did you perform all of the Bentley AFM resistance tests?

- did you verify that the aux air regulator is actually closing when 
voltage is applied?  Unfortunately the easiest way to do this is by 
pulling it off and then applying voltage.  That, or you could blow 
through the hose when the engine's cold, then turn it on and let it drop 
in idle (5mins or so depending on ambient temp), turn the engine off and 
try blowing into the hose that goes to the regulator - it should be 
significantly more restrictive.

- did you test that the cold-start switch with a test lamp and watch as 
the light dims to nothing (no voltage)?  Since your system is holding 
pressure when the engine is off, we can conclude that your cold start 
valve isn't leaking, but we need to make sure it's turning off.
