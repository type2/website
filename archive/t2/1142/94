hose connected about 35psi under load 28psi idle

haven't tried that

don't have a vacuum guage to test with, wonder where I can rent/borrow one

at least 24hrs

did ambient temp measure and hot with engine just shut down.  all readings 
are within range.

I have the yellow VW fuel injection trouble shooting manual and have 
followed the entire test sequence with acceptable readings

have done this.

have not tried this, as soon as the weather breaks a bit (is currently 
snowing) will try this

have done so and it shuts off after about 10-15 seconds or so.

have unplugged it and replaced it with a new one.
