Hi Bob

Know you said you'd replaced all the fuel hoses but just a  
thought....  On recent trip bus (2-litre carb)
ran like dream, went to cousins house stayed overnight, fired up next  
morning, noticed that fuel
gauge was down, ran 500 metres & died.

Long story short, RACT (AAA? to you) couldn't fault things, trucked  
back home, normal mechanic
put fuel hose from tank back on!!!  Had come off but was sitting  
there like it was attached but was
actually running fuel onto the ground.  (Didn't notice because was  
raining & ground was wet)

Hope it is as simple as that
