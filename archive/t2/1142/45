Bob,

Greg has some good ideas.  I had been thinking somewhat along the same line. 
Also, running retarded would help explain fouled plugs and carbon.  IMHO you 
cannot run an engine so rich that it would drop your mpg  that low.  It 
simply wouldn't run, or would run so poorly that black smoke would pour out 
the tail pipe.
