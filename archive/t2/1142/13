hoped you packed your sails as with winds like that you should be able to 
get double your gas mileage if the wind blows the right direction.

with my bus still getting 5-6 mpg I don't think I could afford the trip 
have a great time and stay warm.

((of course if the wind were blowing the south to north today and North to 
south sunday it might work??)
