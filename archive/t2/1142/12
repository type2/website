Hi Volks,

I just checked with Environment Canada's website, and the forecast for 
this weekend could not be better for Winter Camping!

    Tonight:
    Increasing cloudiness. A few flurries beginning late this evening.
    Local blowing snow late this evening and overnight. Wind west 50
    km/h gusting to 70. Low minus 8.

    Saturday:
    A few flurries ending near noon then clearing. Local blowing snow in
    the morning. Wind west 50 km/h gusting to 70 becoming northwest 20
    late in the afternoon then light late in the evening. High minus 5.

    Sunday:
    Periods of snow. Low minus 14. High minus 5.

Please note that the temperatures listed above are in Celsius, and that 
0C=32F.

So there WILL be snow at the True Canadian Winter Bus Campout this 
weekend at Valens Ontario. I've already packed my bus with firewood and 
cold weather gear and am REALLY looking forward to starting my 2011 
camping season at TCWBC.
