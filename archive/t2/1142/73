as I mentioned in another post they have actually pulled the rollers out 
since the last time I was down there. they were the ones that refused the 
roller test

think I posted something along that lines yesterday.


the big thing that is baffling me is that it wasn't sudden but has been a 
slow loss of MPG and during this period the engine was torn down and it 
had no effect on the fuel consumption.   greg thinks maybe the cam is off 
a tooth or two, but I can't imaginge Bob Donalds and his chief mechanic 
doing that twice in a row????

am totally baffled....  next step I think may be to buy four new injectors 
it's about the only thing I haven't replaced.  and they are fairly new 
rebuilds.
