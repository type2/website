That's a good fail-safe. Only residual pressure would force fuel past
a leaking injector. This would seep past the rings into the oil or
puddle at the rings. So you get a startup without lubrication. You
might do the math on the difference in fuel economy between what you
used to get and what you get now so you can have a volumetric count of
the amount of fuel you are actually losing on each trip. A lot would
show at the dipstick, and I would guess would give a gas odor to the
oil. I don't know if gas in the oil remains, or if it is driven off
through evaporation with engine temps.

Black is evidence of rich running, but can also be present when a
vehicle is used for short trips and the rich running of the cold start
isn't burnt off by normal temp running.

No, unburned hydrocarbons can't hurt a muffler (except like chimney
soot). A cat actually burns them and overheats if there is more
present than it is designed to handle.
