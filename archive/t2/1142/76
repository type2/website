	That prompts my first attempt to help in this puzzle.
	I don't (and wouldn't) have any experience with 
computer-controlled T2.  But since all the obvious ideas have been 
put fwd in this thread, perhaps it's time for one of the List's 
would-be pretend intellectual wannabees to suggest an even 
further-out idea: is it possible that the Black Box to which control 
of this engine is entrusted has become PARTLY defective in some way 
to vitiate, scrub, purge and wipe that last assumption, Mike?
	To characterise my suggestion as unlikely is hardly worth 
doing; all the likely ideas, and quite a few much less likely, have 
now been discussed, so we may as well look further out.
