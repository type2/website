Subject: substitution 3-point retractable seat belts

Merry Friday All,

Does anyone have any idea if there is a difference between these two
offerings of 3-point retractable seat belts that would account for the
appreciable disparity in price?

http://www.gowesty.com/ec_view_details.php?id=2738&category_id=155&category_parent_id=
for $139.95 each...

http://www.mtmfg.com/vw/1306/Volkswagen-Bus-Vanagon-Seat-Belts
for $79.95 each...

?

Thanks, Mike
