Yeah.

If you google search camp kitchens or do it on Amazon, there are many
different kinds from multiple manufacturers, almost all of them are
more expensive than the one you gave as an example.

The just campers one is about $67 USD plus shipping will probably be
another 20 bucks or so (pulling that out of my rear but the assumption
being that international shipping is a bear)

There are a couple on amazon in the <$80 range and a few look almost
identical to the one you gave as an example.

Lots of options though so it shouldn't be too difficult to find one to
match your needs and budget.
