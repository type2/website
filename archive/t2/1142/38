Is that the side that has a metal bus bar between the connectors for 
fuses 8 and 9?  This is the +12v supply (unfused) side of the fusebox. 
If that's how it's hooked up, good - if not, you got something wired 
incorrectly.  You should also see a red wire running from one of the 
terminals for the supply side of fuse 8 to fuse 7.  You should be able 
to remove fuses 7, 8, and 9 and the car will still start.  If it 
doesn't, something's not hooked up correctly.

Sorry, this doesn't make any sense.  If you look at the wiring diagram, 
you'll see that the bused, unfused, +12v supply-side terminals are the 
ones that have the bused connectors.  1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8-9, and 10-11-12 
are all connected on the supply-side (bottom of the fusebox in the 
picture).  Use those as your references.

Try and explain better what you did by referencing the wiring diagram 
and the fuse numbers and which side of the fusebox you're moving stuff 
to/from and that will help.  You could be messing things up worse and 
unfusing things that are supposed to be fused.

Also, could you please post the link to what wiring diagram you're using 
so I can verify that we're looking at the same thing.

thanks!
Mike
