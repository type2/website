PS- if it's that rich, maybe plugs are misfiring, allowing the raw gas 
into your oil that you are seeing-this could explaing the worsening 
milage- when plugs are changed, does milage go up for a while?  You 
changed most everthing- did you replace the plug wires, and make sure 
it's not using both resistive wires and a resistor in the dist. rotor?
    BTW, fuel pressure is a balancing act- if you are dumping fuel 
somewhere, the pressure regulator will notice it and increase flow to 
opening at spec.
