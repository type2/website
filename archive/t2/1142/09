Subject: Spring Plate Bushings

Referencing ENERGY SUSPENSION CATALOG, can someone give me the proper part
number (or description - Style A [knobby], or Style B [smooth]) for my 1971
Westfalia. I would prefer someone that installed these or pictures with a VIN
of the year/series 1971, so I'm not doing this twice.

From what I remember, they were the knobby style.
