I s'pose so!  The only real difference I can see (since they don't show the
hardware) is that the GoWe$ty unit doesn't appear to have a separate
L-bracket attachment (since they don't show the hardware), but you can kinda
see one on the unit - which might make it a slicker install, but hardly
enough to justify nearly 2x the price.
