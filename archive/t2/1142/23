Subject: Re: [T2] substitution 3-point retractable seat belts

Last I checked, GoWesty utilizes factory VW Belt Assemblies modified
for any of the particular vehicle installation.  I use to order their
belts for use on Beetles and Ghias for Airhead Parts and they were
great - definitely worth the price (they were even more $$$ a few
years back).  But because they can't get OEM VW Belts anymore it looks
like they have gone to an American made system, probably manufactured
by Beam's in Oklahoma, the biggest aftermarket seat belt maker in the
US.

Looks like M&T carries an aftermarket made belt system, again it looks
like something made by Beam's.  If so, the price is good because
Beam's systems are pretty pricey.  Beam's minimum order is pretty
stiff, requiring a pretty high purchase qty when buying.

Could be that disparity is in the GoWesty name for a higher price, but
shops can charge anything they want.  Whether they get the sale, now
that's the important part for them :)
