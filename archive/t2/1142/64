wish it were that simple, regular parking spot has only the normal "Vw 
marks spot" stains.  also with fuel injection and 35psi you would see 
broken line in a hurry and I designed and have installed a total fuel shut 
off system wired into my ignition. no power no fuel from fuel tank.  also 
over a year now I think I might have noticed.  was actually my first 
thought when I had problem.

thanks for the ideas though
