Subject: Pressure plate/Clutch cover

Howdy,
If you guys had the opportunity to purchase an older, three-fingered 200mm
pressure plate for a 1600 would you choose a coil-spring or leaf-spring type
of plate?  Are there advantages and disadvantages to either one?  I would
think that the vertical 'height' of the coils would make it more difficult to
balance.  Thoughts?
Thanks!
Eron
