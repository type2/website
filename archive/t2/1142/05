Mike,

TheSamba,  http://thesmaba.com
Busted Bus, http://bustedbus.com
and The Busco,  http://thebusco.com/

are all good places to start.

It's also likely that someone on the list will chime in. Knowing the
specific part number will help identify anything else you'll need to
know to find the right part (is it Cali/Federal/etc).

Good luck
peace
