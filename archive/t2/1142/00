I doubt there's a repro sticker being made, considering how many the
minimum would be to keep the cost down as opposed to the number
actually needing them.  For those in this situation, you may be SOL :(

Just for giggles, I looked on the Auto Atlanta site for my 914 and
they have them(!)

Since mine is a 75, I don't have to worry about a smog test here in California

Too bad no one out there has 'em for the 76-79 Bus owner :(
