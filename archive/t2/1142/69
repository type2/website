Hi Volks,

Side note here: in an offline (skype-to-landline) discussion it was 
disclosed that Bob's emission test numbers are static (ie, parked). He 
was able to avoid doing a dyno-based sniffer test because the test 
facility could not provide cooling air to the engine.

I suspect that as a result the numbers are lower than what they would 
have been if the engine had to spin the rear wheels up to 30MPH.

Happy Trails,
