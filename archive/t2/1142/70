I'd go back and have 'em run the numbers again with the wheels turning. 
  You don't have the cool the engine, and you'd rather it be hotter than 
colder (at least for passing smog).  Plus, you're barely even pushing 
the engine hard enough to get it hot enough to cause any problems. 
That, or I'd get a WB O2 sensor on there and see what your exact AFR is.


Bob,
Do you have a running list of everything that's been checked/tested.  I 
don't want to ask more questions because it seems like you're just 
answering them all over and over (which is probably frustrating for you).

Mike
