Hi Bob,

I am not really thinking its wear on the cam, so much as a misaligned 
cam. (off by a tooth or two) or else the drive gear is spinning on the 
camshaft.

I've also heard of a cam breaking in the middle, so that the 1-2 
cylinders were sometimes firing in time with 3-4 and sometimes not. I 
don't think that's what you have, it's just offered up as proof of the 
perversity of the universe. Whatever is going on in your engine is 
pretty strange to be so hard to sort out. In which case I fall back on 
stuff I learned on the X files: Question EVERYTHING.

Wow. I quoted Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and the X files on the same day. 
Maybe the winter camping froze my brain. I am off to bed now, g'nite all!

Happy Trails,
