Subject: exhaust analysis - was: where is my fuel going...

Bob,
I can't remember if you did this already, but have you had your exhaust 
analyzed?  It would really help if you had some data to help identify 
that you really have a problem, and if so, where the problem lies.

The first, and cheaper method, is to take the bus to a smog shop and 
have them run it on their machine.  If you can find one with rollers, 
even better, as you'll know your running numbers.  Now, this won't tell 
you exactly what your air/fuel ratio is, but you can compare it to the 
smog specs and that will still be better information than none.  That 
should run you about $50 for the test.

The other option, and what I would recommend, is to get yourself a 
wideband O2 meter and that'll run you around $200 (rental might be 
cheaper).  Then you can constantly monitor your air/fuel ratio and get 
your AFM dialed in exactly how you'd like it.

Regardless of whatever method you go, I would highly recommend that you 
pick either one of these methods as then you'd have some data to go by 
and it would help guide you in the right direction.  Otherwise you're 
just shooting in the dark...

Mike
