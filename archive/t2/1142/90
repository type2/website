This is VERY interesting.  With the vacuum hose attached, at idle, the 
fuel pressure should drop.  When you remove the hose, it should rise 
(low manifold vacuum means higher load), but it shouldn't necessarily 
stop running.  If anything, removing the hose is lowering manifold 
vacuum, which will cause the AFM to close slightly, but it will also 
increase fuel pressure, so that should possibly counteract opening the 
manifold to ambient air pressure.  I'd test this, but I can't because 
the Megasquirt uses manifold vacuum so it wouldn't be a very accurate test.

If you remove the hose and plug/kink it, will the engine run?  If not, I 
think we might have found our problem.  I know I've idled my engine with 
the hose disconnected before.

Also, I'd like to know what your idle manifold vacuum is running at.
