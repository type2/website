Subject: Substitute for aircooled thermostat

Seems like a thermistor and a servo could substitute for the NLA  
thermostat for aircooled engines. The servo could be mounted up on the  
flaps, in the cool part of the engine compartment, with only the  
thermistor down where it's hot.

It shouldn't take too much thought to make sure that if it fails, it  
fails in the flaps open position. Or buzzes a warning!

So, tell me why this wouldn't work.
