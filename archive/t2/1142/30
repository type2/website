Subject: Re: [T2] Fuse blew and stopped my van

Update:

Swapped the ignition switch red wire for the red one on the supply side. Bus
still starts and all functions work. I found the red wire from the headlight
switch a bit worn so I taped it up. Took it for a test drive, and the fuse
still gets warm. I used my digital temp sensor and it goes up to around 90
degrees on the metal. A few other fuses are that warm as well. Is this
normal?

Thanks,

Max
