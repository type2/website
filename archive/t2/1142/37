 The VIN code doesn't seem to contain that information. Is it stamped some

Well, again, you should tell us what country you are in. There
shouldn't be any Brazilian T2s in America. The better question is what
country was it exported to. If you are in America, you should have a
German made bus made for export to the US, though exceptions are out
there like military servicemember and tourist delivery programs, as
well as gray-market imports or people moving to the US from other
countries and bringing their vehicle with them.

The country information will be on the M-Plate. This should be
somewhere on the body, possibly near the VIN plate. On mine, the VIN
plate in on the right side of the bulkhead behind the front seats, and
the M-Code plate is on the left side in a symmetrical location.

You can also get a birth certificate for your bus here:
