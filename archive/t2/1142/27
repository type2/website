Subject: Re: [T2] Fuse blew and stopped my van

Hi all,

I had a chance today to look at the wiring diagram for my '71 and compare it
with the wires actually in the bus. Going to fuse 9 is the red wire from the
ignition switch as per the diagram.

Here I am a little confused. The fuse block has two terminals on top, one in
the front (FIF) and one in the back. My red wire goes to the back fused one.
This terminal has 12v at it with the ignition off. In the diagram, the wire
goes on the same side as the black coil wire.

Is it safe to swap the wire to the front?

Thanks for all information and opinions.

Max

...need to refer to a wiring diagram to make sure that you have everything
hooked up correctly up front.
