Probably makes more sense to use the #1 set of valves - rotate engine 
clockwise.  Watch for intake to close, then rotate another 180 degrees 
and you're at #1 TDC.  Unfortunately, +/- 15 degrees on either side of 
TDC might not have much noticeable movement of the crank (if you're 
feeling for movement with a screwdriver) so it's not particularly 
accurate.  The better way is to put something in the engine that 
positively stops the piston from upward movement, then rotate the other 
direction until it stops, and then split the difference and then you'll 
be able to zero in on the correct TDC.

That's really strange that your pulley was off by 20 degrees.  Either 
the pulley or the hub was miskeyed, or the key was sheared?  odd...
