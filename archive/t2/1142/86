	If one swapped out a coil, or say a distributor, there would 
be a finite probability that the replacement component would happen 
to share the same fault (or another but which gave the same defect in 
function).  Why are these 'computers' different?
	For some reason, us pedants tend to rile folks.  But you 
really do need us, I'm afraid.  We will imagine many extremely 
unlikely failure modes (see my webpage) and tiresomely point out 
exceedingly improbable concatenations   -  "you, for example" as I 
used to say to judges within expert evidence on potential disasters.
	I imply the recourse of yet another replacement computer.  Sorry.
