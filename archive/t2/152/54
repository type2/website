POR 15 has a kit on their website for repairing steering wheels. I have
never used it, but maybe somebody else has??

Hi Everybody,
    Can anyone point me toward information on how to repair the cracks in
the plastic on my steering wheel?  It's really just a cometic problem, but
I'd like to take care of it while the steering wheel is still off the bus.
