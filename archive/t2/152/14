Subject: Re: [T2] Engine removal question.

Are we talking 1600 here or 17/18/2000?  Can't help you on the doghouse but
have had the pancake out twice in as many weeks.  Pull em together, way
easier!  Done it each time by myself with no problems.  Only need a floor
jack and some wooden blocks.

YMMV,
Bill
