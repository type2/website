Subject: Drag that camper

On Saturday I went to Santa Pod drag strip to see the drag racing, they were 
having a free "run what you brung" well, it would have been rude not to 
enter. Any way the fastest time was 22.176 seconds 60.78mph that's in a 76 
auto 4 berth camper 1800cc 914 engine and all the junk for a weekends 
camping. It was the most fun I have had clothes on or of for a long time. Has 
any body got any performance figures I would like to compare how she went.
                                     Thanks Mel
