Subject: mystery wires


I have a '74 bus, and have replaced most everything in the engine
compartment except for the wiring harness. There are some wires that I
have no clue where they are supposed to go. The bus works fine without
them, but I am curious as to what they were originally connected to.

This mini-loom comes out of the main harness at the same place the loom
for the right tail signal. It consists of 5 wires. a brown (ground im
sure, it has a ring connector attached to a push on connector), red, blue,
yellow with i think a red stripe (all with push on connectors), and
another which i
can't tell.Some of these colors may be wrong, they were painted over.
 I don't think these go to the test connector as it
already has
a ton of wires connected to it from a different loom. It looks as if its
supposed to go to the right tail light, but those are hooked up with a
loom that comes from the same place, and the correct one im sure. 


Its stock as it comes out of the main harness that passes thru the front
right of the engine compartment. 
the bus was originally a dual carb bus with the afterburn system did that 
have anything to do with it? 

any ideas what this may have been for?

thanks
