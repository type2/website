Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Engine removal question.

The master engine remover John Erickson showed me just once how to remove my
type 4 engine (without removing the tranny). I had never removed an engine
before.

 After reinstalling the new rebuilt engine I realized that GoWesty sold me
the wrong flywheel, so I had to remove the engine again and install it by
myself..no help. I didn't have any problems then either.

They are not as bad as some make them sound.

Good luck!!
