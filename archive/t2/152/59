This is an excellent idea if you intend to keep the bus for a while.  VW
did this themselves with the early bays, so there's no structural reason
to keep the panel welded in place.  I think that VW had a
significant maintainance philosophy change with the type IV.  The type-1
bus was engineered for easy maintainance, while the later buses seem to
make the assumption that you will have a lift with which to extract the
engine.
