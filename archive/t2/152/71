Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Type 2 Front Seat Replacement?

Just before I drove back to Everybus I installed a 1986 Vanagon drivers seat
with both armrests into Roadcow. I feel it was the best thing I've ever done
to a bus! All I had to do was to pound down the "inner" seat rails on my bus
body and the Vanagon seats just slid right on. Granted the outside armrest
is close but I have a Westy and no provision for the air to run along the
door panel. I did'nt make a provision for the seat to kock into place yet
since I drove with it slightly reclined and adjusted as far back as it would
go. It worked great and survived a few panic stops without mooving. Yes it
is a bit taller but I had some people who were about 6' tall driving Roadcow
without any problems.
HTH,
