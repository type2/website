Subject: RE: Type 2 Front Seat Replacement?

I'm not sure of what the compatibility issues are year to year. I'd ask the 
list for that info. I think the Baywindows were the same starting in '75 or 
'76 until the Vanagons in about '87.

As for the armrests - the outside armrest - closest to the door - it won't 
fit the baywindow's body I'm told. Maybe something with the seat belts as 
well. Ask the list for that info. My seats did not come with armrests so 
for me it's been a moot question.

Apparently the difference in the seats' quality lies with the fact that the 
earlier VW seats relied on springs and that layer of thatch (what else do 
you call it?) and a layer of board (cardboard?) right under the cover. The 
Vanagon sets at first glance uses mostly foam which adapts better to the 
shape of the driver's posterior better than that set of springs and the 
board. Maybe some home-grown seat specialist could tell us how to make the 
OEM seat in the baywindow more comfortable using 
easily/locally/commonly/economically found materials.

Were all the VW engineers masochists? Noisy, cold, slow vehicles with 
curious handling characteristics and bad seats... Either they were 
masochists or crummy engineers. Either way I love my old Westfalia and I'll 
be correcting it's shortcomings as I can afford to.
