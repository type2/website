Test it with a torch to see if it works..................the height thing
does not matter for you can adjust the cable.

The trouble is that the bracket that supports the thermostat restricts how 
far it can expand and thus the range it can open the flaps. Thanks for your 
post but can the question still stands.
                                                                              
           Thanks Mel
