How hot is hot?  Unless you have some kind of measurement, you can't really
say for sure.

My 71 Westy with stock engine, carb, distributor, etc. also gets
uncomfortably warm in and around the back bumper, but my CHT gauge never
goes above about 325 F and my OT never goes above 210 F or so - that being
highway driving on really hot days.  Those numbers seem to be acceptable by
most listees for producing decent engine life.

I would start with at least the Berg dipstick sender, although my personal
confidence in that measurement/device is not real good.  Others have
installed various temperature measuring devices in the dipstick tube - see
the archives.  Best IMHO is to install VDO gauges for CHT, OT and OP - then
you really know what is happening.

Hi All,

I'm experiencing some problems with my 71 westy. It seems to be running
awfully hot. I mean start it up run it ten minutes or so and you can barely
even get near the back bumper.
Here is what I know. The valves were adjusted less than 60 miles ago. Timing
seems right on. I checked for a blockage in the fan, my fan belt is tight
with a little play, the engine compartment is sealed up, with all seals
around the engine and hatch.
I have noticed the battery runs dead easily, but figured it may be time for
a new one.
Any ideas??

Thanks in advance!
Melissa
71 westy
