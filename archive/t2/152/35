well one of the nice things about an automatic.  it doesn't have to come
anywhere near as far back, just enough to clear the tranny studs so I have
only once pulled the tranny and decided it wasn't worth the extra hassle,
besides I think the auto tranny must weigh at least 10X as much as a
manual tranny.

yeah had to do that

nope only had to remove the coil and the upper part of the oil fill, just
stuck something in the end to keep the dirt out, usually a rubber glove

well automatic doesn't have an input shaft like the manual. the torque
converter shaft is maybe 2 inches long, the studs are longer

all is not goodness and light, the auto tranny has those 3 torque
converter bolts that make up for it.
