Subject: Where does the gray wire go?


Good Morning,

There is a gray wire that runs from the two orange lights in the front and
then join near the fusebox to make a single connection/wire.  It is
currently not plugged in or connected to anything.

(1) What does this wire do?
(2) Where do I plug it in?

Thanks,
Shawn
