Now that's a cool idea! I wouldn't do that to a Porsche - but to the Bus -
hot damn! You could pull the engine anytime you wanted with minimal effort!
And even if you wanted to take the trans too, it would be easier. This is
the kind of thing that leads to weekend engine pulls for extra detailing
and stuff. It also makes you more likely to fix things that are a pain to
reach with the engine in - and, if you drop the engine regularly, you'll
never worry about a blow rear main seal or dropped clutch.
