Yes/No...  There is a switch for the aux blower.  When the heat lever is all
the way down it turns this on. (The lever completes the circuit)  However...
This fan only pushes air up front at idle.  When the engine rpm's take over
the engine fan wins and pushes the air until it is at idle again when the
aux blower will win.

Hope this helps.
