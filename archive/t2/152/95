don't know if they are even on the net....the courts are shall we say
electronically deprived....
   I don't have it on the computer either only in hard copy, it is really
boring reading.... small claims court, charges "non conforming goods",
default judgement....(Gex offered me my money back the day before court,
probably should have taken it, since getting a judgement and collecting it
are two different things)
