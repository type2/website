Subject: Re: [T2] Where does the gray wire go?

Hi Shawn,

According to the diagram in my Bentley that gray wire should be the wire
that carries power to your lights, to turn them on when the headlight switch
is pulled out one click. This wire should connect to the top of the #2 (or
#11 depending on which way you count 'em) fuse. Another gray wire then runs
from the bottom of that fuse to your headlight switch.

If your orange running lights are working now--turning on and off now with
the headlight switch-- and the gray wire you describe is not connected, then
the previous owner may have run a new wire and you should look for it.

Also, make certain both your turn signals and flashers work.

Cheers,

John Rogers -- 70 Westy
