Subject: Re: [T2] Engine removal question.

I not only claim to have done it, it is the only way I have EVER removed a
T-4 from a bus, probably a half a dozen times all told. The most recent was
a year ago when I installed the new AVP engine in my 74.  I'm not saying
it's easy or anything like that, but it can be done in a reasonable amount
of time on a gravel driveway with only ordinary tools and equipment.

That being said, next time I will be lowering the tranny to make it easier.
(I never said I LIKED doing it with the tranny in place.)

Regards,
Dave
