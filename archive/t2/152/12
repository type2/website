is this an automatic????
   in an automatic tranny the center shaft is loose and will come out,
reach in with a long nose pliers or some similar tool and push it back in.

also be carefull the torque converter can fall off when removing the
engine, wire it on so it doesn't fall, the thing is heavy

manual tranny, don't know, hope someone else has that answer
