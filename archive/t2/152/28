Subject: Douglas Supertop?

I found a 76 bus with a high top. On the back is a label that id's it as 
a Douglas Supertop from PA. They have a telephone number on it
,but when I called they said they don't remember making a VW top. It 
looks as it was made for a bus. Fit's real nice and looks good.
It appears to be made on a 76 Westy body. It has no interior and the 
engine has been converted to a carb. Does not run. Body is in
GREAT shape though. Battery trays are even in great shape. I can get 
this bus real cheap or set someonelse up to get it real cheap.
It's located near Old Saybrook ,CT. You don't find them this nice on the 
East Coast. The underneath is perfect. Beam is perfect.. Let me
know if your interested or if you have more info on the top.
