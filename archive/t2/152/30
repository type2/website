Drat!  went to bed too early and missed the excitement.  Back before I
stopped pulling the engine alone, I had this problem as well.  I *did* get
the engine alone out a couple times, but:
the rear tin had to come off,
the oil had to come out,
the oil fill pipe had to come off the block, and
the engine had to be tilted a bit.
It is an extremely tight fit in there to get the engine off the input
shaft and I would swear that I moved the clutch disc in the sandwich a
time or two.
