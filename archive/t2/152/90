I did this to my 78 a couple years ago, and I have to agree it is the best
single thing I did for comfort in my bus,  since mine is a deluxe I had
the air duct on the door but I just removed the door side armrest,  since
it was a later bus it just slid right in.  anyone who hasn't really should
at least give it a try
