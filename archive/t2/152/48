Subject: Installing engine in T2

I hope to install the engine in China Cat complete with Carbs and all tin, 
but without the exhaust system. The carbs (dual Solex) stick up really far. 
Am I asking for trouble? it is so much easier to install them on the bench, 
but I'll do it in the bus if that is better.

I've pulled two engines, but so far haven't installed one. Your advice is 
appreciated.

Oh, yes, I'd like to run the engine briefly out of the bus, just in case 
there is a problem with my build-up. I'm planning to block it up on 2X4 
wooden slats for the test run. Any advice?

Cheers/Don Carron
