POR 15 company recommended that I sand blast or chemically remove the paint
first. I chose to chemically remove most of the paint before the POR 15. If
you do not do this, you run the risk of trapping moisture under the old
paint or just having the old paint flake off taking the POR 15 with it.

rusted area. well if anybody knows get back to me, thanks see ya
