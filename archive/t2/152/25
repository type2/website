Yes!!  I've always wondered how some people can claim they removed/
installed their type4 engine with the tranny in place and fan housing
attached.  I've NEVER been able to do that.  Back before I started
dropping engine/tranny together, I used to install the engine as
a long block (with cylinder covers, minus rear tin, fan housing,
alternator, exhaust, etc.) to get the clearance I needed.  Even then
it was a struggle.

Tyler, I really doubt that the transaxle's input shaft is coming out -
you just need more clearance, clarence.  :)
