don't be, the engines are at the basics very much the same,  the biggest
thing to consider is that the T4 engine is quite a bit heavier.  but it
comes out the same way just be aware of the weight and follow the

general concensus is that you take out manual tranny engines and trans
together, and an automatic is removed seperately from the trans.
