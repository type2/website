Subject: Intermittent Wipers

Can anybody advise me what the part number is the for the OEM VW 
intermittent wiper relay that allows the user to custom set the delay 
duration? It was used on some Golfs and Vanagons. Can't seem to find it on 
ETKA.

Anyone have a good used one they want to part with?
