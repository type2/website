=A0=A0I don't have another one to listen to so, With the hatch to the
engine compartment open should I hear the air going through the air
distribution box? Had a severe vacuum leak that I fixed but I still hear
the hissing sound. Can't seem to pin it down. Plugged all vacuum ports
to rule out the hoses, still hear it. SHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSH.
