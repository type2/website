Subject: 1979 ASI Riviera For Sale  :(

Hi All,

Well.. the sad day has come when I need to sell my
1979 ASI Riviera VW Bus.  It has been an excellent
bus, but unfortunately I have no place to store it
anymore.

Here are the details:

Located in Sacramento CA.
79 ASI with penthouse pop-top. 
Bus is brown, top is beige.
All new work done inside.  New carpet, custom side
panels and cabinets (very nice and clean).
Has Fridge that works on both 110v and 12v.
Propane Stove
Sink with water tank.
No rust (I completely re-worked the inside and
rust-proofed everything.)
Runs great and is smog legal!
About 58k on a rebuilt engine.  All maintenance is
done regularly and done right.
CD Player
Extra parts...

and ALWAYS GARAGED.

I can send pictures if you are interested.. just
e-mail me.

$3600.00

Thanks,
Nick
