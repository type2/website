Hi,
Assuming your '72 is the same as my '78 (dangerous assumption but can't be
bothered to get the wiring diagrams out!), there is a contact on the heat
control lever.  When the lever gets near the bottom of its travel, the
contact grounds a wire, which operates the relay just above the fan and
turns it on.
