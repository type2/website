Hi All, 

I'm experiencing some problems with my 71 westy. It seems to be running awfully hot. I mean start it up run it ten minutes or so and you can barely even get near the back bumper. 
Here is what I know. The valves were adjusted less than 60 miles ago. Timing seems right on. I checked for a blockage in the fan, my fan belt is tight with a little play, the engine compartment is sealed up, with all seals around the engine and hatch. 
I have noticed the battery runs dead easily, but figured it may be time for a new one. 
Any ideas??

Thanks in advance!
Melissa
71 westy
