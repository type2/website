Subject: Re: overheating

I too have been concerned with temperature in my stock '70 Bus.  I put this rebuilt engine in at the beginning of the year and its first long trip was to L.A. in Feb.  At that time I determined that I could run it at 70 all day long but any increment over
that brought my Berg dipstick to life.  I was concerned that the speed/temperature matrix would get lower during the summer months.  In anticipation of another trip this past weekend I switched from a multiweight oil to straight 30 weight and gained 5
degrees on my matrix.  I'm happy to report that I can now cruise at 75 or better all day long and even push it over Pacheco Pass without overheating.  I'm now a strong convert to using straight 30 weight in an air cooled VW.
