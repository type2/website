All this talk of T4 buses has me scared witless... It
took 6 hours with me and a guy that works on american
cars to pull and install a T2 engine in a 68 Westy.  I
have a chance to buy a pair of T4 buses, one needs to
have the engine/trans of the other.  I am not sure
that I am up the the task of swapping the T4s... I
guess if I buy, then I will learn.  Thanks for the
posts on this topic, it is educational.
