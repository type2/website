Subject: Re: [T2] Engine removal question.

(sorry about my english...)

Just something to consider when planning an engine removal:

Why not just cut the body-metal in the lower back of the engine compartment
on both sides (like it is done on split-screen buses).
Then weld some mounting to the cut off-piece and the sides of the engine
compartment, get that rust off and do some painting.
I did this to my '78 2liter.
When removing the engine I just have to put away the bumper and the 4 big
screws holding the cut away body-piece. Put your floor jack under the
engine, get off the engine screws and just pull it out. No need to even
raise your bus.
I've done this a couple of times without any problems.
