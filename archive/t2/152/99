Timo, George,

I am sorry to say I have to disagree.  If you have a 1600cc engine, as
many European buses did, cutting out the rear member will probably not be
a problem, but I believe that VW welded in the rear skirt on the later
buses not to make maintainance more difficult, but rather to decrease flex
under the increased torque of the later, larger T4 engine.  As I look at
bus design thru the years, I see many cases where the engineers and
accountants fought battles and I think this is a case where the engineers
won.  I can see the arguement between the engineers going for increased
strength vs. the accountants going for cheaper manufacturing as I write,
and in cases where there is engineers scored, I am willing to let them
maintain the victory.
