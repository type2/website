Subject: Re: [T2] Installing engine in T2

Hi Don

When I remove an engine,I pull the trans,,and I pull the rear tin, and the CARB
electric jets sticking out the side of the carb,, cause if they catch on the
body on the way out,, you can bust things that cost money! 

Putting the engine in,, or taking it out with the carbs on,, pull the electric
solenoid jets off the carbs,,, 

I run the engine on a wooden pallet. 

Cheers!
