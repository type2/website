Subject: 2.0L Engine & Trans For Sale

Hey Folks,
      Got a complete 2.0 engine from a '76, FI stuff all there, and tin. =
Mileage unknown, but was running well before I pulled it.Only thing =
missing is exhaust system. I'm in the N. Virginia area (Round Hill, 20 =
miles west of Leesburg). $400.00 for the engine, $100.00 for the 4 speed =
trans., $475.00 for both. Delivery within 50-60 miles possible for a few =
extra $$.     Jeff
