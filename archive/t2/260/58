Subject: Re: [T2] carb question on 1970 T2

I too am running the Brosol on my '70. Mine seems to run great.  I'm not 
sure what the jetting is though.  I've never been inclined to check it out.  
In fact, I have 5 of these carbs, and they all run the same on my 1600SP.  
The noise you hear while decelerating is an exhaust leak.  Look for a sooty 
or blackened connection at the head or muffler.

P.S. If you want to unload the throttle position sensor, let me know.  I'm 
running one currently, and it works fine.  Tempermental things though.
