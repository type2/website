Subject: Re: [T2] Rotors turned... too much?

doesn't matter how much you take off the rotors, just
how thick they are.  Once you get to a certain point,
the mechanic is not allowed by law to turn them
anymore for you and you have to get new ones. 
Obviously, the more that is taken off, the quicker you
have to get new ones.  Turning them slightly more
often or at least getting them checked more ofter will
keep you from getting so much warp and they should
keep the rotors straighter for longer.  When it comes
time to replace, get some cross drilled ones, they are
a little more expensive, but you should be able to
hunt down some pretty inexpensive ones and they last a
lot longer because they don't get nearly as hot.
