---- Now
onto seperating the tranny after I clean it and
replacing the pilot bearing.  -----

Drew, 
On pulling the pilot bearing, I recommend renting a slide hammer puller
for this job (I just told my FLAPS what I wanted to do and I guess there
is similar in Harley engines, so they set me right up with a slide hammer
and small jaws - it helps to have the replacement bearing with you so
they can get the right jaws).  

I tried the packing the bearing with grease and pounding a tight fitting
pin or tranny shaft  to create hydraulic pressure to force the bearing
out -  did not work for me. I also don't see the logic of hitting a pin
or shaft heavily on the back of the engine, counting on hydraulic
pressure to stop if from hitting the back of the block!
