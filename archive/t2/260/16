Hello List,

    Does anyone have practical experience with this cooling system (911
replica) ? Cylinder head temp gauge, dip stick touch test, oil temp gauge,
detonation, etc?
    I have had several customers ask about it, and having never used one, I
was afraid to say one way or the other. The bucks just don't equal the cool
(pun-intended) in my book.
    opinions..........................?
