I know you said vanagon, but this is my belt from GoWesty (it's a new VW
belt for a Jetta) which came with an L-shaped bracket for installation.

I decided not to drill another hole.

I thought this was an interesting alternative installation:

Someone recently asked me once how much does the belt come out when
installed down in the original hole. In order words could a larger person
secure the belt? I measured and it seems if your belly can clear the
steering wheel you'll be ok mounting the belt lower down.

It will seem that way until you mount it, then the belt with come out easily
and lock only with a quick pull.
