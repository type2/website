RPM's are necessary for you to figure this out.  What you need to do is put
in new plugs and immediately run it like 30 miles at the higher rpms.
Stop(by turning car off and coasting). and check color on the plugs.  This
will tell you how the motor is running at the higher rpm.   If lean.drill
out the main.

Very likely your timing has a little too much advance causing this problem,
too.  Check your timing for total advance.
