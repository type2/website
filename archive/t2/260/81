Subject: Pertronix dwell

I'm about to make the switch to electronic ignition and I've been reading up
in the archives.

One comment I found seemed to indicate the pertronix dwell was 58 degrees. I
know my bus runs great at 50 degrees of dwell with points so what's up?

Other questions I have are: do you gap the plugs differently? Is the blue
coil fine to use? Is the timing the same value as with points?
