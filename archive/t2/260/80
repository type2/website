Subject: Sachs Pressure Plate Part Number

Anybody know the Sachs Pressure Plate part number for a 66 type I bus
with a 1700 cc engine ?
This new Sachs plate doers not have any VW part numbers on it.
I've got a new pressure plate and want to be sure I've got all mu parts
before I pull the tranny to install a new clutch assembly.


Thanks
