Subject: External Oil Coolers. Who's done it?

HI all,
I know there is some info on t2 . com about runing an
external oil cooler however some of it is a little
unclear and without exact directions on installation
or exactly how much of a difference. So I'll just
shoot it out to all of you. Has anyone had good luck
with and external unit of some kind, how did you go
about it and is there anyway for me to install a unit
without removing the engine? I thought I saw something
out there which allows you to run lines right out of
an oil filter adapter but not sure how that works.
Thanks for any help, 
Giles
