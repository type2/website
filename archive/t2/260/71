Subject: Weber Jets

Hey list-

I have a 1974 1.8 ltr. with a 34/36 Weber DFAV carb sitting on top. For all
of you who will yell about the Weber....I know, I know. But it is what I
have and it actually works very weell for me. Starts up instantly in any
weather, has never iced up (Even though I live in the land of
humidity...KY), and gives me good performance and mileage. My only concern
is that I think I am running lean at high rpm. The spark plugs look good,
color-wise, when I pull them but the head temps seem high when I am cruising
at around 60. The oil temp is good, even when the heads get hot. Hot meaning
400 - 450. The head temp guage also responds INSTANTLY to any change in
speed.

Is it possible to re-jet just for the top end and not redo the entire carb?

Thanks for advice,
Dave
