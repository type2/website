Yes this is soooooooo correct! While not on a bus I can attest to this
on another vehicle. I spent some time experimenting on putting disc
brakes on my 76 IH Scout. Worked good, except for one thing. I didn't
have the proportions correct. One morning a light turned before I
expected it & I slid right through the light (w/ a semi coming quite
close). My front wheels were still fine, but the rear ones had locked
up. If anyone considers it I would seriously consider doing some
serious research into what is needed to reduce the pressure to the
rear brakes.
