The gear is probably still in there but probably in two pieces by now.  You
are going to have to glue it somehow or find a matching replacement part at
the local VDO speedo repair guy's house in his assorted speedo parts bin.

We have a local guy in town, <http://www.speedometer.com/>, but I've been
able to DIY so far and have never used him.

This is how the gear fails: a fracture appears between the teeth and grows
down to the hub until it breaks...

I bet it would be hard to find a gear in anyone's bus that isn't cracked a
little unless it's low mileage. In fact if someone is selling you a bus with
50,000 "original" miles I bet the state of that gear would settle any doubt
as the whether it was 150,000. Of course if you find a broken gear...

This image was from a broken speedo that I stole the face from for my KM ->
Miles conversion.  I noticed the same crack in mine and hopefully
strengthened it a little.
