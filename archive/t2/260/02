I doubt you will have clearance problems in the rear even with bigger wheels.  But the important thing is, what size are your tires?!?  The coilovers are okay and will give you some lift in the rear, but the KYB gas shocks will too.  When I went from the coilovers to the KYBs, I didn't notice a decrease in rear ride height.
