I bought one of these too, through a mail-order house.  I found it to be very unreliable - at first it displayed the correct voltage but the longer it was plugged in the higher the voltage read.  Got to be more than 1v off.  I assume this is because of some temperature factor that was not compensated for in the circuit, but I really don't know... maybe I got a bad one.
