Subject: Jumper Cable -> Cig Lighter

A thought:

To jump start a vehicle, using another vehicle, a good procedure would be to 
connect the two vehicles via the cigarette lighters.

Comments??

Is such a connection wire sold OTC at FLAPS??  Should/must it be 'fused'?? 
How heavy a gauge wire should be used??  How long??
