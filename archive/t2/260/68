I was running 4 wheel discs with a Karmann Ghia master cylinder. It braked 
pretty good and pretty evenly.

You could add a proportion valve it you needed to but I found my setup 
worked just fine.

K-G brakes up front, 914 discs and calipers out back. CB Performance kit. 
Build your own, the kit was big $$$ and all VW and Porsche off the shelf 
parts except the rear caliper bracket (also easy to make).
