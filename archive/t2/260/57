That's a good point Adam. The fellow who wrote the article used the Type 3
rear drums because he was working on a '56 Beetle. I'm pretty sure wide-5
rear discs are a bit more pricey than the four-lug kits, if you can find
'em.
This is just a matter of preference. The article is out there just in case
;)

Have a great day!
