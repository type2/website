Subject: JBB less than a month away!

Time is getting close to John Brown's Buses held in Harpers Ferry, West 
Virginia.  The campout is 66 mile from Washington D.C. and 68 miles from 
Baltimore.  I created a site with some information and local 
attractions.  http://www.home.earthlink.net/~theauchs/JBB.htm.
Hope to see you!
