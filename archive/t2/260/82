Subject: Finding Type I and II on E bay.

I seem to find Vanagon parts very easily on Ebay but I am having
difficulty finding early bus parts on E bay.
I know they are out there but I just happened on the right search word to
bring them to me.
I find 2000 auctions for Matchbox cars but can't seem top sort out the
real stuff from the toys.
