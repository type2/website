Subject: HEI or CDI igntion system complete $85 dollars on Ebay

http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=1862622554

Just a heads up, there is a complete HEI or CDI (whichever you like the name
of best) :-) selling on Ebay right now for $85 dollars. This includes the
ignition box, and the magnetic pickup assembly complete. I bought one
because of the price, the fellow seems to be a straight shooter, shipped it
out an hour after I paypaled him the money. Check it out if you're looking
for an upgrade at a reasonable cost. Anybody have any comments about it? I
will report on it when it arrives in a few days.
Take care,
Courtney
