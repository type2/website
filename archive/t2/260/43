I just had my rotors turned.  The mechanic said the left wasn't too =
bad... he didn't say how much he took off.  The right one was worse.  He =
had to take it down .015" to get it looking nice.  Is this too much?  I =
can't find the specs in Haynes and I don't have access to Bentley.  The =
Bentley for the Karmann Ghia says not to take more than .008" off.  Will =
this be a problem on (I think) '73 - '79 brakes?

Also in regards to this, Funky is a '71, but I think the brakes have =
been upgraded to the '73 -'79.  I've checked as best as I know how to =
confirm this... (the backing plate is about 11.5" in diameter)  If I put =
'73 - '79 calipers on but the disks are actually '71 - '72, am I going =
to seriously screw something up?  If someone could look in Bentley and =
give me the specs on the thicknesses, I'd greatly appreciate it!  I =
think I'll be able to track down a micrometer in the meantime.

Thanks!
Eric
