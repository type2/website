Subject: Cold Idle Issues

I recently went through a whole tune up on my bus after installing a =
vac. dizzy.  After thoroughly warming the engine up I did the following:
Set timing correctly for the dizzy model and engine (7.5deg atdc)
Set dwell exactly at 50deg
Used Hoovers sermon on carbs to field tune the 34PICT3 and set idle at =
950 rpm.

When the bus is warm it runs great, unfortunately it now no longer idles =
when i first start it up.  Since we're heading into the cold weather =
season i'd like to get this resolved so that I don't have to rev the =
engine to keep it running at first.

I don't know what my compression is, and also I don't have the preheat =
hose hooked up to the air cleaner (the air cleaner doesn't have the =
thermostatic elements in it).  I suspect this may be the issue but any =
advice would be helpful.  One option I thought of is to just raise the =
idle speed.
