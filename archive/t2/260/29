Thanks, Jamie.  I did have the door open, and each time I scratched the 
power cable (I actually used a jumper wire) to the positive post, I got 
sparks.

These sparks were so tiny that I was glad I did this at night. Oherwise I 
would not see the sparks.

I will have another go at it tonight.

!! Last night I shortened my search parameters !!

That is, I put a brad nail into the red/black stripe wire coming out of my 
ignition switch, (pulled the wire from coil to distributor) and I measured 
8.5 volts at that point, and the engine turned over.  I did this a second 
time with same results, but a third, fourth and more times gave me  -0.00 on 
the digital scale, and no action from the starter.  The scale actually went 
from 0.00 to -0.00

Over the weekend, measuring the voltage at the solenoid with the key 
turning, my son and I both observed 8.5 volts at the solenoid when we got a 
successful starter reaction.

So, it seems that the problem up front, since the voltage observer at the 
igniton switch was the same as received at the solenoid, when any voltage 
was observed...

I just previously replaced the ignition switch with a FLAPS new one, so I 
think it is not the ignition switch.  I THINK IT IS the area around the 
mechanical ignition switch!!

Many years ago, I had the ignition re-keyed to match my other keys. The key 
meister replaced my whole unit with a 'like new' unit from one of his buses 
in the back. (The key blank on my '78 ignition was not the type 2, but 
something like a beetle ignition switch.  He needed a whole unit.)

I don't thing the operation was successful.  He missed the point when he 
drilled the hole to remove the ignition switch.  He may have forced the 
removal, but since this was a replacement of the ignition switch, not just a 
re-keying, I guess this might have been though to be acceptable.

Results: my 'new' ignition switch would come out with the key!!  Turn the 
key off, pull on the key, and the whole unit would come out!!

But everything worked back then.

Now the ignition switch does NOT come out with the key, but I have this 
intermittent non-voltage problem coming out of my ignition switch.

I guess I have to find a "new" housing and re-drill and re-key and 
re-install.

Ya know, there is a late bay Westy in a yard that has been there three years 
at least.  I went by there last Saturday, and all I could salvage out of it 
was a strip of wood from the right rear quarter.  And the ignition key that 
was STILL in the ignition!!

If I can find that ignition key on my work bench, I am going back for the 
housing this Saturday!!


And Jamie, thanks for the hints.
