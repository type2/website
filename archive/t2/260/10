This is with the fins on the 6-cylinder Porsche engine.  I would also like
to see that Porsche engine pull 400HP for a half-hour straight without
melting.

The fan may well move 3000CFM in free-air conditions, but I doubt that it
can force that kind of flow through the fins on the VW cylinders.  If the
air doesn't go through the fins, it doesn't do any good!

Absolutely true, and very difficult to do without some major investments
in time and expense.

Of course, we could change the cylinder spacing to allow bigger finning,
and while we are at it we could increase the number of cylinders to
increase fin area.

Oh, dear!  I've just invented a Porsche engine!

It would be a lot easier to just swap in a stock engine of the desired
power.  Making big power out of little parts is a racer's game, not one
for a daily driver.
