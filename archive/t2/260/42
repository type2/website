Thanks, I'll check all that.

Really? I am originally from Napoli myself!!! Were you on the Saratoga?
We've been wandering if there was actually someone on that ship!!! Best
sight on Xmas in the bay... ;-)

Oh yeah! I could use some info on the heating system of my bus, but I have
no hurry (only work on it on weekends) so really don't rush just to help me.
Also, my mailbox at andy(-at-)simonetwork.net can handle unlimited mail size.

>You have a Beetle powered bus? (1600cc?).
It's a 1600cc, yes. And beside the heating it does an outstanding job!


Thanks again, and be welcome back here!
