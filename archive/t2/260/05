Subject: Checking for fuel

I have a 81 Cal. (breakerless ignition) model Vanagon and would like to
know a good way to check for fuel.

I pulled a pair of injectors, but when I experienced a backfire through
the intake and saw a flame come out of a blown off hose, I thought I was
going to the great Vanagon maker in the sky.  :o

I pulled the two wires off the #1 terminal on the coil to diable the
spark and re-cranked but no fuel came out of the injectors -  but I am
not sure if I disabled the electrical signal to the injectors by pulling
these wires.

Bentley says to pull the line off the aft end of the fuel pressure
regulator, but because the van is on a gravel driveway and next to a
stone wall, I can't really get to it, nor can I roll the bus to gain
access.

I was thinking of pulling the line off the fuel filter after the fuel
pump to see if it is pump fuel as a quick check.  Any
suggestions/comments welcome.

Please P-mail, I'm in digest mode
