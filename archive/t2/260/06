I think on Jake Ray's site he says the 911 fan can move air at
3000 cu.ft./min. In other words it can move enough air to cool a 400HP 3.6L
Turbo 911.  He states that the real trick is to match all the parts to your
engine so you aren't over or under-cooling the engine.

One of the possibilities he mentions is using Aluminum finned cylinders to
make real use of the 911 fan and radiate the heat better.  Whoops, my wallet
just exploded.  I think the 911 look is pretty cool but it's an "in for a
penny, in for a pound" kind of upgrade.

Just repeating what I read...visit the site.
