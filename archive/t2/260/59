Another thing to consider is the stopping power of rear discs.  Don't you 
need a proportioning valve to lessen the pressure to the rear brake 
hydraulics, so you don't lock and slide under hard braking?  The chances of 
such an occurrence with rear drums is MUCH less, is it not?  Hydraulic 
gurus?  Anyone?  Bueller? ;^)

Rear disc kits with e brake are about the same amount of work and cost
under
$350 now...................
