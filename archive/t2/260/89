Richard....  Wow, neat picture.

Now, notice that the gear has ELEVEN teeth!!

Trying to find this baby outside of VDO supply channels is a fool's errand.  
I carry a spare gear on my key chain, just so I can show various shops what 
exactly I am looking for, 'cause I ask just about everywhere I go.  Even 
major - wholesale gear distributors.

Barry sends - foolish in Virginia  ;-)
