Subject: Front Shift Rod Bushing Replace

Hello All -
I have a 79 bus.  Recently I acquired a new front shift rod bushing (a.k.a.
shift guide) to replace the mangled, sloppy-shifting-causing rubber/plastic
disc thing that is up in there now, hanging by a thread if still there at
all.  Looking at the old bushing some time ago, I assumed that a replacement
would involve just greasing up the new bushing and sliding it into the
"peace pipe" end of the shift rod, working it in so that it seals correctly
into its groove.  But, someone just told me that it is much more involved
that that -- as in having to somehow loosen/disconnect the shift rod and
slide it back in order to get/fit the bushing in there.  Is this true and if
so, can someone step me through this process?  I don't want to get under
there and start unbolting rods willy-nilly without having some guidance to
work from.  Thanks for your help!
