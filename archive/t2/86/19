Subject: Re: [T2] Front Shift Rod Bushing Replace


Did the same thing on my 78 several weeks ago and I have the same problem
with "worse" shifting now.



BTW, I changed mine by disconnecting the grub screw and then could pull
everything back just enough to get the new bushing in.  Didn't touch the
shift lever housing/bolts at all.


Cheers ,dave
