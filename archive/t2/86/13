Subject: needs some parts - Curtain rods & seat belt bolts

Hi Volks,
I need some parts for my '78 camper...
Need: Curtain rods and those little plastic plugs that
bolt into the cargo floor when seat belts are not
installed (or does anyone have a bolt size to use
instead of the original?).
Thanks,
Al
