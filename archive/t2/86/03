Ricardo,
I have used a 9mm 12pt. socket to do this.  Local VW expert told me of
a 5/16 star socket Snap On makes that works better.  Think it cost me
about $5.
You can also usually get an open end wrench in there but sometimes it's
hard to get leverage if the grub screw is really frozen in.  Spray some
good penetrating oil on for a couple days if it's frozen up, try heat etc.
