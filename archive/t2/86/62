Subject: Re: Rear Shift Coupler Screw

Just a note: People have a tendancy to over tighten-these. They need not be
tight at all as the pointed end of the screw goes into an indentation. You
could finger tighten it and it would hold as long as it didn't back out (I'm
not suggesting that finger tight is enough though). That is why there is a
hole in the screw for a retaining wire - to prevent backing out of the
screw.
