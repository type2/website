This is a typical fuel injection problem that is repaired best by folowing
the Bentley procedures. The answer may be fuel supply ( plugged filter, rust in tank )
which will display incorrect fuel pressure or delivery.
It can also be an ECU input signal ( from AFM, Temp Sensor 2, etc.)
You may guess and get lucky, but the Bentley is the preferred method.

As regards the ECU input from the AFM, this is also common to Vanagon,
where the "fix" was a factory patch cable ( for which a cheap solution is
a  capacitor in series with contacts in the AFM ). This has produced
successful repair in 2.1L Vanagon engines, with some evidence of success
in 1.9L engines as well. Evidently, the ECU goes into default under certain conditions,
caused by a resonance in the AFM signal. These are L-jetronic w/ Lambda engines.
Has anyone attempted a similar repair for earlier AFM problems ?
