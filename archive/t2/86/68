Subject: Re: [T2] fuel line blues OVER!


I don't know what year bus you have but the filter needs to go before the
pump. In the fuel injected models the filter is a square type which mounts
imediately prior to the pump and takes a slightly larger diameter hose from
the filter to the pump. I was able to use 7/16 hose here, but I suspect a
closer metric equivalent would be better. That hose is only a few inches
long. On the dual carb motors and older upright (type1) motors the filter
is again located inline between the pump and the tank. The idea here is to
protect the fuel pump and the carbs from contamination. You can locate a
filter after the pump but you may affect fuel pressure which is sensitive
on a fuel injected model. I'm sure others have their own thoughts on this
but heres my opinion...

Thanks to all who guided me.
It wasn't that tough after I melted the ice/snow off
the undercarriage and could see what was what.

Would have been done last week, if the FLAPS guy
hadn't sold me the wrong size tubing. He nor I knew
that only the correct metric would work.

Didn't put a fuel cutoff or a filter in line. (I had
to get back on the road ASAP.)

If a guy was to put a fuel filter in line, where's a
good place and what's a good filter? I have a tractor
filter the size of a can o' beans. (?)
