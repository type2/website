Subject: Re: [T2] machine shops in southern new england?

I've talked to  a few mechanics and machine shop operators in southern New England and the story is that they just don't work on a/c VW engines anymore.  Machine shops that used to do line bores aren't set up to do them anymore because of the lack of requests.  Some will rebuild heads but that isn't such a problen with the cost of a new head less than $120 on a T1 engine.  

I don't know of any machine shop that will work with you if you want to do the assembly work yourself.  I'd like to know if there is still a machine shop in southern New England that will do the line bore, set the cam and advise you on bearing sizes.

Anyone know of a shop that still does this?
