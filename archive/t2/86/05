Hello All   I'll put my two cents in on this subject. The platinum plugs will 
foul out and then will not clear them selfs . The copper tip plugs will. The 
standard bosch # w8ac plug works very well. There is a trick of using the 
W7bc plug from porsche 356', 912's which works even better. Of course this is 
for the type 1 motor.  Later guys H0pe to see you at everbus    Mark Dearing
