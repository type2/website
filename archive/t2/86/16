Chuck & list,

   While visiting Brazil last year I was fortunate to meet a DJ who
owned a type 2 manufactured about 1990, and he let me drive it. I wasn't
familiar with the engine it was using, definitely FI and possibly that
golf engine. About a quarter of the buses in brazil have an alcohol
burning engine because of the emissions issues, but they have been
phased out because of engine wear issues and the current cost of alcohol
vs. gasoline. And the body styling was a little strange-- mostly your
average 70's breadloaf but the rear hatch/window were designed along the
lines of the splitty's rear end, with a smaller window. Some buses had
ane extra 4 inch hardtop roof, other didn't (aftermarket?). I don't know
about the radiator; perhaps it was a swamp cooler? But back to my
friend's comby--- it was so fun to drive! Much more kick than my 1600
engine. In true Rio driving fashion, I nearly flattened a pedestrian and
wound through twisty hilly cobblestone streets at an unsafe speed. The
low points: no heater controls (and probably not missed in brazil), no
radio, very minimal creature comforts (even compared to regular VW
spartan accomodations). These are definitely workhorses. I've got
pictures of type 2 mail trucks, public transit (quasi-legal),
ambulances, and my personal favorite, the Rio de Janeiro police bus,
complete with lights on top (the cops even posed because my girlfriend
told them I was some kind of magazine photographer). R.I.P. the
Brazilian type 2 manufacturing.
