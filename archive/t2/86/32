Subject: Midas Muffler [WAS: Re: [T2] Engine-neering - combustion chamber question]


FWIW the nearest Midas franchise (this is a store in a VERY high-rent 
strip and they have every reason to be mercenary) has welded VW stuff up 
for me not once, but three different times, always smiled about it and 
declined to write me an invoice although I sincerely was willing to pay. 
I don't think they remember me but I take all my watercooled exhaust 
work there. Very generous, competent folks. YMMV
