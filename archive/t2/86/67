Jeremy and list:

Let's not forget the temperature factor.  If a car battery is sitting on hot concrete, it will lose it's charge faster, but it has nothing to do with the concrete.  Hot temps make lead-acid (and other types) lose their charge faster.  Cold temps make batteries hold onto their charge longer.  Some people even store new flashlight batteries (AA, AAA, C, D) in the refrigerator to increase their shelf life.
