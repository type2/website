Subject: tow bar wanted

In a effort to stop inriching U-Haul, I'd like to lay my hands on a tow bar.
I know Uncle Jerry has one at Havasu for $135 which seems resonable but
looks like I wont be able to get to BBB this weekend <sigh> some sun woulda
been nice. Would anyone be interested in a trade for a real nice deluxe
bumper? Like I said I cant make it to BBB, but it looks like I will head
down to SoCal the week after so I could deliver it to anyone along the west
coast. Hope everyone has a great time at BBB
