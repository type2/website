ah!  however one of the reasons for the new cooling system was the stock
type I doesn't cool well enough.

well if I recall the late tranny is an inch or so longer, also I think the
engine is longer so I suspect you will have to modify the tin
anyway.  there is an awefull lot of room behind the pully on a type I, the
type IV barely has an inch or so, which is why many take the engine/tranny
out together.
