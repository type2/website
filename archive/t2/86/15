Subject: Re: [T2] Front Shift Rod Bushing Replace

 
--Travis,

Did this last week on my 76.

1. remove gearshift assembly held by two bolts on floor. take it out as an assembly and note how it's put together so you get it back right.

2. under bus, find point where the two shift rods (front/rear) meet each other and are held together with a coupling/setscrew. remove safety wire on setscrew, remove setscrew and slide coupling forward. it will take a little wiggling to work the front rod out so you can replace the bushing. the rod is bent by design so don't be worried if you see it's crooked.

3. WARNING: the bentley shows the earlier bay front shift rod bushing arrangement where apparently the bushing goes inside the shift rod (list?), the later bushing seats in a circular hole in a piece of vertical sheet metal and goes around the shift rod.

4. Lube the inside of the bushing. reinstall shift rod under bus, it's really not hard.

5. reinstall gearshift assembly and be prepared to adjust per bentley.

Note: My front bushing was missing entirely and my shifting has been worse since doing the procedure. I believe I may need to replace the rear bushings (2) also. Would the list care to comment?
