If whoever is looking for the green/yellow gets in touch with me I think
I own all of this left in the world new on the roll.  Still have some from
a group buy I did from the Trim Shop 6-7 years ago.  I have a number
of small sections sufficient for front seat recovering (54" wide by 33-40"
long) I will sell.  It is the mostly yellow, green, but also black, and
ORANGE.  Proper color for '76-'78 or so Marigold westy's (school bus
yellow standard westy's.)  This has orange anyway, there is a yellow/green
from the green deluxe westy and this is not it.  Similarly it is not the
mostly orange/black from '74-'75 orange westy's.  Anyway if anyone needs
some bits I will see what I got.  Anyone wanting enough to redo a bus
might try to con Dolan into selling his, I doubt he will ever buy a bus
to use it in and he has a full 12-15 yards or whatever we determined
was sufficient to do one bus.
