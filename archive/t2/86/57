Brian,
what you have is state minimums 15/30/5 15k per person,30k per accident and
5k property damage.Nothing there to protect you or your bus. Best thing to
do is shop until you find a good price and agent.To raise your liability
limits to 1mil is fairly cheap, its the comprehensive on your vehicle that
costs.
