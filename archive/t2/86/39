Subject: Re: [T2] Rear Shift Coupler Screw

Ricardo-

I just did this very thing on my 74 this weekend. Changed out the shift
coupling without dropping the trans (ala Bentley) or removing the shift rod.
It's *really* tight in there but it can be done. For the screw I used a tiny
little open end wrench after spraying with PB Blaster. The screw was tight
but it came out with no trouble.

Hope this helps,
Dave
