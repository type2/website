Subject: Upright in a late bay. How about the flipside?

Hi ,
I have been following the thread about putting an upright into a late 
baywindow.  I want to do just the opposite.  I have a good, strong type 4 
engine that I was planning to do an upright conversion and put it into a 
splittie.  I would like to use it in my '71 Deluxe, that I use to commute 
115 miles a day.  I will still use an upright conversion fan shroud but 
what to do with the tranny?  I need to support it for the additional weight 
of the pancake.  Is it possible to use a late bay tranny with the hanger in 
my '71? Thanks

Joy thru Air,
