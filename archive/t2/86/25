Subject: SAPPHIRE XI radio's

Hello,

Yesterday I was able to pick up a really nice SAPPHIRE XI AM radio from a 
local yard...   anyway, I had found this webpage yesterday that listed all 
of the models and what year they went to, but cannot locate it anymore.

It was great, you could see which one should have gone with which model, but 
after searching and searching I could not locate it anymore (dang, I knew I 
should have bookmarked the thing) - anyone know the URL, or happen to know 
which year the SAPPHIRE XI went to?

I have a 76, and it definetly seems like it is an older model year unit, but 
I don't know how much I am off by....

any tips would be appreciatted!

Christopher
76 westy "jasper"
