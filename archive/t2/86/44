Subject: RE: [T2] I got a 74 westy

By looking at this brochure I see that the 74 has an electric fridge in a
similar location as the 73. Any chance this can be swapped into a 73? I know
it would not be an exact match because the 73 is built into the cabinet (I
guess), but are the measurements close. 

If anyone can measure a 74 fridge and let me know, that would be great. I
will measure mine this weekend and maybe I can swap them. I do not like the
stove over the fridge, so I would have to keep the sink over the fridge. 

Has anybody done this? Is this fridge even worth the trouble? Are their
other types of refrigerators that might be a close fit in the hole left by
my ice box? My ice box is okay, but on longer trips it just does not do the
job.

Thanks,
Corbett
