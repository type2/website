Subject: Re: [T2] Need a wheel to steer

I had no problem removing my wheel. Popped off the horn button, removed the big
nut and lifted the wheel off the steering column. Seems the 75 wheel has no taper
to the splines that hold the steering shaft to the wheel. Therefore no binding
between the wheel hub and shaft. I have heard of people putting pressure on the
bottom side of the wheel with their knees and tapping the steering shaft with a
brass or wooden mallet after backing the nut off till the top of the nut is flush
with the end of the steering shaft. I Know this works on F*rds and Ch*vys built in
the 60s and early 70s. They had tapered splines that would lock the wheel to the
shaft. The drawback is possible damage to the steering box! If anyone tries this
please be extreeeemly careful, I've heard the steering box on a bus is quite
expensive and I do not advocate using techniques the German engineers haven't
recommended. But, if no one makes the puller any more, you gotta do what you gotta
do to get the job done sometimes.

Does anyone know what year the splines were changed from tapered to straight or is
my wheel unique? I hope not. I am extremely board with grinding out the rotten
plastic, patching, and sanding, sanding, san............
Thanks,
Tom
Weather looks good for a weekend motor install : )
