Hey VeeDubbers,
I got another rumor i want to have debunked. Thanks to Jim Hood for 
dispelling the last one, in which a neighbor told me "a car battery set on 
concrete will lose its charge quickly." NOT TRUE says Jim.
The other one I had, notably from the same neighbor, is that "the wire 
around your pushrod tubes (retaining wire) doesn't need to be there, just 
throw it away when you take off the valve covers."
Uh, i have seen a number of busses without this wire, probably because it is 
a pain to get in right, but are folks without this wire headed towards some 
kind of disaster?
Okay, also, if anyone else has VW oldwive's tales, lets discuss 'em...
