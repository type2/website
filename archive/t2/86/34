Subject: machine shops in southern new england?

Can anyone recommend an air-cooled friendly machine shop in the CT area?  I
live just outside New Haven, and am going forward with my first teardown and
rebuild of my 1600 DP, and would like to find someone to trust to give me a
qualified opinion of the condition of the case, heads, etc, etc,  I'm
particularly worried about the case because it has an X in the # stamped
below generator, and I've read this could mean it's already been
"reconditioned"

Thanks to all who wrote encouraging words convincing me to actually give
this a shot!
