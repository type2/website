Okay experts can ya set me straight.

I've heard that the reason the platinum plugs don't work well in an old 
points based ignition system is that they have lower internal resistance 
and they don't give the coil a chance to charge or saturate (or something 
like that).

I use Bosch Supers with excellent results and they are cheap. I've tried 
the Bosch Platinums with good results too, they were just more expensive.
