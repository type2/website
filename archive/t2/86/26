Subject: Re: [T2] Front Shift Rod Bushing Replace

I got tired of the hard shifting and excessive rattle in the shift
lever, and did the same, noting that the rear bushings were gone but I
didn't want to pull the rod.  Shifting improved, no more rattles, and I
suspect your shifting may be worse if you did not get that little plate
under the shift lever in the right place to allow 1,2, reverse  gear vs
3,4?
