I tend to second Mark's thoughts, my experience with the Bosch
Platinum has been really varied.  First thing is to say the ONLY car I
ever saw an improvement installing them in mileage wise was my '76,
this was gosh about 10 years ago I guess when they had just come out,
and was really in retrospect probably due to a weak coil.  That is where
they help where the sharp edge helps that coil that is missing 1 in 100
firings or whatever miss in 1 in 500 instead.  No post '80 VW I have ever
put them in with stock electronic ignition has seen a mileage gain and
you'd never see a performance gain you would recognize.  And the foul
out, real easily.  Not so much in an L-jet Bus adjusted to meet emissions
which tends a bit lean but in any with carbs or even worse with something
blowing a lot of oil by the rings into the chamber, foul and won't come
back by themselves with that teeny little electrode.  Now I have run
Autolite (maybe? years ago) with larger tips and they were fine.  But
buck for buck ye old super/copper as long as it is a German made plug
does just fine.  For watercooled the 3 electrode silvers with the full size
center electrode are exceptional, long lasting, maybe a hair of a mileage
gain particularly on a weak system.  They are expensive and although
availble in the 3/4" reach I've never looked to see if they are available in
a proper heat range for the air cooled T4.  My $0.02 anyway.
