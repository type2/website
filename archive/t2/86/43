Subject: Re: [T2] machine shops in southern new england?

I am giving this place my highest recommendation:
Freccia Brothers
246 W. Putnam Ave.
Greenwich, CT 06830
PH: 869-2334
Established 1922
I had an unfortunate incident while returning to Washington, DC from Boston. I got hit pretty bad while on the side of the road just south of Boston. My alternator was not working and I was running on battery power only. Working the AIRS list I was advised of the Freccia Bros as being the best and most honest mechanics in all of CT. I am glad that I had downloaded the AIRS list before I started my trip.
I barely made it to their shop (awesome shop) where they diagnosed my alternator, checked my voltage regulator and charged my battery + spare + cellphone. As well as giving me excellent advice. All free of charge!
I would give them my business any day of the week.
Best regards,
Howie Kafka
