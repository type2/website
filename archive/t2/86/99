Subject: Re: [T2] Oil bottle spout

Most of the FLAPS in my area sell a red plastic spout that also acts as a
shutoff valve. Works great to keep the spills to zero. I just tip the spout
into the filler neck, give it a twist, then the oil goes where it should. If
I don't need the whole quart, I shine a flash light through the bottle and
close the valve when I think enough ha gone in the engine. Great for the
busses that like their oil in liters instead of quarts!
