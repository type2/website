 Can anyone recommend an air-cooled friendly machine shop in the CT area?  I
 live just outside New Haven, and am going forward with my first teardown and
 rebuild of my 1600 DP, and would like to find someone to trust to give me a
 qualified opinion of the condition of the case, heads, etc, etc,  I'm
 particularly worried about the case because it has an X in the # stamped
 below generator, and I've read this could mean it's already been
 "reconditioned"
 
 Thanks to all who wrote encouraging words convincing me to actually give
 this a shot!

Most VW engines are good for 3 or 4 rebuilds during their lives. So you may 
not be in any trouble. I would just find a reputable VW mechanic and get his 
opinion. I don't know about a machine shop in the CT area. I note that you 
are one of those Seinfeld
fans with your Westy's name.
