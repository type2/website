Subject: Re: [T2] Engine install assistance - clarification

In all my engine pulls I have not heard of this but I wanna learn.

To clarify on a late baywindow - say a 1978 like mine - you can remove the 
mustash bar, loosen the mount above the bell housing and tilt the 
drivetrain down leaving the axles and shifter linkage intact?

Sounds good to me...

Does the tranny need to be in neutral or a certain gear for this?

Does this work with the Beetles?
