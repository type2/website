Ummm....  not true! The wire is there because not having it there risks
the pushrod tube popping out of the case. While the odds of a pushrod tube
falling out are low, the result would be catastrophic.  I don't imagine it
would take more than a couple seconds to pump all the oil out of an engine
thru a pushrod port, even by splash alone. With the oil gone, you have a
second or two to shut it down before you need a rebuild.

My take on this is that VW made a bet with every single screw/nut/
bolt/wire they installed.  They were betting that the cost of installing
it was less than the cost of repairing the damage under warrantee.  And
rememeber that the cost of a screw (installed) over the whole of the
production run was probably in the $50,000 range! If you see 3 shroud
screws in a certain piece of tin, there are three because two would not
do.  Engineers and accountants are in constant battle in every
manufacuring shop, worldwide.

Yes, as described above.  Getting back to the $50,000 cost of
installation, distributed over 25K buses/year, they were discussing
whether more than 25 tubes would pop out,  with engine replacement costing
~$2,000/engine, so the expected failure rate may have been as low as .1%,
but if it's *your* engine, well, that's a different story, ain't it?

Oh, my, there are so many!  My personal favorite is, "If you drive a T4
engine bus and your gen light comes on, you can keep going because the fan
is bolted to the end of the crank." This one, too, is absolutley FALSE!
We have had half a dozen cases (one recently) on this list where the fan
hub or bolts sheared off and the fan stopped turning (and cooling the
engine).
