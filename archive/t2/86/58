who the heck knows for sure exactly what the mileage is on MOST of these
buses.  unless you owned it or have records for it's entire life it is
almost always a guess.  I say mine has 305k on it, but I can only verify
105k mysel, but I base it on "good guessing" but it could have sat and
only be 205k or maybe it was driven hard and has 405k...once it passes
100k the mileage has very little effect on value, condition is far far
more important.

all offers are just that "offers to settle" you don't have to accept them
and really shouldn't negotiate.

Maryland (and most other states) include "uninsured insurance" on your
policy so if you get hit by someone with no insurance , your company pays
you...
