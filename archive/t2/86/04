Subject: Need a wheel to steer

Been trying to repair my sun dried steering wheel on my 75 bus. Seems a
lost cause. the more I work on it the more it cracks. If I keep this up
its going to be pure PC7 by the time I'm done. Getting tired of running
in this circle! Does anyone have a steering wheel for a 75 they are
willing to part with for a reasonable price that is in decent condition?

Thanks,
Tom
The Turtlebus will live again
