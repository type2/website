Dont throw that (steel) square headed set screw away.
chances are the one that comes with your new
Brazil (wherever) made shift coupler will be cheesy
(cheap)... I reused the orignal set screw  with
the new shift coupler I bought. I also put lockwire
on the set screw as I am not real fond of crawling
under das bus in das pouring rain to re-tighten the
damn thing when it works loose.
JMHO
