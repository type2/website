I drove one when in Mexico last year.  It took a lot of expensive
long-distance calls from the States and poor use of high school Spanish to
find a car rental agency that still rented them, but I just  had to drive
one!  All of the recent "Mexican" busses are actually Brazilian made, as VW
moved Mexico's bus assembly line to Brazil lock stock and barrel several
years back (and has now discontinued them entirely). They made them
aircooled for the Brazilian market and watercooled (Rabbit engine) for the
Mexican market.  Picture a late 70's bus, but with plastic bumpers and
mirrors similar to those on a Wolfsburg Edition Vanagon, and dash
instrumentation more like a Golf (plus of course a black plastic radiator
grill up front), and you have a rough idea of what it looks like. Somewhere
I have photos; I'll try to post them.

What a treat it was driving a bus with under 20k original miles! It made me
appreciate what my own busses must have driven like, many years before I
owned them, before they were old enough to have any rattles or rough edges.
And I have to admit, it was nice having the power of that watercooled
engine - I actually passed cars with ease on the 2-lane highway!

Too bad they're illegal to import or I'd have taken one home with me!  Oh
well, even if you can't own one, you can have a piece of one; many of the
genuine VW parts I import are actually made for those busses (but
interchange with our old German ones).
