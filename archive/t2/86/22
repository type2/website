>>I did not leap in to volunteer the correct number (232,000). Not
totally honest, but made a big difference in the end. 

p.s. Sorry if I offended any list members with my flexible scruples.<<

i am not personally offended. its your decision & if you can live with it,
then do so.  however, my wallet is offended.  situations like this are just
one of the reasons that insurance rates are so high. & i'm not saying that
just to flame someone, either. i've been through similar situations & felt
that i had to add my .02 on this thread.

to whoever is getting lowballed by an insurance company:

get that bus to an auto body shop that will work on busses & get an estimate.
show the estimates to the insurance company & threaten to sue. might not be
that easy in real life, but in theory thats how it works.

YMMV of course.
