Here's what I found on a website:

14.  WHAT ARE SOME OF THE MYTHS ABOUT BATTERIES?
14.1. Storing a battery on a concrete floor will discharge them.

A hundred years ago when battery cases were made of porous materials
such as wood, storing batteries on concrete floor would accelerate the
discharge.  Modern battery cases are made of polypropylene or hard
rubber.  These cases seal better, so external leakage-causing discharge
is no longer a problem, provided the top of the battery is clean.=20
Temperature stratification within large batteries could accelerate the
internal =93leakage=94 or self-discharge if the battery is sitting on a c=
old
floor in a warm room or is installed in a submarine.
