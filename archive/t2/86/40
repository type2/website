Elizabeth, your first post states that fuel lines were replaced.
You are correct that there should be a new filter.
( Have them cut the old filter open for an exam while you watch ).
If the filter gets plugged, the pump will become noisy when the
stalling problem occurs, this can be verified by connecting a fuel
pressure gauge into the fuel line removed from the cold start valve.
This should produce 35 +/- 3 psi.
Next, Fuel delivery is verified by pumping fuel into a container,
exactly 30 seconds should deliver 500 cc ( 1/2 quart ).
( Open the hose right after the pump, with ignition disabled. )
There may be adequate pressure at idle, and less when the rpm
increases, and this will look like a faulty fuel pressure regulator
when it isn't, it's simply inadequate supply from blockage.
Be sure they installed F.I.hose in the pressure side fuel lines,
insofar as regular fuel line does not support F.I. pressures.
Check for grommets where the fuel hose comes thru the engine tin.
The quick fix ( adequate but not deluxe ) is a slit hose and clamp.
