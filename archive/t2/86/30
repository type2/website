Oh yeah, that's right. Thanks for setting me straight.

(They're not klutzes, they're good professional mechanics...who know that if
they were to bolt the muffler on, you'd just unbolt it when it got a hole in
it and bolt on a new one, but if they weld it on you have to take the car
back and give them $75 to replace it for you. Come now! Hasn't anyone ever
explained upselling to you?)
