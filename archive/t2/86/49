Subject: Shift plate? (was Front Shift Rod Bushing Replace)

>>I got tired of the hard shifting and excessive rattle in the shift lever,
and did the same, noting that the rear bushings were gone but I didn't want
to pull the rod.  Shifting improved, no more rattles, and I suspect your
shifting may be worse if you did not get that little plate under the shift
lever in the right place to allow 1,2, reverse gear vs 3,4?<<

Seems like every response to my idea of replacing the front shift rod
bushing has mentioned the shifting being worse rather than better.  Could
all this be related to the "little plate" you speak of?  I've always known
of a plate down there of some kind and have always wondered if I am missing
something like, as I have never - since I've owned my bus - had to push down
while shifting into reverse; always just a smooth horizontal pull to the
left and smoothly down.  I just always thought I was lucky not to have to
deal with it.  Is this something I really need?
