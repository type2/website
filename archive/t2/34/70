Subject: My 2.0 L has nice big bearing flakes in the sump. :-(

I was sure I'd heard a rod knock at idle with my 1 yr old purchase 79 Westy,
but couldn't quite decide if it was an exhaust leak or whatever. Last night,
in preparation for the Puyallup VW show, the oil was changed, and lo and
behold, nice big flakes (one almost 1/4") of bearing material were lying in
the sump. :-( This engine had just had a top end rebuild, and the P.O. dork
must have not done the bottom end. It's an automatic, so guess what I get to
do this winter? What fun. :-(
Any comments, suggestions, opinions on doing this ? Any chance the mains are
gonna be ok and there is a way to test them? I thought maybe I could luck
out and just redo the rod bearings without splitting the case? (Ha ha, what
wishful thinking). Sorry guys and gals, just had to vent.
Regards,
Courtney
