Subject: How to undercoat a bus?

Hello friends,

My 71 Westy is being painted, two tone in a local paintshop. After that, I
plan to paint the poptop, luggage rack, and undercoat the bottom.

My question is about the undercoating. I have never done this before and
obviously the goal is to keep any part from rusting. I would appreciate how
one might go by. Here are my detailed =) questions:

1. How do you wash the bottom? Is there a better way then shooting from
waterhose and crawl and get wet all the way?
2. What do you do with the original undercoating that is there? I think
keeping the original layer of undercoating would be better since it is
factory tight.
3. What parts should I leave out from undercoating? Moving parts? Fuel,
Cable lines? or Can I undercoat these things? What's the best way to seal
off these so undercoating won't get to it?
4. How do you seal off the side of the van from accidentally spraying? Do I
need masking around the bus or can I get by if I am careful enough?
5. What brand of undercoating(3M maybe?) would you suggest? Do I buy the
spray can or is there some other way I can undercoat? How many cans do you
need? How many layers would you recommend?
6. And finally, is there a place that I can get the undercoating done
professionally? If so, what's the appx. cost?

Thanks always for your valuable suggestions... I don't know what I would do
without you volks!!!

William
