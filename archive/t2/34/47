Hi Volks,
  My 68 Westy has long since lost its poptop.  One of
the previous owners had put in a piece of plexiglass
over the opening and sealed it up good.  It was not a
perfect job, but looks ok.  My problem at the time is
the plexiglass is warping slightly and will need some
extra caulk to reseal the small gaps.
