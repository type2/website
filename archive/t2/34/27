Well, I was a professional mechanic at one time, and every tune up I did
included a compression check. In fact, my standard tune up speech was "I'll
do a compression check which will cost you $2.00 (this was a while ago,
like 1965) and if the compression is okay I'll do a tune up which will be
$xxx. If the compression is low or irregular, we'll decide what to do at
that point." I just wouldn't do a tune up without a compression check
first. No sense in tuning an engine with no compression in one hole.
