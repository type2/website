Subject: White smoke

OK, I looked through the archives, but could not find
the particular problem that I am having with my '73
Sunroof. 1700 engine, Holley double barrel progressive,
009 (yes, I know, bad, bad things, but...) I recently
replaced the right head on the bus. This is the only
thing that I touched other than an all around valve
adjustment. I made no adjustments to the carb. I am
getting white smoke from the tailpipe while idling, but
what's more scary is that when I stop the engine, the
smoke comes out of the fan housing. Also, when I step
on the accelorator, the engine stalls briefly and then
picks up. Any clues?
