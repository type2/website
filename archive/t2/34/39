Yup,, the best thing in the tool box is a compression gauge,, even though I
prefer the leak down tester,,

I had a Late Bay bus come into the shop, that had been in another shop after it
quit in the middle of the intersection right beside their business.

The customer started to accelerate away at a green light,, and hadn't even got
the clutch fully out, when it quit, Bang, No go
He tried the key,, click click click... bummer
the shop was right at that intersection so the crew of mechanics came out and
pushed it in... hmm, I guess it needs a battery,, 
new battery installed,,click click click  nothing,, 
must need new batter cables,,click click click  nothing,
geeez! .. well That PROVES it is the starter!! They sent the starter out to get
it rebuilt as there were no new ones available...  and Talked the customer into
a "tune Up" while it was waiting to get the starter back...
Tune Up done...
Rebuilt starter installed...
click click click  nothing,

NOW the customer started to get upset,, he got into a heated discussion and that
garage decided to tell him to take his car and shove it,, But PAY For it
first,,, 
He ended up paying for the parts only,, would not pay for HIS own starter,, so
they took it off,,,,, 
He had it towed to where I worked,, 

I tried to turn it over by hand using the pulley, and it wouldn't turn, 
I pulled off the rocker cover,, and the spring etc fell out .... the keeper had
come off the stem, the valve had sucked into the cylinder and been shoved back
through the head just north of the guide.

You have to ask,, How can you tune up an air-cooled without setting the
valves????
When I got the engine to look at ,, It had been tuned up by professional North
American mechanics,, they don't adjust valves,,
