Jeremy,

As others have suggested, check:
compression,
vacuum advance.

Anothe cause of gutlessness is a faulty condensor or coil.  The symptoms
for both of these are that the engine runs fine when cold and for 1-3
minutes thereafter, but will not do more than idle or very slight
acceleration after a couple minutes.  In addition, if the condensor is
bad, you will see discoloration at the tip of the points.  Since you say
you had a tune up, the condensor and points *should* be new, but as Tim
said, "tune ups"  often include less than they ought.  If you have a
dwell/tach and timing light, hook them up and see what they say, If not,
they are a far better investment than another tune up and will cost you
about the same.
