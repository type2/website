Subject: Re: [T2] How to undercoat a bus?

You do make a good point. The steps in my bus seemed
ok until I steped on them and light shown through.
What I thought was rusted metal turned out to be
undercoating. I am now in the process of replacing my
steps. Built up undercoating just harbors rust.
undercoating only protects the metal when it is well
adheared to the metal. It gets dangerous when it
starts to flake or bubble up. Six of one half dozen of
the other I guess. Have a great day!
