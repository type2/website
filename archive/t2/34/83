This is a wonderful offer, I have a little over ten years worth of "VW 
Trends" and "hot VWs" Some from June 1988 to December 2000. Most years are 
complete (year) sets, to include some not yet opened. If anyone is 
interested, e-mail me and I will compile an inventory. Make me an offer. 
There are a lot of good stories, information, and techniques to better 
improve you way of doing things. You also pay shipping.
