Subject: CHIPPED CYLINDER FIN ?????

Hey Folks,

Rebuilding a 2000 `76 engine.  Have done it mucho
times...but never had this querry to ponder.  I found
a fellow with an old set of NOS 2000 cylinders for
this bus.  Got them for a song!  Anyhow...as I am
preping to install them I notice one side of the very
top large cylinder fins is chipped.  must have
happended years ago in shipping or something.

Anyhow, talked to my machinist and he said cylinder
can distort when a fin is broken.  I use my micrometer
and checked the cylinder for distortion.  I found
none.  But still worried about constant heating and
cooling and maybe a distortion prob down the road
because of this. 

Any engine gurus out ther have any info or help on
this?

Thanks
