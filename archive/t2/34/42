Hey!
	I have a 76 bus that needs a new head gasket. I had contemplated taking the
engine out, but I am moving from Alameda to Palo Alto and thought it might
be easier to tow the bus to Palo Alto. The only problem is that my mechanic
is too far away. Does anyone know a trustworthy mechanic in the Palo Alto
Area? Or does anyone have the tools to take the engine out? It is a 2000cc
fuel injected.

Thanks!
Cara
