I grew up in a VW dealership during the 70s and 80s. 
I can remember Rusty Jones being sold to every
customer here in Northeastern Wisconsin.  It provided
a lot of revenue for my parents but I can also
remember the fall out when Rusty Jones went belly up
and the warranties associated with the rust proofing
were void. I can also recall rust proofing a few cars
myself and it being THE worst job in the shop, you
always got it on you and brill-o pads were the only
thing that worked at removing it. Incidentley, our
back lot was full of rusted parts cars where the old
rust proofing was the only thing holding a fender to
the car.
