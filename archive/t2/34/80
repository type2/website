Courtney, it is possible but depends on your risk and economic factor. Mains
can be good but you dont know what little pieces might have worked their way
thru the oil galleys. The right way of course is to take it all apart,
inspect and mic all pieces. But sometimes when you dont have enough time or
money you can risk pulling p&c's and replaceing rod bearings without
splitting the case and start saveing money to do the job right. Your
probably on the right track, if the noise is there at idle and goes away
with rpm your looking at big end bearings.
