Max or Alex or anyone,

I have a '79 bus in Seattle with the overhead unit intact.  It's a dealer 
installed after-market unit from some company in Oklahoma.  The entire A/C 
system is there except for the compressor.  A PO just cut the hoses at the 
compressor and removed it.  I don't want the unit (but I want the Bus).  If 
anyone is interested I'd be willing to remove it and make a deal.  Let me 
know.

Ted

'76 & '79 busses
