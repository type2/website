Guys,

You are correct about the compression tester being one of the more
valuable tools in the box....

Most of the examples so far have been vehicles that have been on the road
for quite a few years with problems that have seemed "odd" to start with.

The kind of customer that I saw at the time(1972) were two kinds of
folks...people with 20-60k miles who wanted their cars to run better and
those with  older vw's that needed a rebuild anyway(and they knew it).

The folks with newer cars 20-60k just wanted to get better gas
mileage...seems like gas was the outrageous price of $1.50 at the
time(1972).  They drove in, wanted a "tune-up" and valve adjustment and
then wanted to pick up their car and drive on...

The folks with older vw's just wanted it to run a little longer before
they tried to decide if they could afford a rebuild....lot's of hippie's
driving vw's in those days.

I almost dreaded changing plugs out because about every 10th car would
strip the threads on a head....heavy handed "american" mechanics and
people who used the wrong plugs and hadn't changed them in 20,000 miles.

A lot of these people wanted to move over to Honda or Toyota cause they
got better gas mileage and had an A/C that worked too....You paid about
$1500 over invoice for either of those cars cause of the gas shortage.  
VW's then were "cheap" transportation and people wanted "cheap" tuneups.
I'm "sure" that the folks at the BMW and Mercedes dealerships did a
compression test....they had owners who could afford it.  Would you do a
compression test on a new vw with 8,000 miles that the owner wanted a
tune-up?....probably not.....

I did a lot of driver/owner education in those days about what was needed
and my customers appreciated it.

What we have now is a "select" clientelle who love their vw's for
what they are, not just a good mileage car.  Dr. Tim, I would have loved
to have the kind of customers then that you have now, but what I had were
people who wanted a bargain(tired of vw dealer rates) and still wanted
their cars to run well and get good gas mileage.

I always drove the cars before *and* after working on them to decide if it
ran well...if it didn't, I pulled it back in the shop and found out
why...even if it meant pulling the plugs again and doing a compression
test.

You guys keep doing compression tests...I will too....*now* is a different
time from then...and the people who have VW's now probably take a lot
better tender loving care of their cars than back then.

Cheers, dave
