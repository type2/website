Small wonder everyone's buying Bays.
They're cheaper,have stronger,more powerful running
gear & are heaps more common.
I wish someone would tell HotVW's Magazine though.
I love Samba's & every variety of pre-67 bus,but for
once it would nice to see what someone had done with
the same model as I drive around everyday.
To date I've only seen one bay in HotVW's....a orange
'72 Panel running a 2.0liter with Porsche heads.
A beautiful bus all round.
:-)
Cheers
Andrew Wood.
