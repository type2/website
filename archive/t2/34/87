Subject: Re: [T2] The journey of moisture and a change of heart about undercoating.

I hear you,David.
The undercoating inside the front wheel arches of
baywindows is responsible for more rust than possibly
any other factor with the possible exception of the
battery tray.
My 72 Single Cab has already had one piece of metal
welded into the passenger side wheel arch by a
previous owner & the remaining undercoating has still
let in more water & I'm going to have a fun
time(SARCASM!!) cutting out the rust where it's got
back through the pillar as far as the under tray
compartment.
You're right...there's lots of epoxy paints out there
these days & other products designed to replace the
detrimental stuff VW put on there when they made them.
I wish you good luck with your task.
:-)
Cheers
Andrew Wood
