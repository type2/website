Subject: Heater Cable Adjustment (A Clarification Please)

Howdy All,

First wanted to say thanks for all you advice for the Oil Cooler and Trany
questions. My new tranny is in and tight! Oil cooler is still not hooked up,
but guess I don't need it now until May.

Fall is roaring into Colorado and my 5th annual 'fix your heater before it
snows' event is here. I have spent all day fixing all the air leaks, and
insulating some ducting. I now draw over 138F at the defrosters :)

But, I need help hooking up the cable to theair plenum that splits the heat
from front to back. After messing with it for hours in an ungodly body
position (still getting used to that...), it appears that there is too much
slack in the line at the plenum. The cable has a bent fitting that fit thru
a hole on top of the plenum, then about 1cm cable to a brass fitting, then
about 2-3cm cable until it goes into the housing. The clamp is right at the
end of the housing, but as you actuate the lever from the dash, the cable
slide thru the hole (atop the plenum)freely until the brass fitting hit and
the cable has tension to slide thru the housing.

What gives? Has something fallen off? All I can think of is to take some
more housing and somehow slide it over the end take up the slack, or
otherwise clamp it to the plenum.

Any ideas guys? I can provide pics if my worda failed me.
Not too happy with the VW cabling system. I have the flapper valves wire
open all winter as I busted the main cables and didn't care to buy new ones.
Maybe someday.

Thanks in advance,
