Subject: Re: [T2] There were NEVER any factory ragtop buses

Joe, I think we all understand where you're coming
from & I myself was....gasp!!horror!!...a fan of the
Ford motor company before being converted to the light
as per the gospel acoording to Volkswagon.
Yeah, compared to other makes,ragtop even confused me
as I'd identified it with convertables not sunroofs.
But I mean,Really!!
This is not about terms...we were trying to help out a
guy with some ideas for his bus.
And if we use different terms it's because we ARE into
VW's, not other makes.
And as for slagging off at the VW motoring press,I've
read magazines on hotrods & other enthusiast cars &
the slang they use is nothing short of ridiculous!
Remember,the whole attraction of VW's is they appeal
to almost everyone & so the magazines cater to a wide
field.
They don't & shouldn't read like a nuclear physics
journal....& to be frank journals like that have more
jargon than VW mags & the jargon is MUCH harder to
work out.
You worked out that we were talking about sunroofs
pretty early on.
If you think the mags cater to the lowest common
denominator,don't buy them, but they play a large part
in keeping the VW community together.
Remember,we're enthusiasts....i.e.enthusiastic about
VWs.
So please forgive us if we like to invent terms that
expresses that enthusiasm....every other little
enthusiast movement does & VW showed most of them they
way.
:-)
Cheers
