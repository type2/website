Subject: Sliding door

Hello,

  I have a 1978 Westfalia and the sliding door has some wrinkles in it
and bondo on the bottom portion of the door.  I found a fellow that has
a 1973 Westfalia that he is parting out.  His sliding door is in much
better shape than mine.  He wants $100.00 for the whole door including
door lock, handles and the jalousie window (don't really need the
jalousie window, but it will give me a spare). My question is, are the
sliding doors interchangable between these years?


thank you,
Greg
