Subject: heater box flaps

Like many, i've got my own best-laid plan for heat
this winter...

The heater cables are long gone, but most of the rest
of the system is intact and heater boxes solid.

Question: Which way is OPEN. Is it when the levers on
the flaps are being pulled FORWARD? (That's my guess.)

My flash of genius: I'm going to lock the flaps in the
OPEN position--whatever that is. Then, when i need
heat, I'll push the heat up to the front by turning on
a pair of 12v blowers that the f.o. hung in the engine
compart (but never connected).

I'm figuring that with the blowers off, the heat will
just stay back there or at least not be a problem in
winter weather.

Yes, I'm going to take a shot at insulating the duct
work and the cab as best I can.
