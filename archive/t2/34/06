Tim,

Give it a break....you seem to be talking about what you get when you take
a 2001 american car in for a "tune-up".  about the only thing that is
going to happen is it gets hooked up to a diagnostic machine after new
plugs are inserted.

No professional mechanic I know of offers a "tuneup" which includes a
compression test.  A "tune-up" is an American term which means you change
the plugs, put new points/condenser in, and look over the other parts and 
see if they are worn enough to try and convince some one who only wanted
spend a minimum amount of money that their car needs it.. Maybe change
the oil in the oil bath cleaner.


*Owner's* who are interested, do what you are talking about, not folks who
do mechanic work for a living.  A mechanic will listen to the car before a
tuneup is done and think about how it sounds...maybe ask/tell the owner
that it doesn't sound too good and would they want to pay for a
compression test.  Generally, most owner's would not....if it is really
getting bad, they don't want to know about it until it breaks or uses a
quart of oil every 200 miles at which time, they will trade it in on a new
car if they can possibly afford it.

If they guy says "professionally" tuned it generally means that he took it
to someone with a certification sign out front instead of his
neighborhood grease rack.

...sorry about the rant....

I have been in the mechanic business and *no one*
would pay me for compression test unless they knew enough about
engines to ask for one...in which case, they probably did their own
compression test.

Cheers, dave
