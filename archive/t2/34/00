Subject: Report on free '74 Camper in Philadephia


This afternoon I checked out the Philly free 74 Westy.  160k mi.
The Good- only 2 bubbled areas under the windshield, one starting on
rear hatch.  No overpowering odors of mouse nests, but a bit musty from
water leaking in. Doors OK, sliding door was welded at bottom.  No dents
but one under fender well on driver side.  Tight steering, tight CV
joints.
The metal under the rear engine hatch seems sound; many are rotting
there. Hatch is fine as is the rear access door.  Frame good (axle
housings, rear jack points, floor).  Camper stuff all there.  Front
doors ok.  Rear brake plates very sound. Fibergass top / rack moldy but
see no cracks.  Clutch disk laying in the back was dry, bell housing not
all oily.
   The bad- front axle rotted at torsion tube housings on each side;
it's at the bottoms.  Upper ball joints exposed (very little seals
left).  Steering box leaking.  Brake disks very rusty (sat 2 years). 
All seals on windows very cracked; water has been leaking inside the
front doors and wrecking the paneling.  Water has leaked through rear
vent window on driver side and swelled/stained the paneling below. 
Front seats have padding missing, rear bed cushion rather stained on
top.  Forget the poptop canvas. Dash has a "crunched" area above the
radio area.  Step areas rusted out; front floor still intact.
Front jack points rotted.  Rockers rather bad; you can see the front
sink closet through the rot in the wheel well. Passenger side wheel well
rotten horizontally at the top.  The sliding door tack at the bottom has
some rustthrough starting at the front.  Battery tray needs replacing.
No rear bumper.  Trans upper bolts removed so it's hanging and stressing
the shift coupling. Trans leaking around nose cone joint bolts.  The
engine is dismantled (he said heads ok, but was going to replace a
piston?? )
   I have first shot to take it and would part it out, too much body
work but could be used in a state where rust is not bothered with. I
don't know if the rot around front torsion tube housings can be welded
or if front axle must be replaced.  It's wouldn't pass inspection as it
is. I can use the trans for a 75 bus, and would take the interior camper
stuff and possibly rear backing plates.  If you feel that you want this
to rescue, let me know.
