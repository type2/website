Subject: Re: [T2] The journey of moisture and a change of heart about

One more thought on this undercoating failure sit- com.

The reason the stuff failed, is because the owner's of the vehicle's
didn't inspect, and maintain the undercoating, that is prone to rock and
other damage, in it's journey though its life span.

Get a rock mark or chip in it, it will collect moisture, and sure it's
going to rust.

Don't blame the substance that was applied---blame the procrastinating
owner for not staying on top ( or bottom in this case ) of the
situation.

If you didn't ever wash or wax the upper body--ever on your vehicle, how
long do you think it would last?

This subject relates to anything else----no maintenance---no longevity.
