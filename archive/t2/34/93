Whoa !!-----
You guys are implicating that undercoating is detrimental to you
vehicles?
I am going to disagree big time on this one.
You talk of your busses as they were just fresh off the line, and
prematurly rotting.

I'm laughing my butt off thinking at how lame this thought is.

How long do you think your vehicles would have lasted with just the
robotic blast of paint on your vehicle's under belly?

Not long, if you lived in the rust belt.

If nothing else, whatever undercoating that is there, flaking off,
retarded the situation that you are now finding.

How old are your vehicles?

25----30 years old?

Oh yea, one more finding here.

The thought of stripping the remaining good factory finish, "One square
at a time", is not very wise.
Repair what has to be repaired, and leave well enough alone.
Use the hobbist POR-15 on the area's repaired, and then cover the bottom
with whatever else you choose.
Nothing is tougher than the factory finish.

I thought this whole thread was really funny, and good for several
laughs, as I had just ordered a 5 gallon pail of cosmoline for the
bottom's and the inner panels of all my vehicles, and then I'm seeing
"Don't undercoat your bus"--

It's undercoat or rust--it's that simple.
