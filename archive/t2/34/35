Subject: Gettin' rid of a bus

I sent out a letter a few weeks ago about getting rid of my bus, and I'm
finally ready to get rid of it.  I will probably have it gone by early next
week.

Does anyone want it?  It is pretty much stripped of everything so don't
expect much more than a shell.	However, if you're looking for a descent
shell with not too much rust, this could be a good candidate.

It's a 76 westy and it still has the top.  It also still has it's wheels
on, but I will probably be taking the front brake calipers.  I will also be
taking the front steering box.

It is free to anyone that wants to take it.  email me if you're interested.
 I live in long beach, CA

later,
mike
