Subject: RE: [T2] heater box flaps

Glen, the flappers open when they are pulled forward. I have found two zip
ties per side usually do the trick. I also use a kinda of metal duct tape
(Home Depot has it in their ductwork sections) to cover the mushroom cap.
Mine allowed to much valuable heat past when open. I got a much better flow.
Also check were the tubes meet going forward in the 'Y'. Mine was completely
rested out. Again metal duct tape. I insulated mine kustom(tm) center tube
(6" Metal ducting closed together with sheet metal screws) with R-6 duct
wrap (5.99 at the depot)and again with r-3 self adheasive foam wrap (for a
bit a weather tightness). I'm not convinced this is a weather proof
solutions, but I have lots more try again. I'll also probably make a belly
pan from alumnium sheeting to cover it soon.

Don't expect the heat to 'stay back there. It's gets damn hot in the cab on
the highway, but I can always roll down a window. I have found that the Aux
blower(s) is really only good while sitting in traffic. I usually don't have
mine installed until it gets REAL COLD. I guess every little bit helps.

I can pass on any pictures that might help.

Off to camp in the cold mountains of Colorado. Wish me luck!
