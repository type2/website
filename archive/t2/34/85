Hi,
Yeah, I've heard that track...
"I'm  rockin' the suburbs,just like Jon Bon Jovi did,
I'm rockin' the suburbs, 'cept that he was
talented..."
The big question is was he:-)
For all you bus fans out there check out Blink 182's
new clip for the song "A First Date".
It features a red/white 23 window Samba!!
Very,Very Cool!
I saw it the other night & was mesmerised:-)
Cheers
