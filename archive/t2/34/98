ISSUE "All About VW Performance Engines" This is the "Step-By-Step Engine 
Assembly Guide" it is 148 pages, with tips and tricks on how to build a 60hp 
Stock 1600cc, to a 400hp Turbo Drag Motor, and many other motors in between. 
It was $7.00 brand new and is still close to mint condition now. I will only 
let this one go for $20.00 by itself. All the rest go as a set. Make me an 
offer. You pay shipping.
