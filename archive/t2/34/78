Yeah, and out here in west TX they are selling for $4500 
"restored"....which means fresh paint, interior, and engine...not 
neccessarily stock. That's mostly for campers...but sometimes not! 
Don't know what Splitties sell for here as there aren't ever any for 
sale. Only ones around are in barns or fields. But the Bays are VERY 
poplular and seem to be getting more and more popular.
