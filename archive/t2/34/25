Subject: Re: [T2] How to undercoat a bus?

My Beetle had hidden rot just like you mentioned.

Under the undercoating I had rot.

In the bare places (had worn off, thin coats there I suspect) it was clean 
and rust free.

My bus is exactly the same - rot under heavy undercoating, clean paint 
where there is no coating.

The peeling is catching moisture and holding it there.

WAXOYL is my favorite.

Ciao!
