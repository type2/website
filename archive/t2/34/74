Rivera (ASI) used pretty much Americanized RV parts, for side windows, and 
other stuff.  The side windows in my 69' don't have any markings in the glass 
or on the frame, as far as I've seen.  I did see a set in my local wrecking 
yard and I'll try to check them out next weekend.  
     On a sadder note, while walking about this yard, I stopped to check out 
the crusher plie.  Alas, I notice a 63' Kombi, a 59ish Panel, and about 8 
baywindows.  The splitties were pretty much wasted  and stripped, but I sure 
hated to see'm go.
