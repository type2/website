OK, first: only 74 Cal, 75, 76 up to the end of 12/75, and 79 Cal FI buses use
a dual vacuum dist. If you are referring to 1/76 to the end of 78 and 79 Fed
buses, yes, they time at 7.5 before. This is because they have a single vacuum
advance.

You are not connecting your vacuum line right if you get advance at idle.
MANIFOLD vacuum, that is vacuum at IDLE, goes to the RETARD side. The retard
side is the inboard nipple, the nipple that points towards the body of the
dizzy. With full vacuum AT idle you set your timing at 10 before. If you do
not connect the vacuum, then set it at 7.5 before. Here are the specs on your
dizzy IF you have a 74 Fed model:

Bus & Pickup 1974 * 1800 Manual Trans Dual Carbs

Note: Bosch lists this application as Federal Models Only

Distributor: VW 021-905-205N, Bosch 0231 181 005
Can Use: VW 021-905-205J, Bosch 0231 173 009 or 010
Timing Set At:: 10deg ATDC (-at-) 800-950rpm w/strobe, vacuum hose(s) connected
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 7-12deg Adv, 16-18deg Ret; Centrifugal: 9-14deg
(-at-) 2000rpm, 21-25deg (-at-) 3400 rpm

See the next to last line? 16-18 deg retard. That is at idle with vacuum
connected. If you have it at 10 after and disconnect the line, it MUST go to
6-8 before. If it does not, you have 4 things wrong:
1) no vacuum
2) a leaking vacuum unit
3) a frozen breaker plate
4) the wrong vacuum unit

In regards to 4, you should have a 07 115 vacuum unit. However, you will not
find that number anywhere on it. You will find a 3 digit number on the arm of
it. It should be 953. If you do not get 16-18 degrees of retard AND you do not
have a 953 vacuum unit, you got burned with a
one-size-maybe-fits-a-bunch-of-different-applications. You did not get the
correct 'rebuilt' dizzy for your engine.

Ported vacuum is vacuum that ONLY appears after you open the throttle. Ported
vacuum goes to the outer nipple, the advance side.

One way of testing your advance/retard specs is to set the timing at idle to
10 before with NO hoses on. Take the manifold vac line and connect it to the
advance side. Read timing. It should be 17-22 before. Disconnect it and it
should go back to 10 before. Connect it to the retard side. Read timing. It
should read 6-8 after.
