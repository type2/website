Subject: Brakes squeal after 15 mins.

I eliminated all the suspects with my squealing brakes and I believe the
flexible brake hoses have deteriorated.  It wasn't a problem with my old
rotors and pads but the clearances with the new parts revealed a problem
with the hose.

What brand should I be shopping for?

Also, If I have to replace these hoses and bleed the system, what else in
the fluid part of the brake system is worth replacing at this time?
