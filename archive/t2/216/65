Subject: Re: [T2] how high?

To get my 74 1800 out from under the Bus, I used tw 8x8's, plus is just
need a squeeker more, so I layed two additional 2x4's on top of the
8x8's--plenty of room for the trans jack to drop and slide her out of
there--with 3 inches to spare --the carbs just squeeked out from under
the bus--

I hate cramped area's--especially while laying on you back and eating
whatever falls in your face---:>)

How high do I have to jack up the bus to be able to get the
engine/tranny combo out? I am not sure my jack will go up high enough. 
What year? From '71 down you don't have to jack at all. From '72 up, I
think that you can get sufficient height by jacking with the stock jack
and putting 2X8s under the back tires. If you can't get it high enough
with the jack on the ground, you can always put a couple of 2X8s under
the jack. Make sure the 2x8s are wider than the height at which you are
supporting the jack bottom. Otherwise it's dangerously tippy!
