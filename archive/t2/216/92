Subject: Oil cooler leak / Trip report

Skip to the end for the questions.

This last weekend my Wife and I took our '77 Riviera down to LA from
Sacramento. We took the 1 down along the coast to get the nice views. It
took a lot longer, but was well worth it. However, about half way there
the oil pressure dropped and the oil light flicked on briefly as I was
rounding a corner. I checked it and was about 2 quarts low, with oil all
over the inside of the engine bay and the back of the bus! The oil cooler
had sprung a leak!

I monitored the oil loss for the rest of the trip, and it progressively 
got worse. Before we got to LA we where loosing a quart every 100 miles. I 
debated seriously on pullig the engine in LA, but decided that it would be 
better to limp it home where I wouldn't have to do a rush job. We made it 
back up to Sacramento in good time, but where loosing 2 quarts every 100 
miles! Oil pressure was good the whole rest of the trip though, and the 
engine ran nice and cool.

So I guess now I will have to pull my engine, which really means I will 
have to clean the garage first! Not sure which job is bigger. ;)

My plan is to pull the engine, and then pull the cooler and take it down 
to a shop and have it pressure tested. If it tests okay then I will 
remount it with new gaskets and hope for the best. If not then I will 
replace it.

Should I just replace the oil cooler anyway while I have it off? Any
advice on doing the job?

Thanks,
-Nick
