Subject: Re: [T2] Dometic fridge in 78-79

My dometic 182 quit permanently on me... but it has been noted that an 
added fan(s) (internal as well) does have benefits.  I replaced mine 
with a dometic sc3000 and it also benefits from a fan blowing on the 
apparatus on the back.  While rolling I use the 12V but  i use it 
through a  connection to an aux batt that stays on while i am  parked.  
When i reach site i  switch to gas.  Before putting anything into the 
fridge it really helps if it is already  cooled down.  I start mine off 
several hours early on the ac connection and then add what i am putting 
into it.
