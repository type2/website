Subject: died half way on trip


73 Bus, single carb ..mech. fuel pump.

Well it died in Indiana so I jumped a wire from the battery to the coil and it ran fine until I reached my friends house in Springfield Illinois. Well within 5 min. of it anyway. This time it would not start. So we unhooked the gas line before the fuel filter he watched well I turned the key. No Fuel.
again. No fuel.
We towed it to his place.
Tried it again and fuel poured out.

So do fuel pumps work speradicly sometimes on there way out?

And where do I find a tool to remove those odd star shaped bolts that hold the pump on?
