Another approach is to use 5-gallon plastic carboys like are used in
science labs.  These are big poly jugs with a 3 inch or so fill opening
and a tap at the bottom.  You can secure them next to a sink to provide a
pumpless source of water.  They can be refilled in place with a hose or
easily carried to a source of water.
