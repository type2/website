Moght I suggest that not only do you get the Haynes manual, but that you 
also purchase a copy of Phillip K. Smith's "The Scientific Design of 
Exhaust and Intake Systems" (SDEIS).

The internal combustion engine is a well studied device and without the 
formulas, you'll easily burn up the cost of all research tomes available 
by buying unnecessary parts. (And believe me, Weber parts are not 
cheap.) Smith's book gives one the formulae necessary to get it v. close 
the first time.

SDEIS is the first book I reach for when considering any custom intake 
or exhaust project.

"This is one of the best-selling technical books in its field. For 
years, engineers, engine designers, high-performance tuners and racers 
have depended on this book to help maximize their engines' potential. 
Dr. John C. Morrison is one of the foremost authorities on the analysis 
of the induction and exhaust processes of high-speed engines. Together 
with Philip Smith, he gives a thorough explanation of the physics that 
govern the behavior of gases as they pass through an engine, and the 
theories and practical research methods used in designing more efficient 
induction manifolds and exhaust systems, for both competition and street 
use. An outstanding, authoritative book."

Shoot... You can even get it from WalMart now...

Curious...  Used their (WalMart's) search engine...

Haynes Weber book, $11.94
HPs Weber book, $11.31
Vanagon Bentley, $69 and change...

Wonder who they're partnered with?
