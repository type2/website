John is definitely correct.  The Dellorto manual by CB Performance also 
claims that with one venturi per runner, carburation is ideal and no 
balance tube is needed.  Their logic sounds reasonable and I don't see how 
any improvement could be made by connecting the four plenums together.  I 
suppose you could do it with four one-way valves with no ill effect, but 
that's a bunch of work so I've left mine connected to a single cylinder.
