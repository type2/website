The culprit has been found.
  (note i still have the problem of extremely  slow over ridges but at 
least i dont start thinking of getting out and pushing it over)
Was looking at one of the links you gave and  with  the  fuel injection 
charts in front of me it became very obvious i had forgotten to check a 
very basic step.  THE FREAKIN ACCELERATOR CABLE adjustment!!!
  As I nominate myself  for the dummy check award.
  It had somehow  worked almost 3/8 inch of play. That is a lot of pedal 
i wasnt getting.

step 3 should be in all trouble shooting charts,  I now know how easy it 
is to overlook something that should be obvious.
