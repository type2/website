Matthew,
   I had a "77 bus for 20 years and never jacked the bus to remove the 
engine.  Rirst remove the rear bumper, then remove the exhaust system from 
the engine.  Now remove the engine and take it off your jack and lay it on 
the ground.  Roll the bus forward from over the engine.  You may have to 
lift the rear of the bus just a little to clear the top of the engine.
