There is another trick that can be used, if you can get dry ice. Freeze
everything you can and load up an ordinary picnic ice chest with frozen
goods, then put the dry ice on top, and a towel or something over that (lids
on ice chests usually have pretty poor insulation). That dry ice will
probably maybe four days, and it will get the food in the freezer SO cold
that even when the dry ice is long gone, it may still remain frozen for
days. The best part is that there is no melted icewater mess to deal with,
and as you take each frozen food item out to use, you can put it in to the
refrigerator, which will help to cool down the rest of the fresh food and
take the load off your refrigerator. Jan B
