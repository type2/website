Subject: Re: [T2] '78 Bus - Engine dies when turning left

I worked on a friend's 77 westy that had similar symptoms. The cause in that 
case was garbage in the fuel tank that, when he cornered, was forced to the 
right side of the tank and covered the outlet. It took a bit of investigation 
to figure it out, but when I tapped into the fuel ring with a pressure gauge, 
I could watch the pressure drop everytime he made the left turn. I rode in 
the back of the bus with the gauge as he drove. His bus had sat for several 
years so the rust and scale had broken loose and needed to be cleaned out. 
Might be worthwhile to check out,
