I would bonk them to spec. This is the first I've heard of such a problem. 
I might question the source. Could be someone knocked a few on the floor. I 
consider it an anomaly until more evidence says otherwise.

Also, Bosch plugs have the gap shown on the box, and W8CC's won't have the 
same gap as WR8CC's. Rule of thumb, to be sure, always verify.
