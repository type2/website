Mark,

Inside the tank is a metal bowl at the right side that traps the fuel to
prevent this very situation:

However, if there is any unwanted junk in there, the bowl also helps to keep
it close to the fuel pickup and fuel line.

I'm not sure what the exact fuel pressure is like coming from the fuel
return line via the pressure regulator but I it must create a cauldron in
that little bowl.  When my pickup line was clogged I hooked up a spare gas
can to get the bus started.  To my surprise it sucked a 2 gal tank gas can
dry in about 4 minutes and I filled up the clogged tank some more. Doh!

In this next picture which I adjusted for max. contrast, you can see the
pickup and return outlets.  They aren't very big.

It's also conceivable that the bowl has partially rusted away and is letting
the fuel slosh around.  Last week the local vw junk yard had three tanks.
This week, none: original gas tanks are dying all the time.

One can only imagine what's actually going on inside your tank.
