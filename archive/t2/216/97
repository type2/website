don't know how large a town or city your in but I have had good luck
finding odd size hose at a place that fixes heavy industrial machinery and
trucks and construction equipment.

locally here in Baltimore I go to Langsdale Holtzman they have everything,
fair prices too, although the guy who needs a hyd hose for his fire truck
is likely to get priority over you
