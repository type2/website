Dave et al:

79 cal engine f.i. catches, won't continue to run.

suspicion: lack of proper voltage to fuel pump in the #2 key postion.

double relay tested ok, replaced with another anyway.
afm tested ok, replaced with another anyway.
recharged battery to 13.6, 440 cca, cleaned.
(thanks Dok)

whats happening: key in #2 postion, move the afm airflap with my hand, d-relay switches on/off probably 10-20 time per second, very fast swinger.

I have 12 volts to the afm, seems to drop to 8 when I move the airflap. Having charged the battery and tested both the d-relay and afm, I now suspect high resistance in the wiring from the afm signal to the fuel pump, not providing enough voltage to keep the relay closed.

Would anyone concur/disagree?

I have another f.i. loom I could substitute also.

Please for the love of God.

two weeks sittin',

Billy
