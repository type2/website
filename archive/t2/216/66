Subject: Re: [T2] how high?

I did my '73 a little different. I removed the bumper,
exhaust system, and carburator first. Then, I lowered
the engine down on the jack, set the engine on the
floor (with a little help from my friends) and rolled
the van forward, over the engine. That may have been
the hard way, but I didn't like the idea of supporting
all that weight of the engine on those fragile exhaust
studs.                            -Paul
