Subject: Brake Regulator Problems.

I have a 71 bus, and am in the process of restoration. I recently have
started replacing the brake line, and have run into a snag: The regulator
(I suppose that's what it is) that is connected to the servo through a
brake line, then junctions off towards the back of the bus needs to be
taken off. I started to take this off, and got the first of the two bolts
(which are bolted to the frame) off, but the second one keeps turning
without coming off. What gives? On the other side of the frame (on the
inside of the wheel well under the driver), there is a small hole. I
tried to put a screwdriver in this to stabilize the nut on the inside of
the frame, but didn't work. what should I do?  If I cut the bolt off,
what happens when I go to replace it?  Is there a special tool that I
need?
