If you go this route, do use a grinder or round file to knock off the=20
chunks and match the ports up. Some of those spacers don't match well at=20
all. Then polish the insides with 320-360 grit. You want a matte finish,=20
not a mirror finish, so as to reduce fuel condensing on the surface.

This port matching does not have to be with pinned flanges and precise=20
tolerance. What is intended is to reduce air flow friction and eddies=20
developing behind edges and the ridges and canyons in the cast surfaces. On=
=20
some (most) aftermarket manifolds and spacers, these can be extreme, and=20
guarantee such poor balance that no dual carb setup could be tuned for=20
clean running.

Use the flange and carb base gaskets to scribe the parts and your matching=
=20
will improve flow. You get a much better balanced loading of the cylinders,=
=20
higher efficiency, promoting excellent function and long life. One of the=20
many refinements on my 912, which runs so smooth, it's scary. With Weber 40=
=20
IDF's, no chokes, 40=B0F, dead cold, it will start and idle at less than 300=
=20
rpm, and take several minutes to warm and rise to stock 600-800. No motor=20
exists that will benefit from refining balance than the opposed 4 cylinder,=
=20
except probably the opposed 2 cylinder.
