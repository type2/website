mine is also a daily driver and I have taken it from Baltimore to Maine,
New Hampshire and Vermont in winter several times..but I needed to make an
emergency business trip last week and couldn't get plane or train
reservations so with having just put new heads on my van I made the

get as comfortable as my bus)

didn't see many type 2's but last Sunday (21st) I saw several bays headed
east on New York route 17 between Binghamton and Elmira was there a get
together up that way???  found myself waving, but no one waved back and I
felt so alone on the road.
