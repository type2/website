Subject: Broken cylinder stud, 2000 miles later

Well, after our little mishap in Paradise (Utah) we replaced the broken
stud and continued on our vacation.  Of course, not having pulled the top
tin to check the upper studs I kept a sharp ear out for odd noises.  When
one is doing this, hearing odd noises is virtually assured!

After getting home, I immediately had to start commuting to Occidental
College to work on a physics seminar, so I didn't get a chance to check
anything.  Still kept an ear out on the freeway commute and still heard
undefinable (and possibly imaginary) noises.

This weekend I finally had some time to look at the bus and it was due for
its 2000 mile valve adjustment and oil change.

I popped the valve covers, halfway expecting the worst, but all studs were
in place and tight.  Checked the valves and none needed adjustment.

Funny how your brain can play games with you if you let it.

George
