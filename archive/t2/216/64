Personally i have never  known a mechanical fuel pump to go intermittant 
like your describing. I would look for blockage either in the tank or 
the lines.  There  also is  an explanation that might make your 
mysterious intermitant pump. Was the gas tank fuel level (relative to 
the fuel pump) different  on the two  different tries?  If  the level  
was higher than the pump then you on the try that works you may actually 
be just getting siphon activity and the pump may actually be bad.
