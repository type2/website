There is this one more thing that I failed to mention.
There is a guy on the Vanagon list that used a big magnet on his Type IV
strainer plate during the engine break in and runs it all the time stuck
to the strainer plate.
I found a Winchester computer drive that had two very nice and very
strong magnets that I removed and have used on the strainer plate since
day one of my new engine. They just hang there and have never blown off
even in torrential rain storms when I thought they would wash off from
wheel splash.
Every time I remove the strainer plate I find magnetic particles clinging
to the plate.
I've seen the sludge that normally accumulates to the strainer plates
over the past eight years of running a Type IV engine but the magnets
seem to collect a fair supply of magnetic material over and above the
standard sludge that is found there.
I can't say if it is small particles that continuously pass through the
filter or large particles that are just in the path and get anchored
there.
I can't explain the engineering or the per chance accumulation since the
steel strainer plate is separated from the oil pickup by the aluminum
strainer disk. That means that all of the metallic particles have to come
through the tiny clearance between the aluminum disk and the threaded
mounted stud.
The migration of these metallic particles must be gradual and since there
isn't actually any oil flow to carry them back into the system they just
stay there.
I can't say that this has made any difference in maintaining the like new
oil pressure but I know that I get some metallic particles out with every
three thousand mile oil change (I always change my oil through the
strainer plate, seen too many stripped oil plugs).
So figure it out and tell me if its snake oil or just a practical
preventive maintenance procedure.
The whole shooting match and the Winchester Drive magnets was free so I
just went along with it and don't see the harm in removing a few abrasive
particles from my oil, even if its just a tiny bit with each oil change.
Most computer hard drives, even the 3.5" have two very strong magnets in
them so if you decide to give this a try, just get revenge on that failed
drive and steal its magnets. No need to look for antique Winchester
drives.
