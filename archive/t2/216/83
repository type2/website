Subject: Oil temps and FMBC thanks

I have asked about oil temps before and have gotten so many different answers
ranging from "oil temp should be AT LEAST 210*.." to "best range is
180-200*.."
So, here is a VERY specific question I would like to ask the EXPERTS:
On my way home from HCBF (thanks Buddah!) I was driving my 71 Westy (1600 DP)
through the mountains of Virginia, Tennessee, and Kentucky. Outside air temps
were HOT like 94* fahrenheit. When I would cruise the bus at 55 MPH the oil
temp hovered right around 220*.  On the long uphills it would goto about 225*
or if i tried to push it to 60 MPH, it would also climb to about 225*. So is
220* too hot for my 1600 DP?? (normal day-to-day in outside temperature below
80*, the oil temp seldom reaches 200*, usually hangs out about 195*.)
The bus ran great the whole time, 10 hours one way! My only concern was engine
temp, so I'd like to know once and for all if I should be concerned about
this.
On a different note, thanks to everyone who made HCBF such a great time. I
think the only people who had more fun than me were my kids! Big Thanks to
Buddah for organizing. Thanks to Sheila, Ian, Shawn, and Nova Janes for
keeping an eye on my son Ben when he came to visit. Thanks to Michelle and
Scott from Atlanta for bringing their kids around to play with the boys,
Thanks to Frank's daughter Breann (sp?) for keeping Dillon out of trouble,
thanks to all the OVT gang who camped with us (Who built that fire?), and
everyone else for a GREAT time!
Peace, John Baker
