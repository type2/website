I am celebrating. 
You just can't know at the pleasure it gives me to pull those hills and
go into those head winds and see the oil temperature and oil pressure
remain virtually the same for hours on end.
Rebuilders will never guarantee the oil pressure that you're going to
have because that don't know. Its just every once in a while that all the
VW pieces fit well enough to give you a blue printed engine rather than
just a rebuild. 
This is a matter of chance if you don't have a rack full of crankshafts,
a few pallets full of cases and a few dozen rod sets to work from.
I've been lucky so far and have built several engines that come up to my
expectitations.
