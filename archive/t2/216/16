Subject: fuel injection questions type 4 cv engine

Any experts on this?
Everything I know about jtronic injection leads me to believe I am 
looking at something with the injection system
a. timing is correct/points and all check okay
b. fuel pressures good
c. compression checks good

Problem is when i go up in elevation above about 7000 feet there is a 
definate loss of performance.  I am suspecting air/fuel mixture.  
Computer check of air/fuel says this is good too.  What is the actual 
sense positions that the jtronic on the 82 vanagon cv engine uses.  Is 
there a sensor signal that i am maybe overlooking?
Or is there something i should recheck with different parameters?
thanks
