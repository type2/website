Subject: Update.......thanks everyone!

Hello all,
	You probly recognize the name as the one who is dealing with the 78 FI
wiring issue. Well, I ordered the Bentley manual (which the vw shop didn't
have) and will take it to him to use because I still don't have enough time
on my hands to get it done.  That's unfortunate because I would really like
to learn it.  I am sure ill run into wiring stuff again down the road
though.  A big thanks goes out to all those who gave me information to help
me out.
	Also, since it's Friday, I updated my webpage today to include a full host
of pictures on my 78 T2.  Pics include interior, exterior, and engine.  You
can check them out here.  www.geocities.com/calivw78 Right now the homepage
is loading kinda slow but please be patient.  I am redoing the page with
smaller files that I should have uploaded by the end of the weekend.  Also,
I have not put links to go back to my hompage yet. I was more concentrating
on just making the pics available, then find tune the page later.  Just use
the back button to go back to my home page.  Thanks again to all.

Troy S Wical
