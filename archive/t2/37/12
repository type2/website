Happy weekend, all!

I have a 1974 Riviera Day Camper and I want to put in a decent radio/tape
player. Are there any specs on the size/type of unit I should get-- I don't
know too much about these things--such as shaft mount, DIN size, etc? I just
want something that will fit the stock opening.

TIA,
Dave
