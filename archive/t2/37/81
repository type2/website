Subject: case switch, transplant



Im switching cases on my type 4 engine, the old one got cracked pretty
bad. Is it possible to transplant the crankshaft, pistons, and flywheel as
one
unit, or must they be disassembled to switch them into the new
case? Thinking about it, it seems to make sense and save a step or
two..... but something tells me its not a good idea...
