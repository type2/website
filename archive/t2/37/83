Subject: Buying a van with 180,000...

Hi,

I'm still looking at vans...I saw an 83 the other day that is in beautiful
condition, no rust, clean, engine rebuilt 6k miles ago (it is water cooled
however). A mechanic friend of mine went to look at it with me and thinks
it is way too many miles, despite the good care. I'm under the impression
that with the body, etc looking so great things are replaceable otherwise
(bearings, etc.). It also has a new clutch assembly. I think the previous
owner did most of the work. It had two long term owners, and then this
young couple for a short time. They seem to be very careful with it.

Anyway, any comments for or against this many miles and what to be wary
of?

Compression test is good too....

Thanks,

Andree
