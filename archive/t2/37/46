Subject: rear table and leg from a 76, for sale in bay area

Hello listmembers,

I have a read table with leg from a 76 westfalia, that I do not need and
would sell, but I am
not shipping the thing anyplace. I will accept $60 for it if you come pick
it up, in san francisco or
san burno - whichever is closer for you. (depending on the time of day you
can pick it up)

Would also trade it for a stool from a deluxe, if you had an extra for some
odd reason. =)

Regards,
Christopher
76 westy "jasper"
