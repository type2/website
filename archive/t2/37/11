Subject: The 229,500mi bus, a nice printer, & will our kids want to drive a bus?

Yes, bus content suitable for Fri... 
    The long life bus is still chuggin' (only parts ever replaced beyond
usual tuning/exhaust stuff were clutch, set of lifters, thermostat,
cv's, brake rotors, and seals), but the oil change intervals  have to be
tighter, as it gets black/gassy smelling sooner, likely blow by.  Still
no blue clouds at startup or running, gets 18-20 mpg, and is happier in
these cool times as oil temp rarely gets over 224.  The heater flaps
have been wired open for the winter.
   The talk on wiring diagrams leads me to point out the Canon s600
printer is great ($149 at Best Buy), I scanned a '75 bus title for a
copy and printed it; even the stains look real!  Prints at unbelievable
speeds. Uses 3 separate inks plus black, which my daughter likes; great
photo printing on coated paper.
   Speaking of which, at the age of 15 realism begins to outpace
idealism- the interest in owning a "cool" bus is waning when faced with
the "competition" of automatic shifting, quick water heating, power
steering, and easy to find mechanics.  In other words, when she will be
driving on her own (little over a year), I'd better hope cheap, used,
PR-cruisers will be out there!  But then, she thinks the concept "bus"
is cool looking also.........how to convince them the cost/benefit ratio
on the oldies is worth the hassle?
