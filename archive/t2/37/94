Subject: '78 back out on the road w/ questions

Hello all,

This past Friday I picked up my '78 automatic bus with a camper conversion
from the repair shop, where it sat ever so patiently for about six months.
Before that, it amassed mildew, cobwebs, surface rust and a gawdawful smell
for a minimum of two years and a maximum of seven in the PO's driveway. The
repair shop completely rebuilt the engine, installed a new fuel pump and
fuel line, overhauled the transmission, adjusted and cleaned the brakes and
also added various mirrors and lights. The result is a bus that purrs like a
kitten, never mind its current cosmetic shortcomings. I have never driven a
bus before, let alone been in one before, so I'm still learning what is
normal bus behavior vs. potential problematic behavior that needs attention.
So, here are my questions:

1) When I start it after its been sitting for a while (overnight), it tends
to putter out and stall once I put it in gear. How long should I let it warm
up before driving off (under "normal" weather conditions, if that matters)?
I've heard conflicting reports on this one. If I don't really need to warm
it up at all, what could be the problem that causes it to stall when I first
get it going?

2) I never expected my bus to break the sound barrier, but it is sorely
lacking in the pickup department, mainly on inclines of any sort. Is this
normal? I suspect it is, but just wanted to make sure. The other day I was
on a state route with a 55 mph speed limit and going up a long, gradual
incline.  I found myself with the pedal to the floor and barely making it to
32. I half expected to get passed by a mule cart...

Thanks for any pointers--they are much appreciated!
