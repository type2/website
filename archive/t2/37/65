If you want to argue then you are in the right place :)

If you have a running, turnkey upright motor then you can put a bus 
on the road and use it. You seen to have some of this already worked 
so there is no need to discuss the details. If you have a failed type 
4 motor that is complete including tine, exhaust, carb and or FI and 
are considering buying an upright to take its place then you may want 
to do or have done a quality rebuild done.

The type4 has many virtues. Almost everything about it stronger and 
longer lived than an upright. You may also find that strength and 
longevity come at a higher price.  Upright motors are far more common 
and easier to source parts for in a pinch. It is your bus and your 
money and you have to live with yourself and your bus.


Good luck
