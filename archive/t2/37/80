Clark:

Sorry, it will NOT. NO WAY. The physical size is different between the 64-69 and
larger70-79 beams. (It's gotta be in the archives, too, BTW, I've written the
same thing at least 3 times previously.)
You'll need a 68 or 69 axle beam.
Having said that, most all the parts will interchange, but you will not want to
put in both the torsion bars from a 70 or later. They are about 220 lbs heavier
in front and the bars are considerably stiffer. I tried this on my 69 double
cab, but foun them too stiff. I ended up changing back one torsion bar to the
stock type and am very pleased with the performance.
