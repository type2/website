Subject: Wipers SLOW when cold

When cold (like 32 outside, these mornings), my wipers (78 Westy) go
rather slowly; is this due to the motor gear grease getting old or
something stiff in the pantograph stuff rotating the arms?  Being
reluctant to pull anything with all that stuff in the way, what works
best as a spray solution- WD40 (dries up?), Liquid Wrench (ditto), spray
grease (too thick to penetrate?)....any experence on this??
