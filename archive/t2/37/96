Hi Jason,

There are a couple of really good write-ups in the technical library 
(www.type2.com under "Library", "Suspension", "Ball Joints").  

When I did mine, I removed the arms and took them to the local VW dealer along 
with my new ball joints.  I happily paid the man to press the old ones out and 
the new ones in.  Others have had luck removing and installing them themselves 
using heat, big hammers, and/or pickle forks.

BTW, if any of you don't know about the Technical Resource Library, take a few 
minutes and go peruse it.  It is FULL of great info and covers just about 
anything you want to do to your bus.  It was originally conceived and created 
by the late Josh Rogers and is now maintained on the type2 site by (I believe) 
Sean Bartnik.
