Subject: Re: [T2] setting valves on rebuild problem


Have you checked the head bolts? Very often, after retightening the lower 
head bolts (I know - I should tighten all 8 - I'm just descibing past 
behavior..)the valve clearance is zero - with the screw all the way out. I'm 
pretty sure now that my head bolts are pulling out of the case. Maybe you 
didn't stick em in all the way? Or maybe they are coming out. You could 
always shim the rocker arms, but you hate to do that after a rebuild..... 
good luck, I'm curious if its the bolts or not.

Speaking of these bolts, Anyone know how what the distance from the case is 
supposed to be? Mine is a 71 1600dp. I'll be dropping the engine and 
checking/resetting the head bolts sometime in the next year or so...
