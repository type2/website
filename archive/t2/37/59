M.R.:
I think the tin is the LEAST of your problems! If you're gonna have a
rigged up bus, why not use furnace tin and sheetmetal screws?
If you are gonna do it the way the factory did you need different
transmission ratios, tranmission input shaft, rear engine carrier, and
throttle cable,  air cleaner and air cleaner bracket. (Oh, don't you need
air cleaner and air pre-heating? Are you in Mexico or Brazil?) Then you
are going to have a 38 amp generator instead of a 55 amp alternator.
This is a lame idea unless you are planning to drive a lot in the 3rd
world (where type 4 engines were never marketed.)
To do a satisfactory, trouble free, job takes either about a thousand
dollars worth of parts or 2000 dollars worth of labor to make those parts.

If you're gonna rig it up, just use chain or rope or  threaded rod and see
how great it works.
Actually, about the only thing that ever wears out in a type 4 engine is
the heads. NOT the pistons and cylinders, not the bottom end.
This is a LAME IDEA!
