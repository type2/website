Hi,

Ronnie from www.type2parts.com is now selling repro floor mats for 
bays and splits. The molds for the mats were made from NOS floor 
mats. Unlike others that have been available in the past, these have 
the correct waffling on the underside. I doubt they are cheap but 
Ronnie has a good rep for selling quality stuff.
