Joel,

Yes, it's expensive, but I believe it is worth it.

I don't change oil every 3,000 if I use synthetic....that is sure to get a
few flames<grin>.

Some of my cars use syn and some I use the reular stuff.

In my opinion....the synthetic lasts longer than dino.

I have some water cooled vehicles that I use only synthetic...go 10,000
miles between changes.  I *never* use any oil between changes in them and 
I drive them hard.  The last one I treated that way had 127,000 on it and
still used *no* oil between changes...

As always....Your mileage may vary.  :-)

Cheers ,dave
