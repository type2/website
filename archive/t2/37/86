Wow, I've heard it was pretty much a straight swap.  I even went as far as 
sand blasting the 71' front beam.  My main reason for the swap is to use the 
later and cheaper master cylinder.  I guess I could weld the mounting plate 
on my 69' beam.  The question that has been bugging me is, has anybody just 
used the stock drum brakes up front.  I've heard a lot of American iron ran 
power drum brakes.  Anybody ever try it?
                                                       Peace, Love, and I 
love my wide 5's.
