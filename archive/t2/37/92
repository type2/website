Hi All, 

I have two manuals I would like to sell.
One is a 75 type 2 owners manual, in nice shape, for $10.00

The second is a stove instruction, and parts manual, probably for an
76--to --79 Westy, in good condition, $5.00

I also ( just thought of it ) have a orange headrest for a 74 Westy, in
perfect condition for $25.00.

Shpping for the books will be $ 3.95 regardless where you may live.

For the headrest I will need to know your location.

Thanks,
