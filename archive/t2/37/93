Normally unnder $20, you will be ablt remove the stud from the steering
knuckle on the most stubborn ball joints, with a big enough sledge
hammer.  You can also heat the arm and whack it with a hammer...I hve
never bent one, but I do not like pounding on frontends too hard either.
they always come loose too.  Just heat it until its DULL red and no more.

I wouldn't heat the forged suspension parts.  You're risking a drasic
weakening of the parts.

A Chevy pitman arm puller (~$10 at cheap tool places) will do the job.

You can also use the "2-hammer" technique to pop the things loose.  Place
two heavy ball-peen hammers on either side of the end of the arm
through which the ball-joint stud passes.  Keep one in place, back off
with the other and give it a good whack.  This squeezes the arm slightly
between the hammers which will loosen the tapered stud.

removing the ball joints on the car.  I do not know where you can find
the tool....snap-on may have a reproduction or some facsimilie used in
other applications.  Good Luck!

Now here you may be talking about the other end of the ball joint, which
is a much more specialized task.  A tool should be possible, but we're
talking a lot of force.
