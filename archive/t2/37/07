Subject: making a camper?

I just bought 2 more buses, one is a 78 with a slider in the rear, the
other is manufacture stamp of 08-75, guessing it is a 1976 model. the 76
is a riviera pretty much complete. missing the stove and ice box. my
plans are to strip the riviera and install it on the '78. will this
work? special problems? also, the top (penthouse style) is busted in one
place and was wondering if these can be bought or must have
repaired...all input appreciated.
