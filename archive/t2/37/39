I Have recently acquired a 78 Bus and it is missing the seal between the =
engine compartment and the engine tin.I have looked at several websites =
with Bus parts and can not find this seal can anyone get a part number =
for this seal or a parts supplier who would carry it and its exact name. =
I was told i need to get it replaced soon or the engine will run hot.  =
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Paul
