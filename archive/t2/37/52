Hi,

This weekend it has been raining so instead of working on my van, I decided
to find out more about it. So I took out both cab seats to look for the
M-Code plate (remembering that my bus is RHD and so you never can tell which
side things are on).

Behind the drivers seat (RHS) I found a quite large grey plate half obscured
by the seat belt fitting and with "VOLKSWAGEN AG" across the top in large
letters. Below was not the VI details I'd expected, just a few lines like
"Vehicle Type: 2" "Engine Type: Petrol" etc, and nothing about the vehicles
date or original spec.

On the passenger side, I found a small grey plate mounted at 90 degrees and
again not with the details I'd expected. On it are the following rather
cryptic set of digits:

52 064 767
J6J651 A41 123
49 4 7042 EN 2140 11

Anyone got any idea what these mean?
