Paul,

The seal is very important to maintain proper cooling. If the seal is 
missing, in poor condition, or not properly installed the you will be 
sucking hot air from the underside of the motor instead of cooler air 
from the vents on the side of the bus.

The seal should be widely available from many vendors. Try 
www.busdepot.com. If you have a VW dealer in your town they should be 
able to get it as well. Do not rule out the dealership for parts. VW 
still has odds and ends for air cooled buses.
