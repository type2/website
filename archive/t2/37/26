Thanks.  I have this and the company that provides the
fiberglass bookmarked previously.  

What I really was trying review all the arguments for
and against a slightly modified type I engine vs. the
type IV.  I remember Raby and others discussing the
matter and there being some good points made.  

I guess I need to save my type2 digests locally.
