Jason,
  There are a couple of ways to undo the ball joint.  If you aree not =
worried about the boot, go to the parts store and buy a pickle fork.  =
Normally unnder $20, you will be ablt remove the stud from the steering =
knuckle on the most stubborn ball joints, with a big enough sledge =
hammer.  You can also heat the arm and whack it with a hammer...I hve =
never bent one, but I do not like pounding on frontends too hard either. =
 they always come loose too.  Just heat it until its DULL red and no =
more.  The last way is the most expensive and involves a specialized =
tool for removing the ball joints on the car.  I do not know where you =
can find the tool....snap-on may have a reproduction or some facsimilie =
used in other applications.  Good Luck!
