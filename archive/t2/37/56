It's not a bad idea if you have the engine and the parts.  In Europe, the 
1600 was offered up through the air cooled Vanagons on the Transporter models.

My '73 European Panel van has the original 1600 in it.  The engine bay is 
just the same as my '74 Westy, but the '73 has special tin that fits this 
opening.
