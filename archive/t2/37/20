Subject: Buses And Punkin Chunkin in the First State

Hello,
We are putting this event on again this year. Last year was the first year
and it
was a big success. It will be held on Nov. 2-4th in Millsboro,Delaware.
It will be held at Holly Lakes Campgrounds.

There is no need to make reservations,
just tell them you are with the Vw group upon arrival.
 They have assured me that they have plenty of room for us. Arrive early on
Friday and get a good spot and enjoy some great company.
The plan is to caravan Saturday to Punkin Chunkin about 10:00 am.
www.punkinchunkin.com It was a blast last year
. Sat. night we will have a potluck dinner for anyone interested.
Here are some pics fromlast year http://pages.prodigy.net/bugnut1/index.html
You can e-mail me if you have any question or just want to let me know you
are coming.
Keep your eyes open a website is coming soon.
Thanks,
Dave Parsons
