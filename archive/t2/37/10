I started in to a long procedure on removing the fan shroud, and realised
that all you really have to do is remove the oil fill tube, which makes it
a heck of a lot easier.  This is based on memory from a while ago, so if
anyone has corrections/comments, please chime in....

1. Drain oil;

2. remove oil fill tube top.  Requires a large vice grip to compress the
   spring clip, then lift the plastic tube off;

3. remove the oil fill tube from the bottom passenger side of the engine.
   This will require removal of two rather thin nutsone on either side of
   the base of the fill tube;

4. as you remove the fill tube, the accordion will either be on its
   nipple on top of the fill tube or will remain on the bottom of the tube
   that passes thru the shroud.  Remove the old accordian and replace and
   re-install the fill tube.

NOTES:

Long skinny fingers or a spare 6-year old are handy for reaching between
the fan shroud and engine to remove and install the bellows. :-)

In addition to the new accordion, you will need a new gasket for the oil
fill tube-engine connection, or risk a new leak in a different spot.

The plastic filler top only goes on one way... there is a tab that fits a
slot, look at the metal and plastic tubes carefully before re-assembling.

Change your filter and put in new oil and you are ready for winter :-)
