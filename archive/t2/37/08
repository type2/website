Actually, it does matter.  You shouldnt have much trouble finding a good
or rebuildable 205N from either a used parts supplier or just hitting swap
meets....but.

The carbs you use are NOT stock, and it is very possible that any vacuum
ports on these carbs would be incorrect for use on this distributor.
(memory says this should have a vac advance, and retard, as well as a
centrifugal advance.)  Without the correct vacuum pressure, and from the
correct places (above or below throttle plate.  Yeah, it is different..),
you'd be just as well off with a 009...which is rather sad, since the 009
falls roughly 20 degrees short of the total amount of advance that a type4
engine prefers.

What that means:  To get the correct "total" advance, you're advance at
idle would be way to high, causing a high idle.  Then you must back the
idle WAY down...and when you attempt to accelerate, it bogs.

Or, you can give it a reasonable idle ignition timing, but you suffer
greatly at the top end, since you never advance far enough...

(the 009 advance curve has similar, though generally not as extreme,
problems on the older upright engines also.)

I'm not familar with the curve of the 050, but it is my understanding that
it, too, is incorrect.


If someone can present evidence that the vacuum ports on the 34 ICTs can
be used to control a more appropriate distributor, that would be great.
