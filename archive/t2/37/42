Subject: Continued Problems with reverse, 78 Westfalia

Hello List,
I just got inside from what has been a frustrating
Saturday and I hope I can find some solace from the
list's advise.
I wrote last week that I have a problem with reverse. 
All forward gears work well. When I shift into
reverse, nothing.  Every 100th time or so I will get
it to engage but a shift later and its gone.  I have
replaced front linkage bushing (it wasn't bad but I
had bought a new one).  I also replaced the rear
coupler (which also was not bad but again I had a new
one) on the linkage just forward of the tranny.  I
have moved the shifting plate in the cab forward
backwards into every concievable possition and still
nothing.  
Of the times that I have gotten reverse to engage it
will sometimes disengage with a clunk.  
Any advise would be greatly appreciated.
Rick
