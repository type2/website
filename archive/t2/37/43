Subject: 25th Anniversary--

Recently Magoo and I celebrated our 25th Anniversary--Been doing VW even
longer then that, and we are trying to move away from our daily grind of VW
Stuff--So-- we have a deal going for a Matchbox 25th Anniversary Bus--with a
limited Edition of 100 pieces--we will be selling them near cost --just as a
thank-you to all our VW Friends--as of now, there will be Two issues--The
1st will be a White Matchbox boxed VW bus with our 16 years in possession
"Herbey" on both sides--100 Editions.

Issue #2 will be the Matchbox VW Bus with "Bessie" and hopefully the 1969
Eriba Puck in Tow on both sides--Again just 100 Editions--

The 1st Edition is now in progress--stay tuned--
