There were a VERY small number of VERY early watercooled Vanagons that used
a 215mm clutch. (Also '75 busses used them.)  So few that in all the clutch
kits I've sold I've only run up against one Vanagon that took one.
(Interestingly, it was a Canadian vehicle, titled as an '82, not an '83, but
wasserboxer-engined.)  Besides that, all '76-91 take 228mm.
