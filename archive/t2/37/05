I'm going to print out all of the request that I get and give them to the
Vanagon owner, that way I won't be adding anything to your price and
everybody will get the best deal possible.......
If he doesn't want to handle them I will.
You can count on them being shipped from Austin Texas about the same rate
as from Dallas TX 75220 if you want to gestimate your freight go to

I'm leaving about 7AM Saturday morning and I'll post the van owners name
and Email when I get back.

Original Post from Last Night:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
I'm making a 320 mile trip this Saturday to scavenge 82 Air Cooled
Vanagon parts.
If you're need anything for 80-83 aircooled let me know.
The parts that are already spoken for are:
Tranny, Heater Boxes, Crossover pipe, rear bumper, engine, FI 
system.
Everything else is there and If I don't have to hold, clean it 
these parts will be cheap.
Whatever I don't get: the owner is going to put on E-bay Sunday 
night.
Speak up now!
I'm not going to chase after parts a second time on this Vanagon.
