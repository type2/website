Subject: Brake adjustment UPDATE

Well gang, I feel very confident that I got the brakes handled! My
adjustments of the star-wheels were so far off I wanted to punch myself for
being such a "Dee". After I got them done, I did the full adjust of the
parking brake, and for the first time in MONTHS, I can park Zoey on an
incline without having to chock a tire. I can do a fairly zippy pull and she
stays put (as long as she is also in gear) but I am sure that is because I
have a pretty nice size incline for a driveway. However, if I hit the clutch
peddle, she will start to roll down the hill ever so slowly.

I guess I am too used to the fact that I can pull the parking brake on my
Civic, take it out of gear, and it stays put. Overall, I am sure that at
some point in the future, new cables will be needed.

For now though, I think I got it to a satisfactory point.

The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is Christians, who
acknowledge Jesus with their lips and walk out the door, and deny Him by
their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds
unbelievable.
