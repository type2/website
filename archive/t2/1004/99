Subject: Fuse box wires... '78 Westy

OK, I was messing around with the fuse box, and I pulled the heavy red/2
black stripes wire out of the bank of fuses.  This red/b2 seems to go to the
head light switch.  Which fuse should it be connected??  #9??

Also, I want to wire a radio to a fuse that is hot with the key turns on.
Which fuse, #12??

Right now I have the battery disconnected for safety sake        Bentley is
a great coffee table leg leveler....
