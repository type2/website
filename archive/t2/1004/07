Subject: Shifter adjustment - DAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!

I just recently changed the front bushing of my shift linkage. That little
rubber donut in the front sure does make a difference...

Problem is, I can't get the damn shifter adjusted properly again. Just when
I think I have it good, I can't down-shift from third with out the dreaded
grrrriiiiiinnnnd, then I have to let the engine slow down before I can slip
it into second.

I have once again followed what the Bentley told me to do, but have to admit
that strikes me as a very touchy science to get it tweaked just right. When
I think I have it in second, it also looks like the linkage is bumping up
against my parking brake lever. I don't know if the two are related, but
either way, I can't get her fully into second and then adjust the stick from
there. Just when I think I have it all the way in second, adjust the housing
so that the stick is about 90 degrees from the floor, and tighten a bolt....
grrrrriiiiiind.

Since I just got done with the brakes, I decided to take advantage of the
fact that she is still up on the jack stands and drive her "in place" to get
the shifter  positioned correctly. Though it is cool to get her in second
(when I can) and get out of the driver's seat and watch her run in place, I
am still getting nowhere (no pun intended with the jacked up deal) with my
shifter.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated since I REALLY want to start driving
her before I have to go on another trip for work.

TIA

The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is Christians, who
acknowledge Jesus with their lips and walk out the door, and deny Him by
their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds
unbelievable.
