Subject: Fuel Starvation?

Recently, I took my 78 Westy on its first long trip, from Washington, DC to 
St. John New Brunswick and back, about 2500 miles.   The first 3 or 4 days went 
fine.   About then however, I felt a couple of hiccups when traveling uphill 
at elevated speeds (OK maybe 55-60 mph).   The next couple of days it got 
worse and began badly misfiring uphill at freeway speeds.    I stopped at a parts 
store and pulled a couple of plugs and saw they were white, not tan.   I got a 
couple of ranges colder to be on the safe side ( though because of the 
rapidly crumbling elbow from the crossover pipe to the muffler I could not have 
heard any detonation.    I tried, without success to get a fuel filter since I 
suspected fuel starvation.   I could not find one so removed mine and found it 
had some resistance to blowing by mouth and the thin wire I used (22 ga) to poke 
three holes in the filter indicated a tarry substance,   After a fruitless 
search of Calais, ME to locate a filter, I prepared a cobbled together universal 
filter with a 3/8" inlet and a female threaded outlet.   At a hardware store 
I got a couple of brass fittings which would give me enough of an outlet stub 
to connect the 1/2 inch hose to the fuel pump with a hose clamp.   However, in 
a piece of luck I passed Jim's VW south of Belfast Maine, who not only had 
the correct filter but installed it in about 15 minutes.    Jim is   really 
helpful VW specialist and should be known to VW owners down east Maine.   If not 
his phone number is (207) 338-4593 and is located at 830 Atlantic Highway, 
Northpoint, ME, 04849.   He works on all type VWs and sells used ones too.

The bus began acting much better, but in a few hundred miles resumed its 
misfire.   I managed to get home by keeping it under 55.   It still feels like 
fuel starvation, but I don't know what to check next.   I most certainly do not 
want to drop the engine to get the fuel tank out.

Anybody have this problem and any suggestions?        While on the topic of 
VW specialists, I have to mention my superior mechanic in the Bethany Beach 
Delaware area, Steve Shockley who beautifully 
restored my Bus after its side was ripped open by a dump truck with a snow 
plow attachment who did not understand the right of way.   Good insurance 
though.    Steve' number is 302-537-7663.   I plan to take pictures and write about 
the 65 Spitwindow panel van in which he replaced the entire frame   and engine 
with the whole front end of   a late model Saturn, transmission, brakes 
wheels, engine and climate control and subframe.   It fit into the Splitty while 
retaining a totally stock appearance.   Imagine a 65 split window van with a 
four cylinder water cooled engine, automatic transmission, and real heat and air 
conditioning.   Even the instrument cluster has been fit into the center of 
The VW dash, and very neatly, as well as the Saturn's automatic seat belts. 
Steve kept the hood of the Saturn and mounted the back seat on it. The Saturn fuel 
tank is housed in the former engine compartment.    He is waiting to upgrade 
the front brakes to discs and rebuild the well worn steering mechanism before 
putting it on the road.    It did take 1200 feet of wire to connect all the 
parts of the power train to the cab   of the van.    I cannot wait to drive it.  
 Should be unbelievable power brakes and convenience.   Steve thinks he could 
do the same with just about any late model Japanese small sedan.   It would 
be nice if it would fit in a slick as the Saturn.   Steve used to be a Mercedes 
Benz and Toyota dealer mechanic, but is able to think Way,Way out of the Box. 
  He has also built catapults for the annual pumpkin chucking contest in 
Sussex county.   His is powered by lots and lots of surgical tubing stretched 
tight.   An amazing man indeed, and wonderfully nice as well





Thanks to all on the list
