Subject: Brake Light Switches and bleeding?

I just performed the 5 year ritual...replaced the
brake light pressure switches.

Technically, I assume I'm supposed to bleed the whole
system, but only a tiny amount of fluid came out of
the holes and I suspect that any air would go out the
top of the master into the resevoir. The pedal feels
fine. I have no assistant handy...anyone know if you
really need to bleed the system after this evolution?
