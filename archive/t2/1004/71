Subject: A Smoooooooth Ride....

Last night, I took a friend of mine home and decided that I was gonna take
Zoey. It was the first official "run" since doing the brakes and the
shifter.

As I started on down the road, I did notice that the shifting starting to
"fall into place" although I was still doing a lot of grinding if I didn't
go from 3rd to 2nd juuuust right.

The steering felt good since I changed that pin, the brakes felt pretty
good, and the fact that my boy fell asleep tells me that is was a good "bus
ride" as I call it.

Still have a little tweaking to do with the shifter, and I think my brakes
have a tiny bit of room for improvement, but overall, it was a VERY pleasant
ride.

Thank you to everyone who gave me such extensive help - even to the point of
annoyance. I have learned a shyt-load on this go-round and think I have
enough to polish everything else off without much issue.

Y'all are... appreciated.

The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is Christians, who
acknowledge Jesus with their lips and walk out the door, and deny Him by
their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds
unbelievable.
