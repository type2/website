Subject: Re: [T2] Rear License Plate Bracket

Eric said:


 The reason I ask is since I was hit in the engine lid is a parking lot, I
had to get a new lid.  My current engine lid has two holes near the center,
maybe 2 inches apart; the plate is attached with a bracket.

The replacement lid, from BustedBus, has holes far apart - license plate
size.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Do the holes line up with the holes in the license plate?

If yes, I'd wager a cold beer that the dealer that sold the bus the replacement lid came from did not even buy
brackets, they took the cheap route and mounted the plate right to the lid.....
