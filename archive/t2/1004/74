Subject: Tell us about YOUR heat

I'm at the point where I need to either sh!t or get off the pot with
my BA6.  I need to decide to start cutting and welding to get it in
the Guac's belly, or to go back to my plans for recirculating air
through the HE's.

So tell me about your heat. What's worked for you, what was a mistake?
