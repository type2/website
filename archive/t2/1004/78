Subject: inspection

Hi,

 

I am having a PEI vehicle inspection tomorrow.

 

I am wondering how it will do.

 

The issue has always been ball joint play.

 

I heard from someone, I think at VW tech that there has always been some on
busses.

 

Is the spec in Bentley?

 

If I get a fail tomorrow, it will be my first ever.

 

Cheers,

 

Alan
