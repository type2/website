Subject: Fwd: [T2] Solex 40 P11-4 carbs and Bosch JF-4 dist. Balancing

Dave: I use a procedure that I got off one of the lists years ago. It 
uses a manometer which I built from glass tubing.  It has the nice 
feature that the manometer is connected to both carbs at the same 
time and can sense and correct any imbalance in air flow.
I can send it to you privately if you want.
