Jeff asked:


 Thanks to everyone who replied.   Does anyone have a preference over 15 X 4.5 or 15 X 5 wheels?

 Thanks again.

Wrong question to ask.  NEITHER are wide enough.
You do realize that the bay 14" wheels are 5.5 inches wide and the Vanagon 14" alloys are 6 inches wide?  This
is because of the load weight requirement of the CORRECT tires for a bus.

Before you invest in the wrong wheels [even though they may be pretty and you have your mind set on them....]
you might want to read ALL the posts here: http://www.thesamba.com/vw/forum/viewtopic.php?t=162278
and go here and scroll down to 15" tires.  On a 5.5" wheel, I would not go larger than the Nokian
Hakkapeliitta 195R70/15.  All the rest are 205 and larger.
