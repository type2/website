It's been some years since I owned an air cooled Type2, Hawaii in 
1990. I sold the '79 (no heater boxes on it) and bought an '86 Syncro 
GL and headed out for Chicago. 1990 was a long time ago.

Today I bought a 1979 lime green pop-top Westie. This is my first ever Westie.

The guy said it had bad valves and I did hear a ticking noise so I 
had it towed home, I really didn't want to lose a valve and trash the 
engine. As a bonus the tow guy took the '91 Subaru Legacy (donor 
carcass) with him, but that's a story for a different list. The '79 
came with a 1.8 engine for parts if needed (that was why I asked 
about the heads yesterday).

Testing and inspections tomorrow to see what I need to do to get 
running.  Then a closer look to see what I have and start exploring 
the mysteries of the Westie.
