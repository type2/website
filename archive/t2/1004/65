Hi Rob,

Yes.... But if you are running FI with a carb'd 1.8 head you will  
need to drill and tap it for the head temp sensor.

If it's a 1.8 FI head you may have to drill a hole in the 2L engine  
tin to allow the lead from the sensor to reach the harness. IIRC  
there is no such hole in the 2L tin.


Happy Trails,
