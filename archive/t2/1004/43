It sounds like theres a short somewhere in the dash.

If you were hitting the brakes and the radio cut out, that is a short.
Almost every dash short I've seen will make the radio cut out.... you
are losing voltage at the short, which could also explain why the dash
lights dim when you try to engage the starter.

I would look very carefully at the dash wiring. Label everything and
try to eliminate what isn't necessary. The wiring diagrams on
vintagebus.com will be a huge help.
