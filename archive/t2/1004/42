Subject: Re: [T2] Z Bed Question

Ok, Ok, Ok - I called it the wrong thing. Sorry. Funny thing is I almost
never use the term Z-bed.

To goal is a full length rear bench seat that will fold into a bed - better?
:)

Now being firmly corrected - the Z Bed hinges would be ok I guess (although
we have no seat to apply them too).

However, if Westfalia made full length bed seat in '74 and '75 will these
mount in our '78?

So it sounds like I have two solid options. Thank you all for any further
advice on the topic - and the schoolin' :)
