Subject: RE: [T2] won't start...again. what else could it be?

To me it sounds like ignition switch is ok. You turn into the on position and
that click is the starter sylnoid (sp?) clicking into action. WHen you click
to start it does nothing correct?

One easy thing I would do is throw a charger on your battery for a couple
hours and see if it starts up then. Your battery may not be charging properly
afterall or your battery might just be wore out and not holding a charge
well.

The other easy thing to do is just make sure all the connections are as good
as you can get them. My bus starts reliably but once every month or two it
won't start the first time because the ground wire needs to be slighly
adjusted. ;)

Don't give up, just about every VW I've ever owned has had starting problems
at one time or another.
