Don't know if anyone out there has seen this, but it would certainly make
for a great sales-demo video if classic VW splitties were still in

The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is Christians, who
acknowledge Jesus with their lips and walk out the door, and deny Him by
their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds
unbelievable.
