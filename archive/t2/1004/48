Mike and Karl,

Thanks this should be just what we need to get started on searching for what
we need.

By the way no need to apologize MIke. I wasn't offended at all - I actually
thought it was rather humorus. There are always those certain things that
cause groans from the knowledgable and shine brightly the lack of knowledge
from the newbie. It's the way it works and how I learn.

Thanks again.

Jeff & Patty
