Look for brake fluid in the line from the booster to your intake manifold.
Sometimes the master cylinder will leak brake fluid into the booster.  When the level of fluid reaches the vacuum port, it will get sucked into your engine and cause thick, white smoke.

> Fired up the 72 riviera this morning to go to work and it looked like one of those mosquito foggers! Thick white smoke billowing out the back. Seemed to be running fine but the smoke was very thick.  I didnt have time to look into it so I shut her down and drove the Vanagon.
