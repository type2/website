Subject: Clutch engagement

Hi list,

I apologize for all of the questions lately. My bus's ('71 Westy
1600dp) clutch and throw out bearing, and input shaft seals are pretty
new (8000 miles). My pedal engages the clutch right near the top of
the pedal travel. It shifts great, but the pedal travels forever
before engaging. It doesn't affect me while cruising, but stop signs,
etc... are a pain because of how much throttle I have to give until
the clutch engages. The clutch cable is adjusted all the way. What can
cause this, can the cable stretch?

Thank you all,

Max
