Subject: Solex 40 P11-4 carbs and Bosch JF-4 dist. Balancing act.

Hi All,
I recently purchased a 67 VW with a 1.7L T-4 motor with 914 cam,  Solex 40
P11-4 carbs and Bosch JF-4 distributor. Everything was run into the ground and
all are now rebuilt.  However I am having difficulty with the timing, carbs
and distributor balancing act. It is running but is coughs, pops and chokes.
Once it gets past that, it gets up and goes but with lotsa flat spots. The
carbs ran great on a 2L transporter motor, but not on this this. Anyone have a
procedure to balance things out?
I am new to type2 and want to make sure I get your reply, so if you would also
cc your messages to sunflowernut.com as well, that will help.

Dave
