Subject: Re: [T2]FULL WIDTH (74-75)  Z Bed install Question

We did it in our "made livable" 78- http://www.geocities.com/mike_benthin
Remove the fridge (we use a cooler stored behind passenger front seat).
To keep the rear cabinet, you have to notch out the front of the cabinet 
to pull out the bed; I closed off the front door to glue on a headrest I 
made from the same bluegreen material and cut a side opening that has no 
door as you couldn't open it with a lot of stuff back there.
There are mounts hidden near the edge of the cabinet you can use to 
install 3 pont seat belts that will go over the shoulder.

  The goal is a full length rear bench seat that will fold into a bed - 
better?
  However, if Westfalia made full length bed seat in '74 and '75 will these
  mount in our '78?
