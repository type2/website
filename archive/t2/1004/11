Michael said:

Thank you all for you kind and informative replies.  I have a line a
fiberglass dune with a 1776 single-port motor for asking price of $2,000.  I will go and take a look at it
tomorrow.  If things look good, I may buy the lot, take the motor out (AE case) and put on my old dual port
heads or buy some new ones.  I might even be able to take some of the dune buggy parts and swap them
in-and-out with a dune I project I already have.  When is all said and done, I will sell the left over parts
and try to recoup some of my money.

Be warned that not all AE engine cases are bus AE cases. Some lack the 3 mounts for the rear hanger bar.

In the 1st group, AE is 71-72 1600 DP

In the 2nd group, AE is 71 1600 (with crossmember holes)

I have a AE engine with no holes..... worked in my 67 bus but not in your 71.
