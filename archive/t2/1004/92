Subject: 56/57 bug trade for westy

I have a 56 or 57 bug that I would like to trade for a Westy or sell. The bug is
  very complete with original motor,tranny,interior. The body is in
  great shape rus wise except the floor pans need replacing and the sad part
  is a branch landed on the roof denting in the pass side of the roof and the top
  of the front door frame. None of the glass is broken including the pass door.
  The door still opens and closes. It has been in a garage since the mid 60's.
  It comes with an assortment of wheel bearings,seals,some gaskets and other
  misc parts that were purchased back in the 60's but have no rust on them
  and are in perfect shape. This stuff was quality made back then. It has a W
  deck lid with no rust,the fenders and rest of the body are rust free except
  some minor around the front windshield and the previously mentioned floor pans.
  Still has the original seat covers in perfect shape. I was able to get the motor to
  run off a plastic fuel tank,but the original tank is there and rust free. Just needs
  fuel lines replaced and I would clean the tank. Still has tube tires that will need
  replacing,but hold air. It is missing bumpers but has the brackets. Someone
  primered the car years ago and did a lousy job. Still has orig radio,dash knobs
  and all tin and muffler/heatbox in great shape. Air cleaner,carbs,are still the
  orig in great shape. This would make a great oval window project for someone.
  I'd like to trade for a 75 and up Westy/bus/Vanagon. Would also trade for
  something I could use as a daily driver this winter. Make me an offer or let me
  know what you got to trade.
