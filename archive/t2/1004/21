Jon,

Thanks for the tip - I would never have considered that. The battery is
brand new - however the old Alternator had a short in it and I "think"
caused it to drain the battery while the vehicle was just sitting (not sure
that makes sense). We recharged the battery all the way and drove the bus on
just battery power from the PO's place to home. We stopped half way and
charged the battery back up again.

Either way I would never have considered a bad battery. I'll have it tested.
Thanks for the tip.
