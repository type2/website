Subject: White smoke

Fired up the 72 riviera this morning to go to work and it looked like one of those mosquito foggers! Thick white smoke billowing out the back. Seemed to be running fine but the smoke was very thick.  I didnt have time to look into it so I shut her down and drove the Vanagon.
  Any ideas what I should look for when I get home tomorrow?
