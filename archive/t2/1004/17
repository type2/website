Usually means the battery is bad. Often a bad alternator will fry a
perfectly good battery. Then when the alternator is changed, the battery
doesn't charge and ends up overheating and frying your new alternator. Have
you taken the battery into your nearest FLAPS for a test? The test is free.

Ok, the alternator was shot -so we got a new one. I got it installed tonight
(this is a huge accomplishment for me - especially for my first time working
on an AC engine). So the new alternator is in and still the battery isn't
charging. So now what? Voltage Regulator?

The good news is the battery light is no longer lighting up all the time. It
was on even when the key was out of the ignition. I was told the old
alternator had a short - So I am hoping that was what was draining the
battery. If not well, we'll cross that bridge after I get this not charging
problem solved.

Thanks ahead of time for any help.
