Subject: Re: [T2] Rear License Plate Bracket

Eric asked:


Are there different rear license plate brackets for different years?

And Dan replied:
 
 i recall there being differences in california and non-california buses. 
 not sure about differences throughout the years though.

I do not find any VW part number for any license brake bracket. Even Bus Depot does not show one for a bus.

I believe the dealer installed whatever they found as a 'local purchase'.
