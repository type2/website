Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Off-Roading

It  might just be my buses, but I feel that my '63 split is built like
a brick shithouse compared to my '74 Westy. I'm not saying my bay is
junk, but the few splits that I've driven, including mine feel a lot
more like work trucks that are designed to haul and take a severe
beating and keep on truckin. Bays seem a bit more fragile.

It probably has a lot to do with the upgraded suspension on the later
models. The splits ride a lot more stiff in my experience.
