Subject:  Dixie Bus stuff


I have been asked a few questions, and so I decided to post to the list as
well.  Those not planning on the event, please delete now and forgive me.

Okey Dokey!!!!

Rustic Knolls does not accept MC/Visa (but I will take it!!)  They will take
your check.

Camping fess are $20 per night (supposed to be per site) However I know
there are some bringing multiple buses, and I will see that we are not
charged that way!
So, it is $20 per night, per family? and includes water and electric.

Those visiting for the day or what have you will be charged a $2 per person
visitors fee.

I will be there Thursday evening.  Dwayne expects to be there late Thursday
evening, Brian from Syracuse expects to be there early Friday AM, and I will
be soliciting assistance to get new brake lines on the 66, for the show.  So
come one come all early, baby needs new stopping gear!!!

Any more questions??????

Dwayne asked what the plans were for Friday???   Vegetable cutting and meat
frying!!  I have 20 pounds of Turkey and Chorizo sausage to be cooked.  This
chili thing is huge!!!!
Any helpers????

Looking forward to a great time!!  At least I know there will be a "small"
fire for us to enjoy!
