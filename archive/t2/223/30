Hi,

That bus is freakin SWEET!!

I guess if your some freak about keeping things stock, you may not like it, 
but I for one USE my bus and will make whatever changes to it that I feel 
like. Cut off this, shave off that, install this, its all good.

Not to mention, its so well done. dang.

Christopher
