Subject: Re: [T2] Cooling - 1600Sp vs 1600DP


Hi Bob,
	I did this myself, and it worked out great.  The only thing I would add if 
I were you, is the type 3 cooling tin that fits between the cylinders and 
pushrod tubes.  On 105 degree day, driving uphill in first gear, with over 
1500 pounds of camping gear and human flesh, my cylinder head temp never 
exceeded 350 degrees!  My oil pressure was a healthy45 PSI as well(at 3K 
RPM).  Well worth the added effort.  Get the real VW ones though...

	Eron
