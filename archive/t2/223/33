Funny you should mention Pinzgauers - I just found not one, not two, but 
SIX of them on a used car lot in San Diego.  No, I'm not kidding.  There 
were hardtops, convertibles, and one with an extra set of wheels in the 
back... six wheel drive!  If anyone is interested e-mail me privately and I 
will tell you more.
