hey listees!

In my desperation to install a clock in my 74 single cab, I had to get 
innovative.  I earlier purchased a gray faced clock from a fellow listee 
which did not work when I received it (through no fault of the seller).  I 
later purchased a black faced clock (which does work) from another very 
nice listee.  I simply took the gray face off the non-working clock and put 
it on the working clock!  The faces are identical in every way except the 
color.  All in all, not too complicated.  Just a thought for those also 
trying to find clocks that work.  Greg
