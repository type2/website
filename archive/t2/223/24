Subject: vanagon hubcap wanted

Hello,

I am looking for just one of those vanagon hubcaps with the wolfsburg castle 
in the center. I have 4, painted white, and looking for a 5th to put on the 
nose mounted spare.

This one doesn't have to be white, I can paint it myself if needed.

p-mail me if you have one available, but be sure to leave the [t2] in the 
subject line, or my mail filter will block it out.

Christopher
76 Westfalia "jasper"
