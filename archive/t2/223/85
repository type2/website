Never remove spark plugs from a hot aluminum head. 
First remove the sparks when the engine is cold, re-install them with
never-size but not in tight.
As you say warm, a 5 minute warm up.
All plugs removed, spin the engine at least 10 revolutions with the
starter for each cylinder, sequense is not important.
