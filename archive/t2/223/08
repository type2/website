Subject: Cooling - 1600Sp vs 1600DP

I am thinking to upgrade my stock component 1600SP cooling system  to 
1600DP sizings.

I guess I need:
Doghouse (larger) oil cooler.
Tin (deeper) to house same.
Larger volume cooling fan.

What else is needed, and what is the best plan of attack for getting the 
conversion parts on the cheap side. - Vendors, parts yard sources, etc. ??

Cooler, of course, I think should be bought as new.

Thanks,

Bob Perring
