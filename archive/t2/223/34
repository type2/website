Subject: I guess it's not wrong after all

First, thanks for those that gave the correct, usable link. I messed up the
first one from pure inexperience. My bad.
Second, if you like it, great. I just thought that the vehicle had been
changed soooo much that it could barely qualify as a bus.
And, yes, I drive my bus every day......to work, to the feed store, to the
lumber yard, etc, etc, and I'm not a 'stock freak'.

Just an opinion, folks. Don't take it so seriously.

Regards,
Dave
