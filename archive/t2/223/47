Subject: Compression test

I bought a tester and I'm going to test the compression this weekend.  What
I know:

- warm up engine first
- remove all plugs
- test one by one with throttle wide open each time

What I don't know is the best way to stop the fuel from flowing while I
perform the test.

Undo the main plug from the ECU?  I'm guessing if I do this the fuel pump
will still run and the fuel pressure will build.  Disconnect the double
relay as well?
