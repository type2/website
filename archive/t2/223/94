I, too, say exhaust leak... Except for one possibility
nobody mentioned:
If the smog ports on your heads are plugged up with
bolts, one of them may have come loose. One time, I
spent a month trying to find an exhaust leak. I wanted
to rip my hair out, I was so frustrated. Finally, I
took it to somebody. Sure enough, one of the smog
ports had come unplugged. Doh!
