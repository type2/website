Subject: Re: [T2] re-establishing EGR in my FI 

I have the linkage.
However, if that washer is loose, then you lost the lock nut. And more than
likely the rubber boot on the other end is history too. That valve is a paper
weight. It is now history.
When it is working correctly, the valve only lets exhaust flow thru it in the
middle of its travel. It is closed at each end of its stops.
