Okay dumb question time...

I looked at EKTA to see what the mounts look like...

How do the early bay rear mounts bolt to the late bay window moustache bar 
frame mounts?

I assume the early bay has the same front tranny mount holes in the bottom 
of the rear torsion bar housing as the late bay?

I'll start looking for used motor mounts for all the above.
