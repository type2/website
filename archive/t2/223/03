Hello Again Listers:

Thanks to all that gave me things to look for on my seized engine from a
couple weeks ago.  I tore the engine down over the last week, and it wasn't
nearly as bad as I thought it might be.  Everything is reusable, except the
culprit, the main bearings.  Specifically, main bearing 1.  Here's what
happened:  I built this engine using one of the new all aluminum cases that
have hit the market over the last couple of months.  The little holes where
the main bearing dowel pins go seem to be drilled a little deeper than they
should be, thus there isn't much dowel sticking up out of the holes.  This
is bad because the dowels keep the main bearings from rotating in their
saddles, and if the dowels don't stick up into the mating holes in the
bearings far enough, the bearings will spin.  This is what happened to my
main bearing number 1, and it was a mess.

I asked my local VW mechanic what he thought I should do.  He suggested that
I stick a little bead of JB Stick Weld in each dowel hole, then place the
dowel pins in.  This seemed to raise them up to what I think they should
look like.  I guess I'll know in a few thousand miles if this works!!
