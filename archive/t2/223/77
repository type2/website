Subject: Unimoggin

I read a post earlier mentioning Unimogs.  Since you almost never see those
things here this is worth mentioning.  In Woodbridge, VA (25 miles S of
Washington, DC) next to Old Bridge Rd. there are 4 Unimogs for sale.  There
is an old military version and 3 dump/pickup truck looking ones.  One says
that it was used by the Forest Service in Albany, NY.  They are priced from
$7500 to $30000 if memory serves with 2 of them at $12500.  These things
are so cool!  My kids and I checked them out one afternoon.  The cabs are
open so you can get in and check them out up close.  Not exactly plush
accomodations.

I wonder if I could put my Westy body on a Unimog chassis?
