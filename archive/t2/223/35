Subject: Vanless in Seattle

Got your attention, didn't I? 
I threw this out once before, let's try again. 
My 78 Westy is getting zero compression in Cylinder 3.
I need to yerk it out, and nowhere to do it. Anybody
in the North Seattle area that can loan some space? I
am in Mukilteo, WA so anywhere up to Snohomish would
be ideal. 
Thanks,
