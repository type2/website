Subject: Hot or cold plugs

I misplaced my receipt for the Bosch spark plugs I bought.  I think I was
sold W7CC plugs.

I started with this information:

http://www.oldvolkshome.com/ignition.htm#B7679

But then I found this info in the archive:

> W8's are hotter running plugs for most normal driving conditions as well as
> colder climate and lotsa stop n go traffic.
> 
> W7's are colder running plugs for warmer climates and extended/high rpm
> highway driving. Usually the plug of choice when building those hi-perf motors
> as well because they tend to run a little hotter than stock.

I also read the W7CC is a summer plug (warmer climates), and W8CC a winter
plug.

My question: should I be using the W7CC here in Texas?  What about all year
long?

BTW, why does Bentley recommend W8CO?
