The Pinzgauer was made by Steyr-Daimler-Puch in Graz, Austria. NOT by
Mercedes!
However, Steyr-Daimler-Puch has changed owners. It is now owned by Magna
Industries as of May of 1998.

"Magna Acquires Majority of Steyr-Daimler-Puch
Creditantstalt (CA) has sold its 66.8% share in Steyr-Daimler Puch AG (SDP) as
well as its 50% share in Steyr-Daimler Puch Fahrzeugtechnik to Magna
International, the worldwide supplier of auto parts.

The group is owned by Austro-Canadian Frank Stronach. Its last overall sales
figure was ATS70 billion (approx. $5.6 billion) and its employs 39,000 people.
In 1996, SDP had 6,000 workers and sales of ATS11.4 billion (approx. $900
million).

The deal means that SDP gets a strong industrial partner in the global market,
while Magna, by taking over SDP, gains access to SDP's all-wheel
technology-centered in Graz-as well as acquiring an internationally
established designer and component manufacturer for the automotive industry.
Magna's strength lies in the production of car body parts and in sheet metal
shaping, while SDP is one of the world's leading propulsion engineering
companies."

The Uni-mog is Mercedes.....

The Mercedes G-wagon is also made in Graz.

vehicles used in Germany, Belgium and? (I noticed one is painted UN blue!)..
Check out this one.. and yes, their electrical systems are 24V.
