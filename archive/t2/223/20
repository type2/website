okay, i understand. the lock nut i am able to buy, but the rubber boot -
no? my FLAPS feller told me there was no rubber of any kind on the other
side; that it was tapered metal and that was enough. we couldn't find an
exploded view of the valve. no improvising on the rubber, huh.

also: yikes i had sent my heads to rimco, and had to return one head
because they hadn't tapped the temp sensor II. now i am fitting the gasket
and intake manifold on that side and see that the outter studs they put in
for me are off. can't even put the gasket on. can i bang them back center,
how - with what, or should i wait, be patient, and send them back again?
what is the risk of cracking the head, even if i'm gentle with it?
