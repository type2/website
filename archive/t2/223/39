Subject: setting off car alarms

My 70 bus has started sounding like a lawnmower on sterroids. it
backfires and when driving, sounds like childhood memories of putting a
playing card on my bike so that it thumps the spokes so you can pretend
to be riding a motorcycle. remember that? can barely hear the rabid
cricket over the roar of the lawnmower. if i listen closely, i can hear
the cricket, but barely.

engine has just be rebuilt, and nearly everything was replaced.
valves were not adjusted right away, but have been done now (a couple
were a little tight, but a couple were just fine)
timing was adjusted with a light

any ideas? could it be a bad fuel pump? bad timing? hole in the muffler?
has my bus been possessed by the ghost of a lawnmower? or is it just
having an identity crisis?

waving and wondering what would happen if i drove around my yard a few
times...
chris (the girlie one)
70 westy... (how about the name "chopper"? sounds sorta like a harley
right now...)
