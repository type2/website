Subject: Re: [T2] setting off car alarms - exhaust R&R

The header pipes are not sealing to the exhaust pipes or not sealing to the 
head.

Could be as simple as a rusted out muffler.

Start it up cold and feel around underneath near the seams in the exhaust 
system - feel for puffs of air. Also look for signs of soot.

Fix it yourself 'cause a shop with charge you through the roof for this 
repair. I would just take it apart and replace all of the gaskets and 
bolts/nuts. Clean everything as you go.

Would also be a good time to R&R the heat while you don't need it.
