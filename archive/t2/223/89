Subject: Weber DFV 228

	While I was doing some cleaning and noise proofing under the carpeting in
back of the rear seat the other day I found a receipt and several pages of
an instruction manual (in Spanish of course) for the dual carbs that were
installed on Gretta's '73 1700cc in late 1980.  I had previously inspected
the carbs for model or serial #'s, but found nothing that would help outside
of the fact that they looked like webers and appear to have been made in
Brazil.
The receipt claims that they are Weber DFV 228's, but offers no other
information.  I have tried searching thru Google for info on the DFV 228,
but have come up with limited results at best.  Does anyone have any
experience with these carbs, or know where I might be able to find manuals
or repair kits?  Are these carbs covered in the Haynes Weber Carb book?
	These carbs have been functioning well in the two years that I have owned
my bus, but as with all things mechanical I am sure that I will need to
rebuild them at some point and would like to be prepared when the time
comes.
