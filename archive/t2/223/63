Subject: Rear vent windows

Does anybody ever see those vent windows normally found next to the rear 
seat on a '78 Transporter in rust free condition?

I am searching for two - one for the passenger side and one for the 
driver's side. I presently have good seals and glass of the one piece 
variety (I had 1 very rusty vent window that I removed)  but I am 
collecting parts for a retro fit later.

Thanks!!!
