Subject: Thermostat cable

Hi.
While investigating a zero compression cylinder, I
noticed that the thermostat cable that comes up from
under the engine to the air flap thingy (that is a
professional term) is missing. Is this a problem? I
have been driving it around for about 3 years, and
don't know if this has been like this. Anyone? 
Thanks,

=====
