        I recently picked up a couple of factory engine tools from
        a VW dealer that are depicted in Bentley.....

I've got a good-sized box full of special tools for aircooled VWs.  As a 
recovering Volksaholic I have some interest in a couple of other hobbies, 
including live steam locomotives.  A number of my live steam friends have 
machine shops and are glad to help when I need a special tool, maybe turning a 
seal installer or a bearing drift or a valve/head disassembly tool....

If you haven't done so already, think about making friends with someone in the 
live steam fraternity!  Check out   www.CALSlivesteam.org   if you would like 
to get a feel for another addictive hobby!  Enjoy.....
