Hallo Volks,

My bus is a 69 and after checking out all of the steering assembly my 
mechanic says my steering box 'ist kaput'.
My mechanic also says once upon a time in a land much like this one, he 
could buy steering box rebuild kits and that they had rebuilt quite a 
few.  I have looked in many places for a kit, and can only find rebuilt 
steering boxes (cha-ching$$$$).  I saw a thread in the archives from a 
guy who had purchased a new box in Mexico.  I understand that most of 
the rebuilt boxes are rebuilt in Brazil. I tried to use my knowledge of 
espanol to read some Portuguese sites looking for a rebuild kit, but 
haven't located one.  Does anyone know where to find one?

Thanks for your time,
Karen
