and how, my wifes tags were stolen and they used em on a stolen car in a
crime...they were caught but now my wife has had to go to court 3 times so
far just to say that she didn't lend them the tags even though there is a
police report.  getting em stolen and replaced is the easy part.

In my case my bus has vanity tags and if they get stolen you've lost the
name you have to get something else it can't just be replaced.

so I have my front tag in my windshield and I have riveted the rear tag
on..   I know a lot of folks on this list have vanity tags so be aware of
that if their stolen, their gone...
