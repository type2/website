Subject: RE: [T2] Need outdoor cover for camper 

Thanks for all the responses and information, everyone.  I ordered 
the Bus Depot cover.   For about 10 years the camper has been 
protected by a Covercraft cover made of a "breathing" fabric, from 
J. C. Whitney.  

This has worked well, and there's been very little new rust 
considering the constant rain and terrible humidity and heat here in 
west Alabama, USA.  However, they've doubled in price in the 
interim, and gray squirrels have cut out little circles of the material 
to line their nests until it was a tattered mess :-) 

As for the tag law problem, one could just punch a couple of screw 
holes in the cover and bolt the tag on the outside in the usual place, 
if the bus in long term storage.  Or, why not just lift up the bottom of 
the cover and tuck it behind the tag?  

Thanks again,
Doug
