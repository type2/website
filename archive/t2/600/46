Subject: Slider Cover(s) Removal

Howdy

Was wondering if somebody could let me know how the covers that are 
underneath the 2 rear windows of a 71 Westy come off the vehicle?
On one side its the cover that the side door slider is under.

I took the screws out and tapped it from underneath with a rubber mallot but 
they wont budge.
So before I go bending something I figure I better ask.

Thanks
Kevin
