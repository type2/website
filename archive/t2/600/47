Hi Volks,

Happy Friday!

This message is about a campout I'm attending two weeks from now... Its 
being hosted by the Ohio Valley Tribe of the Full Moon Bus Club, and 
the guy in charge is Frank Biffath.

The even takes place at Rustic Knolls Campground, near Mt Vernon Ohio, 
about 50 miles NE of Columbus. People start gathering there on Thursday 
and continue to roll in Friday as well. Saturday morning there's a 
carabus to a HUGE VW show, followed by some relax time at the 
campground and an award-winning chili dinner. NOTE: As a past Chili 
Judge at EveryBus from 2002-2003, I can assure you that Frank makes an 
incredibly good pot of chili. Easily the best I have ever tasted. 
Having camped near Frank at EveryBus I also know for certain that there 
will be a substantial campfire... but for some reason no-one around is 
able to tell who started it. "Who built that fire?" will be heard quite 
often.

On Sunday there will be a Full Moon Bus Club Burrito Breakfast, and 
then it'll be time for me to hit the road back to Toronto.

For more information, read Frank's "Expectations" page online here:

Happy trails,
