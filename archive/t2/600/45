I noticed a drastic difference when I dumped the "Bosch" filter and
installed a Mahle. The dipstick was noticably cooler.

Either better flow characteristics or more aggressive bypass valve.
;-) But either way, the oil must have been moving faster or something.

The "TouchTest" on the dipstick was done after my normal 5 mile drive
to work, on i5, doing 70-ish, when I was still running the 009 dizzy.
Haven't had a chance to see how a better advance curve will affect
things, but I doubt there'll be any difference in oil temps.

Oddly enough my independant FLAPS that I visit only sells the Mahle
filter. No Fram, or other junk brands.
