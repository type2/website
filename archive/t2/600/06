Subject: 71 rear bumper

I have a spare 71 bumper that I'm not going to use. It's a got some surface rust and is a little warped on one end, but nothing terrible. It could be repaired. I understand that no replacements are available commercially, so it might be worth fixing. I'm going to ask $25 for it and will bring it to HCBF Saturday if anyone wants it.
