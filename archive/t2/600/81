Subject: Re: [T2] Ball Joints Revisited

A machine shop in Berkeley charged me $15 each torsion arm to press 
out the old ball joint and press the new one in.  ($60 for all 4 
arms).

You need a special jig for T2 torsion arms, if you have a generic 
press you'll have to fabricate something that "bites" correctly. 
Same situation for installing Vanagon lower ball joints.

(Vanagon uppers are real easy, no special tools needed).
