Don't do that. That's how I ended up having to deal with the holes in my roof.

20 years ago we moved in very short notice to another country and we left 
our house and cars behind.
In order to protect the cars (the bus and a 1960 Studebaker) from the 
elements my parents used blue tarp
to cover them.... it seemed like a good idea at the time, but it was not. 
The blue tarp doesn't breath and  water
will get trapped between the plastic and the vehicle causing rust..
I started to bring back the bus. Haven't had the time nor the money to 
bring back the Studebaker to life... (rebuilt engine
  has been sitting inside the house for the past 20 years) Shell is still 
outside uncovered.... :-(
Definitely in the long run a real cover is cheaper... Thinking on buying 
the bus depot cover myself. I just need to figure
out how to deal with the parking permit sticker on the rear window and tags...
