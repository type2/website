Attention all Campers!
Lets go camping.  As we all know, we have been blessed by the continued
support and attendance at our events by the Canadian contingent.
I am making an offer to any and all that want to tag along with the HapyBus to
Buses of the Corn next week in Canada.

This is sure to be the most appealing event I have attended.  I have a pocket
full of quarters, I have my passport, I have a t-shirt to tie dye, I am ready
to win the Rodeo driving contest (since I like winning camp out
competitions).

Come one come all and join the HapyBus express  to Whitby Ontario Canada.
