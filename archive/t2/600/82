Subject: Lower engine mount studs for '78

Does anyone know, offhand, what size the lower engine mount studs for a 78
are?  One of mine seems to have gone missing...  out on the highway
someplace, I guess.

A bolt of the appropriate length would do the job too...  I just don't know
how long to get it (and is it an M10?)

Thanks.  :)
