Subject: Re: [T2] uh-oh, brake warning light on

Hi Zach,

Here's the procedure the PO used to fix the same problem on Sweet Pea:

1. reach under the dash and find the ground wire going to the brake light
2. pull firmly and smoothly towards the front of the bus, disconnecting the 
wire from the light
3. tape any bare wire connections to prevent shorts

I probably should track this one down and fix it, but my brakes work fine 
and I inspect them regularly.  If your parking brake is on, you'll know it 
when you reach for third gear and bang your hand.

Good Luck!
