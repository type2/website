Doug,

You can find these almost everywhere, from Walmart to the FLAPS.

I doubt that you will find a *quality* one big enough for a bus at that 
price.

http://www.carcoversdirect.com  and lots of others

They don't show Volkswagen buses, but pick any other van to see what they 
offer.  Read the difference on what "quality" means to them..indoor, 
outdoor, protection...

Cheers, dave
