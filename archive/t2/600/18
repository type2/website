What did the Police say? Why was your landlord going through your trash? Glad your landlord got the scare and glad your bus is coming together again. 

I have an old  Mk-15 Phalanx CIWS dummy shel.. Scared to get rid of it for fear the same episode might occur. <grin!>

Keep us updated on your progress. Maybe you could be the new repository of old busses in storage for listee consumption...
