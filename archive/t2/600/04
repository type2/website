Subject: Re: [T2] '74 Start No Run

herb......I had the very same problem happen on my old  '73 Corolla. As long 
as I was
turnining the key to start position it would run, let the key go to run 
position and it would
die. Turned out it was a resister that was mounted on or next to the coil and 
part of that
circuitry.  It was an easy remove and replace job as I recall. Hope your VW 
repair is as 
easy.........John
