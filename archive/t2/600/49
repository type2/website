Dean,

Look at this:

http://store.yahoo.com/comfort/polkittherwi.html

Mine generally runs about 2 years on a battery.

Hi/low alarms and you can get an extension for the probe at radio shack 
that changes the reading by about 2 degrees.

In boiling water at my altitude, it might be 2 degrees off to start with.

They will also sell you replacement probes for about $9.00.

Cheers, dave
