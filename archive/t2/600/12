Subject: Going on a long-ish drive...

Well, on 8/8 I have to drive to San Diego for a week long training
class. And, of course, we still haven't straightened out the
registration on the Acura and my wife wants the Volvo.

So the bus it is! ;-) 

Ok, I was secretly hoping to "have" to drive it, but my common sense
was telling me I shouldn't. LoL!!

I've never driven her more than a few miles, and now I have to go from
Anaheim to San Diego. Scary... I guess I've gotta do something about
that exhaust leak this weekend, and check all my tin seals and such.
Too bad my steering is still jacked. :( I tightened the adjustment on
the steering box as far as it would go and there's still no binding on
the steering. I guess that means new steering box, and of course my
73's box isn't cheap. So while there may still be ball joint issues
(haven't had the $$ to do those yet), it seems the box itself is bad.
(New drag link and tie rods have already been installed.)

One thing I'd really like to take care of is the interior, but that
won't be happening unfortunately.

So if you see a white hitop swerving all over the 5, wave! 

=D
