Thanks Karl,

You are an asset to this list unsurpassed  in the ability to supply 
accurate info so quickly.

Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!  I promise never to EVER ask you 
about westy cot poles.

Tonight I will be able to re-install the engine. My vacation plans 
remain unaffected, except that now I will no longer have to worry about 
the clutch from here to Dixie Bus Gathering (Mt Vernon OH) and back. A 
win-win situation!

Happy trails,
