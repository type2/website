Actually you will.  We have a new offering from Just Kampers in England
that at $129 would probably qualify as "$100 more or less," and it has a
unique feature not found on any other cover. As well as being custom fit
for a Bus or Vanagon (with or without poptop), it has zippered access to
the front and side doors, so you can get in without removing it. This is
a great idea, as you can load/unload your bus, start it periodically in
the winter, or just air it out.  There is a flap over the zipper so it
won't scratch your paint.
