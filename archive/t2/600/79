Subject: Re: [T2] Ball Joints Revisited

My Harbor Freight 20 ton press was about $160 complete with arbor plates.
However, I found it very difficult in getting just the tie rod off the ball
joint in order to install new rubber ball joint boots. I recall reports of
some shops bending presses trying to get ball joints out of torsion arms.
Some where in the achieves I read that heat was the best method of removing
ball joints Heating until cherry red and striking with a "BF" hammer were
terms I recall in the removal process.
