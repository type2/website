Subject: Small Town Terrorist Leads to Listee Bus Sighting

Ok so I am not a terrorist but I did cause a scene yesterday. My ex-landlord 
found a an old "Dummy" Claymore mine that I had from my days in the Army. I 
had put it out to the curb with a lot of junk during my move earlier this 
week. He was digging through my garbage and discovered the scare, called the 
Fire Dept. who called the Police, who called the bomb squad. Reporters 
caught wind of the situation. I did a small interview as the culpret of the 
live training exercise of the local authorities. Last night another reporter 
shows up at my house to do another interview and I couldn't help but have 
them do it with my bus in the background. He He. What took about twenty 
minutes to shoot turned out to be a fifteen second clip in the news. Only 
the trained eye of a listee could have made out it was actually a bus, but 
it was in there. This ex landlord is the same one that I fought in court 
about the removal of my bus from the house where I was living. Now I live 
next door and I am thinking about buying more of them in worse shape and 
parking them all along the border of the properties(Tagged of course). The 
reporter tried to insinuate that for the love of my bus and the grudge 
against the landlord that I could have been doing this as a means to really 
scare the Bajesus out of him. All though that would have made a better story 
it wasn't the case.

Now the move is over new shop is coming together. I was hoping to drive the 
bus to my next home but it did not work out. My wife got to as I towed it 
over, so this weekend I will be picking up where I left off and can't wait.
