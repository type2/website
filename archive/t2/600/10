I'm afraid to ask, but why was he digging through your garbage?

As in right next to your old landlord?  The next lot over?

Wish I could have been there to see his face when he uncovered that practice
claymore.  I wonder if the "This side toward enemy" printed on the front of
the claymore was facing up when he moved the banana peels? :O)

Bus content: Glad to hear that you were able to get your bus on the news.
Very cool.
