Subject: Engines & \tranny available in Utah

Just a reminder of the message I sent last month.  I have discounted the new engine $100 to move it.
 
New engines and tranny available in Utah
A few years ago I purchased a 1983 Vanagon to rebuild as a work
van.  I bought a rebuilt Rancho transaxle for it.  I
built up a  2 litre engine from scratch forit
including new barrels, heads, main and cam
shafts,hydralic lifters, and new oil pump as well as
bearingsand seals througout.  I then found a newer 91
waterboxer I liked better fora work van and the 83
has just been sitting.  The problem is I have more in
the unit than I can get forit  ($2095 and the whole
thng is yours) so I am goingto part it out as
follows:
 
TURN KEY engine option...............$1750..now $1650 Fresh built long block plus
cooling shroud and fan,heater boxes, intake manifold,
etc.just install the unit and turn the key!  (You
willneed your old dizzy as I am going to keep this one
toput back in my parts cache for the one I loaned to
aAIDS patient from Princeton NJ that he never
returned)
 
Long Block Only................$1500... now $1400  (Brand
NewHeads)Put you own skin and manifold , etc  and
installI also have a rebuilt but slightly used short
blockout of a 77 availabe.  I rebuilt this engine for
my77 Westy a few years ago and shortly thereafter had
arocker arm stud break on one of the heads.  I bought
awhole replacement engine off a railroad action, so
Inever reused this engine.
 
SHORT BLOCk................$400
Fairly fresh rebuilt case up with
barrels and pistons(no heads)
 
77 REBUILT Head  (Left).........................$95
 
Usedpair of 83 heads (notrebuilt but good shape)  ($100)
Put these on the 77 short block and use for a 79-through 83
 
80-83 091 Fresh Rebuild Rancho Tranny............$500 
 
'78 091 used Tranny( I saved this tranny for a guy in Port
Heunume,California, but I crashed my computer disc
last springand lost his name and address.  If you are
stillinterested please get back to me or I will sell
thisalso)

listees: Keep this list and my phone number so when you
burn up that 30 year old engine this year traversing
the Rockiesyou'll have a replacement close at
hand.Engines and Trannys warranteed for 10,000 miles--
Bring back the unit, I 'll return the Money
