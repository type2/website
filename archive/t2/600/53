Hiya Kevin,

I'd echo Karl's advice and add this.....................

I had to pull those covers off the Duck a couple of years back when she was 
painted.  I had heard that the track covers could be obstinate even with the 
piece of  2x4 and a hammer.  Obstinate doesn't even begin to describe it!  30+ 
years of sun, dirt, and rain had effectively set those covers in place.  
I had to work on them for quite a while.  Problem is that brute force will 
not get the job done either.  After all these are sheet metal parts which will 
distort under unbalanced pressure.  So.........you just need to take it slow 
and easy with a reserve of patience.
