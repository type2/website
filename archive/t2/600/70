Better suggestion: encourage it to send the mail to a NEW mailbox or folder called Type2... 

I have my own archive with 15K+ messages. Easier than searching for stuff in the archives sometimes. Technically Eudora sends copies of all Type2 mail to my "archive" folder which I never edit AND to my "Newmail Type2" mailbox which I dump daily to keep the new mail separated from old mail. Scan the subjects, answer a few, and dump the rest. You folks can get off topic all you want with me - delete is fast... <grin!>

I sort ALL of my mail into mailboxes and archive 3 lists I subscribe to. I also archive cerrtain people's posts too because their info is generally so entertaining or informative. 

My FILTERS are a 150+ step process. I just add a new one when I need to. 

Also I recommend "Mailwasher" to screen out the SPAM. P-mail if you want help with that. If you are going to use it, holler, I have a huge filter list in that and I can share that with you.
