No, 215 bolts are 7mm.

210 and 228 are 8mm.

The correct 215 bolts are triple-square. They are 7 x 1.0 x 20mm



> Greg, are not the bolts you are talking about
 8X125X45mm, about a inch long. Should be able to get
 them at Lowe's or Home Depot in the automotive Bolt's
 section of hardware. I got some here but it would take
 a week or longer to send them. Phil ( Easley, SC.)
