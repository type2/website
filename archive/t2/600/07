Subject: Re: [T2] rear wheel play?

Chris and others; 

I removed the rear wheels last night and played around with the hubs. The
play I felt at 12 and 6 on the right rear was very very slight at the hub,
not enough to worry about for now. No play in and out. The play at the
left rear was slightly more, and it would also move in and out a small
amount, similar to how you describe (and the axle nuts are tight with
cotter pins in place). 

Certainly the bearings are worn. I suspect that they will be ok for my
upcoming trip, as they roll smoothly and quietly and have been freshly
cleaned and repacked. 

I don't have time to replace them anyway, but things should be fine for
the trip and I'll get to them in the early fall. 

Thanks all for your help and suggestions. Hopefully I won't need them from
the road! 

Back in 18 days...off to the Rockies at last!
