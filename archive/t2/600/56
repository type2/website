Volks, let me clarify, I've tried Bus Depot, Bus boys, BFY Obsolete, 
Automotive Machine, GO Westy, Aircooled.net, BustedBus, some other 
websites that I can't remember, and a bunch of local shops and I've 
emailed a few shops in Brazil and the UK but haven't heard from them yet...
and ideally I want to find a rebuild kit.  I do know where to buy a 
rebuilt box
thanks again,
Karen
