Hi Herb,

It may be the ignition switch, or it could be the ignition barrel. 
There is no ignition relay in a 74 bus unless added by a previous 
owner. But the wiring is very simple, and you can find a color wiring 
diagram for your bus at www.vintagebus.org.

You can find the take-apart instructions for the ignition barrel here:

Question: Is your bus fuel injected? (1974 CA buses were FI) If so then 
it could be a problem with the airflow meter or the double-relay.

Happy trails,
