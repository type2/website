Subject: Remote cooking thermometer for oil monitoring

Awhile back there was a long thread about using $3 and $12 manual and
digital thermometers to measure oil temps. through the dipstick,
including the $40+ Porsche ones.
Somewhere in there was the descriptions of VDO sump oil temp senders and guages.

I remembered this as tonight I got my foam seal in (even went around
blocky tack on rusted off replacement tin) my bus, and was an inch
short.  I'll blame it on the section that only had 1/8'' clearance due
to funky tin and I had to bridge over it but seal looks good, but I
likely just didn't keep it pulled tight enough.Gap is on back wall.  I
took Don's advise and patched duct pass-through holes (and 2 holes on
the non-battery tray) with roofing flashing and "high temp metal
epoxy".

Then I went searching for digital thermometer, as I didn't see
anything like what was mentioned here at my Wal*Mart months ago.
Amazon had a couple, but what caught my eye was this $40 dual probe
remote-read-out backlit smoker guage. (Yes, I'm a gadget geek,
although on a 4 kid budget.)

a. Think it would work?

b. What would you stick the "short stick" too?

c. Is $40 + shipping that much more of a cost and value benefit over
the more formal sump or dipstick sensor and guages?

Happy Friday,

p.s. Got my lights working (crusty lights and unconnected ground wire)
and oil pressure sensor swapped!! Orig. sensor had VW and 73 stamped
on it. Got it at NAPA via ordering by on-line vendors part #  to get
it quick. Saw a thread on samba that mentioned different thread
possibilities--straight and tapered. I haven't double check yet, but
should I be concerned?
Still need to inspect Holley for proper part #.
