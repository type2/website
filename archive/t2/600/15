could always run to the home store and grab a blue plastic tarp the right

a Question, our city has been ticketing any untagged visible vehicle (even
if on private property) and will tow it after so many days,  if covered
with something like this the TAGS MUST BE VISIBLE!! I have seen these
covers now with clear plastic at the location of the vehicles tags. just
wondering if this cover would be like that or would you have to cut a hole
for the tag to show thru????

one cities solution I guess to too many abandoned vehicles.
