Subject: Getting to brake reservior, 84 Vanagon

The owner's manual's description of how to get to the brake fluid 
reservoir is not helping me -- I'm a bit simple, I guess. It says that 
the reservoir is under the instrument cluster -- can't find it. Is it 
forward of the gear shift lever? There is a large plastic cover there 
which sorta comes loose on the driver's side but the passenger side is 
stubborn and I don't want to force it.
