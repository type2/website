Subject: Re: [T2] uh-oh, brake warning light on

Well on my 73 there are two sensors one for each chamber of the master
cylinder.  I would think its when your having problems with your master
cylinder as well.  I don't ever remember seeing wires go to a contact
anywhere near the parking break.  If you were working on the wiring, did
this happen right after? I don't know exactly how those sensors work but I
know there is two wires off of each one, if I'm remembering correctly.  If
they are pressure based, then pushing on the pedal would increase pressure
and cause it to turn off.   I know wiring can be a pain but if you look at
the diagrams you can isolate the systems to make it easier to figure out
what's wrong.

If your master cylinder is failing and it happens to be in the rear, you
might not notice a big difference in breaking.  From what I understand the
rear only makes up about 20% of the breaking and with drum breaks that's
even worse than that possibly.  At least the 73 has a master cylinder that
is essentially 2 breaking systems.  So the rear can fail and the front could
still be functioning correctly.

I personally would check both till I was satisfied.

If you don't have any manuals I can check mine and see what I can find on
the wiring stuff..
