I don't see any difference. How much more secure is your plate in the
original location versus a foot lower (unless the thief in 	question
is amazingly short :-)?  If a thief needed a license plate, he could
steal just about any plate from any car anywhere in about 10 seconds
with nothing but a flathead screwdriver or a knife blade. They're not
exactly kept under lock and key to begin with.
