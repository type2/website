Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Pedal = Stalled Engine

per the original post:

>>Should there be any change in the rpm's when the pedal is pressed? 
 I checked
the lines leading to the brake servo and the "check" valve, all are
functioning 100% with no leaks.<<

no, there should be no change when the pedal is pressed.

since you have stated that the check valve is operating properly,
be sure it is not installed backwards.

good luck,
