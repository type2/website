Subject: Re: [T2] Response from Nokian

My experience when I got my CQ tires two years ago was that I had to request
these tires specifically.  The tire shop knew about the special requirements
for the tires for our vehicles, but they didn't know that Nokian carried
them until they went looking for the CQs.  It had also been a few years
since they put tires on an air-cooled VW - the kid that was trying to drive
my bus into the shop was unable to find reverse...
