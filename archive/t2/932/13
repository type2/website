If you don't have a checkvalve and had a backfire,
that could do in the diaphragm. Unless the idle is
already too low due to other issues... and using the
booster is just enough additional vacuum "leak"
(usage) to kill the motor. As I recall, the hose end
at the booster moves with every application, right? If
this is so, there could be a break in the hose right
up front there that is opening up when you step on the
pedal. -BaH
