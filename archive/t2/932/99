Subject: Re: [T2] chains (Don!)

Don - It wasn't for YOU! You already know about
chains.
I used to have both fronts chained on my WW2 jeep in 1
minute flat (I was 17 years old at the time !) It
takes me about a half hour now with the bus - with
time out for warming up and resting. Didn't need
either back then!

Here's one for you: What do you do when you've been
driving in rain and puddles, go up into freezing
weather and park for 4-5 hours and start your bus...
only to find that the brakes have frozen to the drums!
Keep in mind that there is about six inches of fresh
powder snow atop a sheet of glare ice. Oh - one more
thing - peeing on them is not going to be allowable as
it's a "family" parking lot. Oh - and no, the parking
brake was not set - nobody's that stoopid! -Busahaulic
P.S. Chains required on I-90 and US2 east of here as I
write this.
