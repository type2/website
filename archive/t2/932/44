Subject: Re: [T2] black wire on Alternator harness goes where?

Greg said:

I just reinstalled the 2L engine back in the westfakia and its 55A
alternator wiring harness has a thin black wire that I can't seem to
match up with any unused connectors.  The bus seems to run OK without
it connected and the alt light is not coming on.

 Anyone got an idea what that wire connects to?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

That alternator harness came from a Westfalia bus.

The black wire is the signal wire that went to the relay mounted on the left side for the aux battery, to
energize the relay so the 2nd battery will charge.
