The point is not who is or isn't "protected" and we
all very well know it. The point is that the forum is
for content pertinent to VW Type twos. If there is no
relevence and the forum is used for the purpose of
slinging mud at an individual regardless of whether
you or I think it is warranted, it is inappropriate
for this group. It is unfortunate that a person would
deprive himself of such a great resource as this
because he thinks somebody else should be deprived of
it. Sad, truly sad. In theory, I should have my wrist
slapped for posting this, but I participated in
another group where everyone was "walking on
eggshells" all the time so they wouldn't offend any of
the group bullies. In a sense, this is the same thing.
If everybody worried about setting standards for
themselves and trying to meet them rather than setting
standards for others to meet, the world would not be
in the sad state it is in. Iraq war? Look in the
mirror! -BaH
