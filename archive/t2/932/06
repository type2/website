Subject: ADMIN Re: [T2] what would grove the push rod

This subject has been killed by a list administrator already and my 
patience is wearing thin.

Just so there is no misunderstanding, I'll sum it up again.  The subject 
of this list is type2 VW's.  Not jokes, not alledged transgressions by 
listmembers, and most certainly not personal attacks.
