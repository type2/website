Subject: Re: [T2] what would grove the push rod

Mario - when you look at it, is there any indication
as to whether this is a current condition or is it
likely that it happened before the rebuild or even an
out-of-engine event during the rebuild? It seems to me
unlikely to have occurred at the bottom end where you
found it. If it did occur inside the engine, my
suspicion is that it was inverted previously and the
problem occured in the head area.

No, I have not seen it personally, but I like David's
suggestion that it could have been caused by the
failure or incorrect installation of the retainer
spring-wire that holds against the tops of the tubes.
Very likely scenario. -BaH
