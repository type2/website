Subject: Re: [T2] Heat

Yah, heater core.. in my 74 Bus :)

The heater I had in my 78 worked great.
I drove it back from Edmonton one winter in -41 Celcius
I was soo darn cold it wasn't funny. Wind blowing snow
all over the place you couldn't see. It was putting out good
heat but the wind was stripping it off the bus faster than it
would put it out. I was in my insulated coveralls and over that
I had an army sleeping bag good to -50ish or something.
I was sooo cold it wasn't funny.
But yah, my 74 must have heater core problems...
you figure CLR might help if I run it through the system while
the bus is running? ;)

My 74 doesn't have a heater, It wasn't working and I took
it out.. it didn't have the same ducting as the 78 did. When I
can afford it Im putting in a small propane furnace. All I need
it $800 :)

Heater core?  ;-).  Seriously, I'll have to demonstrate my BA6 heater to you
someday - I had the snow melting off my windshield in a couple of minutes
yesterday.  It is a bit colder today, but it's not snowing anymore.

For the folks not in the middle of the Great White North like James and I
are, we had freezing rain two nights ago, it snowed 13cm (5.25 inches)
yesterday, and today the temperature high was -13C (8F).

James, it was -23C (-9F) when I went to work this morning ;-).

To bring things slightly more on topic, the Nokian CQ tires were great
yesterday.  I didn't get stuck, but I did help push a couple of cars out of
the parking lot at work and a camero through an intersection.
