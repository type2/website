Subject: Still looking for a Bodyshop in Maryland

Not having much luck with any referrals to get my bus painted. I have not yet started thumbing through the yellow pages as I was hoping to find a shop that someone on the list has used and would recommend. I dont mind going to VA either as long as were not talking too far. Ideally Baltimore would be best. If I have to start shopping blind for this I suppose I will. Other than asking for references from the potential body shops any other recomendations you guys want to suggest?
