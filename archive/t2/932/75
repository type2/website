So pre dry rotting the Tyre's prior tousing them is the best longevity
ticket.

I've got some new Dunlop K-70's 20 years old that have been in storage.

Anyone need a set of new scooter tyre's they want to toss on their
restored Triumph, BSA, Norton, Royal Enfeild, AJS, Brough Superior, or
Vincent, that want rock hard, pre dry rotted, and Motherland correct?

I don't think I'd be making any high end runs with them mounted.
