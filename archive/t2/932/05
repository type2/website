Subject: Starter for a 73?

Hey guys,

    I bought a Porsche 944 a couple of weeks back, and I bought a new starter
for it. It's a BRAND NEW Bosch starter for the 2.5 Porsche motor.
Unfortunately, it's NOT the "CCW" (Counter-ClockWise) starter and it was
actually making my engine rotate backwards. I didn't realize this until it was
too late and I couldn't return it. Someone was kind enough to make me aware of
this fact, and why I couldn't get the 944 to start.

I've since corrected the issue, and I ordered a CCW Bosch starter over the
internet (specified as a CCW). Now, I've got this brand spanking new Bosch
starter that I cannot return and I was wondering... it appears as though
practically every european car uses a Bosch starter. Is there any chance that
I might be so lucky that this clockwise (normal) starter is the exact same
kind that will fit my Type-2 Bus with the 1800cc motor???

Please, PLEASE say it's so...


Thanks,

Todd
