Subject: Seat Belts?

Hey guys,

    Would anyone mind very much providing me with some pictures of the front
of their bus, specifically what I'm looking for are pictures of the seat
belts, how they mount, and which ones go where?

I have a huge collection of seat belts that I have NO idea where they came
from. When I got my Bus, it was gutted and what was in there was in boxes.
None of the seat belts were attached. I was able to figure out the shoulder
and lap belts for the front seats, but I'm confused with the other half of the
seat belts in the front. I have a 73, so I'm not sure how that differs from
the other years, but I have the "walkway" between the two front seats.
Attached to the seat pedastals is apparently where the latch to the seat belt
attaches to. However, I have 2 sets of holes on either seat. I'm guessing that
maybe the other holes are in case I've got a center seat or something??? And
then I'm curious as to exactly which belts go in there. Is it the one that has
the flat metal blade, so to speak? Or are the loose fabric seat belts attached
to there?  I'm trying to put everything back to stock. If anyone also has any
pictures of what washers go there too, I would appreciate seeing it. (if it is
the metal seat belt latch, then is it supposed to swing freely from there?)


Thanks!!!

Todd
