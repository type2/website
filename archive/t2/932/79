The kits contain everything you need and are very cheap and a rebuild
of a solex is easy. Probably take you 3-4 hours first time you do it.
Just make sure you have some injector clearer and compressor to blast
the thing clean.

The key is the order, from memory the choke out via 3 scews, then
under the plastic cap you can see how to remove the diaphragm.
Everything else is fairly obvious sequence wise.

There are plenty of much better guides via google tho or haynes that I
have used which will take you step by step
