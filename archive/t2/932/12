Pretty tough bleeding yourself without using a
checkvalve to keep the out> fluid out! I really like
the checkvalve bleeders for this.

Okay, here's atrick that works: Clamp a vice grip or
some other clamp that will stick downward - to the
brake pedal arm under the front of the bus. Tie a rope
or strap to it such that when you pull the rope, it
pulls the pedal down. It works best if you arrange it
so that you can pull it with your leg, or wrap it
around your torso such that you can do a half-roll and
the pedal comes down. That leaves both hands for
bleeder screw operation. Just as you start pulling,
loosen the screw, and just before you bottom out the
pedal stroke, tighten the screw.

Do the furthest wheel 1st, next closest, etcetera. You
may need to refill the reservoir several times. Don't
let it get down to where you're getting more air in.
Don't forget to remove the vice grips! -BaH
