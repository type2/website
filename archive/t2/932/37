Subject: rivera pop top seal?

I have a general tip on seals. Take a piece of the the worn out stuff to a salvage yard. I found that mid-'80's Volvo trunk seals are better than OG for splitty safari window frame to body seals.   My '71 propane powered Chevy truck has reversed BMW 320i door seals that are better than stock. (Thanks to Karl's sharp eye!) I must have paid all of 3 dollars for each seal. It isn't the price so much, but the better materials and technology.  European vehicles have better parts, BMW, Mercedes, Volvo, etc.

Also, FLAPS carry generic "knock on" trim of various sizes.
