  I have tried searching the archives but am still at a loss.  THought I had
the problem figured out, but now fear I'm In uncharted waters!  She starts

ordered rebuilt AFM  (after testing unit with my multi meter >  finally got
here and installed it  >>  NOTHING ?.  I.  Wire to the gauge to head temp unit

square 1.  Fires  runs briefly>  unplug wiring harness and she runs idles
(luckly  died in the garage)  I asked the only local VW guy for advice & he
said sounds like you still havn't found the problem,  ha ha  ish.  Maybe he is
upset  have only had to use him once.  No house calls, really would like to
get her running.  I am figuring I need to test all sending units?  Fuel pum
engages when turned over.  Any advice appreciated.  This fuel Injection is a
new issue, the rest of her is pretty good,   Thanks    Peace     Devin
