Subject: It was running when I parked it...

So this week I got to thinking about this statement in the VW world, "It ran
when I parked it". It seems to be especially common when a type 2 is for
sale.

 

My history of buses with this statement:

 

68 Double Cab, PO "It ran when I parked it". (0 lbs of compression on each
cylinder, cracked case, scored crank) I tossed the motor and restored it.

79 Transporter, PO "It ran when I parked it".  (0 lbs of compression on each
cylinder) Parted Out for my DC project

78 Green Westy, PO "It ran when I parked it".  (0 lbs of compression on each
cylinder) Parted Out, spit on, kicked out of town 

78 Dakota Westy, PO "It ran when I parked it".  (73lbs, 109lbs, 75lbs, 85lbs
of compression and a nearly catastrophic main bearing failure) I keeping
this one though, it is just too nice and it did technically "run".

 

SO, my question is for this Friday: Has this happened to any of you, or do I
have a rare gift?

 

Share your stories of the "It was running when I parked it." sale or any
other common statement like, "the motor was just rebuilt by a VW engineer"
or "I just drove it to some far-off distant land".
