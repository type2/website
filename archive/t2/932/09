Subject: Re: [T2] scary noise

I didn't have time to read the other replies. It got
really bad when you slwed way down. It got worse when
steering one way, less the other way. I suspect you
shut the motor down as soon as you got stopped so you
could not tell if it went away from stopping or from
the engine stopping. It sounds like it is related to
the rotation of the wheels / axles. Could be a CV
joint failing or actually coming unbolted from one of
the drive flanges. It could simply be your first
experience with a CV rubber boot coming apart. It
could also be the parking brake mechanism banging
against the heads of the lug studs that hold the tire
on. When the brakes are way loose, the parking brake
mechanism flops around in there and although the heads
on those studs are fairly flat, they stick out enough
to make a heck of a clatter. A right swerve would be
the left side and a left swerve loder would be the
right side. Of course, if the engine makes the noise
without the bus moving, all bets on CV's and brake
parts are off! -BaH
