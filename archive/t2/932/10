Subject: Good bye, all

Well, it is kind of a sad day for me.  Been on here a
while.  

However, it is time to vote with my feet.  If Mario
the Criminal is a respected member of this site and
someone who is to be protected by these admins, it's
time to walk with my feet.  

It's funny because I remember how quickly you kicked
Arky the Master Race guy off.  Yet a criminal remains
on the list.  

Good bye!  See you on Samba or Full Moon!
