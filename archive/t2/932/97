	No such thing  -  Vauxhall is the Brit car firm bought up by 
GM, whose Brit lorries are branded Bedford.

	He must have heard from our old taxi driver.
	To make a tyre last double or treble the mileage is a 
considerable economy.  You pay the price of less grip than the rubber 
gives when new.
	But these are relatively fat tyres, and radial, so the 
footprint is pretty large.

	That is a point.
