Subject: Ditching the Standard Solex....  Or should I ????

 Hello all... 

I am having real trouble in getting my CU 2 litre dual solex (007 dizzy)
engine running....

Having rebuilt the dizzy and re-done all the vacuum tubes, I cannot get the
engine to run well, and am beginning to suspect the carbs.

Has anyone ever replaced the dual solex PDSIT setup with a single carb?

Webber etc..?

Otherwise I am thinking about rebuilding the carbs...  I will check for air
leaks tonight using WD40, but has anyone any experience of using rebuild
kits ?  What's the level of difficulty?
