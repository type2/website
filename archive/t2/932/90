Subject: Removing stubborn oil pump?

Subject says it all.  I'm trying to get the oilpump out of my engine
for a rebuild and it doesn't seem to want to budge.  I soaked the
whole thing in pb blaster, stuck my strongest screwdrivers behind the
"ears" and nothing.  Is it just one of those things that you have to
keep at and it'll eventually come loose or is there a trick I'm
missing?
And just to clarify, it's not moving at all.  It's not like it's
cocked too much or anything, I can't even get a fingernail between the
cover and the case.
And yes, all 4 nuts and washers are off (cuz I know someone will ask ;) )


Thanks in advance for the help
