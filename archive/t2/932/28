Subject: Washington DC sharing...

Anyones out there that want to share in parting out a '78 Westy??  yours,
mine, or a friend's who's not at home !?!?!?

Seriously, I am considering acquiring another '78 Westy that may be in
better shape, body rust wise, than my current '78 Westy, and I would like to
rework the new '78s body with a fresh paint job and then swap all my good
'78 parts into the re-done '78.

My current '78 has a busted right front door, and bunches of rust holes, but
I would probably come out of this with much extra parts, along with the
extra parts I already have ( 1 and 1/2 spare 2000 engines plus one reworked
2000 engine; progressive carbs for the type 4 with manifolds; pop top and
things; Westy interior(s); glass and more glass!!)

While I am trying to keep the herd down to one, there are/will be extras to
be had...  But I would like someone to share some expenses and rewards.

My last donation of 10 tires/rims went well, but that was to someone on
thesamba.
