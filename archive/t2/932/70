Subject: Altenator hook up

OK, I've looked in the library and the archives
75 westy motor in a 77 transporter, carb by necessity.  To hook up altenator

Big red wire to bat lug on starter
Blue/green wire to indicator light in dash if I can find it in harness 
(excitor, exciter, making happyer)
Red wire sensing wire to battery?
Brown wire to ground?
Black wire left over from westy 2nd battery charging solenoid?

Question marks indicate I'm certain I don't know, no question marks indicate 
I don't know I don't know or that I actually do know.
