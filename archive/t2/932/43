I might add, that in doing this test, you are really only testing the 
engine-running state of the fuel switch; you aren't testing the 
cranking-state.  In other words, the double relay also serves the 
purpose of running the fuel pump while the engine is cranking.  So, if 
the car starts and runs w/ the pump running (via screwdriver in AFM, 
jumpers, etc), but not when cranking on it's own, then it's probably a 
wiring issue between the starter and the double relay.  But that's 
pretty easily tested with a test light on the ignition crank-switched 
line (I believe the white/red wire) while you're cranking...
