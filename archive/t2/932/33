Subject: Re: [T2] rivera pop top seal?

Matt.... i couldnt find the seal besides what depot has..... you can buy and do youreself in lenghts....
   
  i ended up using a 1/2 inch pipe insulation for a temp insulator... worked well....
   
  also use the 1/2 inch pipe insulation on my wifes 69 beetle hood seal and works great....
   
  the insulation will wear out and shrink up a bit but works good in a bind until you can find a new seal.... i dont have my penthouse on on the bus no more ,... its in the backyard now.... being used as a shelter till i can restore it... just the top....... good luck ... 
   
  check with www.mikesimportparts.com also.... he might be able to help you out...
   
  peace
