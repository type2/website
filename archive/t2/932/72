Subject: windscreen washer doubles as douche

	One of the last steps  -  I hope  -  in restoring my ''73 
Devon to specs is to get the windscreen washer working.  So I slap 
detergent soln in the bottle under the dash, and slam in 45 psi air.
	The expected two jets appear when I pull the wipers lever. 
Goodly break!
	But the compressed air is also squirting the liquid into my 
crotch, groin, and lower abdomen.  In some tropical climes this might 
be welcome, especially perhaps for a certain class of female driver 
;-).  But Auckland is sub-tropical only, and I can't say i welcomed 
this additional mode of squirt, which ran down the air reserve long 
before the water.  Bummer  ...
