sounds like the problem I was fighting with for weeks,  found out that the
replacement AFM was bad.  try to borrow a KNOWN good unit and try it out.


also check your double relay. with air vane moved slightly it will turn on
the fuel pump.

  basically your starter turns on the fuel pump until the engine starts
then the AFM has to keep the fuel pump running.  so you can start but
can't run.  with the AFM unplugged it basically "Sucks" just enough fuel
to idle but can't do anything else.

check the double relay is working and check the "New" AFM is any good.
