Subject: Re: [T2] Heat

I have a diesel model Espar heater that I got a good
deal on from a dealer near Seattle. They had purchased
a bunch of them expecting to sell them for truck
sleeper-cab heaters. I got mine for under $1500. I
have not had it installed since I put the Subey in,
but do plan on re-installing it, as it is a wonderful
survival gear addition. In temps in the teens
(farenheit) it forced me to wear t-shirt while
driving! It will run continuously for over 48 hours on
two gallons of diesel. I had a remote hooked up so
that on those cold winter mornings, when I first got
out of bed I'd walk over to the living-room window and
click the remote out toward the bus. The LED came on
and I knew it would be toasty when I went out to go to
work! These things are phenomenal - only as big as a
loaf of bread and I guarantee you will be cracking a
window open in all but the most frigid weather! If you
plan on having a bus forever and you live in cold
climate, it is easily one of the two best investments
you can make! (The other? a Subaru conversion! Just
kidding die-hards!) -BaH
