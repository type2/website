Where did you install it on your bus?  I've occasionally thought about
getting one of these and putting it in the same place the current gas heater
is installed.  The BA6 works great, but it is getting to be old, requires
maintenance and I occasionally worry about cracks letting exhaust
recirculate in the cab.
