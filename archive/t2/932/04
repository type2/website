Subject: Re: [T2] Seat Belts?

Coincidentally, I just put retracting seatbelts in the front of my bus this
weekend, so I just removed my stock seatbelts.  The buckle on the flat metal
blade goes on the front.  On my bus, it was in the topmost of the two
holes.  I'm not sure what goes in the other holes.  I don't think it's
supposed to swing freely, but on mine the driver's side buckle would stay in
place and the passenger side would often swing down.  Unfortunately, I don't
have any pictures.
