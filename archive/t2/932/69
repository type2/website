Wow. It took longer to read that than put them on. =)

I got really good at chains when I lived in Big Bear, CA. Regardless
of the vehicle or tires, unless it's 4x4 you have to have chains as
soon as one flake hits the ground. Stupid laws.

BaH is right, though. And I still keep a set of cable chains in the
Guac for when the cops make me use 'em. Though they'd disintegrate in
minutes on the Nokians since the tread lugs would rip them apart.
