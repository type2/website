Todd -

Well, the only starter shown in Bosch for the 73 Bus is the SR15, but the
self-supporting SR17 will work.  How does one figure rotation?  If you look
at a SR15 or SR17 at the Front (gear side) of the starter, it appears
to rotate CCW.  If you look from the back (closed) end of the starter, it
appears to rotate CW.  The aircooled VW engine rotates CW.

But the important question to answer is what Bosch Starter Number you
were sold, so that a proper answer as to interchange can be given.  There
are several hundred Bosch starters of different configurations just for the
past 5 years of several European vehicle makes (Audi, Porsche, BMW,
Mercedes, Skoda, Fiat, Seat, etc., let alone starters for the 70s era.
