Subject: '74 type 2 pressure plate "bolts"

Hi!! I have just completed the most incredible part search Oddesy, on
Vancouver Island, looking for one of the socket head 7mm Allen bolts for the
Pressure plate to flywheel.  Met some amazing people and learned a lot, and
these people seem to agree that the '73 74 "big pressure plate, was the only
one to use these, as well as the 411, and finally I have
the clutch installed, heads and barrels on, and am getting excited to see this
"piece of basement furniture", get completed.  Were these socket head allen
bolts only used by VW for this short time, and......wait for it.....why?
Sid
