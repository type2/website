Richard,

You could go back to the original wiring (which buzzes when the door is
open) and add a different buzzer for when the lights are on and the engine
is off.  See:

(Adding a small piezoelectric buzzer to the headlight switch with minimal
(none!) hacking into the wiring.)

A very elegant, easy and inexpensive way to avoid those
"I-left-my-lights-on-and-needa-jump" blues.  8^)

This works great.  Thanks to Barry B.
