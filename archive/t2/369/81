I don't think I've seen a westy from that period (the '71) with  
two-tone paint and beltline trim.  I didn't think deluxes were  
converted to westies.  But despite the makeover on various things  
(upholstery, curtains, paneling, floor) it doesn't look like a home-do.  
  Did someone put all the westy gear on a deluxe sunroof?

I love the floor -- what's that behind the passenger seat - a heater  
vent? :-)

Nice looking & unusual.
