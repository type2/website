Subject: Stock manifold source (was heat riser repair)

If you're looking for a stock single port manifold, I found this one:

http://store.cip1.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=VWC-113-129-701-K&Category_Code=02-06-03-04

Under $50 with shipping in continental US.  No connection with them.  I'm going by the FLAPS this afternoon for some other stuff & see if they have 
em.
