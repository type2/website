Ah, google.  It appears to be something like the wheel lug tool in the 
stock tool roll - a kind of socket with hex outside walls:

I have a small one of these that I think is VW-issued and appears to be 
13mm inside, 17mm outside.  Silvery instead of brown/black.  It's a 
little flimsy -- most of the drain plugs I've encountered are really 
snugged.
