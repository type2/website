Subject: Re: [T2] Carb Cleaner

Matthew,

Don't know where you are, but I picked one up several months ago
at Autozone.  Noticed they also had them at the local O'Reilly's.

Yes, it is paint can size, smells bad and will burn you a little.
Wash off with water when finished cleaning.

I believe mine was made by chemtool...comes with a little metal strainer 
inside and was sitting on the bottom shelf just below all of the other
carb cleaner type stuff that doesn't go into your gas tank.

Yes, you do need this...diesel won't really do.  You could use several
small cans of liquid b-12 chemtool also...very explosive!

Cheers, dave
