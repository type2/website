Hi Dave,

In the old days (When I was young and stoopid) I had a 72 westy with a 
914 engine. I had no problem using a tow-bar to pull a baja beetle 200 
miles to a friends cottage. It took a lot of patience to get up to 
highway speed and a lot of planning to get it stopped again safely.

I'm nicer to my buses now than I used to be.

Happy trails,
