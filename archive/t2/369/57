Subject: Re: [T2] Carb Cleaner (IMHO)

I did it, more than once Matthew:
http://www.letambourin.com/west_carbu_rebuilt1.htm

If the carbs works ok, don't touch them! (Until they die!)
I would only change the intake/carbs gasket! (Even!)

I have 3 sets of working Solex 34-PICT (+ 8 others single in parts), 
every set as a different problem! None is working properly after all 
have been rebuilt. (Well, one is working OK)
The aftermarket rebuilt kit sucks, the 2 float valve included in the kit 
are... marginal, not to say cheap!

I don't want to spoil your day but they spoiled more than one (day) day 
for me, I can say weeks!
Work done:
-Re-bush the throttle shaft
-Soak and clean (air pressure)
-new parts & gasket (rebuilt kit)
-New choke element

They still suck! They were good 30 years ago, i have no doubt, but now 
there are old, that mean that they are somewhat bent.
The "flatness" of the matting intake/carbs does no longer seal, the 
upper linkage holder (near choke) is often bent/crooked also (mine broke 
in Mexico!).

But more important, the central, idling system! This is the main 
problem! All adjusting screws (mixture, idle) hole was scorch over the 
years by PO trying to adjust those, so each new O-ring won't last!

I don't want to be a downer! But I have spent to much time on those 
carbs in the past 6 month, I also somewhat "Spoiled" my last trip 
struggling with those carbs, every single day of my trip!

There is only one option for me now! "Injection" for now, and later, 
maybe dual Weber or Dell!

List member warned me a few months ago, I didnt listen to them! I 
should have done so! I guess that if they work good, thats good, if 
not, stop struggling with them!

Still, I sincerely wish you good luck!
