Subject: '78 tranny into '71

Yes a '78 tranny will fit in a '71.

As far as I know, the only thing you need to change is to swap the
bellhousing with a tranny from a type 1.  If there is anything else, please
chime in.

In fact, I am looking for a late 091 trans like that for my '70 Westy now
that I have an 1835, for some highway cruisin'.  However, I think that a '78
trans might be too highly geared for a stock 1600 especially if you like the
mountains.  If you decide to sell it, please let me know!
