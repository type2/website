Subject: axle differences 71-79

I just did the opposite this week on my 71, using a beam from a 78.  I 
used my 71 spindles and discs and hubs on the 78 beam with 78 ball 
joints with no problem, so I assume you could use a 71+ beam, and put 
your 79 spindles on it.  Just go slow, and keep everything organized, 
so you dont lose something like the nut and bolt that hold the clutch 
pedal to the lever like I did.
