Mark,

I am not sure about this, but try fat performance. Also rimco will have
some, as they remanufacture heads all the time. Any machine shop in fact
that does type IV heads will have lots of bad cores with good studs.

I looked around a bit online and did not find a source for them new, but fat
does not have a catalog on their web site.
