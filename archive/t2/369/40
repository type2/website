2.5 tons is stretching it - only did it once when I used my 1600DP to tow
its replacement with a busted engine home - limiting factor were the brakes

I use my bus regularly though to tow other old cars (mostly my Opels) on  a
trailer. This is a 74 Westy with a factory (European style) hitch that
attaches to the rear bumper mounts. These hitches come in two varieties:
1200 kg towing capacity 50 kg load on the ball or 1800 kg / 70 kg with an
additional mount on the side of the frame on 75 and later buses.
Hitches look the same - so I do not hesitate to tow up to 1.5 tons on longer
trips. However, check the condition of your frame rail ends / bumper mounts
first - mine are getting crunchy and required some structural improvements.
I towed an Opel on a dolly from Minnesota to DC through the mountains with
my 79 Camper and recently did a trip to Phoenix (from DC) towing a car each
way. No problems.
