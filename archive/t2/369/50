Subject: Carb Cleaner

Hey there-

I am going to rebuild my carbs on my '73 (34-PICT 3,4) today and have a
question: The article in the library on this subject mentioned a carb cleaner
that comes in something like a paint can that you can actually dip parts into.
Sounds like a great idea, but just got me a blank look at my local FLAPS. My
question is this: Is there anything special in carb cleaner? Could I use
another solvent (diesel perhaps)? Also, are there any good resources other
than the Robert Kuhn article, or any tips for someone who has never opened a
carb before?

Cheers,
Matthew
