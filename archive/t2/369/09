Subject: Carlisle May 16-18

With all this talke about upcoming meetings - who is planning to go to
Carlisle for the import show? It is May 16-18 and the last time I was there
(2000) a bunch of buses simply camped on the show field. Today (April 25) is
the last day for early (and cheaper) registration:
