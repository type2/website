I rebuilt a '74 carb (34-PICT 4 I believe) a year or so ago. The cleaner I
used came in a paint can which also contained a metal basket so that parts
can be placed in the can to soak. I had a rebuild kit which contained all
the gaskets, seals, etc as well as some of the valves. I pretty much
followed the instructions that came with the kit and didn't have any
trouble.

Watch out for springs. They are easy to loose track of. Whoever last
rebuilt my 34-PICT 4 lost one spring, which I replaced. For some strange
reason, they actually managed to get it to work without it.
