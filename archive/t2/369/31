Subject: Re: [T2] towing weights?

I once towed a cow trailer 4 miles with a 1400 lb cow in it behind my 73
bus.  The cow walked to the front of the trailer once or twice.  I made
the trip to the market and the trailer hitch was only slightly bent
downward (about 1/2 inch) and was used for many more years before I
wrecked the bus.  This was the same type of hitch that Jamie Rivers is
now making.  Greg
