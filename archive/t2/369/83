Hello everyone,

Here's my latest off the wall question, yep go ahead
and laugh already, I'm used to it. 

Is it in any way, possible to get useable data ie data
that tells you something about the engine in general
and the fi system in particular out of the central
engine control unit? 

I've been mulling over the idea (rather foolishly) of
dispersting sensors of various sorts through out the
bus. 4 head temp sensors, an oil temp, an 02 sensor
and any other sensible (or unsenseble) sensing sensors
to moniter the heart of my home on wheels. I would
then like, with the help of A-D converters to have all
these directing their findings to a PC via a com or
lpt port.

I realize that getting all this built is not only
tricky but also useless since what is going to happen
will and the more I know of the impending doom of my
bus the more I will worry.

If anyone has any ideas shoot me one
