Don,

You didn't describe whether they *stop* the bus well or not!

So stiff that you have to stand on them to stop the bus? 

With new correctly adjusted  brakes, 2" of travel might be about right.

Any vacuum leaks?....new o-ring between MC and booster?..or old one still 
good...maybe?

Cheers, dave
