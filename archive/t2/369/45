In 1982 I was 25 and drove my 71 bus from Tampa to Philadelphia towing 
a UHaul trailer with all the worldly possessions of my wife, my newborn 
daughter, and myself in it (and in the bus, packed to the windows).  
Wife and daughter flew up separately.

This was the largest single-wheel trailer - 6x8?  The trailer was so 
heavy I had to pry its fenders up to clear the tires, one of which had 
a big goose egg on the inside after I got to PA.  I made it in one 
piece despite not being able to get above 35 or 40 frequently once I 
got north of Richmond.  I-freakin-95.

So young, soooo stooopid.  Not young anymore.

PS: Towed the same bus back to Fla 5 years later behind a big UHaul 
truck.  I had come up in the world.

PPS: Hey, Bob - rail travois counts as a drag, not a tow. :)
