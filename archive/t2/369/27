Subject: Looking for Left Heat Exchanger

Looking for a left exhaust heat exchanger that fits an
80-83 Vanagon Air cooled federal model.  I currently
have a California Model and I am trying to change the
muffler over to Federal (which I have already found)
but need the left heat exchanger since the Cali models
didn't have one.  Thanks
