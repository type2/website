Subject: Door buzzer idea

I've had the door buzzer relay removed since last July because it was
driving me nuts. Last week I locked my keys in the bus which probably would
have been avoided by the buzz. Today I left the lights and an almost didn't
have enough battery left to turn the engine over.

It got me thinking that it would be handy to re-use the buzzer as a warning
for the lights.

A - key in
B - door ajar
C - lights on

Here's the logic that would activate the buzzer:

(Key in and door ajar) or (Key out and lights on) == (AB + A'C).

I can figure out where to get these "signals" from the wiring diagram but I
don't know in what minimal way I can build this trigger.

Any ideas from the electronics/electrical folks out there?
