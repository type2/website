Thanks Jim! I usually pre-Google my questions but got lazy today. Great link!

The anodizing on my vent window frames went to pieces and I polished it 
off. I have the same problem with several of the lower engine castings on 
my '81 Honda and want to polish them too, of course this is going to lead 
to the polish job failing when it is in the weather.

I also have some Type IV 911 cooling parts for my Beetle that get the 
treatment eventually.
