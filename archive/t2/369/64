Be ABSOLUTELY sure that you rust proof all the hidden crevices and crannies 
that are now absolutely clean but not likely to get painted. I mean the 
inside of frame rails and such.

I hope to do this to my bus someday when it needs a better resto than we've 
given it this time.

I used to work in an antique car shop doing gofer work to pay for college. 
Saw a few cars that had been dipped and had rust coming through the paint a 
few years later.

What I don't know and would like to - what do you treat those hidden places 
with - Waxoyl?
