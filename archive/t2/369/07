This looks like a good camp-out, at Deerfield Park
just south of Asheville NC. Would like to know who is
coming to it besides me. I will be working on my
freinds (Craig) westy, one he just bought for $200.00
to see if it will make it from Easley, SC. If we get
it right it will be a caravan of two from Easley. Phil
