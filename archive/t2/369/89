Giles,

You just need to switch to Megasquirt.  Dump the original ECU
in the process and plug your laptop right in.  Build it yourself and get 
the source code to boot!

In several weeks, they will have a display unit that goes with it called 
Megaview.  

If you are interested, then spend some time reading on the list...

Two(or more) people have already done it to their buses....look here.
