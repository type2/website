Subject: Re: [T2] 81 handle question

<<The outside handle on on the sliding door of my 81 westy was broken off >>

To remove the lock cylinder, there is a small, buried setscrew in a smal
hole on the outside of the cylindrical area of the handle. To remove, take
out the setscrew with the key in the lock cylinder and withdraw the cylinder
with the key..... without a key, it might take some fiddling to get the lock
cylinder out.

Try E-B*y  for a used handle.... they seem to be on sale every once in a
while. I removed mine to fix it and have left it out ...I put a nice plastic
round body plug in there and I think it's actually better without it. More
theftproof and aerodynamic. To open the sliding door, I just reach around
behind the passenger seat and use the inside handle.
