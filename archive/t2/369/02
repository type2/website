Hi Melissa,

    This may have already been asked, buy have you asked if someone at the
body shop would be willing to pull your engine? As pulling Volkswagen
engines goes, the Ghia is very easy to pull. It can be done with very a
minimum amount of hand tools, and only a floor jack and stands would be
considered a special tool. With an experienced "Guy" or "Gall" can do it in
15 minuets or so, a less experienced person 30 to 45 minuets.
    Why don't you take your manuals down to the shop and ask around, I'll
bet someone will do it for a few bucks or less.
    Just a thought, if I'm covering old ground forgive me. Good luck.

Tommy
