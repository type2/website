Brain fade,

I was thinking of the heat-riser flanges.  I think the center section is 
probably an interference fit with the steel tubes.  Maybe the aluminum is 
cast around the tubes.  I would think you could cut the aluminum to remove 
the heat-risers, and then heliarc it back when you were done.  Probably more 
work than just finding a good junker, or ordering one fron CB Performance.  
The nice thing about the new ones is that they can be removed without 
pulling the dynamo.
