Subject: Re: [T2] RE: painting a bus

$1900.00, But well worth it. It takes evertthing off. If you have any rust it 
will be gone and then some. But it lets you know where your weak spots are. A 
little extreme but for my first resto I wanted to start from the ground up. 
This way I will get to fix and reinstall every system in the bus and have 
hopefully a good working knowledge of the whole bus. Good thing I have a very 
supportive wife. Hell I extended out two years in the Navy just so I could take 
advantage of there hobby shops here on Camp LeJeune. I figure that will give me 
enough time to get it right. Maybe
