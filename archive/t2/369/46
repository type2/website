Subject: Axle differences 71-79

Can I use any front axle beam of this period on my '79?  A couple I've 
looked at had drum brakes, can I change these over to my disc setup 
(are the spindles the same)?

Still working on getting the old one out.  What a pain!  I might have 
to resort to air tools :-)

Thanks
