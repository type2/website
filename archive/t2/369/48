I don't have the wiring diagram for a Bus in front of me, but the
connections should be pretty simple. I initially was thinking a single
relay and a pair of diodes would do the trick, but that would have the
buzzer active anytime the lights are on or the key is in, so that is
certainly not what you want :)


Right now, you probably have something like this:

+12VDC <----|buzzer|-------|door switches|--+
                                            |
Ground <------------------------------------+


I was initially thinking of something like this (which won't work):

+12VDC <----|buzzer|----+--|door switches|--+
                        |                   |
Relay normally open <---+                   |
                                            |
Relay common <------------------------------+
                                            |
Relay coil (-) <----------------------------+
                                            |
Ground <------------------------------------+

(active +12V)    Diodes
Key in <----------|>|----+
Lights <----------|>|----+
                         |
Relay coil (+) <---------+


What would be ideal are logic gates. Using gate ICs isn't really possible
due to unregulated and electronically noisy 12VDC. The best solution is
probably going to involve a relay and some FET type transistors. I'd have
to think about that one before I could come up with something, and then I
don't think I could make out a simple ASCII diagram for it.
