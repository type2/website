Subject: RE: painting a bus

Eron,

I went all out and totally stripped the bus down and towed it about three hours 
away to a place called Carolina Chem Strip in Burlington, NC. They baked the 
bus to 700 degreesF then powerwashed it. They then dipped the whole body in an 
acid solution then a neutralizer then powerwashed it again. Finally they 
sprated it with an anti corrosive called Ospho which etches the metal. At this 
point the bus looked I'm sure much as it did rolling down the assembly line. 

I did take some pictures with my old camera but sadly they didn't come out for 
some reason. I now have a digital camera and will take some pics and send a 
couple to you.

As for what to use to strip your floor, I've heard that aircraft stripper is 
really good.
