Subject: Re; 17mm Allen key for transmission plug

Hello there.  I'm a newbie to the list, having recently bought my first VW, a
1976 2L auto Kombi camper.

There has been some correspondence on making a tool for the 17mm Allen key
plug.  I have found that the outside of a 13mm tube spanner is just over 17mm,
and a quick dress with a file brought it down to size.  Also, when pumping or
handling 90 grade oil it sometimes helps to heat the oil first.

Thanks for a great list.
