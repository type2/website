Subject: towing weights?

Love this list...got to thinking about my tow hitch that I haven't 
installed on my bus yet and wondering what the weight capacities 
were....went an looked it up on our site and "wow".


Trailer weight for my 78 is 2645lbs with trailer brakes!
without brakes is 1322 lbs.


but tongue weight of only about 110lbs....hmmmm

Anyone ever pushed this limit and lived to tell?<grin>

Cheers, dave
