Subject: High oil pressure - 79 Westy

I noticed high oil pressure in my '79 CA bus yesterday on the way to work.
When I started the bus to go home the oil pressure went to 10 psi on start,
hesitated, then climbed up to 40 psi. On the 35 mile freeway drive home the
oil pressure remained high, close to 60 psi at freeway speeds. After parking
the bus in the driveway and coming out of the house a little while later I
noticed a dollar bill sized oil patch under the driveway. It looks like
there is a leak at the front main seal. 

Does this indicate that the oil pressure relief valve is stuck, or are there
other possibilities?
