Subject: RE: painting a bus

I'm going to spray a rust converter/preventative in all of those spaces using a 
sprayer siphon feed type gun I bought from JC Whitney (Professional Rust 
Proofer Kit) slightly modified with a brake line attched to it. Then with the 
same gun I will spray Zero Rust (originally designed for offshore oil rigs to 
prevent rust)inside all of the same spaces. After I've finall gotten the whole 
vehicle painted BC/CC, I will spray 3M Rust Fighter interior panel coating in 
these same spaces once again. It is similar to Waxoyl it is also a cavity wax 
that stays somewhat soft all the time. Hopefully this will do it. The 3M 
product is substantially cheaper than Waxoyl.
