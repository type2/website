Hi All

This is a call to all Vanagon owners who know the science behind air
filtration assemblies and the impact on fuel / air optimum efficiency mixes.
A call to arms and a challenge to the knowledged air cooled VW fanatic.

I am currently running my air filter system and air cleaner assembly as
such.  Upper housing has 4 inlets with temperature regulator on the inside
of the air cleaner housing and a temperature switch.  The 2 inlets with the
temp' reg' are connected to the Vacuum Unit on the air housing and the inlet
manifold.  The 2 inlets with the temperature switch (?) I have blocked off
with a looped hose.  This is because I have no control valve on my original
solex carb' to which the air hose should connect to from the air cleaner
housing.  I also have a straight feed from the throttle damper back to the
carb' without the delay valve.  Not ideal but will this be ok?

For a detailed diagram see the haynes manual page 63 or Bentleys equivalent
of the air cleaner assembly and vacuum hose layout.  Can anyone advise me on
what the consequences of my set up will be.  The van does run ok but I fear
the air / fuel mix is far from the optimum for efficiency.
