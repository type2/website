Yes there is.  It's nasty stuff, smells to high heaven, and what do you do
with it when you're done cleaning?  Left on its own, it will eat through
its own can in a few years, contaminating whatever is under it.

After one
experience with dips I went to using the spray carb cleaners.  The spray
cleaners are still nasty, but at least they evaporate!  It is very nice to
be able to direct the cleaner through the passages to make sure thay all
get cleaned.  The "dip" cleaners sometimes don't get into all the
convoluted passages.

With either of these, use gloves and eye protection.  Even with gloves,
remove all rings and watches.  If a little of either cleaner gets under
your ring, it will burn the skin.  Don't ask how I know.
