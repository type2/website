Subject: Re: [T2] major engine teardown woes

Uhhh, I can't help you with "just what will get me 100 miles down the road"
repair suggestions. Perhaps you could call the toll free number at
www.gexi.com and ask them as they seem to have made an entire business of
selling VW engines repaired in this fashion.

To do things properly. I would, at the very least, spring for a new set of
cylinders/pistons.rings and a pair of rebuilt heads. Mainly because, it's
such a pain in the a** to pull and rebuild an engine and reinstall it... why
risk having to re-do the whole thing over again by scrimping on parts?

Check out Bus Depot www.busdepot.com for rebuilt heads and
piston/cylinder/ring sets.
