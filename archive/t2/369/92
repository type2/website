Subject: Re: Torsion arm removal

That was my problem, I was trying to get two out at a time. I have since 
separated the upper from the lower and got the lower off but the upper seems to 
be a little more stubborn.
Question: The leaf type spring inside the lower control arm housing was welded 
at one end and the weld itself was broken. Is this something that should be 
replaced if possible or should I just have it welded up and continue to use it.
