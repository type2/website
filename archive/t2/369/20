On the dual port center section, the heat riser and the manifold center is
buried in an aluminum (I think) casting.  Not all that repairable.  Even
if it were a matter of rebrazing the tube it would be really hard to
get everything to line up without a very good jig.

The heat riser design is one place that Porsche really messed up.  If I
were designing it these days I'd put an electric heater muff around the
manifold with a thermostat to regulate the temperature.  Electrics were a
lot less capable back in '38, of course.

Makes that Megasquirt seem a lot more attractive, doesn't it!  :)
