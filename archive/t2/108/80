Subject: More Vent Wing Questions

Hiya All,

Here we are with the continuing saga of the vent wings.  I now have all the 
vent wings out of the Bus.  And the Bus is in the paintshop.  

Right now I am trying to rehab the first of the three rear vent wings (you 
know, the rectangular ones).  I stripped the old rubber off and removed the 
vent wing from the frame.  And I have refitted the new rubber seal around 
this frame.  The only part I have not yet figured out is how to get the new 
seal into the upright at the back of the frame (where the glass closes to 
meet the rubber).  This really does not want to go in place.  The rubber 
seems too wide for the channel in the frame.  Is there some trick to 
inserting this part of the seal into the frame?

As always, TIA

Mike
