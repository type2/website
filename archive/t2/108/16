Subject: RE: [T2] 72-79 Pressure Plate bolts

Hey Everyone thanks for the help on this issue from before.  And a little
extra information.

Karl is one the money with the 74-75 flywheel having 7mm bolts!  They are
7mm x 1.00 thread x 20mm long.  This also will give you a 11mm head instead
of that cursable triple square [12 point] head.

Why the Bentley does not list it is beyond me.

On the gravytrain to biscuitville!

Depends on your flywheel:
72/73 1700 uses a 210mm clutch with 8mm bolts.
74/75 1800 uses a 215mm clutch with 7mm bolts.
76 up 2.0L uses a 228mm clutch with 8mm bolts.
The 8mm bolts are 1.25 pitch. 1.25 is the 'standard' pitch for a 8mm bolt.
That is why the pitch is not given. The 8mm bolt normally uses a 13mm wrench
[Japanese cars use a 12mm wrench].
The 7mm bolts use a 8mm triple square socket.
