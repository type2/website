Subject: heating air flow

Now that I have 2 functional heat exchangers on my 79 bus I have
noticed something that seems odd. the air from the lower regesters
seem to be thrown toward the outside of the bus. This is great for my
left foot, but it seems to miss my cold right foot. So is this just
normal?
