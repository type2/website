Subject: 62-71 T/L assemblies

    Just want to thank all that took advantage of the 62 to 71 tail-light
assemblies deal and  to let everyone know that it is still going. I recieved
another shippment of the T/L and will continue the $35.00 a pair for
complete tail light assemblies. That like buying 2 housings and getting the
lens, bezel and seal for free!


thanks again  ronnie
