BINGO, the 009 is a sure killer of the T4 engine, there simply isn't
enough advance in the unit.  Of course the stock dizzy is still the
best choice, I don't know anything about the SVDA, apparently
it isn't a bad choice.  I don't know if I'd go quite for 42 degrees at
full tilt though, the stockers usually top out around 38-40 so you
might retard it a hair and see if you run cooler and if the power isn't
affected too much.  I always find it sort of hard to hear when a T4
is actually pinging in a bus with all the other noise that assaults
you driving one.  The 050 is a reasonable choice as well for the
T4 if you got one laying around, as I guess might be an 010 if it
fits physically?  I recall they have a pile of advance as well but the
last thing I had one in was a 36hp and it was over 10 years ago.
Anyway as the 009 discussion has crept up again I think people
should know there are alternatives whether you buy em from John
or whoever, and finding a stocker in a junkyard is a pretty darn good
one as long as you supply it a proper vacuum advance signal.  I
went to see a '81 this weekend that had a 10,000 mile engine that
had fallen dead to just this problem, well compounded by the fact
the guy thought he could drive it 80mph and it was an auto tranny
Westy, but the 009 sure hadn't helped.  Yeah the 009 will run a T4
engine or darn near any VW engine but it doesn't make it right.
