In the past I have purchased kits from an outfit in SoCal called "Pony
Express.  The first kit was through JC Whitney a decade ago (for a bug)
and the second was 6 years ago for my '71 bus.  The second kit was
purchased direct, though they don't like to deal with retail.  I don't
know if they are still around, but the quality is good.  The driver's
seats of both sets are in need of replacement through daily use, but that
is pretty good service.
