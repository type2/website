Still processing-
Taper pipe thread spec is NPT
Straight pipe thread spec is NPS

1/8 NPT tap drill is R = ..3390" taper thread
10X1.0 tap drill is 9mm=.3543" straight thread
measurements can be more exacting depending
on the percentage of  thread surface desired or possible.
Drill bits have an estimated, actual, and theoretical hole size.
Taps are categorized for their precision as well.

Some VW oil sender holes are 1/8 i.p., some are 10X1.0
