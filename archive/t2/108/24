Hi Paul,

I installed a BN-2 into my 72 westy with exactly that configuration back in
1986. It worked beautifully. At the time I had never seen or heard of a
BA-,, but the location seemed to make sense to me.

The air coming out of the heaterboxes in a late bay is pushed by a separate
booster fan from the one used for engine cooling -- very different from how
it is with an upright engine. But since many people have added bilge blowers
to their systems on both models of baywindow buses without incident I
wouldn't worry too much about it. Just think of the BN-2 as a really
complicated bilge blower. I put the heater there and didn't worry about it;
I wasn't getting significant output from the heater boxes anyway.

When the BN-2 is not running you probably won't get much airflow. If the
fuel economy concerns you (at $.40/hr is it really an issue?) then you might
want to wire an auxiliary switch that could power the BN-2 fan without
running the fuel pump or glow plug. Wouldn't be hard to do.

Like VW's  BA-6 configuration I put a metal shroud over the heater to seal
it from the elements and used a small cable routed to the passenger
compartment to remotely operate the reset relay if it was required.


Happy trails,
