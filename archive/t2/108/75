John I'm not entirely doubting you but that is a pile of full
advance compared to a stocker which does by the book
a max of 37 but in reality around 40 under load at revs.  As
long as the thing runs cool with good power and the engine
goes 100k miles or better on it though should obviously be fine.
I still favor a good stocker though as they are readily available
in pick and pulls for about nothing and usually still in pretty
fair shape if pulled from a Vanagon.
