--Okay, since I started this...

I said I used to design sprinklers, ID of schedule 40 steel pipe 1" (I said 1 1/4" accidently the first time) nominal is 1.038". No pipe of any kind is ever exactly 1" ID or 1 1/4" ID as it's called "nominally" (hence NPT = nominal pipe thread)

P.S. to Dave Bolen: I do electrical now.
