I agree with George on his response.  As you "upgrade" one unit, it is a good 
idea to upgrade all affected units. As mentioned the 009 is not necc an 
upgrade, your better off with a vacuum advance distributer ( I too use a V/A 
Dis with a new 009 as a backup)...I use a "Flamethrower Coil" and the 
"Flamethrower ignition wires"...as well as a Universal CDI (Capacitive 
Discharge Ignition) and Bosch W8 Platinum Plugs (gapped at .045)...I also got 
a "Hot Start Relay...(also Bosch).  I don't mind changing out points, so I 
kept those in instead of a Pertronix replacement...This is all in a 76.  If 
the list has any more reccomendations for my set up, I'm open...I really 
appreciate the information and advice provided...I hope after all is said and 
done, you get the "right" set up for you...
