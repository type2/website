The idle circuit of the carb is running lean, as well as the 009 syndrome=

contributing to your problems.

Make a chart with your settings and the performance for each change.
Mine is running with the idle screw 1.75 turns out and the speed screw 2.=
75
turns in... seems to run OK, but i haven't had much time to troubleshoot.=

still trending and need to get rid of the 009 myself.

Switch to a vac distributor. The SVDA from Aircooled.net has gotten good

Its about $120, but worth it i hear.
