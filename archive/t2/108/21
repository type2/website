Subject: BN 2 heater and a 71 bus

Good Day Everybody,
    I have a '71 bus, 1600 dual port engine with doghouse cooling fan setup,
that I'm going to put a BN 2 heater into.   I'd like the heat to come out of
the stock defroster and heater vents and still have the original heating
system for when I don't need all those exta BTUs.
    My first thought was to cut the long, under bus, heat tube and install
the heater in place of the missing section.  Similar to how the late bay
window buses have the BN 6 installed.  My concern is that ,when running, the
gasoline heater would suck more air than usually delived to the heating
system and there by deprive the engine of cooling air.  A secondary concern
is that the BN 2 being in the heater tube would block air flow and make the
original heating system less effective.
   I'd love to hear your opinions, ideas, and real world experiences of
doing this.
Alternate ideas gladly accepted too.
