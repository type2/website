Well, ok -one list member. What follows is a message David Bell sent me.
David - forgive me for posting this to the list without your permission, =
but i
feel it is good info that can only help to clear the air...and maybe sell=
 some
distributors for John.

Without further ado:

"My bus came to me with a failing 1700 and a brand new AVP 1800 long bloc=

I bought the Bosch SVDA from John at aircooled.net and haven't regretted =

BTDC at ~3000RPM. (My tach/dwell only reads to 2000RPM!)

I've never run a dual can on anything so I can't compare them to the sing=

Aircooled.net has gotten good reviews from
listmembers. =


Thought the aircooled.net guy said it's for type
1 engine only.  I assume that means insufficient
advance...
