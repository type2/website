When looking at claims, the first question you should ask is if the claim
is measureable.  This one isn't.

This might be measurable, but the difference won't be huge.

This isn't really much of an upgrade.  The 009 distributor isn't ideal for
a bus application (it needs revs to advance, so it tends to hesitate while
starting off)  The pertronix is just a replacement for the points.  The
advantage is that it doesn't wear like the points, the disadvantage is
that when a pertronix dies you are stranded.

Sure!

About 1%.

Any time you stress one conponent more than it was designed for, there is
a danger.  In this case, the primary wire feeding the coil from the
ignition switch will carry more current.  Consider your ignition switch
before making the change
