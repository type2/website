Subject: fuel hose ID = 5mm? 

I'm at the end of a rebuild of a 1600 on my test stand. In the RMMW
catalog,  hose with ID = 5mm is listed as fuel hose.  I bought a meter of
this to connect carb to fuel pump and fuel pump to tank.

Even if I smear a bit of glycerine over the nipples, it is almost
impossible to push the hose into place.  On the other hand, I found another
piece of braided hose in my kit.  It's ID measures 6.5mm.  Not 7 but a true
6.5. Have no idea where I picked this up. This slips easily but snugly over
the nipples.

Does everyone have this difficulty with 5mm hose? Should I just ram it on?

Thanks, Jack
