Maybe should be Normal Plumber's Measurement, insofar as it
appears they don't use rulers. And 1.038 " is not 1 1/4 ".
(But maybe close enough for plumbing work :)
Even more curious why there is no DIN for the oil sender hole.
So, OK, then- just how close is the interchange between  senders
that are 10X1.0 straight thread and those that are 1/8 i.p.NPT tapered ?
