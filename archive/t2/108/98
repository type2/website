I'm a very new bus owner ( '74 camper) am a bit reluctant to expose my =
ignorance on this list, but I think I may have solved a problem that =
stumped 1/2 a dozen mechanics and am hoping listees can confirm or deny =
my theory.  So here's the deal...  I had a love at first sight =
experience in a BIG way (Ruby is bright red and cute as can be, after =
all) and do my best to restrain myself by reading up on the subject, =
dragging friends to see her and even paying my $50 for a pre-sale =
inspection (worth every penny).  The weekend before she was to go in the =
shop and have a few mostly standard procedures done, just as I am =
pulling in my driveway we have loss of power, bucking, coughing and God =
help me the oil light goes on.  It turns out oil is all over (it looks =
like she soiled herself)  when I lay down cardboard I can see that it is =
coming from a lot of places.  It turns out the Left needle valve is =
blown and had allowed gas to mix with the oil resulting in "about 4 =
times as much oil as there should be" and I couldn't tell because the =
dipstick was thrashed and useless.    So in the process of fixing all =
this a few other previous owner oddities were discovered-- you should =
have seen the mechanics face when he showed me that the choke had been =
repaired with some kind of plastic and glue!  I don't know yet why but I =
had an electric fuel pump-- when the mechanic put a mechanical one back =
on all is good until I want to go more than 30 miles per hours or up any =
little incline.  So back on goes the electric fuel pump with =
instructions for me to keep a close eye on the oil level and home I head =
but dog gone it  I still am  having  serious loss of power just when I =
really need it (had to drive 20 MPH along the side of the road any time =
there was even a teeny incline).  I decide I didn't want to spend my =
Friday night waiting for a friend to pick me up at the repair shop =
(again) so I limp home determined to figure this out myself ( I have =
next to no mechanical knowledge).  After I spend days pouring over books =
and not really finding much to help me (HERE COMES THE BOTTOM LINE) I =
just go out and LOOK at the engine. I discover that the clamp that =
affixes the air cleaner to the left carburetor is missing and there is =
nothing holding it down.  The clamp on the right carburetor is really =
strong so I figure that puppy needs to be secured well.  I lash it down =
with wire and take her out for a spin and low and behold all is good-- =
I'm zipping up hills and going 60 MPH as if my darling Ruby had not been =
having tantrums for  weeks.  SO HERE'S MY QUESTION:  Did I really fix =
what all those paid mechanics couldn't?  Would that air cleaner =
connection flopping around really cause that much loss of power?  Could =
it be that it sat on there OK when the demand on the engine was lower =
and then "lifted" off as I went or tried to go faster?  I would like to =
be sure I'm OK before I let the shop off the hook.  This story is A LOT =
longer than this so I hope I have not left out important details.  =
Thanks for all the good info I've been gleaning from the list and =
archives and thanks to those that made it through my long explanation...
I'd appreciate any insight you all care to pass along.
Donna and Ruby Vroom
