a stock distributor from 1976-1983 has 32 total at WOT, 42-45 at part
throttle cruise (read the Bentley manual if you doubt me). Ours is a
modified curve from this, with the same 7.5 idle, 32 total centrifugal, and
42-45 full advance (only under certain conditions).

I sincerely dont' want hard feelings John. I just want to clear up the
misconception that the engine "can't run more than 32 total" because that is
a huge myth. It is true for the 009 or 050, but only because they are
centrifugal ONLY.
