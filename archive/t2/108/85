Carb or FI?  (Are all later model buses FI unless otherwise modified?)

If it's a carb, I wouldn't say that it's necessarily "normal" but when
I rev the engine way up by hand, it's pretty common for it to drop down
to about 50-100 rpm below what the idle is set at before coming back up
and idling normally.  It'll come down, sputter a sec and recover.

That's for my 1600DP, vac. adv. dizzy and non-German 34-Pict-3 though.
It used to worry me more, but now I guess I've just accepted it and
expect that it's the non-german carb (but there's no real logic behind
that assumption, as I know the float is set correctly, etc.).

Is this a common problem for volks, or...?
