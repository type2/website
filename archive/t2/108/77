Hello,

I own a '71 westy that pretty much does what she's supposed to do (point a to 
b and back) but am having problems with the lock on the rear door.  I rebuilt 
the driver and passenger locks by following the Ron Van Ness' article from 
the library and they work great.  The rear lock doesn't want to engage.  
There's a metal plate riveted in place that blocks access to the lock.  What 
should I do if I want to keep it keyed the same?  Is there a way to rebuild 
or do I need to replace? 

Also the sliding door no longer pops out when I open the handle, I have to 
pull on the back of the louvered window to make it open.  Its rattle is also 
getting worse.  Does anyone have a method preferably with photos that might 
help me out?

Thanks for the help,

Eric
