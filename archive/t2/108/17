Subject: replacing window seals w/out breaking window

Thanks to everyone who replied concerning the 71 vs 73 issue.

Now my question is about replacing window seals.  I've replaced a windshield
seal in a bug so I'm familiar with the technique used to get the window and
new seal back in place.  That windshield was already cracked and removing it
only cracked it more.  Additionally, the article I read on www.type2.com
concerning window seal replacement mentions that the glass will be broken
when removed.

My question is how do I get the glass out without breaking it?

Thanks,
Brian
