	Hello,
	If you are replacing the seal, I just cut the seal
	away enough that I can pop the window out without
	breaking it. Then after the window is gone, you can
	take the rest of the seal off the car and toss it.
	BTW, if you are going to cut the seal away, do so from
	the exterior.

What is the point of cutting the exterior side?  I've taken a bunch of
windshields out (cars I was stripping) by just cutting the rubber off on the
inside.  Just estimate how far in from the edge you need to cut to miss the
edge of the metal.  You don't even have to be particularly accurate.  As
long as you get 3/4 of the rubber out of the way, the whole thing will pop
out rubber and all.  Since the rubber is still on the windshield it even
gives you a cushion when you set the windshield down.  And the shape of the
trim stays intact as well which helps when reinstalling.
