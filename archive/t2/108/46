Subject: LOOK - New '68-72 Front Bumpers

One of my suppliers just offered me 10 brand new '68-72 front bumpers that
he got a hold of somewhere.  These are genuine N.O.S. stock, and have been
discontinued and completely unavailable for about 10 years.   I'm not going
to take them all but will order them for anyone who needs one.

Price is $199.95 for the bumper itself (excluding the ends/steps).  The
ends/steps are $179.95 each (for left or right).  You can buy them
separately or all together.  All plus shipping of course.

Email me directly at ron(-at-)busdepot.com if you need one - the sooner the
better.  I don't think they'll last very long; this is the type of thing
that overseas buyers tend to snap up.
