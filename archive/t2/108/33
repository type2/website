Subject: RE: [T2] Windshield rubber

VW no longer makes most window rubber with grooves for the trim strips.
These chromse strips were pretty much a U.S. only feature and there just
isn't much demand for them.  The result is that most of what's out there is
repros from either West Coast Metric or Wolfsburg West (regardless of where
you get it, including from us), as they are the two primary suppliers of
those seals in the aftermarket.  They are similar quality to eachother,
which is to say that they're close to, but not neccessarily comparable to,
OEM quality.  They are also considerably more expensive than OEM seals which
lack the grooves for the trim strips.  My advice is to skip the molding
strips unless you're absolutely dead-set on it. If you go with what we in
the U.S. call the "Cal Look" (really the European look, without molding
grooves), you'll get much better rubber for a fraction of the price.

Genuine VW seals are still available without molding grooves, but they are
hard to find. There is a great temptation for vendors to sell aftermarket
seals, even when genuine is available, because the aftermarket ones
wholesale for less money and are easier to get.  (Lead time from one of the
U.S. aftermarket companies is a few days; you sometimes have to order months
in advance to get the genuine ones, and even then supply can be spotty.)
If you order from West Coast Metric, Wolfsburg West, Rocky Mountain
Motorworks, etc., you will NOT get the genuine VW rubber.  You will get
either U.S. made or Brazilian made aftermarket seals, depending on the
vendor.  However, if you order from us, the vast majority of our body rubber
is either genuine VW, or European made by the O.E. suppliers to VW.  I try
to stockpile large quantities whenever it's available, and while I can't say
I never have to ship an aftermarket seal, it's by far the exception, not the
rule.  So I can honestly say that by and large ours are the best seals you
can buy, geniine OEM quality, for less than the price of everyone else's
aftermarket seals.
