Subject: Bus upholstery

Hi Volks,
I have a question about upholstering the front seats
on a ’78 Bus.
I have done a few Type 1 seats with no problem (I
usually buy the padding kit too) so I don’t expect a
lot of trouble with the process. I would like to hear
from those that have bought kits (from who and how
much$$$) and your satisfaction with the kit. There is
an armrest on these tall back seats that look like
heck – one each seat, on the inside (don’t know if
armrests are standard?). I am not looking for an exact
resto quality – a good sturdy set of upholstery would
be nice – we use our camper!

Thanks for any advise!
Al
