I am tending to agree that this has to be the culprit (thanks Rob Henley,
Snoopy, and others)...  I will switch it over to vacuum and report back.  

What is odd is that the manual that came with the carb explicitly stated
that even in a bus it should be run with a 009.  So that is how I set it up,
silly me :)

Again, as always in a bus the vacuum advance distributors rule!

I think your problem here could have more to do with the 009 than the carb.
I would use a vacuum dizzy...

Anyone have a great running Weber Progressive and care to share their
tuning
notes?

I am working on setting up a Weber Progressive on a '74 Westi and have an
issue with from stop take offs and dying when coming to a stop (if not
toeing the gas).  Once underway the carb is great and delivers 20+ MPG
(think 23ish) on the highway which is good.

The thing that worries me about this carb setup is that there is no heat
risers so it seems that the choke would constantly be on???

Also there seem to be only 3 adjustments; idle mixture, fast idle cam, low
idle cam...  Am I missing something else?  Seems like limited tunability.

Running it with a 009.
