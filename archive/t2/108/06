Subject: Riviera Canvas Repair

We had unusually warm weather in Indianapolis last weekend. I spent the day 
outside on Friday attempting to remove the yellow canvas from my 1971 
Riviera Pop Top. It only took about 5 hours. I took my time and a bunch of 
photographs.

With any luck at all, I can find a local person to sew new screens and 
zippers throughout and remember how the hell to put it back.

Has anyone heard anything from Dawn Smyth at PLF? I see she has a newly 
updated website, but no answer on the phone and no return e-mail from her. 
I'd love to get a new one, but I just can't wait any longer. I need to get 
this done and it was enough of a pain in the ass that I'll probably not do 
it again if the repaired one gets back before I hear from her about a new one.
