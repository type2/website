Subject: type 4 case

I just split the case on my 2.0 l engine yesterday, expecting to
find much better news than I got when I split my type 3 case a couple
of weeks ago--but like the type 3, I
found the parts number from main bearing
#2 (?? the one that splits apart..)imprinted in the bore--
Does this mean that the case for sure needs align boring or can
it just be from oil discoloration?  I am beginning to think that
any case I split will look like this.  Also, could someone explain
to me what "fretting" actually looks like?  Do you see this on the
flat part of the case web or on the edges?  Is there a shop anyone
can recommend which will honestly assess what shape my case is in?
I don't want to align bore it if I can avoid it.
Thanks!
