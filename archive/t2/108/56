How about using a nice big relay to switch the current just to the coil?

Your wire from the front, on a non-FI Bus, supplies power to three things--
the coil, the backup lights and the carbs if you have electrified carbs. If
you used a foglight relay (30a at 12v) to switch the power to the coil and
ONLY to the coil (the backup lights and carbs can stay on the primary wire)
you could use an MSD funny car coil (supplies 11 amps at 50kv) and your
ignition switch would never know the difference.
