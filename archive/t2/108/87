The weber progressive kit is exactly what you need. The kit comes complete
with intake manifolds, air cleaner, carb, etc.  Yes, it can be used with a
universal electric pump (and in fact wouldn't work with the VW
fuel-injection fuel pump anyway).  You will need a pump with 2-4 psi output.
We sell a Facet pump that works well with it.  My part numbers are 43 067 00
for the carb kit and 412010 for the pump.
