>>I got the book  "VW Bus" The First 50 Years for

Xmas. On page 131 there's a picture of VW LT(Load

Transport) built for the Yamaha Paris-Dakar team.
It bears a passing resemblance to a vanagon(I
mistook it for a crew cab vanagon at first
glance). The LT was front engine(water cooled)
rear drive utility  truck. I don't think they
were ever sold in US.

There's one for sale in the US right now!
