Subject: Re: [T2] racing buses on dirt

Sorry, Matty, but I'm with Phil.
I think that bus racing would kill too many buses that
might get back on the road legitimately.
Maybe you could organise "Boneyard Bus Racing" i.e. in
order to enter the bus you wish to race, you must have
the receipt from the boneyard you bought it in or at
least proof of a neglectful, unserviced &
unregisterable period of at least 18 months before the
bus is allowed to enter.
In short, to stop any viable on-road buses being
turned into paddock bashers.
Other racing conditions should include wacky paint
jobs, and I don't mean racing stripes.....I mean ZEBRA
stripes or Hawaiian flowers all over the bus. 
As such, the scrutineering team should include a very
poor fashion designer or graffiti artist on community
service :-)
And yes, people should have to do community service
for poor fashion design ;-)
Anyhow, lets keep bus racing wacky if we must have it,
like most of the rest of the bus scene!
Oh & Phil, the cheque's in the mail ;-)
:-)
Cheers
