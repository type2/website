	I realize this thread probably deserves to be dropped, but I seem to
	remember reading in a couple of my Porsche histories that the racing
shop
	used to build T2's with 356 and 911 motors and upgraded suspensions
that
	were then used by the team when the factory was heavily involved in
rallying
	all over Europe.  The thought of chugging up the hill in my Westy
towards
	Turn 9 at Laguna Seca and then dropping down into the Corkscrew
gives me the
	willies.  I'm sure that at anything more than a fast jog she'd roll
over on
	her left side and whack the Armco, scaring the bejeesuz out of the
	spectators sitting under the trees.  Probably spill their chardonnay
and
	cucumber sandwiches all over their Ralph Lauren spectating togs,
don't you
	know.

Why go to Laguna Seca when you can take a white knuckled ride with Richard
Troy in his 912 powered '68 Crew Cab.  A 25mph turn on a freeway onramp
becomes 45mph and only the gearing prevents him from doing 90+.  You'd be
surprised at how well one could corner when taken to the limit.  

I got him back though on our trip to L.A. earlier this month.  He was in
agony the whole time as I drove like a true VW Bus driver.  He'd say,
"There's a hole.  You can pass this guy."  I'd say, "Yup.  That's a hole."
And keep right on cruisin'.
