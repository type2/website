John C writ:
"a stock distributor from 1976-1983 has 32 total at WOT, 42-45 at part
throttle cruise (read the Bentley manual if you doubt me)."

Just to clarify, it is possible to time the vacuum advance with vacuum
disconnected and plugged at 32 degrees at 3800RPM..?  Then test the results
with the vacuum attached and you should read 45ish degrees at part throttle?

That just seems like a lot of advance to me, but hey if it works go with it.
I will read up in the Bentley tonight to see their timing process...  So
much different than the T1 vacuum advance :)
