Subject: Wheel width & diameter

Hi everyone,
Can anyone tell me what the standard wheel width &
diameter are on a 77 bus?
I think they're 5 x 14 but I could be wrong & I'm
trying to source some tyres that'll be suitable for
the rear when the cold weather sets in & the ground
gets muddy.
The front tyres are almost bald but since the bus is
rear wheel drive they don't have to be very chunky &
I'll probably go with standard road tyres.....correct
me if I'm wrong on that one & should go to safer
tyres.
The rear tyres, however, could probably do with a
semi-offroad/4x4 style tread for greater traction in
winter when we will DEFINITELY get snow.
So can some one confirm or correct those figures for
me.
I'd also love to see a pic of any bus which has had
done the same sort of thing done to it.
Tyre models really aren't going to be a great help
because the tyres you guys have are either different
or really expensive over here in Australia but an idea
of the effectiveness of this idea would be great.
:-)
Cheers
