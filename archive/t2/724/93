Hi Mike,

Don't remember what year your bus is, but for a range,  the spec for a
68 is 27 mph in 2nd gear, and 32 mph for a 75.

 One other question would be "Is it hard on the engine to drive the bus 30
 mph in 2nd?"  It's my daily driver, and to get the 2 miles down to the store
 for groceries is through a 35 mph zone.  While it's not good for the other
 drivers' attitudes to be behind me, I don't want to damage the engine
 driving it like that.
