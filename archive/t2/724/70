Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch

I was under the bus a few moments ago and inspected the shift rods.

First thing is I noticed that neither square head set screw had locking wire
through it.  I'll fix that soon.  But the other thing may be the problem I'm
having getting into 3rd and 4th.

I noticed that the "cage", assuming that I'm identifying that part
correctly, isn't firmly attached to the collar that attaches to the
transmission.  The Bentley labels this "cage" a "housing" and it holds the
end of the rear shift rod onto the end of the trans.

If you turn the rear shift rod by hand you can see the housing rotating a
bit on the collar.  I.e. the trans rod and collar end of the housing don't
move at all, just the housing on the collar.

Maybe this is why I can't shift into 3rd & 4th?
