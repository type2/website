Mike,

For what it's worth, when I took the rod out of my 78 for thefirst time 
since it came from the factory, 

*None* of the  grub screws had safety wire in it...*and* no hole to put it 
in.

They had some sort of "thick" blue locktite sort of material in 
them and I was worried about getting them out.  

Once they were out, I drilled holes for safety wire before I put them back 
in.

Cheers, dave
