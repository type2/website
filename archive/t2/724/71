It's tight.  The collar that the screw is threaded into stays put while the
cage rotates on the collar.  I couldn't move the rear shift rod more than a
few mm in either direction, but it was clear that the cage could move on the
collar.

I didn't know that.  That might explain why I can get into 1st & 2nd, but
not 3rd or 4th.
