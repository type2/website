Subject: Re: [T2] Excessive Blow-by & Valve Rattle - are they related?

Hi Mark,

I have been running the same setup on my 72. Had the same problem with
blowby through the crank breather hose. It was worse when I had it
tied to the air cleaner. My mechanic said the nipple on the webber air
cleaner was too small and constrictive, and advised me similarly to
what you have done by running the hose up and around inside the engine
compartment. By running yours over the muffler, I know oil smokes and
rarely burns, but I wouldn't invite problems. Also, do you observe
lots of oil coming out the hose. At least with mine routed up, the oil
has a chance to condense and return to the crankcase. That quart per
300 miles isn't too bad. Ultimately mine was found to have a leak in
the oil cooler. Do you have other leaks?

Yes, you must adjust your valves on schedule or ruin them!

 The only reason I am asking about this now is because it needed a quart of
 oil each way between Christiansburg and Everybus (~3 hours).
