Hello Bill Being an old time canoer    running up and down the east coast 
running white water  I took a std bus rack and welded some pipes on each end and 
threaded the ends and put elbows onm the end with a cap on top   made them 
long enough to carry two whitesell canoes and a kayak in the middle.  I use to 
have a pix of my bus with 6 canoes on top of it that we took up in West Va. when 
we were running the new River Gorge  carried all 6 people and gear to the put 
in in that bus   If you have ever seen the new gorge area you know that it is 
all uphill    I also use to sell Yakima racks that worked real well    I 
perxsonally didnt like the quick qnd easy system as they tear up the gutters  
later and have fun  Mark Dearing
