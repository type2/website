Subject: 74 bus parts up for grabs.

     Well, the 74 is now just costing me money to keep insured and taged. It 
has to go.  It's just too rusty to be a decent prospect for restoration.  
I've already pulled the motor and tranny to keep around for myself, and I'll 
be grabbing a few other things tomorrow (brake booster, sunroof parts, 
anything else that catches my fancy).  Pretty much everything else is up for 
grabs.  I want to keep it rolling, so I can have it towed off.

Stuff up for grabs includes:
Guages ('cept for my good VDO ones which come off tomorrow)
Dash (kinda rough)
Glass (windshield is cracked)
Gas Tank
Doors are useable, not great
Whatever else you can think of that I can't and you need?

     I don't want to ship big stuff.  I'm not trying to get a bunch of 
money, but I'll probably charge you a small hassle fee and shipping charges 
if you need something shipped (more if it's a big PITA :-). Anybody in the 
area can come out and pick things up!
