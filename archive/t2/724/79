Subject: Re: [T2] Strange loss of oil pressure.

Hi Chris,

I have had experience with this. One time after an oil change, I had
trouble getting the pump primed. I had to inject oil into the hose
from the full flow adaptor to the oil filter.

I have also experienced not being able to suck oil when I was above
the add line. Beware incorrect dip sticks!

Also, you may have had a blockage that you cleared when you let the
oil pump out the hose.

 I didn't find any obvious problems. The pump had prime when it started.
 What did I do? Do you think that the pump just sucked air at some point and
 lost it's prime, never to get it back? Or perhaps one of the pressure
 reliefs was actually stuck and it just unstuck it's self when I messed with
 it or just with time. I am stumped.
