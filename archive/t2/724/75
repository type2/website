I don't know why you would want to check the end play
before you tear the engine down, I measure the case at
the bearing after the case is apart to see if it needs
to be fly cut, this sets the play on the bearing to
the case, then all that is left is to put the engine
together and choose the right shims(3)for the correct
end play of 3-5 thousandths. phil
