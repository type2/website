Guess it wasn't.

The fix quit working and I'm back to just 1st and 2nd.  Took the shifter out
to see what was what and discovered that the stop plate (9a in the Bentley,
p. 61-10) was actually broken.  The passenger side of the plate was broken
away from the rest of the plate.  Replaced it with a donor plate.

After the replacement, I still could not get into 3rd or 4th, and I noticed
that there doesn't seem to be any "H" pattern when I shift.  Trying to shift
into 3rd gets it back into 1st, the same with 4th and 2nd.

I also could not get it into reverse on the trip home this morning.

I've got the front bushing repaired (sort of, I fabricated something to
replace it), what else should I be looking at?

One other question would be "Is it hard on the engine to drive the bus 30
mph in 2nd?"  It's my daily driver, and to get the 2 miles down to the store
for groceries is through a 35 mph zone.  While it's not good for the other
drivers' attitudes to be behind me, I don't want to damage the engine
driving it like that.
