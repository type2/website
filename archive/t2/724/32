Check around for FLAPS replacements and junkyard replacements. Install the parts yourself. Go ahead and replace the dryer too. Once the system is open it will quickly soak up humidity and may later be a marginal preformer. 

Once it is complete have them pull a vacum on the system and charge it with oil and freon. 

I agree a/c service is EXPENSIVE but I like to think it is b/c they got you between a rock and a hard place.
