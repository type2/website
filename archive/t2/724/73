Subject: crank end play before the tear down?

Dan --  If you haven't done so already, take a look at Horrible Freight 
(harborfreight.com) and pick up a dial indicator.  Then rig a bracket to hold 
this as you push the flywheel fore and aft.... the indicator will give you the 
reading you need.  Also very handy to check if your wheels are true.  Often on 
sale, I see item 37862-2CAA for $14.

I'll let others weigh-in on line boring.  Talk to a race car shop for 
references on guys who do balancing of engines.... Glenn

 I am about ready to jump into the total rebuild.   I thought I read 
somewhere that it would be a good idea to find out the end play before 
tearing the case apart?  Is that correct?  If so, how would I do that? 

I will be taking the crank / case in for line boring (is this a good 
idea?) and polishing.   I am toying with the idea of having the engine 
balanced.  I have access to a three bar scale and thought I would do the 
rods and pistons.  Anyone have an idea what the cost would / should be 
for the rest?
