Subject: RE: Gas in Mexico

What we used to do (travelling with kiddos)  was to find a motel with a pool &
restaurant.  Have our comida there in heat of the day, use the pool, kids are
happy, bus happy not to be driving in heat.  Then drive more or less till
destination for the day or dark.  We often parked at a closed Pemex for the
night.  NEVER ON the side of the road.  Sometimes we would stop at a finca or
whatever to ask if we could park there for the night.  Met some great people
that way.  Easy to travel  with kiddos as the Mexicans love  kids.  We had
great adventures with our bus - more to come I hope.

Ginny - thinking about bus now in grown kiddos garage in Kelowna for the next
few weeks - Rats rats.
