Hi,
Sorry for the non bus related question. I just got an estimate of 770$
+ to change compressor (with clutch) and expansion valve to repair the
A/C on my 95 Golf. This is more than I would  spend for a fridge, so
no way i'll spend that for the fridge in the car !

Are there any A/C experts (Vanagon) on this list that could give me a
few pointers. I would like to understand if I can work on this myself
and possibly not change the whole compressor (400$ for a pump!) but
only the part that's wrong with it. It seems that the compressor needs
to be lubricated, which I guess never happened and could be part of
the failure. A few internet links or forums would be great.

To make it bus related : tomorrow we go camping :-))
