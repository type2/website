Karl, just because you can't save them all isn't a reason to give up!  :)

Yep, happened to be twice before I wised up.  First was a set of 185R14
passenger tires which wallowed like a drunken camel and finally
(mercifully) suffered tread separations.  Second, after I figured out that
the bus needs heavier duty tires I fell for the "195/75R14 supercedes
185R14" line.  After living with those too-small-diameter tires for a year
I finally got educated and forced the tire guy to order the correct tires
for my bus.
