I hope we can all learn tolerance and respect of one another. I'm sure
we are all where we are at because of our best thinking and
understanding of our life's experience. I hope our mutual interactions
can lead to understanding one another instead of condemning and
judging one another. We may see each other at bus events. Please don't
let animosity spoil the environment. It is also important for our bus
list to be able to get along to be able to help and share knowledge.

 great job of insulting  many on this list and confirming my already dim view
 of the burned-out-hippy Left.
