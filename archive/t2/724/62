Subject: crank end play before the tear down?

Hi!  78 2.0 engine 

 I am about ready to jump into the total rebuild.   I thought I read 
somewhere that it would be a good idea to find out the end play before 
tearing the case apart?  Is that correct?  If so, how would I do that? 

I will be taking the crank / case in for line boring (is this a good 
idea?) and polishing.   I am toying with the idea of having the engine 
balanced.  I have access to a three bar scale and thought I would do the 
rods and pistons.  Anyone have an idea what the cost would / should be 
for the rest?  I am aware that they will need the rods and pistons for 
the balancing process.  

I will be asking a ton of question as I progress, I hope someone will 
tell me if I become a pest on the list? 

Thanks!

dan
