You need a fixture to hold a dial guage, move the crankshaft all the
way one direction, zero the dial guage, and then move the crank all
the way the other direction. If you are in spec, then your case is
worthy of a rebuild at least in that respect. If it fails, it could be
bearing rather than the case.

Type 4 cases usually do not need this like type 1 cases, but it is
good to have the case inspected by an experienced Type 4 machinist to
make sure it is in spec. Same with having the crank checked.

 rods and pistons.  Anyone have an idea what the cost would / should be
 for the rest?  I am aware that they will need the rods and pistons for
 the balancing process.

Balancing is very good. The greater the precision, the longer the life
of your engine, not to mention smoother running. You need to go beyond
the rod/piston balance though and have your machinist balance the
rotating mass. Will need flywheel, clutch, and fan for this. Costs
under $200 from what I've heard.

You should be fine as tech support is what the list is about.
Tolerance is greater when you make some effort by studying the
manuals, the library, and the archives before posting questions, but
that is not always done by all, myself included!
