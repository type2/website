Bus content - Top and bottom end rebuild of Konrad the '69 Tiki Bus
commenced last weekend. With much help from legends of the Full Moon
Bus Club (Snoopy and Derek) we should have the job done next weekend.
This makes me very happy! Any thoughts on tossing on larger dual carbs,
to replace the single Solex we currently have?

About Focus on the Family - Dobson is of the opinion that the popular
cartoon characters have been (and this is a direct quote)  hijacked to
promote an agenda that involves teaching homosexual propaganda to
children. His organization, amongst others, has decried the
distribution of the music video We Are Family" to elementary schools.
At a black-tie presidential election celebration earlier this year,
Dobson addressed the crowd by asking, Does anybody here know
SpongeBob? His outspoken position on homosexuality, coupled with his
public commentary about SpongeBob, has prompted all of this discussion
and controversy.

This man is not godly, has nothing to do with what is good in this
world, and is instead a rigid fundamentalist (Say, aren't we fighting
people like this in the Middle East. Oh yeah, we are). Just as with
Falwell's attack against Tinky Winky, Dobson's wrath is directed
against a fictional, non-human character, which is patently silly. The
message of the video and the mission of the We Are Family Foundation is
tolerance. I must therefore conclude that Dobson's message and mission
is intolerance, which is indeed a strange morality for the head of an
organization that is supposed to promote family values.

I'll quit now...we all have better things to talk about than religion.
