Subject: Side step on Bus

HEY Guys,    

I just bought a 69 Westy.  And it has a side step just under the sliding door 
and is attached into the jack supports.

One side the bracket holding it into place is gone and the other side is 
pretty much stuck into place.  Any one anybody that is making at least the 
brackets for these things.  I know there rare but any help would be appreciated.
