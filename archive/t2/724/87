Volks,

Fairly abbreviated as I have just arrived home and it's 11:21 EDT, but:

I left work Wed. at ~2PM, finally got the cats into their carriers and off
to "Kitty Kountry Klub" at ~5.  Drove from Alexandria, VA up to College
Park, MD and Marcus Schaper's place, arriving at ~7.  We proceeded to
field strip his rear brakes, release the frozen adjusters and adjust his
rear brakes.  Left College park at ~11PM.  Arrived in Salem, VA at Mark
Deering's place on Thursday at ~4:30.  Passed out.  Woke up on Thursday at
~8 to find Jamie Rivers and his offspring surrounding the buses... a
scarier sight has rarely been seen.

Jamie delivered the engine for my '67 which Kelley had done the sheet
metal work on and Mark had painted.  We started in to engine assembly.
Finished engine assembly and installation, one oil pump installation
later, at ~7PM on Thursday, left for EB.  Arrived in Pleasant Garden, NC
at ~11PM and started drinking Greg Potts' home-brew.  Next memory (other
than the really beautiful woman that Rob Lafoon brought (hello, Amy! :))
is Sunday Morning at 10AM when we left EB.  Arrived home one ACSR later at
~11PM.  All is well and the most beautiful '67 bus in the world now
resides in Alexandria VA :-)

I do have vague memories of one of the finer camp-outs I have ever
attended (which I may describe in more detail when I wake up tomorrow) but
that Potts' fellow brews one powerful home-brew!!! :-) and Chris Cybulski
throws a realllllllly good camp out, m'lads and laddesses, I promise!
