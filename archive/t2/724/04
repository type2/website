Subject: [T2] Points adjustment tip

Having owned several Vanagons, Porsche 912e and a few VW Dune buggies It had
become the natural thing for me to just take the distributor out to install
new point sets.
With adjustments I go ahead and do the contortions to get them tweaked to
the proper dwell.
Point being; It's easier to pull the distributor and give it a good
inspection when you're installing new points and condensers. It's nice to
have the room to check things out, clean the distributor and test the vacuum
canister.
With old cars come old parts so often the culprit is a wrong screw in the
point set hold-down.
The proper screw should be a cheese head screw with a straight slot.
I don't know if it should have a star cut lock-washer or not, but I've seen
them both ways and try to put them back the way I find them. (Nearly
impossible getting the screw and lock washer installed with the distributor
in the car.)
Changing over to a socket head screw (Allen head) is sometimes an advantage
when trying to restart the screw if you don't have one of those nifty screw
holder devises.
Although Bosch point sets should all be the same ............ be advised
that they could be made in Brazil, Germany, Austria, Mexico and some will
have good phenolic (Bake-O-Lite ???) rubbing blocks and others could have
nylon or other plastic material causing different adjustment intervals.
