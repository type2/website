Well, apparently the PO had the plate in backwards.  Which would explain the
difficulty in getting it into reverse before, nad the near imposiiblility of
getting it into reverse when I reaplced the broken plate.

It goes into reverse just fine now.  Thanks, Richard.

I still can't get it tino 3rd & 4th, but I'll try to figure this out over
the course of the next week as I get time to get under the bus.

Replacing the broken stop plate changed the location of where the stick
"goes into" various gears, but I can get use to that.
