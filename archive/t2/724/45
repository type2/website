Excellent state of tune.
Good tires.
Good suspension.
Oil.
A screwdriver (if you have carbs) to adjust idle once at altitude if
your bus stops idling correctly.

Not a big deal aside from the fact that if your carb(s) are on the way
out anyway, being a mile in the sky will just make the problems much
more noticable. Ask me how I know... heh

Remember also that you lose +/- 20% of your power this high up. I
can't wait for the trip to monument valley just so I can see what my
bus would run like now at something approximating sea level.
