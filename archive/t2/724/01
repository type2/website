Subject: 71 bus cooling flaps

I cannot find a good picture in manuals
or on the net...

We pulled the engine which was running
fine (engine compartment warm, not hot)

while taking the fan housing off to clean,
the spring came off the flaps/control
rods that connect the flaps.  I put the
spring back on and the engine runs
HOT.  I am guessing I got the spring in
the wrong place because opening the
flaps took too much pressure.

I read about a thermostat
that controls the flaps.  I have never seen
this thermostat in any VW's I've worked on.
(somewhere between 10-15 bus and bugs)

would it be OK to leave the flaps loose,
not sprung?  Just let them float free, or
perhaps wire them open?

If someone has a good diagram of the
cooling system, it would be much appreciated.
