The compressor oils are different between R12 and
R134A.  But both pump oil, and happen to transport the
coolant at the same time.  The dryer unit, downstream
from the compressor, lets the oil drop out, and is
returned to the compressor for re-pumping, while the
refrigerant continues a straight path to the expansion
valve & evaporator (cooling side).  R134A pumps an
"Ester Oil" that R12 does not.
     
A/C compressors don't get lubricated.  There are no
zerks.  No bearing(s) to re-pack.  Instead, they pump
lubricant.  They swim in oil.  Did yours fail because
your system ran dry of oil?  If so, you have a
significant leak.  Normally, A/C units fail because of
a leak of coolant, not of oil.  And most leaks occur
at the front shaft seal of the compressor.
   
Tell us more.
   
To make mine T2 related, I'm going camping tomorrow to
a WetWesties campout at Fort Stevens, Oregon.
