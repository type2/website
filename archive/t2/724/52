Subject: Trim Ring Size

Hello All,

I wanted to install a set of chrome or stainless trim rings on my 72 bus.  
Was wonderinfg what size 14 ring they would be. I never know what the depth 
measurement is.  I see them for sale at various online parts stores for a wide 
price range.  I would hate to buy some that don't fit right and fall off.  Could 
someone out there measure theirs?  Any tips on some reasonably priced rings 
out there?  Also, do those trim inserts from bugs work on a bus... just 
wondering (like the way they look).

Thanks,
