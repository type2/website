Subject: Excessive Blow-by & Valve Rattle - are they related?

A great camping trip was had at Everybus 2005.  It was our first as this
year was the first year in 5 years of bus ownership we actually had a
running bus!.

On the way back up 220 climbing some of the hills, when the bus was under
small strain, there would be a definite valve rattle. (I've had early
Subarus and it sounds exactly the same). Do I need to figure put how to
adjust my valves?

I also have had excessive blowby through the crankcase breather; this has
been a problem for months. I have the breather hose exiting through a hole
in the tin and dropping it's contents onto the muffler to be burned off. 
The only reason I am asking about this now is because it needed a quart of
oil each way between Christiansburg and Everybus (~3 hours).

The motor is a 2L w/ weber carb.

Any help would be most appreciated!
