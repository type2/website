Subject: RE: [T2] New tires are on, why nitrogen ?

Maybe most of you knows why.  Here is what I found about it time ago.

It is because using nitrogen from bottles you do not get all the moisture
regular compressed air brings in the tire.

With low or no moisture inside the tire, tire pressure stays more constant
with temperature variations.

Correct me if I'm wrong.  It would be then a real good idea not to mount any
"wet inside" tire which were exposed to rain or other.
