No, the Agilis are 185R14C.  The have a PR6 or
PR8 ply rating and a load range of D.  The
185R14C tire is a higher spec tire than the old
reinforced passenger tires that were available in
185R14.  

Agilis is the recommended tire, it just isn't
popular enough to make it on Michelin's website. 
If you look on their configuration tool under
"choose specific tire", you'll see that Agilis
isn't even listed.  If you call the tech number,
they will tell you to use Agilis.  

Sorry for the FART.
