Subject: tire pressure???

Huh? If that were the case, wouldn't my tire pressure gauge read 15 psi when 
the tire was flat? It won't...go try it.... For that matter, it would 15 psi 
before I even pushed it onto the tire stem.

I believe that tire pressure gauges are designed to show us the _difference_ 
in atmospheric pressure and the pressure of the air in our tires. Using the 
term absolute pressure is a little pedantic because 0 PSI absolute pressure 
(or a perfect vacuum) doesn't exist anywhere naturally on the earth's 
surface. We would have to subtract 15psi from every single pressure reading 
to be able to compare pressures. Maybe NASA engineers have to work with the 
concept of absolute pressure, but I don't think even the most highly skilled 
mechanics or tire designers do.

The other thing that is overlooked is that a tire with _no_ pressure
already has about a third of the air in it that it will ultimately have.
Atmospheric air has an absolute pressure of ~15PSI, while a full tire has
an absolute pressure of ~45PSI.
