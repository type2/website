Subject: Automatic Kickdown spring available at Dealer

I needed a kick-down adjustment spring for a '79 2L
automatic Westy. It's about 2-3 inches long. This is
the spring that is at the accelerator linkage in
engine compartment at the throttle body.  I was
PLEASANTLY surprised that I was able to get this
through my local VW Dealer!  It was only $3.30 plus
tax.  From now on, I'll definitely not exclude my
dealership from consideration when searching for hard
to find parts.  Greg
