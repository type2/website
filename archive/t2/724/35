If anyone is interested, I found a ladder rack for a
Chevy van that I was able to modify to fit on my '76
Westy.  I had to drill two extra holes, but it is very
sturdy.  I use it to haul my hang glider but you could
use it for anything.  It would be great for canoes.  
Cost was a little over $150.  Easy to take on and off
with one wrench.   I'll get the details and post
pictures if anyone wants.  Just let me know.  Cheers...KR
