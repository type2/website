Subject: stripping a '73 Westy

What parts should I keep if I'm stripping down a totally rusted-out 73'
Westy before I send it to the wreckers? I own another '73 bus and was
keeping this one as my own little wrecking yard, but my wife says having 4
busses parked on our property is too many, so the '73 Westy has got to go.
I've already pulled the motor and tranny, and sold all the interior. Are
there any little hard to find bits I should save?  I was also thinking.  I
have a '66 Samba I'm restoring and was wondering if I could/should swap out
some Bay parts such as the front beam, or fuel tank, brake master cylinder,
hmmm .(or is it more work than what it's worth?).
