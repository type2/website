The correct distributor is ALWAYS recommended. You will experience
smoother power, and probably better mileage as well.

I live at 5900 feet and the vacuum distributor I have is perfect. I
had an 009 when I first got the bus and it sucked. I had to advance
the heck out of it for it to run right at highway speeds. Then I got
my vacuum dizzy. HUGE improvement.
