Actually, it says:

For further assistance, please contact our
Customer Relations department by calling
1-800-847-3435 during normal business hours
(Monday - Friday: 8:00 am to 6:00 pm, EST;
Saturday: 9:00 am to 5:30 pm, EST) or sending an
email.

And the kind young lady says that Agilis 61 is
the recommended tire.  I SHOULD have asked for an
email, but didn't.  I will and will forward it to
Margaret and Karl offlist unless anyone else
pmails me offlist.  

Sorry for continuing the FART.
