Are you running a type 1 or type 4 motor? In any case, the springs are
designed to push the flaps open so that if your thermostat fails, you
do not overheat your motor. Do not let them float free.

 perhaps wire them open?

 If someone has a good diagram of the
 cooling system, it would be much appreciated.
