Art student daughter (she literally grew up with the 78 Westy) has a 
page up on her site for her 75 bus- you can see her festooned dash on 
the link to 2005 Fla trip, and also the washable art painting party held 
at Westies in the Woods, with some Tim Hayden hieroglyphics painted on- 
he is owner of the Franken bus (Toyota chassis/60's bus top) and 
decorated the Broklyn Museum of Art.  You can see her at the upcoming 
Westies in the Woods May 27; we are driving right up from Savannah to NJ.
