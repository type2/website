Can I add a few things?

73 linkage looks drastically different. There are no clamps on the
ends of the crossbar. Instead, the brackets hold ball and socket
joints. One end of the crossbar has a tube instead of a true socket,
allowing the bar to move from side to side.

The throttle return spring is responsible for centering the crossbar
between the two brackets. (This was a month long discovery in and of
itself. Sigh.)

Also note that the brackets are often bent. Out of the 4 left side
brackets I have only one that was square to the world. Bent brackets
will cause binding or slop in the throttle.

The balls on the brackets after 30 years are gouged and grooved. Since
I got the bus I've tried every kind of grease possible to make that
movement smooth instead of feeling like pushing a broomstick into a
bucket of sand. Last weekend I pulled the brackets and polished the
balls up with my Dremel. Steel wire wheel first, then felt polishing
disks with black compound first, then white. There are still visible
grooves, but the edges are all rounded off and shiny. A thin layer of
moly grease is perfect now. The linkage is much smoother and the
crossbar also relocates itself easily.

One last thing: I can't stress enough how important fresh rubber
connections on the central idle circuit are! Even if they LOOK good,
they can still be leaking enough to throw the idle out of balance.

I can take detailed pics of the above if anybody wants them...

After my web host took a dive, my site went down. I have a new host
but haven't put the site back up. Of course I'm seeing this as an
opportunity to completely redo my site, which means it'll be 45 years
before it's done. ;-) That's why there's no link in my sig anymore.
