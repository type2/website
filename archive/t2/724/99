Well, I don't have an external cooler. Just the filter. I keep the lines as 
short as possible and change the hoses at least every other year. I was 
considering adding an oil cooler and thermostat once I move to Florida in 
September, but I still have to figure out where I would mount the cooler 
and fan. Maybe Ill start with the 1.5 quart sump first.
