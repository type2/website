DUDE!

Dobson is the head of Focus on the Family. He is a total whacko nut job
who thinks both Tinky Winkie (TeleTubbies) and Sponge Bob Square Pants
are promoting a homosexual agenda. (That sort of sums up how far out in
right field bowling for dollars with a bent hockey stick this dude is.

Along with Jerry Falwell and the rest of those right-wing nut jobs, a
total freakazoid.

They think all programming on PBS is responsible for the moral
deterioration of the country, etc...

I would be willing to bet he thinks all Bus drivers are irresponsible,
pot smoking, lazy, good-for-nothing hippies. (to make this post
somewhat relevant)

Give me PBS, or Give Me Death!
