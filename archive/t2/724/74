Subject: Pop top seal questions

My 80 Westy was purchased with a nearly new seal on the part of the roof that
lifts up and a damaged seal around the luggage rack. I have a new seal for the
luggage rack from Bus Depot. I started looking at things before changing the
seal today and I came up with a few questions.

1. Should the seal that is on the front of the pop top start at the corner or
above the seal that goes along the bottom edge? It currently starts above the
lower edge seal. The edge seal goes up to the corner on both sides.

2. How long is the luggage rack seal supposed to be? I held my new one up
along the edge to compare to the old on. I think It's going to be too short.
Do the Vanagons require a different length or am I just misjudging the
length?

3. Can the seal that goes over the top be ordered from anyone without the seal
that goes around the edge?

4. Do I need to remove the luggage rack to install the seal or just remove the
4 fasteners accusable from outside?

5. Where can I get some new fasteners to replace the rusty ones on my pop top?
I checked all the hardware stores and FLAPS in town, no one has any that have
the same shaped/sized heads.

Does anyone know the part number for a Pertronix ignition for this year bus?
