I keep saying to myself: 
"Karl, stay out of the tire farts, people believe what salespeople tell them over facts printed" 
"Karl, stay out of the tire farts, people believe what salespeople tell them over facts printed"
"Karl, stay out of the tire farts, people believe what salespeople tell them over facts printed"
but do I listen? Noo....  
People, I know you are going to buy what the salesperson tells you because he has it in stock 
and makes his living selling you tires.  What a salesperson tells you is not worth squat in a court 
of law when your bus crashes because of the wrong tires. Firestone lost all their lawsuits.....
I quote facts I can back up in writing. Writing that will stand up in a lawsuit.
People, don't ask questions after you buy the tires and then get buyers remorse.
You know you are going to buy it because it holds air, is round, and the salesman told it was 
correct. 
"I will not reply to anymore tire questions"
"I will not reply to anymore tire questions"
"I will not reply to anymore tire questions"
Maybe I will remember.......
