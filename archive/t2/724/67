Subject: crank end play before the tear down?

I will be asking a ton of question as I progress, I hope someone will  tell
me if I become a pest on the list?

Thanks!dan

This is sort of a ten part question.
#1) Check the end play by testing how far the fan will move forward and
backwarrds. Use a feeler gauge and flat bar.
#2) Why worry if you're going to tear it down?
#3) Chances are your case will not need align boring, check the #2 main
bearing support for roundness first, and look for curled edges in the case
indicating that the bore is hammered out.
#4) You can balance the rods and pistons with a $20.00 postage scale that
will go to 1 gram weight.
#5) Most cases you'll find replacement pistons Mahle, Mann, Cofap all within
1 gram when delivered to you.
#6) Most cases you can just swap pistons, wrist pins around and get a zero
balance set.
#7) The crank may require balancing but I seriously doubt it. They were very
good from thre factory.

#10) Before you start that teardown, and if the van is running. Run some
Rislone / Gunk / Siloo or other crank case cleaner through the engine.
You'll find it's a big help getting the interior of your crankcase clean.
Run the mix for the specified time frame in the instructions (most times 5
minutes) , let the engine cool and run the routine again with the same
mixture, cool the engine and run the mixture a time or two more. You're not
hurting anything.
#11) Get a copy of Tom Wilson's book How To Rebuild your Air Cooled VW
Engine. VERY IMPORTANT!
#12) Lots of very important info here http://tunacan.net/t4/index.shtml
#13) Lots of Type IV parts for sale
