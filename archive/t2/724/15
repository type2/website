You don't want water inside your tires, as it will corrode the rims.

However, I really doubt that nitrogen makes much difference over
compressed air (air is already 80% nitrogen!)

Air as it comes out of the compressor is pretty dry to begin with, since
one part of compressor maintainance is draining the condensed water from
the storage tank.

The other thing that is overlooked is that a tire with _no_ pressure
already has about a third of the air in it that it will ultimately have.
Atmospheric air has an absolute pressure of ~15PSI, while a full tire has
an absolute pressure of ~45PSI.

IF you want the inside of your rims _really_ dry, you have to figure out
some way to purge the air out before you start to fill.  The racer types
have two valve stems so they can drain out one side while filling from the
other, but even that doesn't purge the tire completely.

IMO, this whole "nitrogen fill" thing came about because some racers were
using nitrogen bottles as convenient, portable sources of pressurized gas
to fill tires.  You can fill a number of tires from one bottle of N2, and
you don't need electricity!  Folks saw the racers using it, asked why, and
the racers made up a good story!

Nitrogen is also used in aircraft tires at very high pressure.  The reason
that it is used here is because conventional compressors don't put out air
at such high pressures, and oxygen at high pressure tends to be more
corrosive than it would be in a car tire.
