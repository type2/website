Subject: Re: [T2] Carb Port Repair

Those brass tubes sticking out of the carbs every which way are just
pressed in. If you have one broken off, you might be able to wheedle
the last bit out. But probably not.

A decent machine shop can ream it out and fit a new one. If you're
gonna have the carb there anyway, might as well check the throttle
shafts for leakage and get that rebushed as well.  Virtually all carbs
have issues with hard steel shaft vs. soft metal carb opening up the
hole after many moons...

Of course, this may be a great time to give up the Weber altogether. ;-)
