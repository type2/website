Subject: Bending curtain rods

So ... in another life I was a plumber/gasfitter ... I worked in pneumatic 
controls for a short time - mostly as a grunt running air lines.  Anyway ... 
I used to bend this really small copper air line with a bender thing ... 
worked well for 90's and 45's (don't know how to make a 'degree' symbol'). 
But I'd like to find a way to bend some late westy curtain rod 180 degrees 
so I could use them in an early bus ... anyone ever bend this stuff? If so 
... with what?
