Subject: Carb Port Repair

In the following picture you can see a number of brass (?) ports on a carb.

On my "spare" weber carb I bought the gas inlet one was snapped.*

How do you fix this?

* Background:   The container contained the adjoining piece with
rubber hose and clamp.  I don't know if it broke in shipping (or
before?:() or nearly after as I was having too much fun opening it
with my 5 year old. (Be warned, their appreciation for "delicate"
dimishes proportionately to excitement of opening packages).
