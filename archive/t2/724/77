Subject: Re: Strange loss of oil pressure

Well, I am happy to report that when I buttoned up the engine and 
everything my oil pressure and everything came back up. I even took care of 
a minor exhaust leak while I was in there. It seems to be running fine now. 
Of course, my paranoid ear hears rods knocking all of the time now and I am 
scared that I hurt something, but a few more miles will tell the tale.

I don't think that it is possible for the oil pickup tube to fall off. I 
originally thought that might be it, but it is held in place with a nut 
inside the oil strainer area and it would be really hard for it to fall off.

I am going to guess that either the Berg pressure relief cover or the front 
pressure regulator piston got stuck when I over-pressured it and it finally 
just let go on it's own. No real explanation. There could be some crud in 
the oil, but I try to keep it pretty clean and not introduce any when 
filling it.

Ill just keep a close eye on the gauge from now on. I think I will finally 
go through with wiring up a really loud buzzer along with the idiot light 
too. Always wanted to do that, don't know why I don't. Ill do the generator 
light, too in case I throw a fan belt. It may buzz for a second when I am 
starting it, but I can live with that.
