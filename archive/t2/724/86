Subject: 72 to 77 fuel tank stuff

1) there were 4 screws from the bottom on the firewall on my 72.  Isn't this uncommon?  I thought there were only 2.  Which years had 4 and which 2?  My 73 had 2 so my guess is that 2 started in 73.
 
2) My 72 tank has the vent tube on top in middle (in addition to the 2 small ones that go to canister) that goes to filler neck.
I'm putting a 77 F.I. tank in that has no such vent.  I do recall that my 73 had no such vent either (another thing starting in 73?) and was always very difficult to fill with gas.  Do the two small vents (for canister) replace the large vent in middle for the purpose of breathing during filling up?  Without this middle tank vent and the newly open filler neck line, OK to tap the filler neck line into the vent lines (to canister) to restore its function?
 
3)  With the installation of the 77 F.I. tank, will the newer style guage sender work with 72 guage or will I have to get a 77 style guage?
 
thanks all!
