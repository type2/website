No sir. Go to http://www.michelin-us.com/
On the top right corner, click on vans etc.
Now select Volkswagen, Vanagon, 86, and then
reinforced.
And now you get this: 
http://www.michelinman.com/mastapp/servlet/Controller/site.toolkit.advisor.ShowResults?vehicle=18318

Now from that page that says: Sorry, there are NO tire
matches for you.  Move your cursor up to the link that
says  Tire Catalog.  Click on SUV. Now click on
Agilis.
Now READ the left side that says "Not available in
your
vehicle's original equipment size".
http://www.michelinman.com/catalog/tires/MichelinAgilis.html?tiretype=5&tire=7

Now if you can read where it says the Agilis IS the
recommended tire, more power to you. Show me. IT IS
NOT A REINFORCED SIDEWALL TIRE. There is more to a
tire then size, load range, and speed rating.

 No, the Agilis are 185R14C.  The have a PR6 or
 PR8 ply rating and a load range of D.  The
 185R14C tire is a higher spec tire than the old
 reinforced passenger tires that were available in
 185R14.  
 
 Agilis is the recommended tire, it just isn't
 popular enough to make it on Michelin's website. 
 If you look on their configuration tool under
 "choose specific tire", you'll see that Agilis
 isn't even listed.  If you call the tech number,
 they will tell you to use Agilis.  
 
 Sorry for the FART.
