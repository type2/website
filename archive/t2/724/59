Subject: Re: loss of oil pressure

It's only a guess... I really have no internal experience with the Type-2
motor.. or VW motors in general. Most of my experience comes with GM and
Ford engines.

One thing I'm not totally sure of... did you say that you NOW are getting
oil pressure again? Or do you still have absolutely no oil pressure?

One thought could be that your oil pickup tube could have possibly
disconnected itself? Maybe it wasn't bolted down properly and you lost oil
pressure because of it.. or maybe it's still slightly loose and when you're
at a certain angle, the pickup tube pops out a little bit?

It's just a thought....
