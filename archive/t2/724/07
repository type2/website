Subject: my bus came out of slumber today from winter

Hello type2 listee when i finally took my bus out
today of a long slumber from winter here in
Connecticut. I brought it to my vw mechanic who works
in Greenwich and i live in Bridgeport which is a good
35-40 minutes of 1-95. I didn't realize how much oil
leaked on the botton of my engine during the winter
when i went to open her up on the highway all the oil
burning off her was incredible all the people passing
me when white smoke was pouring off her. I had one guy
in a bmw flick me off for some reason but i made it
down to greenwich with no problem my bus is a champ i
have owned her for 6 years with not engine trouble my
fuel injected 2L engine is a fighter. I plan on
attending alot of shows this year in and around CT and
possible some campouts if anyone goes to any of the vw
shows in ct look for me in a 2 tone passenger van
white/blue with a awning i always have a grill cooking
something good to eat or drink well have camping and
everybody drive safe 

sincerely sam
