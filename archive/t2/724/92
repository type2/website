I've had nothing but bad luck with
the heater.  always leaks and
CO fumes give quite a headache.

Solution:  disconnect heater.

Would it be OK to block off
air outputs from fan shroud
(supposed to be routed to
heaterboxes) ?  More air
would be able to move by
cylinders/oil cooler.

There would be
no air going by exhaust, but
the same happens when the
heater lever is in OFF position.
