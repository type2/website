rich:

it's OK to wire them *open* temporarily if this weather is warm.  however, if
you don't restore them to proper operation, this will ultimately reduce the
life of your engine due to longer cold starts.

do not leave them loose and do not attempt to let them operate without the
spring.  if they get stuck closed, you run the risk of destroying your engine
very quickly and very permanently.
