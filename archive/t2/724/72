Subject: ADMIN AGAIN Re: [T2] RE:missing california (OT re Dobson)

Mike Benthin posting OT after a thread has been killed by an 
admin?  I can hardly believe it.

I'm really saddened by the lack of restraint shown here.  The 
purpose of this list is to discuss type2s, not POLITICS.  I 
thought everyone here knew that and accepted it.

So here's the deal - The next person that posts on this topic will 
be immediately and permanently removed from this list.  I don't 
care who you are or how long you've been here - I'm not kidding.

And in case anyone was wondering, Joseph Ames is no longer a list 
member and will not be back.

 Type2 list administrator

that any religous agenda forced into the political arena is a sign 
of the "Tyranny of the Majority" that is coming.  This is why the 
founding fathers created the balance of powers that certain 
religious Republicans sought to trample by trying to void a 
decision based on much law review by judges.
