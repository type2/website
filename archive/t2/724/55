What a crock, all that's wrong with America is the fualt of Howard Stern and
Hollywood!? Do you really believe that retoric?

More likely the fault of rotten parents, educators, and politicians that are
too self absorbed to truely give a crap about those around them, oh wait
that's right Hollywood, Stern and the Rappers made them do it!

Stupid me what was I thinking! groan....
