Hmmm.  There's nothing like watching selfless liberal tolerance and
brotherly love in action.   Thanks Alejandro, Tim, et al.  You've done a
great job of insulting  many on this list and confirming my already dim view
of the burned-out-hippy Left.

"Hypocrisy" does not begin to describe what you've done.

Leader of Focus on the Family. He's given Colorado Springs quite the
reputation as a haven for close-minded religious fanatics who teach
intolerance and hatred in the name of God, and who think they can bring
legislative pressure on politicians to eliminate "problems" in society like
homosexuality. At least, that's him in a nutshell...

PS Don, I hope you're not mad at me for the posting. I didn't mean to be
mean....

Who the heck is this James Dobson?

Yes, friends, PBS is one of the better things in life. If you want to come
down on who's responsible for moral degradation in our siciety, look to the
likes of Howard Stern and Hollywood/commercial TV in general (not to mention
the whole of rap/hiphop music).

One who is also a liberal yet prays to God Almighty...

Dobson is the head of Focus on the Family. He is a total whacko nut job
who thinks both Tinky Winkie (TeleTubbies) and Sponge Bob Square Pants
are promoting a homosexual agenda. (That sort of sums up how far out in
right field bowling for dollars with a bent hockey stick this dude is.
