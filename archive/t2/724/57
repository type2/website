Subject: loss of oil pressure

Hi Chris,

Hmm..this is a strange one...My first guess is that the low oil level caused 
some starvation on a hill or coming up to a stop. That doesn't explain, 
however, the lack of pressure once you added oil and started again. I'm not 
sure about the pump losing its prime and just pumping air. I'm not sure that 
the pump really keeps a prime when the engine isn't running. Seems to me 
that it will always start with no oil and prime itself very quickly while 
cranking the engine. Anyone else have a definitive answer for this one?

Since this is a recent rebuild, is it possible that there was something in 
the oil passageways that finally came loose and temporary blocked some part 
of the oil system? Maybe you didn't get it quite clean enough during the 
rebuild? Or would the new case make that not the problem?

Hmm.. sorry, I'm just thinking out loud here and nothing is going, "AHA!"

I didn't find any obvious problems. The pump had prime when it started.
What did I do? Do you think that the pump just sucked air at some point and
lost it's prime, never to get it back? Or perhaps one of the pressure
reliefs was actually stuck and it just unstuck it's self when I messed with
it or just with time. I am stumped.

Anybody else have a prognostication?
