Meg,

Your tires are fine.

The max inflation you stated tells me you got the load range D tires. The
"load range D" designation of your tires implies that they are a LT tire.

The Bently manual and the '79 owner's manual concur that LT tires are
acceptable for the van.


Quoted from my 1979 Type 2  Volkswagen Owner's Manual, Page 53:

"Your VW is equipped with tubeless tires of either designation:

185 R 14 C 6 PR*
or 185 SR 14 Reinforced

* The 'C' type tire also bears the label 'Load range C.'"

"The letter 'C' stands for 'commercial,' the European rating similar to the
domestic 'LT,' meaning a tire for light trucks.  The words 'Load Range C'
stand for load range C in a COMMERCIAL tire." (emphasis not added)


And from Bently, 8.13.2 Tire Types And Pressures:

"...Caution-Not all bias ply or radial ply tires are the same. When you buy
replacement tires, select only bias ply tires that have an 8 ply rating;
select radial ply tires designated 'reinforced' or, for Delivery Vans and
Station Wagons, with the suffix 'C.' Other tires of identical size may have
inadequate load carrying capacity." (that suffix means "commercial," which
equates to LT, not "load range C." -ed)

Rest easy, Meg.

Question I may have misunderstood but in a discussion on the samba I
think Karl was saying these are really not the right size for our
busses? Did I read that right?
