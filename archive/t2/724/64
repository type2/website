It's hard to picture a 78 Westy and a VW Touraeg in the same driveway.
We looked at the Tourareg (needing a 4WD vehicle) and bought a Subaru 
Forester for $12,000 less.   The Touraeg is a way too heavy gas guzzler. 
  Ten miles per gallon less in a vehicle burns over TWO TONS of extra 
CO2 into the atmosphere.  It's one reason we drive a Westy instead of a 
Winnebago.
The Touraeg is one of the few "Tax Dodge" vehicles suggested last year 
for business owners by savvy accountants to get a large deduction 
($100K?) if the vehicle was for business use and weighed over 6,000 lbs! 
  The original measure was to give farmers a break on heavy farm 
vehicles; didn't take long for business owners to take advantage.

As to being pro Dobson,  I will go off topic this once.  I feel that any 
religous agenda forced into the political arena is a sign of the 
"Tyranny of the Majority" that is coming.  This is why the founding 
fathers created the balance of powers that certain religious Republicans 
sought to trample by trying to void a decision based on much law review 
by judges.
