Subject: Re: [T2] Gas in Mexico

I've taken my '71 to Mexico many times on trips ranging from a week to 4 
months. I've stopped taking a spare gas can because gas availability is 
no longer the problem it was in the 80's. Most towns of any size have 
gas but if your going far off a main highway, be sure to ask first. I've 
never driven in the heat of summer though so watch your engine temps. 
Also listen for pinging and be prepared to tweak the timing if necessary.

To expand on Ginny's advice regarding gas pumps, a trick that I've seen 
them pull is to not set the pump all the way to zero and start pumping 
as soon as the vehicle stops but before you have a chance to get back 
there. If there is a passenger in your bus, have them jump out 
immediately to watch for this. If you are by yourself, a gas cap lock 
comes in very handy here.

You will probably want these books for your mobile library:

For maps, the Guia Roji road atlas (about 130 pages, 8 1/2 x 11 inch 
format) is hard to beat.

For camping locations, the latest edition of "Traveler's Guide to 
Mexican Camping" by Church & Church is indespensible. Check just before 
you leave to make sure you have the latest as some of the campgrounds 
tend to come and go.

A copy of "The Peoples Guide To Mexico" by Carl Franz is required 
reading for a VW Bus trip to Mexico. Carl was a buddy of John Muir (VW 
Idiot Guide) and it shows. Although the book is old now, they keep 
putting out updated editions. The book is worth it for entertainment 
value alone.

Believe it or not the "AAA Mexico Travelbook" has lots of good information.

Let me know if you need more info.

Happy Trails,
Bill Moon
