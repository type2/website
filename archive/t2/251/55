Here come the additive flames(flame-suit being donned)...

	Add some Marvel with the oil change.  It'll do what you want, PLUS it gives 
your engine bay that fresh wintergreen smell!  Ready for the fall holidays!

Question: I just put 40 straight weight oil in my bus.
We are sliding quickly into fall. As it gets colder,
can one "thin" the oil by adding 30w or 20w of the
same brand?

I plan on switching to 30w at the next change and
warming up real good.

If this sparks an oil jihad, pls email me direct.
tnx
