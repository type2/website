Subject: Re: [T2] Cover for a Westy

I was just on the phone to the flaps i work at on another issue and 
checked this at the same time.  As soon as you leave tyvek you are into 
steep to really steep pricing.  I took the ratio of increase from a 
regular sized car through the increases and then compared to the 
increase rate on the buses and vanagons.  the vast majority of the 
increase is the fact of life of the massive amount of material needed.  
part is probably the size and weight of the box.
