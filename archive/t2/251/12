Subject: Re: [T2] '68 Panel Part Needed (fwd)


There is a guy in England somplace that makes body panels...although this 
sounds like a standard replacement part there.

Alan Scofield or Shoenfield or something like that.

He can handle orders to the us no problem.

Someone will have the name correctly, I have a catalog at home, but who 
knows where!<grin>.

Pmail me if no one else comes up with the answer.

Cheers, dave
