It's held in place by a metal clip buried inside the rubber seal.
When the old metal clip gets relaxed or rusty, it loses it's grip.

My cure was vinyl bathroom caulking in a tube.  Squirted a bead
into the groove of the seal, and pressed it back in place.  Then
masking taped it in position until the caulk set up.  No sags
for over a year now.

Good luck,
