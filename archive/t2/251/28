In response to a question about speed bleeders

I'm going to bleed the brakes soon and I was wondering if anyone had
installed speed bleeder valves? I've seen these for 914's and other cars.
I've used them with good results on a BMW motorcycle. They make the bleeding
operation very easy.  Of course on a bike you can see what is happening.
Even with the speed bleeders on a car I think it would be advisable to have
an assistant at least look at the jar as it fills with fluid and alert you
when it is coming out clear so you can move to the next wheel.  I would
start with right rear, then left rear, right front and finally left front as
these are furthest in order from the master cylinder. Still, I wonder if you
could not do all four at once, as long as the receiving jars are big and you
have a big can of brake fluid.  Any experience out there?
