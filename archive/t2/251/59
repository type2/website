Subject: VW Drag Day Time Slips

Greetings List -

I'm finally coming down from the thrill of the Drag Races. What a rush!

They had basically two Classes for the street-legal A/C VWs - those under 
8.00 seconds in the 1/8th mile, and those 8.00 seconds and over.

Well, I was in the latter, along with 60+ other VWs. I was the only bus in 
the group. Itch has grown a bit portly with the addition of the awning, 
side-tent, 2 extra deep cycle batteries and all.

I have posted my time slips at: www.SaveTheBays.org/VWDrags.htm for your 
perusal.

Basically, these cars were passing me like I was standing still - but after 
the finish line!

Like I said in my previous post, this was my first drag race, and if this 
thrill wasn't worth the $15 race fee, I certainly don't know what could be. 
I encourage everybody in the area to participate next run, I believe 
sometime in March. Imagine the fear it would strike in the hearts of the 
Turbo-racers if 5-6 busses showed up next run!

Later!

Mike & Itch (aka Moby Dick, Rhino, White Whale to the dragstrip announcer).
