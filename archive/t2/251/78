Subject: Re: [T2] Cover for a Westy

Try this---Autoanything.com
I have a real nice Covercraft cover's for both my early and late
Westies---
The cover's are Noah cover's--and guarantee'd for 5 years--$129.00
delivered---heavy duty, quilted for softness to the finish--pretty nice
cover's--
I have had one of these on my BMW 325 for at least 5 years--and it still
functions real good--
And they all were custom stitched for each vehicle---so the spare tire
area for the 74 Westy was sewn in---etc---
Later,

Terry

I was just on the phone to the flaps i work at on another issue and
checked this at the same time. As soon as you leave tyvek you are into
steep to really steep pricing. I took the ratio of increase from a
regular sized car through the increases and then compared to the
increase rate on the buses and vanagons. the vast majority of the
increase is the fact of life of the massive amount of material needed.
part is probably the size and weight of the box. jimt  

. Wolfsburg West says that they don't sell a special Westy cover. I saw
that GoWesty sells what they say is a Westy cover, but at a rather steep 
price if you want other than the basic tyvec fabric. Are there any other 
choices listies could recommend, and/or any comments on the GoWesty
cover?
