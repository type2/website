Ok, I took the dist back out.  Looked down the shaft and noted how the
drive shaft was lined up.  I arranged the dist so that when I put it in,
it would go in the way it should to correctly line up together. Put it
in, didn't slip or anything.  Tapped it down and made extra sure that it
was all the way down.  I can push the rotor down just a tad, but the
spring at the bottom pushes it back up.  It does not slip though.  I
also tested the head temp sensor.  Bentley says it should be somewhere
around 2500 when tested with an ohm meter.  Now, I am not electrically
inclined so bear with me.  I had the meter set to 2k on the ohm side of
the meter.  It registered about 1.900.  Any other settings on the ohm
side did not even come close so I assume I picked the right one on the
meter.  Bentley says that if it registers too far higher or lower from
2500 that it needs to be replaced.  Is this part of the culprit or am I
still doing something wrong with the dist?  Thanks 

Troy

Tap the dizzy back in with a piece of wood (rotor off) you did not have
it
engages all the way, or had it 180 degrees out and it slipped off.
There
should be a spring in the hole in the dizzy drive gear that is still in
the
motor.

The gear that the dizzy goes into can be ANYWHERE...........as long as
it is
meshing underneath, and the van will run as it did................Just
put
it back in and time it...........you are not getting it in all the way.
