Jim(Captain<grin>)

I brought a 78 back after 8 years in the same type of conditions.

Anything touched by fuel will need to be taken apart depending on how much 
was in it when it died.  See the gas tank pics here 
http://www.shockwaverider.com/78bustankjob/   

Look at #12 to see what came out of the tank.

Brakes would need to be totally rebuilt/restored...fluid flushed
all brake cylinders/master replaced....don't try to skimp, just do it!

Replace pads/shoes at the same time.

Yes, the brakes on mine worked ok, but one cylinder was totally 
stuck...indicative of the condition ofthe rest....master was leaking.


Cheers, dave
