Subject: My first "Westy" Question!!




But not the last, I'm sure, as I deal with my new-to-me '82 Westfalia...

When I put up the pop-top the seal around the edge of the pop-up sags for
several feet in various places.  I can't see what's to keep this seal in
place, unless I'm supposed to use some sort of glue or sealer.  The seal
itself is flexible and supple.

What's the "cure" for this problem?

TIA!
