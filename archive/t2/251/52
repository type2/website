I'd lay a top-dollar bet on an air leak around the intake manifold on the
right side.  Check this by starting the bus and letting it idle.  Then, with
it still running, sparingly spray carb cleaner directed at the the
manifold-to-head area and listen for any change in idle speed.  

An intake leak in this area is common and will cause exactly what you
describe.  It can be tricky getting the manifolds sealed good.  I finally
started using some gasket sealer on both sides of the gasket when I ran dual
Webers on my bus and 914.
