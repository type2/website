Subject: Re: [T2] Rear Window Wing Drivers Side

Vent window for the rear seat?

Remove rear most side glass and seal.

The vent window and it's seal will slide out and then pivot it out of the 
window opening.

Repair the rust you find.

The rest is self explanitory I think. If you have questions let me know.

You'll need a new seal for the large window I expect as if it is old it is 
not worth saving.
