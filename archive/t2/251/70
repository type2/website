Marcus,,
you didn't mention what country you are importing the camper to,,,, but when I
imported my 1974 into CANADA, The Canadian Customs wanted Tax and Duty on
$1500.00 Canadian dollars,, a value out of their price book.

That was in 1990, to Canada from u.s.a. They wanted 6% duty on a "VAN" and 15%
duty on "CAMPERS" , so when I presented the "VAN" at the border,, I made sure I
called it a "VAN"  numerous times, so they would look in the book under "VANS".

Call the Canadian border crossings and see if they have a book value.  Then get
them to fax it on a letter head, 

Hope that helps
