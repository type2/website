It is simply flexible paint for vinyl and plastic. The stuff is the exact 
stuff you need to recolor either vinyl or plastic and not some JC Whitney 
miracle in a can or some other miracle hype. The professional guys/gals use 
it. All the local FLAPS carry about 3-4 colors but none seem to be the same 
quality as the stuff I used. The brand name is SEM.

Our local auto body supply store carries about 2 dozen colors in stock and 
can get any color you want.

$6-$7 a can. Easy prep, easy spray, dries VERY fast.

Even survives my grandfather's death grip on his steering wheel which I 
recently resprayed. He had rubbed the OEM color off. He does this to every 
car - presses so hard that all the switches have no markings - windows, 
turnsignal levers, etc. I've begun wondering if it isn't my grandmother's 
lotions too.

I have recolored the dash and plastic trim inside my bus as I am moving 
away from the Champagne Edition brown everything (Cow Poop Edition) to 
something different. The good thing is that I can recolor it again when 
Champagne Edition Westfalias reach $25K for stock condition... The paint is 
very thin, durable, and does not hide the texture of the vinyl or plastic.
