tried speed bleeders and wasnt impressed.  my usual technique is to 
take a large clear soda bottle and a  length of clear plastic line like 
found for air lines at most aquarium stores.
plastic line piece long enough to go from the bleeder to the bottom of 
the bottle.
put about 1/2 inch into bottom of bottle
loosen  bleeder port
enter vehicle and pump at least ten times
check color in tube
repeat  if necessary
seal bleeder port
next bleeder
when done recap bottle and recycle
