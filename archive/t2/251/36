Subject: Re: [T2] popping from webers

i had the exact same problem with my dual 40mm webers, i downloaded a step 
by step guide to adjust them and it fixed it, it did allot of sneezing and 
popping threw the carbs and the exhaust, i adjust the linkage(new) so that 
they were sync'd and i bought a syncrometer to adjust the idle, but before 
i used the sync'r they were pretty well fixed and sync'd up, so borrow 
one....

check out this link, and adjust your idle mixture and such....
