Not as far as I could find.  I was told that the diaphram is the same as a
914 and available, but I could not find one.  New pumps are simply NLA.

You may need a regulator.  Depends on the pump.  I have not run one (I
stick to FI), but the Facet pumps are supposed to need a small regulator
to reduce pressure to 2-3PSI.   Any VWFLAPS should have one.

On the one hand, the mechanical pump at the front of the block on the old
dual carb buses was pretty reliable, on the other, parts are a bear to
find these days.  Since you have a pump in the spares box, I'd advise
buying a regulator to keep it company, some fuel hose, and an electric kit
to make up a jumper to power the pump.  As I say this, tho... be warned
that my style of travel is very "white knight".... I tend to stuff every
nook and cranny of the bus with spare parts when I go on the road :-)
