Subject: normal vacuum?

I've been dealing with various vacuum related issues and am trying to find
a spec for normal vacuum readings.  Checked Bentley, but it barely
mentions the air system; only mention of vacuum readings was in relation
to dizzy advance curves.  No definitive answer from the archives either.
Is there a spec for this?  What is normal?  Should it vary over time (from
startup to warmed up)?

I went out and got a vac gauge and got a wide range of readings, from as
high as 15"Hg to as low as 10"Hg.  Often, the reading would oscillate 2"
(and the engine would speed up and slow down as I watched the vac reading
swing).  Also, I can hear what sounds like "sucking wind" from the engine
compartment (maybe near the throttle body but hard to tell).  I went ape
and replaced ALL the small vac lines, some of the larger ones, clamped
all the larger vacuum tubes, removed and cleaned the throttle body and
reattached it with Blue RTV around the gasket (some archive post
mentioned possible leaks here).  Gonna start 'er up tonight after the
gasket maker dries... hoping for good readings!
