Subject: Re: [T2] My first "Westy" Question!!

did the trim change over the years? on my 70, which i just installed a
new seal for (long one, not the short middle one) it has metal clips
inside it which merely pinch the edge of the fiberglass top (or so i was
told AFTER i glued the damn thing on!!). now the smaller middle one i
installed with 3M weather strip adhesive as i was advised to use.
actually, the instructions that came with mine suggested 3M.
