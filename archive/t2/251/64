>>>  A sign in it says the PO crossed the battery connections.

I did this on a generator powered Beetle on a bet. Said I could start the 
car with the cables reversed.

It did and it ran!!! Don't think I would do this with a Type IV engine that 
was fuel injected or powered by an alternator.

I would expect possible damage to some or all of the fuel injection system 
and possibly the alternator or regulator.

No damage done as far as I could tell. That was back in 1991.

No it didn't run backwards. I didn't drive it, and it was dark.

No beer was involved or anything else controlled by our government!!!
