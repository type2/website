They are made in Brazil.  The only article about them I've seen concerns
use in race buggies and they seem to like them.  Of course this isn't
exactly unexpected from the VW press.  They did say that there are some
issues of clearancing, matching the oil pump holes, and fixing the
distributor drive macnining.  It seems that if you want to use these you
really need a competent builder (ala RIMCO) to detail the castings for
you.
