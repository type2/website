Subject: alternator tip & question

In putting in a new alternator, i replaced much of the
related wiring. I found a good $4 replacement at
Wallmart for the heavy positive line that runs to the
battery from the alternator. 

I picked up a 27" battery cable meant for a riding
mower. It's just a bit heavier than the stock one and
has a eye hole at each end, so attaches in a second to
the alternator contact (i added a couple washers) and
to the positive battery clamp. It comes in several
lengths. I guessed on 27" and it was about perfect.

Question: I just put 40 straight weight oil in my bus.
We are sliding quickly into fall. As it gets colder,
can one "thin" the oil by adding 30w or 20w of the
same brand?

I plan on switching to 30w at the next change and
warming up real good.

If this sparks an oil jihad, pls email me direct.
tnx
