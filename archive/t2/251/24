Seems this may be the issue?  When I push down on the rotor and turn, it
will only have a slight bit of play.  It grabs though and I cannot turn
it all the way around like before.  However when I don't put pressure on
the rotor, it pops up about 2mm and I can then spin at all the way
around.

I had this problem on my 69'. The shims in the bottom of the dizzy wore
out and the whole shaft could easly move up and down and would not catch
on the shaft in the engine. Pull out the dizzy and take a look see.
