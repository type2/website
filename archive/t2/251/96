Subject: Camper Engine in a bug

Hello

I know this is not strictly a camper question but hopefully you maybe able
to help me. (again!)

My Girlfriend has a 1971 1200 base Beetle, but the engine is totally worn
out.

I have a spare 1600 from my Camper van.  Does anyone know if I will have any
problems if I put this in the bug?.  Will it create problems with the
gearbox?

Any advice would be gratefully received

Cheers
Matt
