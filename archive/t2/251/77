Glen,

Yes, you can, but is it worth it?  My understanding (theoretical, I've
never tried this) is that to get to 30W you would need to mix 20W and 40W
50/50, which meand draining off half your oil.  Once the plug is out,
would it not be easier just to drain it?

My fall oil change is coming up, and I intend to go back to 20W-50 for the
winter.  I have been running 50W all summer and am quite happy with it,
but it is definitely on the thick side these days.  In the next week or
three, I will be switching back to 20W-50 'til spring.
