Subject: Re: [T2] detinting windows?

Depends on how they are tinted. If it's just that film that is applied
to the inside of a window, yes. there might be a solvent that will
help with the adhesive, but you can use a razor blade to scrape the
tint off the glass. If you talking about a tint that seems in the
glass, no. This is usually part of the film of "stuff" that goes in
between the 2 sheets of glass to create safety glass.
