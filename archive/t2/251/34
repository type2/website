Subject: Bringing Back A Bus

I'm thinking of buying another bus. The bus in question is a 1971 Westy.
When parked, it was in excellent shape. It's been sitting under an oak tree
for about 9 years.

I know I'll have to go through the fuel system. It will probably need new
tires and have the brakes unfrozen.

Can anyone think of other things that might need attention after this long
time period?
