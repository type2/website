"I've found model-specific, rebuilt bus dizzies at NAPA's web page for about
$80. The Philbin Group ( http://philbingroup.com/) has them for about $100."

FWIW (and it may be worth a bit), I live in Portland.  Philbin is located in 
Portland.  I decided to wander on down there and check out the product 
earlier this summer.  My Bus (a 1970 stocker) required a 205T.  And that's 
what the counterman pulled right off the shelf.  Looked like it was brand 
new.  The list was over $100 but I was charged $54.00  So, I'm not really 
sure what to make of the "list" prices.  Nice work on the distributor though!
