Subject: Coolers and Gaskets

Ashley is running hot at the moment. He touched a staggering 140 degrees C
oil temp on the way to Vanfest at the end of a long run. Thankfully this
dropped quickly with some 30mph 3rd gear running and a bit more care on the
way back to keep him at 120 max. Looks like a I got away with it as he is
still running properly with normal power and ticks over beautifully. Engine
sounds very good as well.

On my return I went hunting for what I hopped was a loose engine bay seal
or something caught in the fan but neither seemed to be a problem. I now
suspect the oil cooler has too much muck in it. It's obviously working as I
can cool the engine with slower running but it needs looking at.

My question: On a 1600CC Type 1 engine, can the fan shroud be removed so I
can see the cooler WITHOUT dropping the engine ? It looks fiddly but
dooable if I take the alternator out, but before I get stuck in I thought
there must be someone out there who has tried this. Incidentally, has
anyone got pictures online of doghouse & non-doghouse coolers ? I'm not
entirely sure what I have and am now curoius, especially if I decide to
replace the cooler !

Second question (unrelated as far as I know): In the Haynes manual, on P51
it warns against using a pre-heater gasket with a small hole when
re-fitting the exhaust. The photos shows the same one I used (it came in
the fitting kit) when I recently re-fitted it and I assume this is the one
with the "small hole" as it does appear to be smaller than the inside
diameter of the pipe. Can anyone confirm this and also explain what the
effect of fitting such a gasket would be. I assume it restricts flow of gas
and can't see why anyone would want to use a gasket to do this, but what
would I gain by taking the gasket back out and making the hole the right
size ?
