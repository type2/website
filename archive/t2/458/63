So far every response to this has be wrong or only right in small part. The 
first thing to do is verify all maintenance is up to date. This sounds like 
an issue that will typically be resolved by just adequate maintenance 
inspection. Rule that out before any further diagnosis. It needs to be done 
anyway if it's been too long and rules out a bunch of possible  obvious 
causes. Worn or heavy deposits on plugs, cracked cap or rotor, clogged fuel 
filter, clogged air filter, valves not quite closing all the way, poor 
compression, all the things that are never allowed to become a problem if 
addressed in rational order by periodic maintenance inspection.
