Not the stuff I used!  Been tested at 100 degree plus in full sun all day 
at the Eureka springs show....i147 degree pavement too!

Plastic looking on one side and tar/rocky looking on the other side.
I think Chris Mills and I used the same stuff.  Dirt cheap and when you 
tap on the outside panels, it sounds like a mercedes instead of a 
vw<grin>.

Labeled "sca" or something like that...comes in a big roll..if you buy 
some, then ask me how I put mine on.

I *did* buy it at the local roofing supply  place.

Cheers, dave
