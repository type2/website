Subject: 79 into 72

Good afternoon everybody.
My bus has had some pretty lousy bondo work done by a po. I have been 
looking at pictures of a 72 for sale in the area. The 72 has no engine or 
tranny and it is not a camper. I'm not sure about the body yet, but if it is 
in ok condition I was considering using it. Would it be possible to install 
the engine and tranny and camper equipment from my 79 into the 72. The 
engine is rebuilt stock. The tranny is a stock automatic. I may want to use 
the camper equipment from a different year, but was just wondering if the 79 
equipment would work. I definitely want to use the pop top from my 79.  Is 
there any problems I should consider before doing this. How hard will it be. 
I have never dropped an engine or tranny before, but am not afraid to try.
Thanks,
Kyle
