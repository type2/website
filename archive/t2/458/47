Subject: Am I on the right track??

Ok, here's the poop. I'm driving my 1970 to work this morning and while
shifting between 3rd and 4th, I feel it lose some power. I think. "that's
wierd" and coast to the light. My bus is sputtering and I keep it alive by
tapping teh gas a little, but when I try to pull forward at the light, it
dies. Now I can't start it back up. It turn over and almost catches, but it
won't fire up. I checked for spark on 4 and I've got it. Do I need to check
all four or is that a dumb question. The spark at the coil was orange, so St.
Muir says replace the coil, I'll do that. I haven't chacked my points yet, but
they probably need replacing as well.  Am I on the right track? Or am I
missing something. Here's the stats:

1970 Westy w/ 1776 and 009 dizzy ( I know, I know), dual Kadrons
