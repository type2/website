There is no way you can adjust it yourself. If you have the correct size tires, which you do [but Rob does not
because he has an aspect ratio of 75], check the odometer accuracy by travelling along a measured mile. If it
reads one mile, then the problem is in the speedo head. You have a weak magnet. There is no direct connection
between the needle and the head. Only an air gap and a magnetic field. If the 4 magnets loses their strength,
the weight of the speed cup will slow the needle down.
The only fix is to have the speedo recalibrated by reloading the magnets. It may be cheaper to find a good
used one....
