Sorry, Wil (who has a 1980 Vanagon)

I guess I just use that term to distinguish two general categories of bay 
window VWs.


I don't know if there is a formal year breakout, but in the terms we are 
discussing, the late bay would be the fuel injected models. (Air Intake 
Elbow Boot)

The early bays could stop at 1970, the last year for the four wheel drum 
brake and wide 5 lug wheels, or 1971, the last of the uprights with the 
removable apron, or 1973, the last of the rearward opening fiberglass top, 
or 1974, the last of the carb engine (I think that year had carb and FI).  
1975-1979 are definitely in the category 'late bay'.  And by that count, 
1968-1970 would be in the early bay category.

So, whatever the item, there seems to be an early version and a later 
version in the bays.

If there is no distinction, like the windshield, it would be silly to try to 
distinguish the bay window model, and when the bumper has a unique year 
factored in, like the 1972 rear bumper mounts, then you cannot make a 
distinction between the items as early/late bays.

Another popular distinction is California or Federal.  Of course we are 
neglecting those bays which are not USA models (as we have done re: upright 
and suitcase/pancake engines).



I'll try to get the item out to you this weekend.

I am sending this CC: to the list to generate a few flames...
