Subject: (wtb) 70 bus sliding and pass. front door original white

Hi, I just purchased a 70 Westy that was wrecked in 1980 and put in the garage.
It has 69,000 miles on it and is in unbelievable condition besides the wreck. I`m looking for an original paint L87 I think Pass. door and sliding door. I want the inside paint on the doors to be usable so I don`t have to paint the bus inside and out. I`m going to paint the outside of the bus anyway. The guy who had it two toned in 1977. Changed it to orange and white. I really cant decide if I want to paint it back all white or go ahead and two tone it properly. This bus is absolutely rust free so it would probably be worth going back original with it.
Thanks,
Dave
