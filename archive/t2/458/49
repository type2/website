Zach,

I'd check the points/timing  first, but if you have a spare coil, show up 
with everything and go from there.

You *do* have gas, right?<grin>  or maybe got "robbed" by the same guy 
that got someone last week?

Air, gas, spark....at the right time and the right place...

All kinds of other possibilities...eliminate the obvious and easy ones 
first.


Cheers, dave
