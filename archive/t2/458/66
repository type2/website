Subject: 68 Baywindow Broken Brakes 

Dear List Folks,

  Spent the entire day on brakes.  I managed to get two rear supple brake
lines and installed one and the other is a male/female which I didn't
have.  I'll just go ahead and replace them all.  I might as well wear
the two wrenches around my neck that I use to bleed the brakes.

  Replaced the wheel cylinder on the right rear.  Found another busted
spring, this one on the right front.  I am trying to adjust them all and
it's becoming a major chapter in my life.

  At what point will I have brakes that don't require a pump and a half?

  The pads are new on all of the wheels as are the wheel cylinders.  I was
told to adjust the pads till it stopped the wheel from spinning.  Then
to back the pad off so that is just begins to spin freely.  Then do the
next pad adjustment the same thing.

Thanks so much for everyone's answers, I am beating my brains out trying
to get this bus on the road.

Jennifer
