Subject: re 68  broke da brakes

"  At what point will I have brakes that don't require
a pump and a half?"

 If you have replaced the slave cyl. on all wheels and
the bleeding process went well you should have good
brakes.
So based on what you wrote i would say the master cyl.
has
a bad seal and is allowing the fluid to bypass
resulting
in you having to pump them. I went through this on my
daughters 84 240 Volvo. I did all the stuff you talked
about and the brakes were still mushy... If you get
the
pressure up by pumping and then hold a constant
pressure
on the pedal .. does it slowly sink towards the floor?
If
so.. new master cyl. time. I dont think they are
to pricey and not any more work to change one out then
what
you have already done. ;-)
