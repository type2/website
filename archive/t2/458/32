Subject: Re: [T2] stuck exhaust gasket-OUT!!

Hello,

Just a note to say thanks.  I was able to get the exhaust gasket out.  I 
must have spent a whole hour trying to get it out the first time.  I tried 
again the next day and it wouldn't budge.  I headed down to my local flaps 
and bought a can of the PB Blaster.  Not to sound like a goofy testimonial, 
but it was the best 4.06$ I ever spent.  2 shots of the stuff, a couple taps 
with the screwdriver, out it came.  I will have to see if new gaskets fix 
the problem.  I checked the flange surfaces of the heater boxes on a flat 
surface, they look fine and straight.  I will have to wait until I finish 
replacing push rod tube seals to check the exhaust.

A few more questions:  Is it possible to cut the finned heat sinks off the 
pipes themselves to check them?

I have smog holes which are bolted shut.  If one of the bolts fell out, 
would it cause the exhaust to get very loud?  My exhaust leak happened very 
suddenly.

I mixed up 2 pushrods from the same cylinder before I could label them.  
Will it be a problem if they don't go back exactly the way they came out?

Thanks for all your help,
James
