Hi James,


Yes, it will get very loud when that happens.

My 1.8L engine used to spit out it's #3 smog port plug on a regular 
basis. Due to the type of plug the P.O. installed, it was very 
difficult to torque it tight enough to make it stay in the head for 
more than about 20 hours of operation. Usually it would pop off during 
a long highway run, and I would start looking for a place to pull over 
and reseat it.

Happy trails,
