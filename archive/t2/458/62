Wow, thank you for the really helpful input! I had not know that there 
are bits and pieces of this van that make it a more valued buy! I 
bought it on impulse and am kicking myself over the repairs thus far. I 
know I can't get my money back out of it, but I just wish it weren't 
costing me a fortune to get it rolling!

So, do you think mine could be over 8'? I don't have it here, so I 
can't measure it. What makes yours over 8'? Do you have a roof rack or 
is it just the same as mine?

Should that tank be up higher? Are there mounts that have let it slip?

I am now imagining the things that were washed dow it that will need to 
be washed out. I think I'll dump a gallon or two of Clorox or Vinegar 
into it to kill the smell before I tackle cleaning it!

Ok, so I now know I have a very expensive water bucket! ;-) Sure hope 
the PO took good care of the insides of it.

Looks like crap in person. I figured the "contact-paper" paneling needs 
to go. Would like to replace with hard wood, not laminate.

You think so? I will need to see your Bluto's interior to see what 
"normal" looks like. ;-)

Another mystery solved.

Yes, white, pristine, like new, etc. Sure hope they stay that way. The 
roof lid venty-door-thing was open when I was visiting it, so I asked 
them to close it for me as I can't get there from here.

I thought it was tacky, but wondered.... thanks!

Thanks, I look forward to the day I can drive and meet the folks on the 
list in my little blue whale.
