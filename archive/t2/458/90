I seem to have missed the beginning of this conversation but it sounds like you are talking about an early Adventurewagen conversion. If you'll check out the interior picture here you can see what it looks like: http://www.ghiatwins.homestead.com/Adventurewagon.html. Also, I have posted scans of the owner's manual for my '71 AW, which talks about it, in the
