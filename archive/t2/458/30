I have a used speedo head in my hand.
Here is my observation.
The magnet disk is given tension towards 0 mph by a coiled hair spring with a 
certain amount of preload on the needle.
If you were to hold the magnetic disk firmly with your fingers and twist the 
needle on it's shaft away from the 0 mph mark or clockwise by grasping the hub 
portion of the needle, you will lessen the preload or negative pressure of 
the needle allowing the speedo to indicate a higher speed at a lower magnet RPM.
If you could support the speedo without the instrument panel and take a 
cruise with a GPS, you could in theory adjust the needle to the correct MPH by 
applying small adjustments + & - between rest stops till you are satisfied.
Or till you get so frustrated you pitch the whole affair out the window and 
just use your GPS.
This is only a partially tested theory.
Comments and criticism accepted.
