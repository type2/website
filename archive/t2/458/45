Engine oil for the felt pad and shaft. Dizzy points grease in tubes 
typically available at most FLAPS for the rubbing block. Substitute if you 
must any heavy bodied, high drip point wheel bearing grease from FLAPS or 
hardware shelves. Just a small dab the size of this 0.

If you want the best, I can sell you a tube of genuine Bosch dizzy grease 
for about $8 plus shipping. Enough for a life time of DIY use. At a dab or 
2 every week in the last 14 years, I am still on my second tube. This is 
the same grease called for the clutch pilot bearing. Also have genuine 
Bosch dielectric grease for terminals at similar cost. Also a special Bosch 
blue grease designed for advance weights lube and other applications.
