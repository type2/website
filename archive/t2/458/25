Mary,

I used hi-temp powdercoat on my new heater boxes when I put my new engine 
together.

So far, I only have 346 miles on it, but under some pretty serious 
conditions and the manifolds up next to the heads look the same as the day 
that I put them on.

No long term data yet, so I guess it is still an "experiment".

I did these at home, so don't know if the commercial folks do hi-temp yet.

I shelled out for the stainless muffler(72-74) style and so far, it looks 
ok too.

Cheers, dave
