A friend who used to have a Karmann Ghia told me that he was able to 
pull the shroud and replace the cooler seals without dropping the 
engine.  But the caveat is that the Karmann Ghia's engine compartment 
is configured in a way to make this possible.  You might have just 
enough room in a Bus engine compartment to wiggle it out.
