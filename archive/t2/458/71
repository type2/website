Sure, let's wait a few days and I'll order enough for everyone who wants 
some. Anything less than a pound is $4 US Priority. Probably send 10 tubes 
in one box for 1 pound shipping. Know that any Bosch Authorized Parts 
Spezialist, such as me, can order anything Bosch makes, if you can provide 
the right item/part no. Thousands of parts listed that show in no catalog, 
only no., one or two word description and price. A few of these things I 
know, like the greases and dizzy hardware kits, for example.

Why don't you collect orders for a bunch, I'll give you a descent margin on 
10 or 20 tubes, and you can pass on the savings or take a small profit to 
ship to all who want one.
