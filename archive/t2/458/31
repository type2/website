Subject: greetings & need air intake elbow for '80

Hi all,

I'm new here but I've been on some other vw lists for some time.

I've been cleaning up lots of issues with my '80 Vanagon and 
still have one issue I can't find the part for....

The rubber air intake elbow fits between the air flow meter and the
throttle body and most of the time they have some cracking.  Well,
mine is cracked enough that the vacuum leakage seems to be throwing my 
AFM off and it won't idle when its cold and only around 400 rpm and
irregularly when its warm.

The effective problem is its running lean when it runs and I need to
replace this elbow with a good one or patch it up again (which I don't
really want to do since it involves work and will probably fail again
shortly).

This part is lists as NLA so I'm having trouble finding one.

Anyone know of a dealer with one???  Anyone have a spare one that's in
good shape?

Sincerely,
--
