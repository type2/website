Ryan,  here as usual...

http://www.type2.com/bartnik/tech.htm

Scroll down the page under fuel injection and look for afm...great picture 
of the internals.

Ryan the bartnik pages are terrific...wish he still had his bus...but I 
think he sold it and isn't on the list any more.

Are 6 and 27 the internal temp sensor??

Cheers, dave
