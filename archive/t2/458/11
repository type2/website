Subject: Starter problems?

Hi all

I am new to the list and am having some problems starting my 71 camper.  I
suspect that the problems are starter motor or solenoid related but wanted
to check with the list before shelling out for a new one.

When I turn the key the solenoid clicks and then a second or so passes
before the starter (very slowly) turns the engine over.  Sometimes it then
slowly speeds up enough to start the engine but mostly does not.  I have
cleaned the battery connections etc.  When I try using jumper leads from a
running car I have the same issue though, I can hear the other car engine
change pitch as I engage my starter and start to draw a current but the
starter on mine just really slowly turns over then stops, turns over then
stops...  I can usually get it started this way if I am persistent but if I
keep trying for too long the jumper leads get really hot.  No problem roll
starting it though.

Am I on the right track or is this something electrical?

I tried the archives but could not really find a discussion of the same
symptoms.

Thanks a lot,

Tim
