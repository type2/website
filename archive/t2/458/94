Subject: RE: [T2] Drum Drum Drum

The PO of my 69 installed a 71 braking system ( vacuum power assist
master clylinder, front disks, rear drums, newer 5 lug rims ( no longer
the 5 wides)) I don't know what's involved, but I do know it can be
done. It stops pretty well.

Is it possible to replace the drums and brakes of a 1970 with one's from
a
'71?  Thanks.
