Subject: For Kadron users 

Hi Volks- has anyone who uses Kadron carbs ever had the secondary venturi
(the little circular thing in the throat of the carb) come loose and be
sucked into the engine? Also, anyone had any experience with A.J. Sims (Mr.
Kadron of LowBugget.com)?In case you can't tell, I'm having a problem.....
