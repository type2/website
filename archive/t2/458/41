Subject: vented gas cap?

I filled up my gas tank until the pump clicked off, which I now know not
to do:-)  Drove a bit parked and noticed gas coming out of the extra
battery tray! After inspection it was coming from the bend in the
expansion tube where the fuel line connects the two tubes and had
decided to leak! I had the fuel lines replaced last fall, but didn't
think about these. Fixed it with a new piece of fuel line, but my
question is anyone using vented gas caps to avoid or help the pressure
relief system? I have a 1977 FI westy. I searched the archive but could
not find specifics on are vented gas caps okay?

Peace

Meg
