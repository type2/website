some stuff is here if you haven't seen it yet:
http://www.type2.com/library/brakes.htm

there are also some good brake items in the archive if you search for
brake and "dolan" who wrote quite a lot about brakes. One more thing
to note is this. If you adjust the pats till stop, go and press the
brake pedal, betchabeer that the wheel that was just a moment ago
stopped will spin freely again. repeat this procedure till you
actually get a stopped wheel. That will help eliminate any adjustment
problems before buying a new MC for your bus. good luck & let us know.
