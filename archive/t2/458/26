insulation for the doors. Any Ideas that might not >>require ordering it
from somewhere? 

Go to any car stereo place and get DYNAmat its good stuff to keep
outside sounds out and inside sounds in. It will also cut down on the
rattle your door might make. Its not the cheapest stuff but it is really
good stuff. It will also help in insulating your bus......
