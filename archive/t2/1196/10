No clue.  No seat tracks of any sort - so they'd have been a clamp down 
seat of some sort.

Sedan seats all got headrests by '68 - but busses didn't get them until 
'76 for standard equipment.

And even the earliest of the early beetles didn't have seats like that, 
though there are some similarities..

Earliest walkthrough bus seats ('55-61)

Not really 356 seats either.

I'm leaning toward something nearly vw like a Tempo or NSU or something.
