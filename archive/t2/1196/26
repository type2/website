I cannot believe the Prius owners here In California. When you have a VW
bus riding your ass in the number one lane, move the fock over; You're
going too slow.

I have attained speeds in excess of 95 mph (gps) on the downhill of a pass
(Altimont) in a bone stock '79 CA emissions two liter (I have 15" wheels
and tall tires, tho). If you don't believe me, meet me in Alameda. We'll
drive to Pleasanton for a beer or three, on you.

Our vans were designed to be efficient. The engines were not overdesigned
to provide enough horsepower to overcome the drag of the body. They were
designed to meet the hp necessary keep the van moving at its most effecient
speed, hills and valleys considered.

Forcing a breadbox through air at 100 mph (a flluid, with viscosity, like
honey clinging to a spoon) requires something like five times the HP than
60 mph.

Why do I get only 15 mpg?
If it's not WOT, you're not going as fast as you possibly can. It's a good
thing I drive a VW bus and not a Porche.
