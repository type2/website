I think the first Type One gas gauge was in 1962, no more reserve handle on
the floor. How about that 1960 model with 4400K miles on the clock.

In 1968 I worked for Mid America Cars at the docks in Lake Charles, Louisiana,
and that ship in the video or one like it would tie up and spew Type Ones all
over the yard. I worked in the warehouse installing air conditioning units
before the cars were shipped to the dealers. We worked in two man teams, and
could install 2 1/2 units a day.

One bad day the ship docked, and one of the hole covers had leaked and swamped
the hole. It flooded about 25 cars, a team of Germans came and pulled the
engines and transmissions, and took a sledge hammer to them. The cars were
scraped also. Seems that salt water totals everything. They were afraid
someone would get a good motor or trans I guess.

Oh well!

  Cute.
  What year did these antiques finally get a Gas Gauge ?

  What automotive Progress ..a fuel level gauge !!   ......... like 1960 in
the VW Bug.
  I had a 54 ..small oval window, semaphore turn signals.
  Purchased for $ 450, sold for 850,   around 1981.

  Someone should come up with semaphores for vanagons.
  Old Bug nuts would love them.
  btdt too much myself.
