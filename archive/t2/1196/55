Subject: tow bar advice

Hi All!
 
Hey, I'm looking for advice on buying a tow bar for my 76 Westy.
Ease of installation, quality, and hopefully one with the square inset for
hanging a bike rack or luggage box. Will usually pull a small utility trailer,
maybe once every few years pull a car a short distance. 
 
I see a lot of them
out there for sale. Any suggestions are appreciated.
thanks
Happy Jack Feder
