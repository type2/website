Subject: Vanagon experience

For those who think I'm on the wrong list, this is about an aircooled  
Vanagon, which is more like a baywindow than it is like a water-oozin'  
Vanagon.

The weekend before last I drove from San Diego to Yucca Valley, on the  
north side of Joshua Tree National Park. I did my best to keep my  
speed low - under 55 almost the whole trip. On the way back I was at  
65 most of the way.

I used less gas at the higher average speeds than at the lower speeds,  
and paid no penalty in higher temperatures. In fact, the climb up the  
ten out of the Coachella Valley was fairly cool at 65 mph.

How can that be? Well, Yucca Valley is at 3,300 feet and where I live  
in SD is at 200 feet. So I was climbing on the way and dropping - a  
net climb, net drop - on the way back. Second, the wind was against me  
going and at my back on the way back.

But I tend to think that a rule of thumb ought to be: get momentum and  
sustain it. There were a couple of times (only two!) on the return  
trip where my speed sank to 45 and I downshifted. Those, not  
surprisingly, were the two times I saw higher temps. (I know I should  
measure by CHT and I will, but this was oil temperature.)

Just some observations.
