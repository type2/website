Look for a "Class A" bolt on (to the frame) then have it welded by a
professional welding shop. Keep this in mind, Hitches are rated by there
tongue weight capability. Here is a scale that may be helpful. I think there
also is a Class D rating, but I drought you will need anything that high.

Hitch Ratings: Supplied by err (stolen from U-Haul)

This is the one you will most likely want
Class A (Class A) trailer hitch
Trailer hitch with capacity of up to 2,000 lbs gross trailer weight and 200
lbs tongue weight.
Class B (Class B) trailer hitch
Trailer hitch with weight-carrying rating of up to 3,500 lbs gross trailer
weight and 300/350 lbs tongue weight.
Class C (Class C) trailer hitch
Trailer hitch with weight carrying rating of up to 5,000 lbs gross trailer
weight and 500 lbs tongue weight. Also sometimes used to refer to a hitch with
any 2" receiver, regardless of rating.
