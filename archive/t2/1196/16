Yup my sweet spot is also cruising about 58 mph on my 74 Bay 1800. I can
relate to the part about accelerating before a hill to help with the speed
during the climb. I do have a CHT, so if my temps start to rise into the
high 300s, its time to downshift and slow down.

But I do believe I have accepted, and even enjoy going slower than
everybody else. Its like I'm no longer in the "rat race".
