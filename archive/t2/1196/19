I had a blast passing RVs on the way to burning man a few years ago in my
splitty.

We were westbound on I-80 heading up into the Rockies when I stopped for gas
and to zip tie the heaters open. It was in the low thirties and we were
freezing... We met a bunch of folks at that gas station, but passed most of
them headed up the pass, revving 3rd gear out to between 36 and 40, that cold
weather keeping the heads nice and cool with the rgbs giving me all the torque
I needed, even with the half ton of band and camping gear.  Probably got two
or three times the fuel economy they did too...

Cheers,
   Tom
