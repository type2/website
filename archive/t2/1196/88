Subject: Re: [T2] looking for advice on a new camper

I have a 1968 tin-top camper.  The plan when restoring it was to take the
family (wife and 2 kids) cross country.  Then the plan was to take 2 trips
cross country (each trip 4 weeks), one northern route, one southern route.
 Given that our work schedules were not going to allow us to accomodate
potential break-down time, we decided we needed something newer.  I love
camping in a VW, so this is the compromise.
