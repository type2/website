what drives me nuts locally is
one of the rest areas on I-95 which I drive occasionally has a gas station 
I like but it is in the Median so entry and exit is in the fast lane.
I come down the exit back into traffic with the turn signal going and no 
one I swear no one will let me over to the slow lane. I've had em come up 
behind em swerve into a tiny hole in traffic pass me on the right and 
swerve back in front of me, rather than let me get out of their way. 
sometimes it has taken miles to get over to the right lane. and I don't 
think anyone who has ridden with me will consider me a timid driver. a 
prudent bus pilot yes, but timid nah.
