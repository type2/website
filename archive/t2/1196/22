Wow..  58 huh?  I like 79.9 mph,,, and it sits at 425 deg,,, a little more 
uphill.. and then coast down,, to about 250deg
I get there faster.. leaves more time to drink SEB ... [somone elses beer] 
lol

My 74 Westfalia has a 79 trans,, and 2.0 liter engine..so the rpm is a lot 
less than the 1800cc carb engine.. I can talk in the cab now. and hear 
myself..
