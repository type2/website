I'm in California and moving back to Boston next year.  I agree that the 
ones out here are in far better shape/  I'm looking seriously at getting 
another bus here before I go.

The 74's do not have all of the smog crap my 78 had (which I think 
helped blow the engine) and are easier to fix, drop the engine, etc.

Good luck whatever you decide.  You can't beat a Westy though.
