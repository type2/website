	I'd add here: if you have access to a Vane Tunescope or other 
method to display the actual spark timing at different rpm, use that 
before you start looking up part numbers let alone procuring parts. 
It can happen that an 'alien' dizzy will give you the right advance 
curve.  Get the facts if you can on actual performance now, which may 
be about as good as you can get (short of figuring how to slap in 
Water Injection :-P).
