Subject: Mystery VW seats...

An old timer hot-rod builder gave me a set of front seats a couple of days
ago. He swore they were out of "an old VW". What type he could not say.
They are offset like a Type 3 and pretty bare bones. They most likely came
off of a vehicle with a transmission tunnel. I can't find any VW stamping
on them after a quick look but I'm not sure where to look.

Can anybody help me identify these? I don't have room for them but I don't
want to throw away something of value.
