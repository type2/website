Subject: Re: [T2] looking for advice on a new camper

Hey Kevin,
When I was a kid, my Dad would take the family camping with a 12' 
skiff on the roof of what is now my bus. Family? Try 5 kids until 66 
when the 6th one arrived. Favorite place was the Sacramento River 
Delta. This is a non-walk through bus. The area between the rear 
facing seat and the back seat was taken up with a wooden box 
containing the 10hp Evinrude and other gear. We all had a great time. 
My Dad kept the drive times generally down to 2 hours or so. Not sure 
how we fit everyone inside. Maybe a couple of my sisters were on the 
roof under the boat. We also made a few journeys from the SF bay area 
to Lake Tahoe for winter skiing, with skis.

When I was dating my wife we tried camping, but she is just not a 
camping girl. However we did do a couple of great camping vacations 
with our two girls. We are in the Los Angeles area. We traveled to 
Albuquerque via the Grand Canyon one year. Another time to the Expo in 
Vancouver (1986). Also to Lake Tahoe. Ahh those were the days. The bus 
was a bit younger and so was I. The last great journey was to San 
Jose, CA for my Dad's 85th birthday 5 years ago.

My bus never let me down on any of the trips. I know this isn't a lot 
of miles for you serious bus people, but I've done over 200k miles 
over the years.

Once I finish installing the FI it'll be time for another road trip 
somewhere. Will keep you posted.

As for a newer bus, I would go for a 71. There should be some out 
there with pop tops.  The advantages of a type 1 engine, easy to work 
on. I would also add a slightly larger engine maybe a 1776cc with dual 
port heads and a nice pair of Kaddies or Webers.

Cheers!!
