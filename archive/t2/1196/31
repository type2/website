Yep.

It's possible they became standard or were a more typical option on 
passenger busses earlier than for campers.   A lot of early bay passenger 
busses I've seen had headrests.

Presumably they were either a dealer installed item or part of a trim 
package...but I've never tried to hunt it down in old lit.
