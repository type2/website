Subject: Bus Gettin' Ready

Greetings-
Well, at long last my bus is *very* close to being ready for a road trip --
just in time for Spring!
Any suggestions?
I'm in the SouthEast US, btw, and am trying to avoid the temptation to jump
right in with a long-ish trip. Maybe a coordinated trip with the help of
this group, just so I'll never be too far if (I mean when) I unexpectedly
stop/breakdown on the side of the road...

-David
