And how!!!

Even in my daily driver I've begun to slow down. Its a well used 247,000 
mile CR-V and it's kind of noisy on the highway - lots of road noise. 
Like a VW van in that regard.

Anyhow it has a quiet spot at 72 mph when the engine seems to be 
quieter. Recently however I discovered that 65 mph delivers the same 
volume and I'm not constantly changing lanes around the big trucks.

Am noticing alot of other cars and trucks slowing down - maybe b/c of 
the higher fuel costs? Followed a half dozen vehicles home from 
Chattanooga the other night at 62 mph in a 70 mph zone. Vehicles did not 
seem to know each other. Different counties and states.
