I don't think a bay window will give you a lot more room than your split
window has now.  I don't own one but like the 83-85 Vanagon Westfalias.  I
like the round headlights so that is why I say those years along with the
water cooled engines only for heat and air conditioning otherwise an early
Vnagon Westfalia would be nice.
