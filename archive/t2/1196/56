Subject: re:Tow Bar Advice

You need to be a little more clear about your needs. Do you want a Tow Bar, 
or a trailer hitch? A tow bar hooks to the front of a car/truck so it can be 
towed, by another car/truck with a trailer hitch!
Your post sounds like your looking for a trailer hitch. If so, please keep 
this in mind, due to the uni-body type subframe on your Westy, it can't take 
much tongue weight. A small baggage trailer, a bike rack, a small boat, a 
small trailer and small lawn mower and not much more is safe to tow. I seem 
to have read a tongue weight of 50 to 75 lb's was tops with an all up weight 
of 1000lb's. Certainly not a car! That's not to say you can't tow a car with 
a strap/chain. Remember your working with 1600 cc's and 50 hp. 
Unless...........??? Engine Mods etc!
Driving our Bus's/Van's is akin to pushing a sale. There just not much of a 
work horse. I know-I know we/I have all don't it. But remember the clutch & 
brakes just aren't made to do it!

ps: Stay away from any trailer hitch that clamps to the bumper! Get one that 
bolts or better yet welds directly to the "frame"!
