You should always make sure your VW is in tune especially dwell,(if using
points)  timing, and make sure you have the correct dizzy so that you have the
right advance curve. You can verify that with the part number and check out
oldvolkshome.com. That is so important. Bad timing or not enough advance will
rob performance and make it run hot. Also check to see if your air filter is
clean. Make sure you dont have vacuum leaks if you are using fuel injection.
You can buy a vacuum guage from your local FLAPS. One HP here and one HP there
really makes a difference.      make sure your plugs are good and tan. Not
burnt or fouled. If you need anyone to walk you through any of these tune up
processes, we are here to help.
