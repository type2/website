yah,, I know...<deep breath>  I am happy as if I am in my right mind...as I 
get 100k, km out of T4 engine running ,, tuned up my way... so,, maybe my 
VDO guage is not accurate... cause 425 is avg,,  I usually get off the pedal 
when it hits near 450... let it cool back to 400...
I try to drive by my VDO CHT guage... but letting off that gas pedal usually 
cramps my leg.... I used to LOVE driving the 1.8 with stock trans.. cause 
cruise control was foot to the floor.... lol
