I once got my 68 camper bus to 78mph, but that was downhill on a mountain
pass. I took a pic of the speedometer with my disposable camera before i
started applying the brakes. Kind of a hairy feeling, like being on a runaway
train.  i had that pic and other pics from that mountain trip turned into a
set of coasters so I would have proof.
