Subject: Re: [T2] DIPSTICK GASKET LEAK

I have 2 things to add to this.
First the bellows goes on either top first or bottom first.  I forgot which,
but did post to the list a while back, so if you can't get it one way try
the other.

Once you get it on there.  I highly recommend zip ties to make sure it
doesn't go anywhere..
Hope this helps,
Peace,
Snoopy
