As mentioned above, It is indeed much easier if the new boot is soft.  To 
soften it up, right before you are about to install the new boot,  just 
throw it in a pot of boiling water.  It'll soften up and slip right on.  
I've ripped a few new boots trying to put them on cold/hard.  I've never had 
a problem using this trick, might want to give it a try.
