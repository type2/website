Vincent,

this was great for you to post this.  It answered a question of mine
that I have had for a very long time.  I have always been curious as
to if jailbars were ever placed on or were intended for the late
model bus or vanagon,.... at all.  I have had friends that have put
jailbars into their busses but they always purchased the the retro
kits for the splitties and then modified them as they needed in
order to make this work.

I'm always hauling something that could potentially scratch my buses
glass (particularly the rear pane that has the defrost on it).  A
side effect of having all that hauling room in my 'station wagon'
spec type II.

Anybody out there in type II land know of a vendor that sells these
for the late model body type???  Specifically for a late bay?  Or is
the method of choice to get the bars for the vanagon and then
hacksaw them shorter in order to fit the late bay?

Thanks again Vincent,

The "255" part is actually not a very early part but a
VERY LATE part! ;-)

It is for the vanagon Jailbars! Yes, also vanagons had
jailbars, may be not until the 1990ties but definitely
on the early vanagons. And the 'Type 255' is a Vanagon
Deluxe microbus (vehicle typenumbering on Vanagons is
very different from the baywindow and splitwindow)
