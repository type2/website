one ultimate benefit is reduced CO2 emissions, which pertains to global 
climate change.

propane has a lower carbon content than gasoline, therefore less CO2 is 
generated by combustion.

With conversion to other fuels such as bio-diesel, you're "re-using" 
carbon that has been absorbed into crops from the atmosphere, as 
opposed to digging up fossil fuels and introducing new carbon into the 
atmosphere.  As a result, you're more a part of the carbon "cycle" as 
opposed to adding more carbon to the net balance.  The other benefit to 
biodiesel is the lack of sulfur, hence less SO2 (SOX, acid rain) 
emissions.  You're also theoretically burning less fuel (more efficient 
engine) so your NOx emissions will be lower.  The problem with BD and 
dino-diesel is that you've got particulate emissions (soot) which cause 
other problems (to various degrees that are still being debated).

Those are some theoretical benefits, but there are lots of other issues.
