I've done it before.  It's nasty, but gets the job done.
Use tubing and catch can which will NOT MELT w/hot motor oil.

Try a Topsider MVP.  These are used on boats, because with a
boat motor everything has to come in and out through the top.
You can't put a boat up on the lift and remove the oil drain
plug to drain the motor oil.   ;-)

Shop around, this is only an example.

It removes the 8 quarts of oil from my MB turbodiesel crankcase
without pulling the oil drain plug.  In my bus I pull the
drain plug each time, and clean the screen every other year.
YMMV
