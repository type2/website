That is correct - you have to remove the plate from your old alternator and 
put it on the new one.  There are a few small machine screws holding the 
plate to the back of the alternator.  When you remove them everything will 
be obvious.

One gotcha though - be careful with the clearance between the hot wire 
mounting stud and the plate.  There is not much of an air gap there and if 
you so much as put in an extra washer it can cause the connector to contact 
the plate and ground out your alternator (and battery!).  Re-use the little 
insulating fiberboard piece also.
