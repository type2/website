Hi - This is just a heads up for anyone this applies to. I was recently made aware of an insurance company in my area that will insure "collector" cars at extremely reasonable rates. I had a 74 standard beetle restored 2 years ago and wanted to upgrade my insurance. This company in Valdese, NC, Farris Insurance (828-874-3250) wrote a policy for me, liability and an established value of $5500 (collision) on my bug for $65.00 A YEAR! Virtually no driving restrictions except no young drivers. My bus is an unrestored daily driver and would never pass for the minimum $5000 value, but I guess a lot of you folks could save some money with these people. I have no financial interest in this at all. I just wanted to pass along a good deal to VW people who may live in western NC.
