Subject: Re: [T2] Diesel Engine for later type 2?

There is a fellow in Michigan that I have seen a
couple of times at alternative energy shows in
Wisconsin (http://www.the-mrea.org/) who was selling
conversions using a diesel Rabbit engine in a bay
window bus, using (supposedly) all VW parts.  I had
contact info for him, which I posted here a couple of
years ago, and I suppose I might be able to find his
business card again if I remembered to look when I am
home.
Check out the MREA link if you are interested in solar
or wind energy--it is worth the trip to the fair for
many people--I think that usually almost all of the
states are represented plus all the continents--last
year even someone who had last lived in Antartica.
