Someone must have a webapage that maps the Permatex formulas to the loctite numbers.

I've surfed the loctite technical pages and there's almost too much information there and it's not consistent from product to product when doing comparisons.

What's most effective is to phone their support line and say, "I've got a gladnut that needs to be torqued to 270ft lbs. Which threadlocker should I use", and they'll give you an answer from their knowledge database after you answer the follow questions wrt permanency, fluid resistance, etc.
