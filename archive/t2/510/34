Huzzah!  Thank you!  It has it's place, and like you so aptly stated,
"for assembled parts [that] are welded together permanently"...  I use
it (sparingly) for stuff like the IDF/DRLA carb manifold studs 'cause I
HATE having them come out.  And if I DO need them out, then I can hit
the whole thing with propane heat once they're off the heads to break
the death grip...  Don't ever use the stuff if you can't see your way
clear to getting the parts in question REALLY, REALLY hot.

This whole thing got started with Mark Dearing's suggestion to use it on
the T4 impeller hub bolt, and Greg Pott's admission of same when he lost
the center bolt - yiii-yiii-yi!  I used the red stuff on the screw-in
style lug nut 'n stud conversions on my first 914, and when I replaced
the rotors I learned the evil power of red.  And when the directions say
"heat required for disassembly" that is NO B.S.!!  Once heated to
paint-blistering temps, they broke loose, but not one degree less...
Don't use it unless you know full well what it's going to take to get
those parts loose down the the line.

Mad respect for the tools of the devil, volks...  You may be getting
much more than what you bargained for :-0

It is my opinion that red loctite is a tool of the devil, and should
only be used if you will assume that the assembled parts are welded
together permanently.

If a part is so vibration-prone that it requires red locktite, it should
be drilled and safety-wired.  Just as secure, and easily disassembled.
