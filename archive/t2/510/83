Homepage of the shop in Germany:

The upper 16 pictures are conversions they did,
the lower not. They use vanagon diesels and
radiators mounted under the bus and in the engine
compartment. They also offer the installation of
a water/air heat-exchanger.
I still run air-cooled with a 2.0l dual-carb-setup,
but since tax for engines without catalytic converter
is beginning to get unaffordable in Germany, I'm
seriously planning in doing such a conversion.
