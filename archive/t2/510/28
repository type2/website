Hint from Heloise (Oh, how I miss her!!)

I found that I can elevate my '72 engine/bell housing pretty easily. By 
myself. One hand, if you please...

Like the 'Arch' said, 'given a lever long enough and a place to stand, I 
could smack my landlord hard enough on the head that he would give me some 
heat in February!!'

So, given a sufficient number of blocks that could be trusted to make a 
solid pile, I could lift a '72 engine/bell housing high enough that I could 
get under it to make all necessary adjustments and oil changes.


Golly, I don't know why, but with just one hand, I can lift one side of the 
muffler end of the engine at least 3 inches.  Then I can slide a 2" block 
under that side.  Next, do the same with the other side, just 2" at a time 
so it does not get unbalanced. And I have a bunch of 2x6 cut stock from Home 
Depot....

But I cannot lift the front (starter side) of the engine, where the bell 
housing/starter is attached, even with both hands!!  I am a bit weak.

Well, after I get the rear (muffler end) of the engine elevated, I put a 
brace of block(s) under the middle of the engine, so it just fits, and 
touched the bottom of the engine.

Then I REMOVE some of the 2" blocks from the rear (muffler) of the engine, 
and the front (starter side) of the engine pivots up in the air.  I slip 
another block under the bell housing/front/starter end of the engine, and 
then I repeat:

I again walk the rear (muffler) of the engine up 2" at a time on each side 
until I get decent air under the block(s) at the middle of the engine (1"), 
add another block or plank in that new air space, drop the rear (muffler) 
again and thereby pivoting the engine and raising the front (starter) -

and on and on.

I know, a lot of you have used this technique, but I am still amazed that I 
can do it, still a newbie after 8 years of VW ownership.

But I still don't have enough heat this February...
