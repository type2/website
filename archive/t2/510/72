Shawn,

The Ford house..."fluidizer"

comes in a 4fl oz bottle....use 2 oz in your tranny.

actually called "additive friction modifier" on the bottle

XL3  "Ford internal ref # 137219"

The local Ford parts guy says he can hardly keep it in stock...all the 
drag and street racers come in and buy it.....from corvette...to hemi's
My other car is a F***  SVT  works great in the manual trans with 
automatic fluid in it.

as always...YMMV


Cheers, dave
