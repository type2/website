I tend to use a shot of cranberry, a shot of apricot, and a half shot of
lemon juice in a glass of ginger ale.  Yum. (apricot snagdragon)

My transaxle prefers good ol' GL4, though.  I don't desire to
experiment with other chemicals...our transaxles are sensitive enough as
it is (re: gl4 vs gl5 arguments).

No chemical (or mineral..) additive is going to repair bad bearings,
sloppy bushings, or worn out syncros.  If you need to get by for a week,
a banana peal might quiet it down long enough to sell it.

Seriously, stick with the specified fluids.  Muir says a lot of good
things...and he also says a lot of..ahh..not good things. :)
