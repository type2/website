Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Oil Removal

remember, you really want to check the amount of oil after the engine 
has run a little.  Do you have a brand new oil filter installed?  If so, 
that should help drop the level down a little.

Otherwise the siphon might work.. or attach something to suck it out - 
turkey baster maybe?
