Actually it's the earlier 72-73 cap that's $12.95. The later 74-79 cap that
doesn't hide behind the door is more.

I recently inquired when I noticed a change in the BD online catalog that
there seemed to be a supply of the nice chrome versions again (maybe a
trickle less than 10 in stock before they are gone again). They were
unavailable but now I see them for $29.95. There's always the ugly black
version for much less. The chrome version really accents the bus.

I think I saw the same chrome made by Blau gas cap available from
<http://www.importeccatalog.com>. I recently replaced the radiator in my
wife's japmobile and had a good experience with this online vendor. Before
the purchase, I thought I'd search the catalog for VW parts and the
selection looked like the typical "I'm one guy in Dallas with a webfront for
drop shipping" business but I did find one treasure (along with that great
price of Bosch injectors for $59):

1978
 Volkswagen
  Type 2
   Fuel Delivery
    Fuel Tank cap
      E2010-18190 (Germany, in stock, $20.68)

He assured me what they sell looks like the photo:

I don't know what they charge (or gouge) for shipping because the rad was
over $50 and it was shipped for free. FYI, it was also tax free (sorry
David) and arrived the next day which I attribute to drop shipping.

If I can digress for a moment. I thought I had ordered a nice Danish made
radiator. As it turned out the Danish company sources 15% of it's radiators
from other vendors to fill out their catalog. I still got a nice unit but
it's just a reminder to me that it's sure nice to be able to get all of
those nice VW OE parts at low prices from many of the original OEMs thanks
to folks like Ron Salmon.
