Subject: Vanagon power outage... Urgent response required.

Hi Volks,

My dad's out right now in his 81 Vanagon, and he has lost all 
electrical power. The lights, horn, and engine are all dead. He's on a 
client site and it was fine when he got there but won't go at all at 
the moment.

He has 2 batteries aboard, and both are well charged with clean 
connections and lots of available juice.

I don't have much electrical experience with Vanagons... Last year I 
was surprised when I found a battery under the passenger seat. I did 
suggest that Dad should check the connections at the starter, as that's 
where I would look if this was happening on a baywindow bus. (Which has 
happened to me a long long time ago)

Opinions are welcome... Dad is now checking the starter connection as 
per my advice and will be calling me back in about 10 minutes.

Thanks in advance,
