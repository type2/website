Just a few idle thoughts on propane power:
Generally you will experience a power and fuel economy
loss on a dual fuel engine. If the engine is modified
to run just propane, (dedicated), by raising the
compression ratio and changing the timing curve, then
the power could be better than gasoline. Propane has
an extremely high octane rating, I think 105 or so. As
a gaseous fuel the volumetric efficiency of the engine
 is lowered as the fuel displaces air, which is only
about 21% oxygen anyway. Liquid propane injection
might be possible but none of the available equipment
does that. Everthing I know of lowers the propane
pressure and allows it to become a gas, hence "gaseous
fuel systems". The actual delivery pressure on the
IPMCO type systems is extremely low, (modulated around
negative 1 1/2" water column (relative) (.054psi or
so) which is so close to atmospheric pressure that you
can't even see the needle move on a regular vacuum
gauge. The storage pressure is less than 200psi, (the
actual pressure depends on temperature). All of the
newest systems are feedback type, meaning they use an
oxygen sensor to fine tune the air/fuel ratio.
Autotronics makes the best control modules. I think
these are the same people who make MSD ignitions. The
cost and quality of propane varies wildly. I've paid
from $1.65/gal to $3.00/gal in the last month. Quality
is usually good enough but it can contain some heavy
components that precipitate oil in the system, (hard
on diaphrams, etc) and the actual propane content of
fuel grade LPG will vary between 80-95%. There are
some other problems too but it can be made to work
very well if you're willing to work with the systems
to get them right. By the way, methanol is racing
alcohol. It is toxic, corrosive, and very expensive,
probably not suitable for everyday use.
