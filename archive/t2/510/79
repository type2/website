I have a 1976 pop-top camper van for sale in Tucson, Arizona.  Rust 
free.  The interior is original and in great shape.  Stove, sink, 
electric ice box, two tables, curtains, mosquito netting.  The exterior 
is in good shape, though not perfect.  It's running pretty darn good.
 
If you are interested, please contact me.  I will send pictures and tell 
you it's history as I know it.  I am seeking somewhere around $2,900 for 
it, but may consider OBO, especially for a loving home for my green baby.
