I am looking for one of these VW only publications covering 1968-1979
buses. Found one on thesamba.com but it was copyrighted in the late
1950's. If you have one you don't want to part with, would you consider
making copies of the tols I need. My father is a retired tool and die
maker with his own shop, maybe he can fabricate these things. It's
frustrating when the manual says " now use VW tool # ------, and I don't
have it. manythanks  Tim
