Subject: my 73 Adventure camper Automatic

Well, took my bus in to get the carbs tuned and deal w/ an overheating
problem that I just don't have the time and patience to track down at this
time and i'm ending up replacing some tie rods muffler/header, and the
master cylinder also (no real surprises there)  the bus was overheating
because the dizzy was hooked to the wrong port (doh!!!) but looks like all
will be well and soon I'll be living in a van down by the river for about a
month and a half.  this will be my first time in an Adventure Camper as all
my other trips have been in a 72 westy.  It is not nearly finished yet but
it will be home never the less.
