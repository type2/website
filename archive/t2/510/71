Mobile-1 85-140 synthetic has made all of the difference for cold starts 
and hot running. I put new GL5 in, ran it for about 500 miles then drained 
and filled with the Mobil-1. That was after 15 years without an oil change. 
It takes most of a gallon of this expensive stuff, so now I only change it 
every 5 years or so.
