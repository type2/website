Greg,

My bet is a main connection somewhere around the ingition switch or
fuse box....in other words the main feed of power to the front.

Vanagon battery underneath the front passenger seat, right?

Look for a large red wire feeding the fuse box...we *are* assuming that 
the battery and such are ok since he drove it there a short time ago.

Dome light?  anything that doesn't work off of the ignition switch?

Not familiar with vanagons either...

Good luck, dave
