Darren,

"librarian's" comments are exactly correct.

It is probably easier to replace this way than trying to "stab" it on
correctly when you install the fan shroud.

You need to crawl under your bus with a flashlight, a couple of
old rags, a new "bellows"...and just get with it...count on getting
dirty...it does wash off though!...and it probably is better if 
you don't have really fat fingers like me!

Unless I have forgotten something, nothing but maybe a pair of long
nose pliers are necessary....maybe.

Cheers, dave
