Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Propane Conversion

Hello Guys  I use to work for a group that did these conversions in the 70's  
Did a lot of the city  police cars and garbage trucks, also all the gas comp. 
trucks , which made sense for them.  The trucks would burn a lot cleaner and 
got somewhat better gas milrage. Some problems were heating the intake and the 
rubber in the system would go bad. It has been so long ago that I can't 
remember all that it took to convert something over to propane . Another problem is 
the storage tank which if hit would be a bomb. But it is something that has 
been done back in the 70's so maybe it can be done even better now. I think the 
system we were using had a throttle body injection system which would replace 
the carb. Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  salem Import service  salem va
