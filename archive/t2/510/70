I just put Redline MT-90 in my transmission also.  Good to hear that it 
took a couple of weeks for you to notice the improvement (I guess it 
takes a while to work its way in everywhere).

I don't drive my Bus daily (maybe a couple of times a week), so I guess 
I should expect a bit longer than 2 weeks?
