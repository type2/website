Subject: DIPSTICK GASKET LEAK

Hello,
'librarian' recently posted a note regarding the dipstick gasket leak and
how to repair.
just wondering if anyone has repaced this, and if there is another method to
fix this leak
other than the bellow and if you need to remove the tin and alternator belt?
Thanks muchly.
(my van is a 72 with a 75 1800 engine.
the oil seems to be leaking onto the tin below the dipstick.)


REF: Dipstick gasket:  This is the rubber bellows tube that connects the
dipstick tube passing through the fan shroud to the dipstick tube on the
block. It is almost certainly the original and almost as certainly
perished. If you are agile you can replace it with the shroud on the bus.
Remove the dipstick, remove the old bellows, insert the new bellows, and
replace the dipstick.
