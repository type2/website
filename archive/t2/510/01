I am not a chemist.  Neither have I been involved in the conversion of any
engine to any alternative fuel.  I have been curious about it but it never
seemed that there would be much ultimate benefit.

The heat content of propane is about 92K btu/gal.  The heat content of
gasoline is 124K btu/gal.  As a result you either have to provide ~26%
more air/fuel mix or lose ~26% of your power.  If displacement remains the
same, then power loss is what happens.  Add a blower and you can come back
up but that is an even larger can of worms. It could be worse.  Convert to
methanol with a heat content of 65K btu/lb and you lose about 50% of your
power.

You make the cost of energy loss back on cost though.  Propane is nearly
1/3rd cheaper than gasoline so your cost per mile would be lower.  You do
get into a rats-nest of paperwork on road taxes which eats into the
savings.

A search of Google turned up this article from the Mother Earth News:

http://www.motherearthnews.com/menarch/archive/issues/015/015-078-02.htm

on converting an air-cooled volkswagen to propane. I bite my tongue on the
optimism of most MEN articles (build the Hoover Dam in your back yard for
under $100!) but this looks like a good starting point.

Of the regulator companies mentioned in the article Century Tool seems to
have gone over completely to camping propane equipment but Beam and IMPCO
are still around at

and
http://www.impco.ws/

Good hunting!

                             OOK!
