Subject: OIL DIP STICK (1 more question)

Hello,

Thanks everyone who helped me with my last post regarding the dip stick seal
and bellow. Just wondering if anyone can tell me how high the oil level
is in the dip stick? I am just trying to figure out how there is oil getting
all the way from the bottom
of the dipstick into where the dipstick goes through the fan shroud and
running down the tin by the oil filler.

Thanks alot,
Darren
