Nope!  The vacuum line to the distributor comes from a port very close to
the throttle butterfly.  It doesn't read manifold vacuum alone!  What it
does read is a combination of throttle position and manifold vacuum.  Very
tricky!

A port can be added to most carburators, but the placement is very
critical and should be left to the carb gurus who really know what they
are doing.  A millimeter misplacment will screw up the advance curve!
