Subject: Much Quieter now... 72-74 exhaust installed and functional.

Hi Volks,

I think the odds are now close to even that the westfakia  could  
sneak up behind a  straight-piped harley or a fart-canned Honda  
civic. When I got home from work tonight I backed the rip-snorting  
exhaust-less westfakia up on the ramps and slid underneath to do  
battle with my one remaining broken exhaust stud.

My secret weapon for today's skirmish was a custom modified set of  
middle-sized vice grips. Not "Mastercraft Locking pliers", but honest  
to goodness $14.99 Vice-Grips from Irwin Corp. The Real McCoy, so to  
speak. I bought them fresh on the way home from work, specifically  
with this task in mind.

In order to grip the stud from a perpendicular angle, I used my angle- 
grinder to put a V-shaped groove into the jaws of the vice-grips.  
This allows the pliers to contact the stud in four places instead of  
only two, and the pliers can also close slightly tighter, which  
allows a bit better clearance to spin the vice grips.

But in the end it was still too tight a working space, so i wound up  
removing the push rod tubes for the #1 cylinder. I heated up the stud  
cherry red, then applied some candle-wax to the base of the stud.  
Capillary action wicks it into the tight spaces between aluminum and  
steel molecules. Then I heated it again and quenched it with an ice  
cube, to shock it with thermal stress. After that I heard the  
satisfying CREAAAK!!! of the stud breaking free. It would only turn  
about 4 degrees at a time, but at least it was moving.

DON: Once you apply the PB-blaster, hit the stud with heat again to  
burn off the PB residue from the stud. I found that if there's  
paraffin or any other lubricant on the stud then it will be really  
hard to get it to break free.

Happy trails,
