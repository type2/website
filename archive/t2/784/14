I agree, but my problem is that my SVDA isn't stock for my '71, which
came with a dual vacuum distributor which is hopelessly worn.  I'll not
be reinstalling that nightmare unless the smog laws force me to.

I believe that, for all intents and purposes, my engine is now basically
a stock, carburated, Mexican bug engine!  :)

Off to find more data...
