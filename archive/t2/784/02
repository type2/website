Hi Tom,

Your measurement is a good idea... I did the same thing when we  
installed the replacement engine in Jamie Auch's 71 after BOTC 2002.

But.... Using that measurement assumes that the engine is using the  
stock pulley. If it isn't the stock pulley, your timing could be off  
by quite a bit.

The correct measurement would be:
Degrees divided by 360 multiplied by 3.14157 multiplied by the pulley  
diameter. Yes, it's a PITA but it's guaranteed to work with ANY pulley.

Luckily I had a math teacher on hand to help with the calculations.

Happy trails,
