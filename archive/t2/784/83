Subject: Re: [T2] Pertronix ignitor woes

If I may, I'd suggest people check out the compufire.  It's a really 
clean install and there are no gaps or anything like that to set.  You 
just put it in there and that's it...

I've been running it for over 20k miles now with no problems.  Also, 
I've never heard people complain about them.  I think we all can attest 
for the number of pertronix compaints over the years...
