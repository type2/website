I think I am the guilty party :-)  A while back (like 3-4 years ago I got
into a "discussion" with someone who believed that the advance should be
set to the engine block number, so I went to Jim's page, downloaded the
whole thing and made a spreadsheet out of it.  I then calculated maximum
advance (vacuum+mechanical) for every distributor and figured the maximum
error you could make by timing a random distributor to the engine block
serial number (I forget what it was, but it was substantial).  As a side
note, I gave a range of maximum advance for type1 engine distributors and
a range of maximum advance for type4 distributors.  As I remember (from
3-4 years ago), the range was slightly (3-4 degrees) higher for the type4
distributors. That was 2 computers ago and a couple HDs.  I am NOT going
to regenerate the spread sheet!  I think I opined at that time that I
figured that the max advance on type4 dists might be higher because of
differences in case alloy, but that the type4 had a far worse record for
dropping valve seats which might be becuase of the greater max advance
allowed.

Anyone who wants to dig around in the archives for long enough might find
that post and repost it, but I am old and tired and not going to do that.
