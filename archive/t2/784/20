We do not do it wrong, and have been doing it properly for 5 years longer
then anyone else.

I'll let you guys figure out why that text is there, but it may be worth
noting that a year ago Mr. Sims was not selling SVDAs, he was promoting the
009.

We do not sell Kadrons, but we do sell Kadron Throttle Bodies with or
without the proper vacuum port. The main advantage to this is you can buy
just the ported TB, and drive your car until the TB arrives, then install it
in 30 minutes, rather then performing delicate operations on your carb while
it sits in the garage.
