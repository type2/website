Subject: FS: New Bus air conditioning evaporator and condensor

Subject says it all.  Among other things I recently aquired from an ex-
VWoA mechanic, I have a few items I don't need right now and would sell 
to someone needing them.  He had the A/C compressor and condensor units 
from a bubble-window Type 2 Bus install kit unused and leftover from a 
warantee repair job.  They are new and only show signs of shelf wear.  
let me know if you're interestedin brand new A/C goodies.

We hope to see some of you at Buses Nowhere Near The Arch #20 over Labor 
Day weekend.  ( http://www.bnnta.com )
