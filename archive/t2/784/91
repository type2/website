Subject: Re: Pertronix ignitor woes

My experience with Pertronix has been good.  I installed a Pertronix 6
years back in my 911 and though I keep the old points in the glove box,
haven't had any problems with it.    When I got the Pertronix, I did 
have
some kind of problem with the installation (can't remember what now),
and I called Pertronix.  They offered to fit the unit in the
distributor free of charge if I sent them the distributor.  I was a
little leery of never seeing my expensive distributor again, but they
did the install and I had the distributor back within a week.

Bus content.  My brother Ed installed a Pertronix unit in his '74 bus a
few years back and also has had no problems.  I'm sure he wishes that
he could say the same thing about his AVP rebuild that failed recently
with around 10,000 miles on the clock due to a cracked engine case from
a poor repair, worn out cam and lifters and poor quality head rebuild.
