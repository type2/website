Subject: M-Codes Question

Ok, this sucks. Only two of my M-codes are listed in the following site:
http://www.type2.com/m-codes/t2mcodes.html#top

Anybody have more info? The missing ones are there, but have ?? for
the description. The listed ones are US delivery and Vent windows.
Sigh.

Here's my M-Code for my 71 Deluxe:
505 640 a01 508 697
