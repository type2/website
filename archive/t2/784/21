 An informal camping weekend on the coast of Maine.
This year we are at Sherwood Forest Campground Just off Rte 130 in New 
Harbor, Maine.
Attrctions include: a boat ride, antique and craft shops, a  tour of 
Colonial Pemaquid and Ft William Henry, a Lobster Feed or just sitting 
around with some old friends.
A weekend in Maine is a sure cure for what ails ya.
