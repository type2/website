I just read an article today that says that OBD-III (currently II) may have the ability to broadcast your emissions performance using cellular technology. If your "Check Engine" light comes on the gov't is going to know... Seriously... Also these emissions-check vans will be able to "interogate" your car's computer as it passes by relaying all sorts of engine management information to the gov't. Now for my scare tactics: all sorts of other info could be relayed to the gov't using this same technology. Where you've been, how fast you were moving, etc. ALREADY there are some marketting types that have put up billboards which interogate your stereo's digital tuner and adjust digital billboards to target YOU - or so I've read (a while back). 

Not just shades of "Big Brother" anymore. Guess those of us who really want the gov't out of our business will have to run a spoof computer to give fake info to the gov't and a parallel computer to actually manage the engine... <griN!> 

Just found out that in Chattanooga (90 miles away) I might have to go back to VW power to pass the emissions check as they go back to 1975. Dunno if that is a rolling exemption or permanent. They do a visual check, tailpipe sniff, and maybe a gas cap check. Good thing we're staying up here in the boonies...
