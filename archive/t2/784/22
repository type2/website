Glenn,

I hope the program mentioned that it is becoming illegal in lots of places 
for the truckers to do that.

I have a buddy in the A/C business that manufacturers a unit for the 
truckers that has a 5hp motor and heat pump...supplies either A/C or heat 
as needed.

Sorry guys, sized for a *big* truck, not for busses.


Cheers, dave
