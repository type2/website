Subject: [T2] Pertronix ignitor woes

Also, I've never heard people complain about them.  I think we all can
attest for the number of pertronix compaints over the years...
---------------- Clip ---------------------------
I'm here to complain about compufire.
I bought one that didn't fit but the selling store said it fit.
I called the factory when I found it wouldn't fit.
They sent an adapter.
I installed the adapter.
It still didn't fit.
I damaged the unit.
I called the factory.
I returned the unit under warranty in the original box with the receipt.
They said they didn't make a unit for a FI VW Bus or Vanagon and said my
warranty was void.
I told them where to stick their Compufire and advised them that I'll tell
this story until I cost them 1000 sales.
I've gone way past killing 1000 sales for them in the six years since my bad
experience but I feel that the story should live forever and Compufire
should roll up their crap and close down.
I've heard similar stories about Petronicx and the most recent one involved
timing advancing enough to kill a nice little type IV bus engine.
