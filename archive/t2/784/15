I reckon that all VW engines have a preferred BTDC timing and the retard settings go away just off idle. Somewhat simplistic if you actually watch the happenings with a vacuum gauge while driving, but with that in mind most if not all of the retard settings (5 ATDC, 10 ATDC, etc) have a vaccum can taylored to add retard to 7.5 BTDC (roughly). You can verify this in Bentley.

After resetting to 7.5 BTDC you can dial in the mechanical portion based on the max advance the engine requires. If the vacuum can is also non-standard it has to be tested and it's a coin toss whether or not you decided to live with a little less or adjust the mechanical timing by a degree or two by increasing the static timing setting at idle.
