That would be 28-30 total centrifugal with the vacuum disconnected.
Vacuum advance comes in when you accelerate and cruise but goes away at full throttle under a load. If you 
look at all the distributors I listed, total centrifugal is 21-25. Now add the initial of 7.5 and you are real 
close to your figure of 28-30. It would be 28.5 to 32.5

What you have to realize about the DVDA distributors:  Manifold vacuum at idle and connected to the retard 
side gives you retarded timing at idle. BUT the amount of retard is figured into the initial timing at idle. 
Key word is 'idle'. You cannot static time a DVDA distributor except if you subtract the amount of retard from 
the initial. Using either DVDA I listed, initial timing was 5 AFTER. If you subtract the amount of retard 
degrees, 11-13 deg, this gives you 6-8 BEFORE TDC. Same as the SVDA initial of 7.5 degrees.

No load, run the engine up to 3000-3500 and watching the timing go past the scale on a 77 bus scares a lot of 
people. But that was the way it is designed. It is supposed to do that!

 Okay, thank Karl, I had no idea. I've been reading these postings on type 2
 for years, and somehow managed to get the impression that some type 4
 dizzies would go up to 45 degrees total advance with vacuum factored in, and an 009 with 22 degrees of 
advance was grossly inadequate for them.

 My new Mexican single vacuum advance Bosch distributor times about 7 BTDC at idle and about 28-30 at full 
advance. I guess some of the double advance distributors had a lot more advance, I never use those myself so 
have little experience with them. 9 times out of 10, when I look at someone's engine with those distributors 
on them, they have the vacuum hoses hooked up backwards and won't listen to reason.

 I stand by the setting the engine at full advance of 28-30, it allows for
 whatever the distributor advances, be it 22 or 45.
