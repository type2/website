Subject: Hot VW's

Just got my October issue of Hot VW's in the mail, and was thrilled to find 
that this issues "Transporter Talk"  entitled BAD LUCK, GOOD LUCK by Bill 
Bowman is definately worth reading.  Starting on page 26 and continued on 
page 30 is what I like to call "The Gary Jarrett Story".  Go out and grab 
this issue, it's yet one more reminder to us of just how lucky Gary was and 
puts the call to duty to all of us to make sure that our tires are in good 
shape.
Looking forward to seeing many of you next weekend at BNNTA.
