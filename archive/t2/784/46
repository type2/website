Subject: Help with timing 77 westy

A little bit of background ifo...
I purchased a 77 westy about 3 or 4 months ago.  At the time it was running,
but after sitting for these 3 or 4 months, it won't start.  I think i was
told that the timing needed to be adjusted when I purchased it.  Since i
purchased it, the only thing that I've done is adjust the valves which I'm
fairly certain I've done correctly and set the point gap.  I'm not
mechanically inclined, but I'm trying to learn.  
 
I've been trying to adjust the timing without success.  I don't have a
timing light so I'm using a voltmeter with the positive lead on the green
wire from the distributer tot he coil at the coil and the engine block as
the ground.  I've set the pulley at 7.5 BTDC and from what I understnad I
should be able to turn the distributer around until the voltmeter does
something.  I do that and nothing happens (I do have the key turned in the
ignition).  At first I had assumed that the coil might be bad so I replaced
it and still no luck.  (I had played the radio for longs periods of time
witht he engine off and I read on the archives that this can cause the coil
to burn up).
 
Any ideas?  I'm really itching to get this running again...
 
Thanks!
