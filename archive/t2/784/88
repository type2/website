I like my Pertronix. I'm coming up on 3 years since I installed it.

I've found that the problem that most people have is that they wire it up backwards and fry it

I've heard of them dying with bizarro coils but failing to remove the slack from the wires inside the distributor is one I've never heard before. I'm sure it's failed for somebody but getting to the details to determine if it truly failed or was simply user error is impossible.

Pertronix offers a 30 month warranty and they take them back without argument.
