Subject: 1700 engines in the U.K.

I was at a club meeting last night, one of the members has a 1700cc engine
with mech. problems. It turns out that the 1700 is very rare beast in the
U.K. and the parts are like hens teeth. He is thinking of fitting a new
1641cc lump.

Automatic gear boxes are also rare, I met a chap at a show earlier this
year, who had been looking the one for a number of years with no luck. I
think he wanted it with a particular van converstion type!
