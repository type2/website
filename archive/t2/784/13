Partial throttle mixtures take longer to ignite so they require more advance.

The amount of vacuum advance is indirectly governed by the throttle position. The rule of thumb is zero at idle, some at partial throttle and almost none again at WOT.

The SVDA advantages are:

- better fuel economy
- better acceleration
- cooler heads

That's it.

Right. You can't dial in these distributors using the mechanical only max advance technique.

The stock settings are best...

1. disconnect the vacuum can and test the witness the max advance w/ timing light and compare to Bentley.
2. test your vacuum can separetely with a vacuum pump w/ gauge and compare to Bentley
