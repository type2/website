   OUCH, Barry!  Tooo involved! We use 2" thick pieces of foam sized to 
the beds in the bus- and sewed covers for them, flannel on ones side, 
sheet like on the other.  These sit over the folds of the stock bed and 
help add comfort, especially to the top bed.  Either roll them or fold 
them over to store, or leave them flat on top on top of the stock bed 
and DO NOT fold it up to drive.  The latter saves the most space and 
actually helps to keep it warmer in winter.  The mats have seen extra 
duty for sleepovers at home, can be used in a tent, and I even take one 
into a motel for extra hard beds.`
