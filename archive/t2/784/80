BD's site has worked well for me.  I'm not sure how big BD is, but I'm 
guessing they're a small shop.  You can't expect someone that isn't an 
amazon.com to have the most pimped out site with excellent interface 
design.  It costs alot of money in programmers, research, and time to 
have a site that really flows.  That might not be BD, but at least he's 
got the parts out there on the internet available for everyone to browse 
through.

Everything's got a learning curve and that probably goes for the BD 
site.  But once you figure it out, you'll never have to learn it again. 
  Plus, now you know about the button ;)

enjoy,
Mike
