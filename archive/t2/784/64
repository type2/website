Subject: Re: [T2] rebuilding the ZBed and upper Bed -

Memory foam (not really foam) has the nasty habit  of getting stiff when 
subjected to temps below 45 deg- a problem for cold weather camping. 
Personally I don't like the lag time in its adjustment.

  the memory foam that is now widely available.  It is only 1.5" deep, yet
  feels more like 4-5".  It is also supposed to have a longer useful life.
  One source is www.jcpenny.com , they sell pads that fit standard beds. 
  Just
  buy the one that provides the overall size you need and then cut as 
needed.
