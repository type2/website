I know I've missed some parts by not remembering/seeing this button.  I think
the same thing happened to Gerald.  He said he looked all over for the MC
grommet.

Is there a search window to put in a part name rather than a #?  I would like
that.

I've read all of these, and the info and specifics on various parts and items
is, to me, one of the finer points of the site, and shows a lot of time/care
invested.

This is where I always get lost.

I didn't want to come off as a BD basher, I'm not and have never been.  I'm
just using the site more now than ever and noticing things more.

Bus content:  I hope my BD order comes today so I can do my brakes and
winshield seal this weekend.
