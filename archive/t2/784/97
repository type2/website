Subject: Removing A/C in '85 Westy?

I am thinking very seriously about yanking the A/C out of my '85 Westy.  I
haven't used it for the past two summers and I would really like to have the
extra storage space for camping.  Has anyone on the list done this before?
I looked thru the Bentley and there wasn't a lot of info about removing the
A/C, and the archive wasn't responding when I just checked.  If anyone could
guide me thru the process I would be very appreciative.

I am also going to be needing a cabinet door and hinges for the top cabinet
if anyone has one available.  I can pay cash or trade for parts (A/C or
other)....

Thanks in advance,
