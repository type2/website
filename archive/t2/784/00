September 09, 2005 - September 11, 2005 - Jerome Jamboree
Gold King Mine, Jerome, Arizona
The Arizona Bus Club proudly invites all VW Drivers to join us for the
Fifteenth Annual Jerome Jamboree. The 1962 Panel raffle bus is looking great
and you may be the lucky soul who drives it home...all we ask is that you
show up in a vw; non volkswagens are not allowed through the gates. Our
venue is located at the historic Gold King Mine (5 minutes from Jerome
Arizona.) New this year WE ARE SERVING FOOD; HOTDOGS AND HAMBURGERS TO CURE
YOUR MUNCHIES!! Back by popular demand are the Pet Show, Body Art Contest,
Chili Cookoff, Slow Drags, Childrens Activities, Raffles Galore and whatever
else we dream up between now and then. The Gold King Mine offers tours and
is a destination in itself. Swapping of parts is strongly encouraged and a
sense of humor is mandatory. Anyone wishing to sell new items must
pre-register as a vendor (see the ABC website) to reserve their spots in
vendor row. The caravan out of Phoenix Friday morning at 8am is legendary
and could change your life! Check our website www.arizonabusclub.com
<http://www.arizonabusclub.com> for updates or email David Lehan
dclehan(-at-)qwest.net <mailto:dclehan(-at-)qwest.net> for details. Admission is $10
per night per vehicle for campers and $3 a day for walk-ins. Sorry no
walk-ins after sunset. Proceeds donated to local charities including the
Jerome Volunteer Fire Department. Thanks Samba!
