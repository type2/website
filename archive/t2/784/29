In my opinion, the $299 Hamburg tent is the best value for the dollar. While
the $199 Koln is great for the price (and many list members are happy with
it), having a floor and/or sleeping cabin can be really useful (especially
when it rains!), and by the time you add that you're at $229. For $70 more,
the Hamburg has the sleeping cabin, plus an actual sewn-in floor - but also
it's a bit better constructed and has an improved design/layout. In a
nutshell, there were fewer constraints because we weren't trying to hit an
under-$200 price point. It's worth the extra $70 in my opinion.
