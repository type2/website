Subject: Kienzle clock

Hello all in the VW world!
 
This might sound like a stupid question, but I have a VDO Kienzle clock in my '74 Westy, the kind that runs off 12 v juice, ya know? On the back of it is an adjuster for speeding up or slowing down the movement. One side has a "+", the other way is "-". You turn it with a little screwdriver to adjust.
 
If my clock is running slow (losing time), which way do I turn it? Toward the + or toward the -?
I'm SOOO confused! Thanks!
