Subject: Re: '72 distributor in a '68

I'd like to throw a curveball at this conversation. I have a '71 with an 
1898cc stroker with Kadrons and a 009. I'm very disappointed with the 009 
you've got me thinking about the SVDA. But what's the best way to add in a 
vacuum port with the Kadrons on there? There's a T leading from the brake 
booster to the vacuum ports on the carb manifolds. So is this as simple as 
adding another small T for the distributor? Are there good and bad places 
to do that?
