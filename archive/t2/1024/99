I've had this EXACT problem, and didn't think of it but it does seem like fuel starvation.  Since
changing the fuel pump didn't fix Matthew's problem my idea wouldn't apply to his problem, but I
had an idea. 

I had a fuel leak and I called the mechanic who checked out my bus before I drove it 500 miles to
ask a couple of questions.  He told me that something people (probably rookies like me anyways)
often don't think of is a faulty fuel pump diaphragm.  He says they get ______ (I forget exactly)
but the result is that during long trips they get hot and have a tendency to stick open or closed.
 Sticking open he said would lead to my fuel leak after a trip ... might sticking closed  lead to
fuel starvation??  It goes away after awhile which makes me think it got unstuck.  Seems like a
faulty diaphragm might answer both of my problems.  

The mechanic says they simply replace the mechanical pump with an electric one.  Reading the
message archives, it doesn't sound like just installing the electric pump is the best idea.  I
gather there needs to be some special wiring done to insure that in case of an accident, where the
electricity is still on, the pump shuts off.  Sounds more difficult than simply changing out the
diaphragm if I can find one ... I haven't read it all, but the Bentley manual makes it look
straight forward.

Thanks for advice,
