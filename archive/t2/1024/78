but I will not mess with those torsion bars.

Any particular reason?  They are not that hard to do, just time consuming,
so a mechanic would probably charge you $$$ for the job.

The transvair means that you won't be setting them to stock settings.  If
you have a station wagon you might want to switch to the higher rate
campmobile torsion bars.
