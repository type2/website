Hi Dave,

"Too Cold" means just that... I guess what I mean is that "too cold"  
= conditions that would render the event uncomfortable and  
impractical, despite all reasonable efforts.

Like a -40 wind chill, for instance... that would be too cold to be  
comfortable no matter how high you built the fire.  Even if you built  
up the fire real huge in those conditions you'd be baking your face  
and freezing your butt at the same time unless you stand there and  
pirouette like a chicken on a spit.  We try to avoid that kind of  
weather; it's "too cold". I asked quite a few of the newcomers if  
they thought that it was "too cold" to have a good time and none of  
them thought that was the case.


Happy Trails,

Looks like lotsa fun, but I have one question:

"...perfect for a winter campout, with more than a
foot of fresh powdered snow on the ground and not too
cold."

That "not too cold" part - that is my question - just
a general question, kinda like, what does that
statement actually mean?

The Canadian Bus Camping season is now officially
open!!

The turnout at TCWBC was outstanding: 15 buses
showed up this year,
including 2 eurovans, 5 vanagons and 8 Baywindow
buses.  That's more
than double the turnout from last year.  We burned
through a metric
busload of firewood, and had a great time.

The weather on Saturday was just about perfect for a
winter campout,
with more than a foot of fresh powdered snow on the
ground and not
too cold. The moon shone brightly through the woods
and the campfire
circle was well attended.
