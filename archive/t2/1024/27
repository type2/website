Hello,

It is my understanding that no bus ever left the
factory with a/c. To my knowledge, a/c was added to
some buses by dealerships as an aftermarket option.
There was a few popular units installed including but
not excluding the under dash only, the overhead unit
with either front or front and rear facing vents, and
a unit located in the jump seat on camper models. I
cannot speak for the cooling power of them or the
practicality of having a/c in a bus because I have
never seen a working system in a bus. David Schwartz
had a bus that he installed front and rear a/c if my
memory serves me correctly. 

A nice article was written in the May 2007 issue of
hot VWs about installing a/c in a bus. If you are
interested in one of their kits for a bus using R134
freon, here is some contact info.

I called the shop last year inquiring about prices.
They are reasonable and you get all new parts. Good
Luck!

Hi,
 
In what year was A/C first available in a
transporter? 
Did it work any good?
