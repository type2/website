Subject: Re: [T2] [Q] Camper Top

I redid the top on my Vanagon last summer. Before I got it, it had 
lived outside in the Texas sun for years, and the gelcoat had oxidized 
off so much it was fuzzy.

I used Interlux Epoxy Primekote and Interlux Perfection 2 part urethane 
topcoat. Lots of sanding between coats to knock the fibers down. If 
your top smooth, you'll have an easier time than I did. I used 2 quarts 
of each because I had to build it up to replace the lost gelcoat. 1 
quart of each should work for a top which is in decent shape.

I just used a small foam roller, it came out pretty good. Not smooth 
like the gelcoat, but with an even texture.

I would stay away from anti-fouling paint, as someone else mentioned. 
Most antifouling paint is sacrificial, it leaches chemicals or turns 
chalky to keep marine growth to a minimum. How it looks and lasts are 
not priorities. It should not be used above the waterline. A good 
topside paint is what you want.
