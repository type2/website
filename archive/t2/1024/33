Almost - only front air in my bus.  :-)

I thought it would be worth mentioning that it may be a little easier to 
put A/C in a 72-up bus than an older one.  The 72-up busses have a nice 
place to mount the compressor on the left side of the engine and there 
is an optional pulley for that purpose that can go behind the fan.  On a 
type 1 powered bus, there is only the main pulley which is relatively 
large and will overdrive the typical A/C compressor significantly.  I 
have seen a couple of systems built where the main pulley, generator and 
A/C compressor make a giant triangle with one belt going around all 
three and it did work, though the belt was a bit floppy and I was 
worried about the power transmission requirements on the single belt.
