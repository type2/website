Subject: Re: [T2] [Q] Bus Trailer

I don't think you can beat horrible freight's price/value.

I've had a couple of their trailers now, no complaints.

I recommend a 12" tire - I understand the bearings take less of a 
beating than the 8's...

And the total weight of these trailers is far less than others.  I keep 
my total weight <1000, including trailer weight in my '79 westy.  Don't 
even know the trailer is there.

May as well get a 4x8, it gives you the ability to haul a number of 
things.  I finish mine out with plywood to 24 or 30", and a conduit 
frame that stands 4-5' above the bed of the trailer, with union joints 
at the level of the ply sides so's I can pop it off ez if it's in the 
way.  Makes it easy to tarp any load neatly and the frame comes in handy 
to stow bungees and hanging stuff, even clothing.

I use the round pipe anchors and slice off a side so they mount inside 
the plywood nicely, along the uprights and secure it with 1 or 2 pipe 
brackets with nice long screws that bite out into the uprights.

I'm a nut - I make sure I've got some kinda super paint when I assemble 
the trailer because there are spots in 'em where you see bare metal. 
While I'm assembling it's easy to see these places and it's all clean, 
easy to dab on a bit of paint to seal 'em up.  Try not to torque so 
tightly you're breaking the paint.  I also predrill all wood even the 
ply base, then a couple good coats of an exterior, and thru the holes so 
it can't suck up water there.

These trailers are red, and I think it's a baked enamel, so difficult to 
paint the frame?  Terry - what's the scoop here?  Some day I'd like to 
build a new trailer up that matches the bus perfectly.  Make some custom 
canvas covers for it and ya got a class act.
