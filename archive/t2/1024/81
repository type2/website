Wow. I can answer this one.
FSR (Fiberglas stain remover) by Johnson.

I have used this stuff extensively. The trick is to not use it in direct
sunshine; it needs to stay wet to work well. Apply it to a dry surface, then
keep it cool and in the shade. You might even try placing a piece of plastic
wrap over it  Stains on poor surfaces will take longer to remove. WEAR
GLOVES! This stuff will turn your skin to raw calamari.
