The Canadian Bus Camping season is now officially open!!

The turnout at TCWBC was outstanding: 15 buses showed up this year,  
including 2 eurovans, 5 vanagons and 8 Baywindow buses.  That's more  
than double the turnout from last year.  We burned through a metric  
busload of firewood, and had a great time.

The weather on Saturday was just about perfect for a winter campout,  
with more than a foot of fresh powdered snow on the ground and not  
too cold. The moon shone brightly through the woods and the campfire  
circle was well attended.

Unfortunately we awoke this morning to rain so we decided to forgo  
breakfast burritos and packed down camp in time for a great brunch at  
a diner just a few kilometers down the road.

Here's my pics:

Here's a great youtube video of Joel Cort backing his synchro out of  
his campsite.

I'm not sure when my next campout will be, but I know I'm looking  
forward to it!


Happy Trails,
