Subject: Re: [T2] [Q] Bus Trailer  

I have a harbor freight tools trailer too and I have had no problems with it. I've hauled a number of engines back and forth fairly long distances. I just recently hauled a 1969 Oldsmobile 455 big block with a Th-400 automatic transmission from Valdosta, Georgia to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Didn't have any problems. The engine actually weighed just upwards of 1080 pounds with the transmission attached. That actually axceeded the capacity of the trailer but it didn't flinch... this was on a 4' x 4' HF all steel trailer. It's painted black, with black diamond plate on the top of the trailer. I think I paid about $200 for the trailer.

Here are two pictures of the engine / tranny on the trailer after bringing it home:

Here is the pic of the motor again 6 months later after bringing it home from the machine shop:

And here is the motor after assembling everything: (if anyone cares, hahah)

The trailer works well though. And you mount a SPARE tire under the middle of the trailer.
