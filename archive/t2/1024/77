I have used both on utility trailers and found that the 8" wheels are bad
both from a bearing and tire standpoint.  You have to keep a close eye on
them (I put grease fittings in the wheel hubs and made a shot of grease a
routine every time I used the trailer) and always carried a spare tire
and tube.

The fact that the 8" wheels were non-demountable made it worse!
