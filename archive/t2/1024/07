After 5 years and a couple of pop top removals I don't see any signs  
of chipping on my own westy.

When plastic bumpers are painted, the paint is often mixed with a  
plasticizer to keep the paint flexible but I've never seen a need for  
it when painting the poptop which flexes rather than deforms.

A topside marine paint might be worthwhile if you can find it at a  
good price and if you permanently park by the ocean.

I think the feeling that the original paint was inadequate (and thus  
the need for marine paint) stems from the fact that VW used a gel  
coat process typically with fiberglass production.
