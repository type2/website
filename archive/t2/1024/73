John,
 
You're right, I should have mentioned this - all valves are set at  .006".  I 
usually set the valves at the beginning of the summer (this bus  is a 
summertime use only vehicle for me).  I rarely have to move any of  them more than 
about 1/8 of a turn or so, so I don't think the case studs are  pulling out.  I 
tend to go for a slightly loose feel on the gauge when I'm  adjusting the 
valves.
 
Hi Rusty,

Have you adjusted the valves recently?  I didn't see  this listed as a
troubleshooting measure, and as it turned out, was the cause  of my
"PICT-3" issues.  My valves were adjusted too tightly by the PO  and it
was something I had never even considered as a cause for lack  of
power/idle.

Regards,

John
