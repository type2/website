Subject: CV joints

I'm doing CV joints, buying a tube of grease rather than the 4 
initial bags of it was my first (and only so far) mistake. I had to 
put about 1/4 of the tube into a ziplock sandwich bag, zipped it shut 
and cut a corner off to squeeze it into the joints.
My pitman puller worked GREAT to pull the joint off the shaft, I had 
to take the joint apart first but it works well with zero stress to 
the parts. The bench vice helps.
Messy job, lot's of rags needed.
Good directions in the Bentley for reassy the joint.
