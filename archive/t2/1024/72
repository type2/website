Subject: 34 PICT-3 Carb Issues

My memory of these things from list discussions of years past is that they  
were never great, but could be made to run acceptably with the right care and  
perhaps a loving touch.
 
 
My engine (stock 1600 DP, stock carb, stock distributor - you get the  
picture) seems to loose it's will to accelerate, especially at low RPM's and  once 
the engine is fully warmed up (choke off).  Sometimes, it just dies  when I 
step on the gas too aggressively.
 

I found this site:

and more specifically:

(http://www.vw-resource.com/34pict3.html) 
 
This is pretty much the procedure I have followed over the years.   Does this 
make sense?  Anyone have anything to add?
 
I've checked timing, advance + vac hoses, intake manifold boots are pretty  
new, brake booster vacuum line hoses and check valve are new, plugs are clean,  
wires, cap, rotor, condenser are new.  
 
If I remember right, the idle speed (big screw) adjustment was a bit funky.  
I think that the situation is that backing the screw out beyond a certain 
point  does not give the increase in idle speed I have come to expect.  I can  
barely get the idle speed to spec (-at-) 850 RPM - that tells me something is  wrong.  
 
I have a re-build kit I plan to install when I take the carb off for a  
going-over, once the cold weather here in the Philly area warms up  enough. 
 
Anyway, all suggestions appreciated.
 
Rusty
