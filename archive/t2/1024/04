Subject: Painting Camper Top

David,

 I painted my top last summer. It was pretty easy to do too. I had the
advantage of the top already having a coat of automotive paint on it, because
the previous owner had the entire bus re-painted in L20B, "Brilliant Orange".
The *entire* bus.
Camper Top
Bumpers
Muffler
The L20B paint job is not show quality, but it's good. I covered the entire
lower portion of the bus with a plastic tarp, fixed the holes in the
fiberglass, sanded the entire top and luggage rack with 180 grit sandpaper, and
painted the top and luggage rack with three coats of Rustoleum Gloss White
straight out of the can. I used foam rollers (one 2", one 12") to apply the
paint, which went on nice and flat. I researched what kind of paint to use on
The Samba and the Type-2 lists, and came to the conclusion that (for me) buying
expensive marine-application paint was not neccessary. It took about two quarts
to paint the entire top and luggage rack, total cost of the job was less than
$30 plus my time. Touchups to the paint, if neccessary in the future, will be
inexpensive. Today, six months later with the bus parked on the street the
entire time, the paint still looks wet. Photos of the process are here:

 Group-
 
 Anyone ever paint their camper top?  I'm going to clean mine, but for 
 a good match with the new paint job I'll put on my bus, I'm 
 considering painting the top too.  My only reservation is that the 
 top flexes, so I don't want to get cracks.
 
 Thoughts?
