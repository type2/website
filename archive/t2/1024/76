Hey all
2.ol hydraulic valves
so I rebuilt my motor ( ok not completely) just from the heads out. This was 
mainly because of oil leaks. The first time I put the motor back in it was 
noisy as hell, popping and backfiring. so I took it apart again and found 
that some of the lifters feel stiffer than others. My question is, Is there 
a rebuild kit for the lifters? Oh and one of the clips that holds the lifter 
together had popped out and seemed broken.
