Craig,

Your Westies are continuing to make memories.  The one formerly known as 
"the magic bus" is my daily driver and frequent camper.  It's provided 
tons of fun and lots of memories for me and the kids.  I saw your other 
Westy last weekend when Jon and I went to pick up my new '65 splitty. 
Both will live on providing smiles for years to come.  My kids fight 
over who will get Green Pea, but I think that was settled when I brought 
the '65 home last weekend.  My 6 year old son loves it!

Here's some pics of what's become of your magic bus...
