Subject: at my wits end

Hello

I shall have to start from the beginning

I have a 1600cc twinport campervan, with a new Vege Engine that has covered
about 3000 miles.  I have set the valves , points and timing and everything
seems correct.

My initial problem was that after around an hours constant driving i would
lose power and then the van would jolt violently, it felt very much like fuel
starvation and the fuel pump didn't seem very effective so I changed it.
Still the problem persisted.

On one journey i decided to swap the coil as I felt it was possible that it
was breaking down under pressure when it got hot, on doing so i noticed there
was a wire from the coil that i had no idea where it went, the live wire and
the wire to the distributor were in place no problem.  The bus would then
start but did not idle.  I read in my VW's for idiots book that on some carbs
that there was a wire from the carb cut off valve to the coil but this was
already connected to the automatic choke (that I have disabled).

So my first question and most important one is can some one please confirm
where the three wires from the coil should go (as I thought there should only
be two) and where should the automatic choke be connected?.  This should at
least get me back on a level playing field to investigate the original
problem!!!

Secondly with the timing set correctly, the valves set up the points set and a
carb that all the jets have been cleaned thoroughly with an air jet...why am I
still losing all power on any journey of a decent size?

Your help would be gratefully appreciated!!
