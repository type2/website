Hi,
 
I've been off the list for about 4 years, job change and a few other things  
going on, but my bus (71 Westy, bone stock, color=chiantirot) is still going  
strong, and so am I at age 52!
 
Anyway, I look forward to much more bus talk.
 
I recently acquired a correct-for-1971 sink and icebox cabinet, to replace  
the 1972 version that has been in my bus for...................a long  time.  
The 1972 cabintet is now for sale on The Samba, but I thought I'd  mention it 
here as well in case there happens to be anyone interested.
 
Let's see, what else have I done on my bus in the intervening years?  
 
    - Replaced the ball joints - that was a job!
    - Fixed the rusted out left rear corner and got her  all painted up nice
 
Projects on the horizon:
 
    - Install newly purchased VDO tachometer in the  clock hole in the 
dashboard
    - Perhaps upgrade the cassette deck to CD?   Anyone know of a decent 
AM/FM/CD that will fit without cutting the dash?
 
By the way, when I had my bus painted about 7 or 8 years ago, I had the top  
painted with plain old DuPont Centari enamel, and it has held up quite  well.  
Not the smoothest job I've seen, as it could have used much more  prep work, 
but maybe that goes on the list of things to do (or, re-do).
 
Rusty
