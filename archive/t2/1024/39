Hey guys.. Here are the specs.. 2.0 T4 Powerplant....
But if you try to accelerate, it pops anf farts out of
the carb...

i say:

could this be a soft lifter?

im troubleshooting the same thing on a 2L and i know
i've got at least one spongy lifter on #3...but may
also have a slighly bent stem on #1, so could be
either - havent been able to narrow it down - am
thinking of just dropping a set of solid lifters in
there.

backfiring thru the carb means an improperly
opening/closing intake valve..somehow. the late throw
of a soft lifter could cause this?

list gurus?
