Subject: Re: Oil temp sender location 

For the automatic transmission, most places recommend anywhere from 30,000 to 50,000 miles. I recommend you change the fluid every 30k miles in an automatic, or more if you beat the hell out of the car (or Bus).

Typically, for the first 30k interval, it's totally acceptable to just do a tranny "flush". They disconnect your cooling lines, well... ok, now I'm not sure how that works on a VW Bus? But they cycle the fluid through a pump and basically replace all the old fluid with clean fluid. 

Then at the 60k mark, do both a filter change and a flush. I prefer to do the flush first, and then the filter... that way your not sending dirty fluid through a clean filter.

The reason why it needs to be changed is because the fluid does in fact get very hot. The transmission heats up (friction among other things) and there is typically some wear. Epsecially when the transmission is new there will be some microscopic metal shavings that get caught in the filter.
