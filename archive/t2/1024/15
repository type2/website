The part about gas spashing out of the top reminded me of when I had my 
dual carbs and one of the accelerator pump nozzles had fallen out, which 
allowed a bunch of fuel to drizzle into the carb in an unnatural way. 
That would also fit with a good idle but problems accelerating.

Might that be your problem?
