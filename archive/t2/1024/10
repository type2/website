Subject: Re: [T2] Oil temp sender location

Hi, I used a temperature sensor that just screwed into where the engine 
oil drain plug is supposed to go (beside the "taco" plate). Works great, 
installs neat. I bought it at California Imports in Langley. This is 
what they suggested for me to do. If you want, I can crawl underneath 
and see if I can read a part number on it.
