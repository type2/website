Hi Dean,

The type2 list is about more than just help. There's a community  
here, too.

Lots of newbies join lists like this one looking for help, then  
discover the community around them. I can't count the number of local  
people I have met through this list, simply through promoting Buses  
of the Corn or the True Canadian Winter Bus Campout.

Yes, BOTC and TCWBC are local events probably within range of less  
than 2% of the listmembers.  But by promoting my events on this  
channel and others the word gets out, and the events grow. Which in  
turn supports the list. I've also heard tell of many cool things to  
do at bus events, which have in turn improved the quality of my own  
WV community experiences.

If someone doesn't like a poster's materials, it is well within their  
ability to use the message filters to censor content from an  
individual they are not interested in hearing from.

And if Uncle Jerry is feeling well enough to be hanging out at the  
hot tub, I'm happy to hear about it.  I would consider that to be the  
"community" side of the post.

Happy Trails.
