Subject: engine running bad..

ok, so some of you said it might be running lean?? How would i tell if  
the main jet dealie is clogged? I took the carb apart, I i took out  
the main jet in the bottom of the bowl... could it be clogged past the  
jet somehow??? just brainstorming.. maybe its the left carb being  
wierd.. cause the plugs on right side are fine looking.. hmm im just  
grasping at straws and am tired..
