Folks that worry about cold have never had fun in the winter,, and are
probably miserable till they get out to a TCWBC ... once they have
experienced the fun... and realize the weather didn't even bother them , in
fact made it more interesting... they are anxiously waiting till the next
one!  Then the winter doesn't seem soooo long and miserable to them any
more.

Too cold would have to include a wind chill factor... other wise you can
just put another layer of clothes on! Or warm up with another log on the
fire.. or something else that is warming..
