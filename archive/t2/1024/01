Subject: [Q] Bus Trailer

Group-

As I think my project to death, I'm considering trailers.  Anyone familiar
with the Besco folding trailer?

Also, does anybody have a trailer, frame, or plans for sale?  O.K., I
probably don't need any plans -- can't handle another project.  If I had a
frame (at least), I could build up a new trailer around it.

Thoughts?
