Subject: Need '77 Westy dimensions

This is embarrassing but I can't seem to find it anywhere on the www that I trust for sure, don't have an owners manual handy, and don't know if I want to trust Bentley or not on this.  Can someone measure a '76-'79ish Westy for me, length, width (at widest point on bumpers I'd imagine), and most importantly heigth while riding on stock 185R14's.  I'm looking at a couple of enclosed car haulers to buy to bring the '77 up from WV this spring and need to make sure, obviously that what I buy is big enough before making a costly or annoying (if I have to pull the bumpers or let all the air out of the tires) error.  I want to buy one light, short, and "just the right size though" so need to know to pretty close numbers.  If anyone can, please pmail me, don't waste the list time.
   
  Thanks in advance.
   
  John
