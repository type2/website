Subject: Convert Sliding Door to Hinged (project)

I have a few thoughts on how I might do this, but
would like to hear suggestions. I want to replace the
sliding door with a single width hinged door on my
'74. My thoughts have ranged from using parts from a
US made van and re-skinning to match body to
attempting to find a double cab that is not usable
intact and starting with that door as a "seed"
(seedling?)
Any thoughtful suggestions are most welcome. -BaH
