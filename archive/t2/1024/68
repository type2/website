My pop-up fiberglass roof had never been painted.  After 15-20
years, the gel coat began to break down and expose glass fibers.

Crystalliner on Placentia Ave in Costa Mesa, CA sold me gel coat
resin, catalyst, pigment (white) and finishing agent. I prepped the
roof by power washing and sanding it.

Masking off, drop cloths, gloves and old clothes are a must
because this stuff does not clean up (easily).  Applied the first
coat by cutting in the grooves with a brush and rollering the rest.
Final coat included the finishing agent. The end result is durable
and compliant with a slight textured feel due to the roller and
lack of sanding the first coat.  I was after performance, not beauty. 

Just like on a boat deck.  No dark-soled shoes on my roof please. ;-)
