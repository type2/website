 backfiring thru the carb means an improperly

of a soft lifter could cause this?

I would suspect retarded ignition timing or no accelerator pump on a carbed
engine long before I would even think about a valve/lifter problem. 99% of
the time, it is something basic.

On a FI bus engine, the fuel pressure regulator acts just like an
accelerator pump. The injectors flow x amount of fuel regulated by the
amount of pressure and the time they are open. The ECU controls the time
they are open. The fuel pressure regulator controls the pressure. At idle,
fuel pressure is regulated to 28-30 psi. But when you open the throttle,
manifold vacuum drops and the fuel pressure goes up to 36-38 psi. More
pressure = more fuel.
