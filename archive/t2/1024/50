Subject: [Q] Engine (Again)

Group-

Thank you all for the feedback on engine choices/vendors.  As a 
general rule, most suggestions (both off- and on-line) were of the 
type "I know a guy...".  This is *great*, as I've had good luck in 
the past with individuals who are only in business because they 
really know what they are doing.

That being said, I'm curious as to the various companies out 
there.  Any reports on super full-fledged businesses that do a great job?

I'm just curious.

P.S.  I got maybe one or two suggestions along these lines, but these 
were in the minority.
