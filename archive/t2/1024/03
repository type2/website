Subject: Running bad :(

Hey guys.. Here aree the specs.. 2.0 T4 Powerplant. Type 3 Carbs,  
Running well for a long time, passed emissions etc.. ran great for  
quite a while.. Then all of a sudden now.. kinda came on over a day or  
so, i drive 30 miles each way to work. Now its bad, It idles great,  
getting good spark, plugs look ok. going to pull one more on passenger  
side to make sure, It idles fine, then if you accelerate, it pops out  
of the passenger carb.. but like i said it idles good, and i know all  
4 cyls firing as i can pull plug wire and engine drops. But if you try  
to accelerate, it pops anf farts out of the carb. And you can see gas  
splashing out of it. the top... so i went ahead, replaced points,  
tried my 009, no dice, still same issue. so.. when i did the valves..  
none of them looked dropped, i had a dropped valve when i bought the  
bus.. so i know what it looks like.. lol.. so i am leaning towards it  
not being a valve.. but i guess i could take it in somewhere and have  
them diagnose the issue. it was running like a friggin top though.. no  
ideas why this is happening, i went through the carbs, needle valves  
working, pumping when accelerate etc.. please help.. any ideas???? I  
need to get this up and going.. just hope i dont need another head.. I  
do know i need to buy a thermostat setup.. Busted Bus can sell it to  
me.. but pricy.. without the thermostat.. :( any and all help would be  
appreciated, if you feel up to brainstorming over the phone and maybe  
want to hear what it is doing.. 801-337-4438 is my number. Thanks a  
ton!!

Jason
