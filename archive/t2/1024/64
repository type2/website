Pics can be pmailed showing 71 foam bed option, also our 78 extra bed I 
made As seen on our 78 Westy site

Our 71 came with a foambed on top, brought here by serviceman who bought 
it to the US; it had the wider
foam bed - not full size, but much better than the cot.  The bus
rotted away; the mattress board became our bed backboard. It had hinges
screwed to the roof over the driver and flipped up with the top to be
totally out of the way.  To retrofit a later bed to a 71 is difficult,
as the stock bus had to be reinforced to accept the flat board in the rear.

  wonder if the idea (full bed) could be retrofitted to my '71?  (I'm 
guessing so.)
