Subject: Re: [T2] Distribution pipe for 72

This is the Air Distribution/Balance Pipe Assembly, often called the "Air
Spider", officially called by VW the "Mixture Distributor".

021 133 551 A  - 1972 ONLY

021 133 551 E  - 73-74

Goes between the dual carbs and attaches to a couple of other things as well
in the engine compartment.

And no, I don't have one right now ;-)
