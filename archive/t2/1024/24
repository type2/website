Subject: Re: [T2]Auto Parts Stores Rants

I try to use only quality parts , not sure if it was said but quality parts  
fit better and have a better chance at working. 
 
I had to return a battery twice to a chain parts store, and what a hassle  
they gave me.  
 
I get parts from most of the venders and they know quality is everything to  
me.
 
 I don't get paid for replacing bad parts.
