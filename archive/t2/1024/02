Subject: Re: [T2] Oil temp sender location

Search the Type2 archives for my meat thermometer oil temp sender/gauge. 
  It is now available in virtually the same format from Harbor Freight 
for $10, but it seems you must open it (3 screws) to replace the battery 
(which lasts for a year)..  I extended the sensor with brass tubing and 
epoxy to fit in the hole your oil level stick fits into, and put the 
gauge on the left side of the dash where it was easy to run the wiring 
(phone wire) behind the sink unit, under the edge of the front mat and 
up. Fancier $20 ones can be had in any food market/WalMart that also 
will give you the MAX since you turned it on.  They even make wireless 
ones for the barbecue?
