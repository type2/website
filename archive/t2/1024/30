This is what my project bus looks like on its side. One of the coolest tools
I have ever bought (even though I only am part-owner). It makes me want to
bolt it up every time just to change the oil in my Westy.

 

Oh, and before anyone wants to start flaming me on the connection points, I
already did the engineering on it and it is very safe (providing there isn't
a swiss-cheese mess of rust where the captive nuts are, which on this bus,
there isn't). The front bolts can withstand about 20X more shear force than
the weight of the bus and the rear bolts almost 40X more. The trick is to
not over torque the bolts and make sure they are all the same. In this case
25 ft/lbs for the front and 35 ft/lbs on the rear.
