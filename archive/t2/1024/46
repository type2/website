Subject: End of the parts rant

I took the parts back to Napa. I 'splained that the rotor spins on the
shaft, and the cap doesn't seat all the way on the distributor.

Napa Counter Monkey: "Did you install the parts?"
Me: "Yeah, that's how I know they don't fit."
Napa Counter Monkey: "We don't take parts back that were installed."
Me: "They don't work."
Napa Counter Monkey: "But they've been installed."
Me: "I'm not paying for parts that don't work. Get me the manager."
Napa Manager Monkey: "Were they installed?"
Me: ...

After going around a few times they realized I was saying they were
"Defective" and refunded my money. I think they thought I broke them and was
trying to return them. Sigh.

So with my $19 refund in hand I headed across town to Blazer in Denver.
Bosch parts. Here's what my receipt says:

1 dist. cap 03010 - $8.63
1 dist. rotor 04033 - $4.08
Tax - $1.00
Total: $13.71

So, not only did I get much better parts, I paid less too!

(Too bad they didn't fix the Guac. Sigh.)
