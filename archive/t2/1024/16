Subject: Looking for a auto tranny

Anyone have a line on one. It's to go into nonstandard 74 westie.
1700 fi so I would prefer the newer tranny ...  .010 I think?
Right now it's got an older one in it that's all vacuum based.

Prefer Canadian source but depending on cost would maybe
bring one up.

James
