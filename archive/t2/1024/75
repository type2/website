Subject: Need shop or mechanic to do a torsion bar adjustment in Tampa,

Hello All,

    I have a 1975 Westy with a Transvair Corvair conversion.  The rear torsion bars were already sagging a bit and the additional
200 lbs or so has pushed the rear even more.

  I have done every bit of work on that old van for the last 15 years but I will not mess with those torsion bars.

  Anybody know of a mechanic in the Tampa bay area that could handle a rear torsion bar adjustment ?

 Thanks

 Mark
