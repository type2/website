I made some more progress with my bus conversion project, thanks to a 
burst of enthusiasm from getting the motor started a couple of weeks 
ago.  Got boost and pyrometer gauges installed, a few miscellaneous bugs 
worked out and 18psi in the intake manifold.  There are some new 
pictures and a detailed description on the web page if anyone is 
interested (new stuff starts midway through page 4):
