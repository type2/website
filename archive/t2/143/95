Ok, I'll go against the grain on this one.  I have run Load range "D" tires
on two of my vans (both campers).  The last was my '78 PopTop Westy.  I ran
50 PSI front and 55 PSI rear.  This was based on a 65 PSI maximum rating.
The load rating of the tire is based (in part) on the air pressure in the
tire.  I found the pressures above to give good ride control, excellent
handling and proper wear.  There was no sign of over inflation in the wear
pattern, and these pressures met the load table as supplied by the
manufacturer.

They were the Y356's also, but the load range "D" 195 width tire.  The
Y356's are a light truck tire.  The original equipment tire was a
"reinforced" tire with a much lower maximum PSI rating (as was the alternate
LT tire).  IMNSHO, you should follow the vehicle manufacturers
recommendation IF you have the same make/style/load rating tire as OEM.
Otherwise, ask the tire manufacturer for their recommendation for your
weight of vehicle and driving style.

Just my opinion,
