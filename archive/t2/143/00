I have a restored 71 westy that I am looking to trade even or down for =
one of the following:Pre 72 single or Double cab, pre 72 passenger van, =
4 spd beetle or 4 spd type 3. I am looking for something that is clean =
and roadworthy and can be driven daily (no projects).
My westy is a 1971 which is considered the best year by most since it =
has the power disc brakes and the upright engine. It has been =
professionally stripped down and all the windows and pop top removed and =
painted a beautiful blue and white combo. The fiberglass pop top was =
even painted to match while it was off as were the rims. Just about =
every exterior rubber seal was replaced at this time and I believe the =
windshield is new as well. The front end was rebuilt and a complete =
brake overhaul was done with new rotors etc. The canvas was replaced in =
the pop top with the deluxe kit that has the 3 zippered and screened =
windows in it. The upstairs cot canvas was also replaced with a new =
unit. All the curtains were custom made with a blue & white gingham =
pattern that matches the exterior colors. The camper also has new tires. =
the interior is the original gold/mustard yellow material and the z bed =
has 2 small tears, but otherwise in good condition. The floor has been =
upgraded with wood parket(sp) tiles. The only thing the westy needs is =
the engine installed. I have purchased a recently rebuilt motor from the =
buggy shop for the westy and lack of time, energy, garage and driveway =
space prevent me from installing it. It does require the bug/bus adapter =
for the rear mount which I do have and is included. A starter will also =
be needed, but I may have one to go with it.
Please contact me at atoz96(-at-)optonline.net if interested. If someone =
wanted to purchase it outright instead of a trade, the price is a firm =
$4500 or $4000 without the rebuilt motor. Anyone who has restored a =
westy knows how much $ it takes to do so and just the paint alone is =
thousands.  Located in NY.
Thanks,
Kurt
