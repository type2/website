Todd,

of a wind at all, I'll arrive at my destination with sore shoulders and
arms (even if the trip is just 2 hours).<<

i would tend to agree with Simon - i think its just part of
driving a bus!

good luck in your quest for more stability. if you find any particularly
useful info, please share with the list. i'm sure there are many people
on this list would would love a more stable bus.
