Subject: Re: [T2] battery cable reversal

Nah, well not in my case :-)
On the '78 I used to have, my dad reversed the battery cables when hooking
up the battery.  No damage to anything except that the alternator died a
horrible smoky death.

Speaking of alternators, I'll have an EB trip report before long.
