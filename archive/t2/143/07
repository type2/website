This is a real good point I forgot to mention as well, in fact it is
pretty much the case in most states now days.  In WV this
isn't a problem (so much) as you can title and register a car
without the car being present yet if you have the title.  Or you
can chance it.  Nobody has fortunately stopped me yet, and
I always seem to have a "close" plate when I need it anyway.
