Subject: '71 has a wierd glitch

'71 Westy running a basically stock 1641 DP. Pertronix in the stock dizzy, 
34PICT carb, extractor. No other mods. Engine runs great and has ever since 
it was built. The problem, which has happened maybe 20 times in over 15,000 
miles: With the engine pretty well loaded, like climbing a slight hill in 
top gear, accelerator 1/2 to 3/4 of the way down, the engine momentarily 
cuts out. No noise, no funkiness, just a sharp, momentary drop in power, 
which causes the bus to lurch briefly until I let up on the accelerator. The 
fuel pump is standard mechanical. By the way, this problem only seems to 
arise when the engine is fairly hot, like an oil temp over 190, but it 
doesn't have to be REALLY hot for it to happen. Fuel delivery problem? Bad 
coil? I've heard others speak of this problem, and I knew one guy who said 
he'd owned a couple of VWs that did this.

I know someone out there has dealt with this. Can you shed some light?

Much obliged,
