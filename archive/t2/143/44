The Berg temp sender flashes the oil pressure idiot light
and indeed is a nifty solution. It needs no additional wiring or
gauge to function, and the installation is easy.
You can also visually read the sender for an approximation.

I lost the post last night regarding the Berg achiever pulley
ratios, it is probably buried inside another reply.
It was an explanation of the stock and berg ratios,
and mentioned Berg's refund for their pulley.
Would someone please p-mail ?
