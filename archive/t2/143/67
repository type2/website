	David:

	You're a saint!  That's exactly the kind of input I was looking
for...

	I was really curious if I got a bad batch of QC, the lube schedule
was insufficient, the MBZ alloys done them in, my 914 influenced driving
style (on a Westy, yeah, right), or the 10 miles of an "alleged" dirt road
while gold prospecting in Michoacan had something to do with their demise.

	The rest of you - come on, don't be shy ;-)  You know who you are...

	Jim H.
