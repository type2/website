be VERY carefull that ball that it goes over is very easy to break.  (ask
me how I know)  the only way I have found to get the stuck ones off is to
wedge it off from both sides at the same time.  I used a pair of curved
forceps that I had.  don't know what else would work though.  all force
has to be "straight" off do not put more presure on one side than the
other.  
  when you put a new cable on make sure that ball is smooth and put a
little lube on the inside, if it seizes up then it flexes the cable at the
end of the fitting and it will break off at that point


if you find an easier way let me know.
