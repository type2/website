Subject: Re: [T2] Rap on distributors

Ric,

Changes in ignition accompanied changes in carburetion and 
displacement. With the 1600cc motor in early bays (1968 to 1971) the 
carb changed several times to conform to emission standards that were 
developing after being put in place in the US in 1968. The 
distributor changed as well. For instance, in the 1972 model year the 
dizzy had introduced vacuum retard. This allowed the heads to operate 
at a slightly higher temperature at idle and allowing for a more 
complete burn in the combustion chamber thus lowering emissions. What 
is correct for the model year on specs of the engine is not 
necessarily the what provides the best ( most effective ) performance.

You have a 1600cc SP/doghouse motor which was is not a factory 
offered configuration but still a popular choice for rebuilds. I have 
the same motor myself. Currently I am running a 009 and it is ok but 
I am going to clean up and install a vac dizzy that came with my old 
1969 passenger bus with single port motor. The dizzy is correct for 
the model year but also provides an advance curve (and starting 
point) that I prefer to the 009.

As you said no one seems to know the answer because there is not a 
single correct answer. You must make a choice based on your own good 
judgement.

Thanks
