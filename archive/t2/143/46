Hi Volks,

Just got off the phone with Dave Ireland, they had some trouble after
getting the engine down when they had to take off the pressure plate to get
at the hole, which required a special torx wrench that someone from AAA
delivered. Since it was 9PM when they got the plate off Dave and his Dad
stayed overnight with the Maintenance worker from the park and today they
will be tapping the hole and putting a bolt in so they can get home.

Dave Wolfganger from the AIRS list has also offered to help, but it looks
like the Park Staff have come through big-time.

BTW, Hills Creek State Park is near Wellsborough PA and is quite nice.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
