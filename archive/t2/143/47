Weber used to offer a direct replacement carb for VW 1600SP engines.  Unfortunately it's been NLA for several years.

This was an excellent carb that didn't require any fiddling or adapting to install.  I found it to be much easier to adjust/tune, it was well made and durable, and provided improvements in performance and fuel mileage.  Overall a clearly superior unit.   

If I'd known it was going out of production I would have bought a bunch to stash for future use.
