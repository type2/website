Not exactly...Most of those Webers were original to
small (1600 - 2000 CC) four cylinder engines. Some
Fiats (I think the "Agua" choke...) as well as some
LBC's (Little British Cars) had 'em stock or as per-
formance upgrades. The Weber was the choice of
many small manufacturers because of its versa-
tility - albeit in the hands of a skillful tuner. Un-
less you were GM or Ford, and could have a carb
"built" to your specs (and order however many
thousands), the Weber was (and is) an obvious
choice. Thousands of pro/am racers swear by
Webers even today.
