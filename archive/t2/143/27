Troy, (and the rest of you, too :-),

Glad to find out who bus #3 was! :-)  And that's "Steve"...  "Mr. Dolan"
is may father (I *know* I am getting old, I feel it every day... I just
*HATE* it! :-)

On replacing injector seals and injector fuel hoses:

I was lax in not wiggling the injectors on your bus.  I should have done
that as those seals are often the cause of a vacuum leak.

There are a couple important notes on replacing the seals.  Most
importantly, injectors are very touchy as to position and alignment. The
clamps that are supposed to hold the injectors in place are a marginal
design at best.  If the injector does not naturally line up square with
the hole in the runner, you are going to get a vacuum leak.  You CANNOT
use the clamps to pull the injector square against any twist in the hose
at all.  you have to lay the fuel rail with injectors attached in place
and make sure that the injectors more or less drop into their holes
square.  If they don't, the fuel rail tubing is very soft and can be
manipulated a bit to make them do so.  Also check that the ends of the
rail line up at the cold start, pressure regulator, and tin junctions.
With all the connector hoses off, the ends ought to lie in line and square
to each other or they will twist the injectors in their bores and you will
have vacuum leak problems down the road.

The short stub hoses from the fuel rail to the injector are DEFINIELY
replacable and ought to be replaced!!!  I have (with Sean Bartnik as a
witness) had one of these fail and it makes a right mess in the engine
compartment even if you don't burn the bus to the ground!

The original stub hoses, as Dave Wolfanger said, are connected to the
injector with a crimp collar.  His idea of cutting the collar off is
excellent and probably the correct way to go, but I have always just
sliced the hose with an X-acto knife or utility knife, after which the
collar falls off.  His way is better, as you don't risk cutting into the
plastic barb. Use clamps at both ends of the new hose.

Finally, there are places that will tune your old injectors, as Beth
Mathis posted.  I like this as an idea very very much.  The price she
quoted ($25) is only a little less than new ($38 from Dave Bolen's
source), but I think that is immaterial. I think I would prefer tuned used
to new.  The spray pattern on injectors is critical and a known good,
tested, tuned injector ought to last just as long as a new one with
slightly better surety that the pattern is right and that no one dropped
it on its nose in the store and is selling it anyway.
