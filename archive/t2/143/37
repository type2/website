      After ensuring you have the valves closed if you still don't have =
clearance=20
check to see if that valve seat has sunk into the head causing your =
valve to tighten.=20
This is what happened to me on the way to Everybus. It was running good =
heading south but started to miss as I approached Jeff Stewart's in =
northern Va.
The next morning I checked the lash and found #3 exhaust tight. I had to =
back the adjuster screw all the way out to get any clearance. I decided =
to stay with the gruop and made it to Ebus. Steve Dolan confirmed the =
prob and I was able to make it home again.(southern Ontario, 850 miles). =
The bus is in the garage and I'm about ready to drop the motor and tear =
it apart. My heater boxes are shot so will replace them as well. Anyone =
get boxes from Bus Depot before. They have German lefts and Danish =
Rights. I'll be calling them today.=20
     Great to see everyone at Everybus!


Take care

     On a side note, I parked the Bus in a different spot when I got =
home and yesterday as my wife was leaving for work she side swiped the =
bus!
Caused more damage to her 97 Carav*n than my bus! Her's is at the body =
shop and the bus is now in my garage! Arhhhhhh!
