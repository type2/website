Tomorrow I am leaving for the Pier show and VWs over the bridge in St
Pete/Tampa this weekend,
 Any one else here going ?
 I will be leaving from Charlotte NC , Taking the Passat, dang.  I will be
staying for about a week and driving my mother-in-laws 66 squareback home. I
hope to see some folks there.
