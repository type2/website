Subject: Westfakia parts?

Hello all,
	Well after spending the last year conviencing myself that not
having a camper was just A OK, those feelings got dashed at everybus
:)

	Now not only do I really want to find a trashed Westy now the wife
actually agrees. I have had 2-3 wrecked enginless westys in various
conditions fall through in the past half year. Does anyone have any
lead on where one might be found. I want to convert mine to somewhat
of a custom camper, but really don't want to trash a good westy.
Looking for something where most of the interior is there & the
pop-top is there as well. any leads appreciated. I live in Dickson, TN
so I'm looking for something somewhat close (not farther than EveryBus
which was about 12 hours). TIA & Thanks everyone who made me and my
families everybus experience one of the best vacations I have EVER
taken.
