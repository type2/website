Subject: Re: [T2] Removing cat from exhaust system...

Hi Folks,

I just recently had a nasty surprise related to catalytic converters removed 
from Buses.  I took my Bus in for an emissions test, and it failed, not 
because of bad smog numbers, but because of a lack of required equipment.  
Basically, if the Bus came with one, the emissions folks WILL NOT pass the 
Bus if it doesn't have one, even if the smog numbers are okay.  It is 
apparently a violation of federal law to remove a catalytic converter from a 
car, and the emissions testers are required to check if a car has a cat or 
not.  If it doesn't have one, your car is lacking the required equipment, 
and is in violation of basic environmental regulations.

If your area doesn't require emissions tests, you're lucky, and can probably 
get away without a cat.  However, if the Bus moves to a different region, 
plan on spending the $150-250 for a new cat and plan on making your existing 
exhaust work with it.  If the exhaust won't accept a cat, plan on another 
$200+ for the correct one.

Good luck!  As always, your mileage may vary...
