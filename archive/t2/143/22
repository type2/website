Subject: RE: <FMBC> Question replacing injector seals....

Ok, before I go any further, let me ask the same question I have asked
everyone else recently on the list.  "Which guy are you again?"  lol  I
met so many damn people this weekend that I can't keep up.  No offense
of course.  I did get the seals changed for two injectors, and replaced
all the fuel lines on that side, except the one going through the
firewall. (It was 12am.)  It idles much better now.  Cant wait to do the
other side.  So, only having three sets of seals, I called Joe at Busted
Bus and ordered another set to complete the other side.  I also ordered
7mm fuel line and enough clamps to replace all of the exsisting ones.
Question though, on the short fuel line going to the injector, there is
not a clamp around the fuel line at the injector side.  There was a
flange looking thing that the fuel line had been pressed into.  May I
had that this was a b*#tch to get the old fuel line out of!!  What
should be done here when replacing that short piece? Oh, also got a new
rubber engine seal to replace around the tin.

Thanks

I would replace all of the fuel line, as previously mentioned by ??????

I wouldn't see any need in replacing the injectors.  As long as the
mechanism in them is opening and closing, you're ok.  (which seemed to
be
the case, when I suggested we switched the wiring, back in Lindsey)
It's
a real simple thing, really.  The only suggestion I'll give for the
injectors is to dip the "in the head" side into a small glass jar full
of
injector cleaner for a few hours, or so.  I say GLASS, so that it won't
eat through.  (you've probably got some baby food jars lying around)
New
injectors SHOULD come with at least the short piece of line, before the
fuel rails (considering the steep angle that one must bend, in order to
take the shaft that is required for such a pricey item), but THEY WILL
NOT
come with any hose.

As far as a more durable piece of fuel line... you will find none.  The
common (non metric...argghhh!!!!) fuel hose found at the local auto
parts
stores will be better material than what was originally on there, simple
because of manufacturing advances and chemical resistency.  However,
think
about it:  the stuff that was on there has lasted for about 25 years! 
That's not bad, in car speak.

Don't worry about getting too anal with it... we're not talking about a
drag motor... just a reliable buser w/ the gumption to get you where
you're going and back home.

The B I G thing to remember is to CLAMP YOUR FUEL LINES.  At every
point... yes, even that one.  I don't care if it costs $30 or more to
do,
it's worth every damn penny, and it can SAVE YOUR LIFE!!
