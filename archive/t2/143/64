I would leave it on and consider myself lucky.  The catalytic converter 
will keep you from smelling those nasty exhaust smells that sometimes waft 
into your bus at stoplights with the windows down.  It will also quiet the 
engine down a little more.  I would love to put one on my bus and would if 
there was an easy way to do it.  If you want a couple of extra horsepower, 
I'd recommend getting it some other way.
