Subject: Speedi-Bleed adaptor for 1970 bus?

I have a speedi-bleed brake bleeder kit:
http://www.vq-speedi.com/euro.html

The adaptor does not fit the upper reservoir cover in my 1970 bus.
Is anyone aware of an adaptor for this purpose?

Otherwise, my wife will have to sit in the van and push the brake pedal up and down again....

Thanks,
