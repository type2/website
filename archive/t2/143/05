Uh
You don't have to disconnect the driveline (unless it's an automatic!)
Just put the towed Bus tranny in neutral and let her roll (assuming you
check first to make sure there is actually gear oil in the transmission).

I towed my '79 from the Washington DC area to western Massachusetts (about 8
hours) behind a U-Haul truck on a U-Haul 2-wheel tow dolly.  I had the Bus
rear wheels on the ground and was cruising at highway speeds the whole time.
No problem.  Did not disconnect the driveshafts.

The manual transmission will be lubricated as the gears inside turn through
the gear oil.  You can't do this with an automatic because the automatic has
a hydraulic pump that isn't running if the engine is off, and therefore the
transmission wouldn't be properly lubricated rolling along in neutral with
the engine off.
