You might do the valves again, and double check that you have rotated the
engine to the right TDC for #2. I did an adjustment once where I forgot to
rotate the engine. Experienced the same inability to get clearance, and
could not get the feeler gauge in there, even with it adjusted all the way
out.  Finally went "Duh!" and rotated the enigne. Then the valve was way
out, and I had to screw it way back in. Sometimes the most obvious things 
slip buy.
