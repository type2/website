Subject: RE: [T2] .009, There MUST be some advantages

Here are my experiences with an 009 on an otherwise stock 2L FI 78 camper
vs an OEM SVDA distributor. The 009 seemed to work fine, definetely had the
lag off the line and then it kicked in, kind of like the turbo lag on my
Golf TDI (turbo diesel). I do mostly highway driving so it worked out just
fine for me. My mechanic said when he put it in that it was the cheapest
solution he had, had trouble finding the OEM dizzies, and with the 2L I had
enough torque to get past the lag. I changed to the stock dizzy recently
and the camper is much smoother off the line. It doesn't feel like any more
power, but maybe because there is no stumble and then push, instead just
steady push.

One place it made a big difference is in tire selection. Last year I bought
Goodyear 205/75R14s, hwy rib. What a terrible combination! Since the tire
was larger then stock (one of my goals) it exagerated the lag since the
gearing was altered slightly. The tire tread also sucked on wet
grass/dirt/mud so having the combination of not being able to start at low
throttle with hwy tread made for some near stuck situations. I went back to
a stock size and the big tires went on my 78 passenger bus.

This spring I bought Dunlop Radial Rover 27/8.5-14 (load range C) as the
best compromise for me of tread, size and thought I was going to have noisy
tires but good traction. I had already changed the dizzy to stock and
thought it would be easier to deal with an oversize tire. I was right, the
oversize tire is unnoticeable in normal driving, the tread is very
aggresive, and it's not loud on the highway, or at least not louder then
the bus on the highway :-) The tread blocks are big and aggresive, but they
are siped which apparently quiets them down.

Through this change of distributors, the only advantage I noticed for the
009 is the perception of more power when your past the lag. Maybe that is
why people like them, they swap out their old SVDA when what it needs is a
tuneup, put in a fresh 009 with fresh points and are impressed with the
"power they feel", especially as they get past the stumble and get the full
advance.

PS: the tire cast is
Contintental Contact CR-21 185R14 (C load stock size 25.6" diam)
Goodyear Marathons 205/75-14 (C load stock size 26.1" diam)
Dunlop Radial Rover RV  27/8.5-14 (C load stock size 26.5" diam)
