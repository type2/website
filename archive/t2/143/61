Subject: Berg dipstick temp gauge

I have the Berg dipstick temp gauge in my '78 2.0L.  My only complaint with 
it is that the cord that plugs into the temperature sender is not long 
enough to pull the dipstick out of the tube while it's plugged in.  To 
remove the dipstick temp gauge, you have to unplug the wire first.

Should be an easy fix with a wire and some crimp-on connectors, but still a 
PITA to have to do that.

By the way, has anyone with the Berg temp dipstick marked it for oil level?  
Would you just line up the stock dipstick beside the Berg dipstick and make 
the marks?  I keep my stock dipstick in the van to check oil levels and 
would like to be able to use the Berg one if possible.
