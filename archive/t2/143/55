Hello all,
            Most know that I have a 78 Bay with a type IV engine.  Some
may have noticed at EB that I have a Cali spec engine.  Meaning that I
have a catalytic converter.  When I was in California, of course I had
no option but to leave it on.  Now that I am in NC and emissions are not
a problem, I was wondering if I would be able to remove the cat without
causing any problems with the engine.  I am hoping that I may get a
little more horse power from doing this.  Or, should I leave it on as
this is how it the engine was meant to be used?  Thanks
