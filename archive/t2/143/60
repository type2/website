Subject: Swing Lever Bushing Lifespan - (Tap, Tap - Is This Thing On???)

	OK, Amigos en List-Landia...

	Other than Mike Benthin (bless his heart), the responses to my post
have been completely underwhelming - did I say something wrong?  To
reiterate, it would appear that the swing lever bushing kit installed in my
'72 Westy Weekender has given it up after approximately 41K miles in place.
I grease the front end probably 2-3X as often as recommended (too many years
of Type3 pilotage, with trailing arm bushings as NLA parts) - to paraphase
George Lyle's comments in the Library article: "...grease is cheap, front
end repairs are not...".

	I know that some of you long term Bay Pilots, somewhere, have
replaced the swing lever bushings, AND have SOMETHING to report on their
lifespan.  Can you do that for a fellow bus-drivin' fool?

	[Donning asbestos(!) flame chonies] And since everyone else wants to
get into this p*ss for distance contest - 009s are pieces of junk
(ESPECIALLY on T4s) - I too was brain-washed by St. Muir's long ago and far
away rantings about the joys of mechanical dizzies as a high-schooler in the
very early 70s.  If you have to run a mech dizzy on a T4, at least get an
050.  After reading up some on things posted to various 914 lists, I plopped
the stock '72 dual vacuum bus dizzy on my '73 1.7L w/36 DRLAs to test out
the theory - it had a German 009 on it.  Night and Day.  The next junk yard
run yielded up a '74 914 1.8L dizzy for the 914, and the Weekender now
sports a '75 914 1.8L dizzy w/the '72 bus vacuum can grafted on to it for
improved vacuum response from the 40 DRLAs.  The girlfriend's '73 w/'78 2.0L
came equipped with the infamous Weber progressive an' 009 combo - it's now
got a set of 36 DRLAs and an OE '73 dizzy - all of 'em running CDI boxes
from aircooled.net, and all of them running compufire points replacement
thingies.  If anybody wants a near new Weber progressive an' 009 dizzy for
their T4 motors, I have one cheap, but I'm not shipping it anywhere.  It's
your funeral.  I think her cats are probably done playing with them now...

	That's all for now - see y'all at The Classic, and don't forget -
