Recently I purchased a rebuilt type 1 dual port motor for my 69 bus.  In =
doing research, and speaking with many owners, I chose to buy my engine f=
rom Bob Donalds at Boston Engine. I got a 1600 long block with flywheel i=
nstalled, new clutch, hardware, plugs, and a 009 distributor. I have actu=
ally known Bob for quite some time, as he built a 2.0 for my friend which=
 carried us to the west coast.  He is very particular about warranties, a=
nd comebacks.  He required me to have all of my tin before I was able to =
get any warranty.  He would not even take my core. He did not know who ha=
d done the previous rebuild, and did not want to chance using that case. =
 I was informed by him that the 009 is a good distributor, as long as it =
is set up correctly. IE: rivet through the throttle plate, and different =
timing. He has this info on his web site in the technical articles.  I tr=
ied this on a 70 camper, and it worked pretty nice, I must say. For a man=
 who is so particular about what parts you use, before giving you a warra=
nty, and does not get come backs, he may just have something. BTW, my eng=
ine has a full warranty, and that's with the 009.
