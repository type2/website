Subject: Servicing Auto Tranny

Hello all,

I've come to the conclusion that my poor shifting has
something to do with a bus that sat for 6 years,
producing likely yucky fluid and possibly a clogged
tranny filter.  Is there anyone who has done this
service recently and can comment on the complexities
of it.  I am certain that the pan has to come off,
other than that, I do not know what to do next or what
to buy.  I have Bentley, Muir, Haynes, Chilton, and
Clymer.  I just don'y know which one to use for this
task!  The bus is a 78 3 speed automatic passenger
soon to be Westfakia.

Thanks and Kindest Regards,

Mark
Christiansburg, VA
