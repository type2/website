And this company (Ford) spent alot of money on engineering the new 
T-bird only to cancel it... Spent a bunch of money on the new 500 and 
SUV equvalent (and cancelling the SUV I read a while back). Is going to 
to cancel their RWD platform (and thus the Town Car) soon when they are 
the only fleet RWD platform at this time... All wise choices I'm sure 
<NOT!>

Of course GM sold their profitable GMAC div.

Sort of looks like they are both TRYING to fail. Let's see they could 
then move to China 100% and ditch pensions and healthcare plans...
