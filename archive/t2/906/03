They sent us two letters:

One was from the PBGC (a taxpayer funded insurer
of "bankrupt" corporations - Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation) saying they'd love to help, but they're
500 Billion in the hole at the moment... ;-(

The other was from the Human Resources Dept. at
the American Association of Anvil Producers saying 
that Wal-Mart (the seventh largest "country" trading
with China) was hiring part time... ;-(

                   GM plant in Mexico... ;-)
