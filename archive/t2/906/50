	In my city I'm acquainted with a small-time entrepreneur, 
Mike, who gets one Chinese factory to do that  -  but you can leave 
out the 'most of'.  The originals are Jap light motorcycles, 
definitely not worth copying; the copies are called a different 
brand, but the Chinese just copy whatever he orders.  Yes, the copies 
are CHEAPER than the originals.

	In China, as late as early 1990, I saw police ('Gong An') 
riding copies of the BMW *side-valve* which BMW themselves abandoned 
decades earlier.
	The Ural is a later BMW copy, but still only mediocre 
quality.  I'm pretty sure they've got as far as OHV  ...

	pathetic, isn't it


>  :-)

	I'd dispute that comment, preferring something more like :-(((


>   On the other hand you can pay the UAW and the big three management

	A comment that would come naturally in my circles would be
			f*ck the times
	but please don't take offence  -  I just think that comment 
expresses the right attitude to mindless modernism.


>  (but not as far as a vintage beetle).

	or, even more to the point, a 'vintage' bus.
	As I've said before, I believe there's a fully workable 
market for a kombi with a few modernisations (mostly in the ignition 
& fuel systems).  It might well be made in Brazil if quality control 
could be made OK.


W.A.S.T.E.  chimed in:
	> The Royal Enfield, one of the oldest bike companies in the 
world, is still being built in India... ;-(

	This (model name Bullet  -  most 350cc but I think there's 
also a 500cc) is something like what I advocate, e.g the ignition 
system is reasonably modern.  Picking a fight again, my comment on 
this would be opposite to Tony's viz.  :-)
	The detailed reasoning behind my advocacy goes back thru 
maintainability  -  a criterion not merely ignored but actively hated 
by the last decade or so of designers in Japan, Europe, the USA, etc.
