Hi Terry,

One of the Canadian motorcycle magazines reviewed the modern Royal  
Enfield a few years back. They were APALLED at the lack of quality  
that the Indian factory allowed through QA.

Apparently the local importer has to import 3 bikes for every 2 he  
intends to sell as roadworthy, and he also has to personally train  
his customers on the rigorous maintenance required to keep them on  
the road.

These things make an old VW look like a modern BMW in comparison.


Happy trails,
