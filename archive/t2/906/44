Yes you should be able to do that. Keep in mind where
the shoes are  so you can go in where they aren't.
You'll have to go through a double thickness with the
dust guard around the outside. Keep the hole as small
as possible and be sure to cover it adequately - some
RTV silicone will work for that.

This certainly isn't a proper approach, but I can't
think of a reason it won't work. There isn't a concern
of weakening any structure that supports anything
critical, so why not? Maybe someone else will think of
a reason not to. -BaH
