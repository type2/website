Subject: Re: [T2] Intake boot to oil breather hose

Heater hose is not an acceptable replacement because it collapses under
vacuum. I got my hose at bus boys.

Ratwell says this guys is NLA.  Last night as I was putting the firewall
back on and reattaching all the hoses the intake boot to oil breather hose
fell apart.  I was able to find some 19mm internal diameter heater hose at
my FLAPS.  Is this an acceptable replacement?  Are there better
alternatives?
