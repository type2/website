Glad someone mentioned the parking brake- I did in the past tighten the 
clamp up front to give OK PB use, and perhaps backing this off will give 
enough slack.  Wounder if could go through a created backing plate hole 
and scraping the rust edge left on the drum lip?  Or using a dremyhl 
carbide small bit through the hole........
