I think I'd rather spend $10K to restore a Beetle with updates and a 
Raby motor than buy a new Chinese car. Look around on the 'net. There 
are pics of several Chinese vehicles that look quite like they bought a 
competitor's car, took it apart and reproduced most of the parts... 
Except that they seem to fair badly in crash tests. Also see the Russian 
Ural motorcycle... They did the same thing right before WWII. Still 
building them, and you can buy them here. I would had I the budget for a 
toy like that.

The race to the bottom of the economic ladder is what we are doing... 
Always shopping for the lowest prices... :-)  On the other hand you can 
pay the UAW and the big three management for cars that are still behind 
the times (but not as far as a vintage beetle).
