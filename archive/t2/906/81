Subject: replacing windows and question

I believe I am going to exchange the windows from my
78' to my 74' westie.  All in perfect shape (glass) and
are all tinted really nice.

Everything is interchangable right? I am going to leave the
middle vent windows where they are though.
How easy is it to pop them out? (More a question for the
rear hatch glass and the rear sides.)

On another note I have a real dilemna. I want to support the
local VW shop here but there is now a silly history.  In the
past I got fed up and mad at the way I was always the one
waiting for work to be down. I felt I was a paying customer
yet someone who walked in the door got handled before me.
Problem with being a friend with the guy I guess?
He was using some of my paneling to restore an old bus, was
selling some parts for me. When I asked how things were and
that I would like to settle up I always got put on the back
burner.. it's been going on for over a year in some cases.
I was handling some of his picture taking and internet needs
and finally during some stress at home told him via email I
couldn't handle the backburner status.

Ok nuff history.
So I want to do my glass project and some other things. I would
seriously love to support local shops and really he isn't a bad guy.
He does good work! So how do I get this mess fixed up, buy my
stuff from him. $ wise it won't matter to me where I go.

I don't want him to think I am only going to him cause
I need work done.

You get the picture, Idea's or thoughts on this?
