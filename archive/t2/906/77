You can rotate a screwdriver as far and as hard as needed when it's in your
hand to bring that switch to make contact.
When installed, the key has a limited amount of rotation, so if the switch
is wearing...

Try a new switch ($5) and see what happens.

>I attempted replacement (lock cyl) in the bus. This does in fact appear to
be impossible.

Seconded.

>...removal of the peened on lock mechanism cover. Is this necessary?

No.  I went there first also until I realized I didn't have to.

>Since I have no electrical part available for now

Typical part installed in most 60s, 70s, 80s VW's.  Not hard to come by
cheaply, new or used.

Don't forget to take pictures and writeup for Jim Thompson's website...
