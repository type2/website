Hello,

I had a similiar problem with my old bus. Everything
was in place and I tested every part and found them to
be working properly. I had no vacuum leaks....

It turned out to be something very simple. The signal
wire had come loose from the coil. I reconnected it
and my bus fired up and stayed running on the first
try. Check that connection on the coil. It is the
easiest thing to check.

That was my $0.015 cents worth.
