You just have to consider what parts are used, what are new, and what are
likely to head south at any given moment.

The Guac had recently gotten new (AMC) heads and new rings. The type 4
bottom end is very tough, so not likely to cause a breakdown. With a type 1,
I'd be more worried about the bottom end than the heads. My troubles with
the Guac have so far been related to fuel, ignition, and vacuum. Tough
troubleshooting, but easy fixes.

Monitoring the valve adjustments, even with my hydraulics, is important.
I've been setting the valves to 1 1/2 turns past contact when warm, and each
time I check they're still 1 1/2 turns in. Now that I've done that several
times since getting the Guac, and made two trips to CA and back, I'm
confident enough to *gasp* skip checking them at every oil change, instead
doing it every other change.

So, knowing what you're working with and keeping an eye on things is all it
really takes to have the confidence to take long trips and use the bus as a
daily driver. The Guac is reliable and solid. I'd trust it more than any
other vehicle I could buy FOR THE SAME MONEY.
