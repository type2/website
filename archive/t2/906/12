Subject: Yet another Roadtrip!

Well, I just got home about 2 hours ago from spending a month with my sick
mom in California.

Trip was really rather uneventful. After resolving the ignition and vacuum
leak issues prior to leaving, the only mechanical concern is the fuel
pressure regulator. The vacuum side is leaking. But it doesn't seem to be
leaking fuel, and since the vacuum's only function is to further reduce
pressure at the rail during decel, I let it go. At $90 from Bus Depot or $60
from Napa, it'll have to wait. The gas for this trip killed me (over $1500
between driving each way and the monster commute I was doing while I was out
there!) so a press regulator isn't in the stars...

Drove 80mph most of the way again. The Guac handled it with aplomb. 80mph
equates to a bit under 4000rpm, so as long as I'm on level ground, it feels
ok. I've been counting turns on the valves at each oil change I've done
since I go the Guac, and except for the first couple times (after the top
end refresh) they've stayed right at 1 1/2 turns past contact which is where
I've been setting them.

Over the entire trip I only used 1 quart of oil! WooHoo! Troy's ring job is
doing the trick.

I saw 2 overturned vehicles during the drive back. One in CA on I-15, one in
Utah on I-70. Scary.

Oh, there was one "almost" issue: At around midnight on Friday night, a Utah
state patrol/highway patrol (whatever they call 'em there) was behind me and
decided to be sneaky. He turned off his lights! I happened to be looking in
my mirror when he did it. LoL.
