The ongoing saga of installing A/C in my '72 Bus with a Vanagon CV engine installed.

The compressor is finally mounted and correctly spaced for the belt.  The proper belt has finally been found.  Pictures will be up later today.

On the original York installation, VW had a brace from the middle of the fan housing to the compressor top side.  With a Sanden used as a replacement, does anyone feel that this cross brace part is necessary?
