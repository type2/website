Subject: Man, Bus doesn't run again...

Ok, so the Bus is almost done. I hop in it to start it up, and the Bus
starts... although, it quickly stalls out because the choke on the Webber
Progressive hasn't been set up right. So... I try to start it again, and the
only thing I hear is the fuel pump (Purolator 4 PSI pump). Not even the
slightest sound from the starter.

I took the key out, tried it again, and even tried charging the battery, not
the slightest sound.

What could have happened?


Thanks!

Todd
