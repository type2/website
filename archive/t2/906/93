Someone stuck a kitchen sieve over your air intake!

Last year I rebuilt the engine of a guy's car, it had sucked about 3 feet of
duct tape into the fan blades (upright engine) and overheated. Not sure
where the duct tape came from, but it was there in the fan and obviously the
reason why the engine overheated and failed.
