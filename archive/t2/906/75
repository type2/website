It wasn't that long ago when both Ford and GM were the largest
employers in America...The gold standard of manufacturing, of-
fering a good, living wage, a pension   and health care...Ford and
GM workers could afford to buy both houses and cars... ;-)
The largest employer in America today is Wal-Mart with an av-
erage wage of $18,000 and not much else...At those wages,
you're sharing an apartment and takin' the bus (and not a VW...;-(

The heyday of both was the 50's and into the '60's...When both
Ford and GM (and to a lesser extent Chrysler) were the only game
in town...Yearly styling changes introduced the idea of planned
obsolescence in looks but not engineering...;-(
