Hi AJ,

YES.

One of my College professors was a road rally enthusiast that owned a  
couple of Fiat 124s and two Ladas. The copies were made of inferior  
steel and the wiring harness on the LADA would have even made Lucas  
cower in fear. On the road the Lada had a completely different  
character than the 124.

Happy trails,
