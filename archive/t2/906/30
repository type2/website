Hi Folks,

I've been away for something like, 7-8 years, so hello to all the old-timers!
Anyway, I got a
phone call from out of the blue from an old friend (hey Charley!) and the next
week I found
myself driving past an old bus friends shop (hey Ted!) and then last week my
wife starting
talking about how much she missed camping in a Westy. Well, I can take a hint
after 3 hits to
the head... Sooooooo, I'm in the market for a Westy that will sleep 4. Where
does one look
them these days? I'm in SW Ohio, but don't mind shipping for the right one...

Thanks!

Tony
