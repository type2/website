Subject: BN2 - Make go

When I repaired lawnmowers for a living (late 60s), I would get a 
lawnmower with a tag on the handle and all it would say was "Make go."

It's been a couple of years since I did anything with the free BN2 that 
I got.  I bought another (newer model apparently) BN2 from a list 
member and they have both been sitting in the garage waiting for me to 
get a round tuit.

Today was the day.  The fuel pump on the free one was broken.  The 
fan/motor/impeller assembly on the one I bought for $35 was broken (the 
impeller seemed to have disintegrated).

I took both of them apart and put them back together and I made it go!  
Clouds of smoke billowed out the exhaust when it first started up, but 
since I've run it through a few cycles, it seems to perform flawlessly.

Now to install it in my bus...
