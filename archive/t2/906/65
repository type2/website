Got money? Jag may be on the block again...Ford can't make
(according to them) a profit on them...Ford sold 84,000 Jags
last year, but the production was projected to be 200,000...
Ford is "considering" moving some Jag production to America,
but I doubt that would help...Despite having more Jag-U-ar
styling cues than the originals, buyers seem uninterested in
Ford-U-ars based on Mondeo and Lincoln mechanicals with
Leaper hood ornaments...
I read quite a bit of auto history (not just the puff picture
books...) and Jag's appeal was mostly based on looks...The
mechanicals always looked good on paper, but required too
much maintenance (Jag, like others, often underbuilt the
stuff that keeps 'em runnin' just to save weight/money)
The Jags that the public bought were nothing like the
racers or even the cars the company "tweaked" for road
tests... ;-(
Just for fun, Google up the e-type's rear suspension...
inboard brakes and all... ;-(
OTOH-2
I've driven a few e-types over the years, and if I could
afford a ride behind mechanic with a full spares kit, I'd
love to own one..."The best crumpet-catcher ever built"... ;-)
