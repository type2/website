Subject: ign switch continued

Ok I was able to remove the electrical portion on the switch without
removing the steering wheel etc. That looks hard especially as I have no
puller. Anyway, the switch seems fine. I can start the bus just fine (no
jugging) with a screwdriver in the electrical switch. Does this mean any
thing, or does the consensus continue to be that this is the bad part.

The Bentley is less than helpful.

Since I already had a key mechanism on hand (bought it a few months ago) I
attempted replacement in the bus. This does in fact appear to be impossible.

This site:

Shows the removal of the peened on lock mechanism cover. Is this necessary?

Since I have no electrical part available for now, I'm going to just put it
back the way it was for now and hot wire it in the engine compartment.
