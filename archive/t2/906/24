A brief history of Malcolm Bricklin enterprises:

Imports Subaru 360's, a micro car with a motor-
cycle engine that Consumer Reports calls "the
most dangerous car sold in America"...

The famous gullwing "Bricklin"...After getting
Canadian financing, a few are built but many
quality problems finally sink it...

After Fiat decides to stop selling cars in America,
Bricklin imports X1/9's under the "Bertone" badge
and the Spyder as a "Pininfarina"...

The infamous Yugo is imported and sold in America.
Based on a Fiat, but built in Yugoslavia for lower
labor costs, the Yugo lacked even Fiat's quality
control...
Bricklin is/maybe trying to bring the Yugo back as the
ZMW - Zastava Motor Works. BMW is not amused...

The Chery is a local car company (to China...)
Bricklin is currently attempting to bring them to
America...Chevy is not amused...
