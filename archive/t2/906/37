Hi Chris,

IIRC the Ural *is actually made from the original BMW tooling taken  
from Germany after WW2.

It's a great air-cooled design that has stood the test of time.  
They're near bulletproof with minimal maintenance. Unfortunately the  
tooling is now 60 years old, so the quality may not be what is used  
to...


Happy trails,
