This may seem harsh - Okay - if you don't want to make
the either/or commitment to use whatever resources you
can to get the drum off and fix the problem NOW with
the chance that you may not be able to drive it for a
few days while repairing / replacing parts... Just
keep driving until the brakes will barely stop or slow
the bus, then the shoes will likely be worn down
enough to clear the ridge.

If you have that much corrosion problem - are you sure
your parking brake mechanism is fully released?

Years ago I pulled my badly rusted adjusters out and
cleaned them on a wire brush wheel until shiny. I
coated all the surfaces with anti seize compound and
screwed them in and out by hand over and over until I
was confidant they would work smoothly. Clean off
excess lubricant. Discard parts that you cannot make
work smoothly. The anti-seize compound really works
well. -BaH
