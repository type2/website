There are often posts from Melissa and Jerry regarding good, rust-free  busses in Aridzona.  I'd recommend watching for those and pricing  a one-way ticket to Phoenix.  There are lots of them out there and  the prices seem quite reasonable.  I've seen some that make me  drool.  Good luck....KR

So, from a bit of research, it seems a 78-79 Westy is our best choice. Any
older models
have the above?

I've looked thru thesamba.com (thanks for the tip!) and eBay. What do you
folks think I
should expect to pay for something in good, usable and mechanical sound
condition?
