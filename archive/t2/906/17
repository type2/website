<< So I bought an Actron combo unit, called an "engine analyzer", from
Pep Boys for $50. Has tach, dwell, and multimeter all in one.>>

What you missed Don was the sale Pep Boys had 2 months ago on all of the
above mentioned, BUT--included, a TV, VCR, DVD, Boom Box, Emergency
Flashlight, Tire inflator, Refrigerator, Ice maker, and food processor
all wrapped up in one convenient portable package for $42.99.

It was an Acrton Super Deluxe Home on the Highway Entertainment &
Emergency unit---

You missed out on this super deal Don .
