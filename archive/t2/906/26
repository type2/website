The closest to what I have (and recommend) I found at
Summit Racing for about $10 a pair. (Mine came from
Tool Town in Federal Way, WA) Here's the link to
Summit:

or - here are part #s:  SUM-W84018 and/or  SUM-W84017
The #18 is probably the one to get.

I also used a set of long-nosed vice grips that I put
heat-shrink tubing over the jaws to protect the hoses,
but they're awfully heavy. -BaH
