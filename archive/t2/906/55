It was a great design, and the Urals are pretty good for a Soviet-era
product.  However, moving the Ural tooling to China (as the Chang Jiang)
apparently didn't do quality control any good.   the Chinese Chang Jiangs
are abysmal.  Folks have bought them brand new in the US and had a hard
time making 100 miles between major breakdowns.

Still, you could buy one with sidecar for about $3K.
