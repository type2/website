Hi to all,

the above link will show you the Lada automobile. These have been made in Russia for years. Compare one to a Fiat 124 sedan and you will see that it is not only motorcycles that they have been copying. As far as quality goes, can the qc of the copy be worse than original? 

 Some may gripe about older low tech vehicles breaking down quite often, it is true they need more TLC than a modern vehicle. That said however, the problems can often be fixed at the side of the road without the aide of computer diaognostics. We could all drive new, modern, oiltight, reliable and totally bland vehicles, but what fun would that be?
