Subject: Re: [T2] Speaking of fuel pumps....

I've had good luck using a pair of Kelly clamps or Kelly foreceps as fuel 
line clamps.
They are stainless steel, don't rust and are usually found at swap meets 
where some
guy will have a bunch of them in a pile for $3 or 2 for $5, sometimes even 
cheaper.
They come in many sizes for many uses in a hospital or ambulance setting.   
If you 
know a  R.N. they probably have a bunch at home.  They are so handy for 
clamping IV
tubing, chest tubes, etc. that rare is the nurse that doesn't start their 
shift without
one in there pocket.   They are strong, too, and won't be coming loose.   
Very light
weight also.    You can find them at nurse uniform shops.  Try Google for a 
ton of sources.      Also some head shops that carry bongs and other smoking 
paraphenalia
carry them.  It seems they excel at holding the short J (I've been told) so 
you might ask an old hippy where he bought his.....................
