The AFM is just the switch. You should check the output from the relay at 88d and the voltage from the battery at 88y and 88z:

85 - Ground
86 - Thermo time switch and ECU pin 4
86a - Starter
86b - AFM harness connector #36

88b - Series resistors and ECU pin 10
88c - Aux air regulator
88d - Fuel Pump
