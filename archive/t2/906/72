I'd have to add too my admiration for some of the listees that build their
ACVW's with all new parts. My economics are somewhat like yours, and I am
usually building or repairing with used parts, so my confidence in the ride
for the long trips is on a wing and a prayer.

I must disagree. A well maintained ACVW is just as reliable as a modern
