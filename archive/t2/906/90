The trouble is no auto company wants to make modern, oiltight, reliable, and
totally bland and relatively less expensive vehicles...You've got to sell 
hundreds

profit.
Even the Korean companies are having trouble with low priced cars...The labor
costs have risen (a rising standard of living includes rising wages...)
