You need deep well 8mm socket. I have some Taiwanese deep wells for general
work and the socket was a hair too short to reach where the nuts are
buried. I spent about $7.00 on a single socket from the higher end lines
that CarQuest Auto Parts carries (the ones that stay behind the counter)
and it worked fine. The "behind the counter" sockets at most FLAPS should
be similar. Measure with a ruler and check before you buy if in doubt.

Not a clue -- I was working on a '74.
