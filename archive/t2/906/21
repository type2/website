Huh! I guess I only have the one... I - uh - forgot
that I still use 'em myself! I did look to see if I
had saved an extra though!

Here's what you can do: Carry one of those hose clamp
pliers that ratchet and when you know you're coming to
a long hard climb, clamp the return line about halfway
shut! (I will not be held responsible for any
explosions / fires / Crispy Critters, etc. resulting
from replicating this semi-good / easily stoopid
idea!)

(I once forgot to remove a clamp on the return line.
As in, really, totally forgot! Bus was running a bit
rich and I was doing diagnostics and discovered fuel
pressure somewhere above 100psi. Good thing my hoses
were all new.) -BaH
