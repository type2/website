Subject: 8.5 volts at FI fuel pump - what's up??

OK, the '78 2.0  Fuel Injection Westy simply died on me, doing 55 mph and
accelerating slightly

Points good, and replaced.  Good dwell readings both before and after points
replaced [along side of I-95, north of Baltimore, south of White Marsh], and
17 inches of vacuum.  Coil measured and considered within acceptable ohm
ranges. Still, got a new coil from Auto Zone and it looked ugly yellow and
had higher resistance than my installed Bosch, and didn't do any good....

When I first opened the engine compartment, I noticed some 20 psi on my in
line fuel gauge permanently installed on left fuel rail.  Eventually the
gauge went down from 20 psi to zero.


I had a helper watch the fuel gauge when I turned the engine over and it did
not move off zero.

I checked the voltage at the fuel pump and I was reading 8.5 volts while my
partner turned the engine.  I held the fuel pump and I could not feel it
pump at all.


Is it my double relay, my AFM or what....  Full tank of gas just 1.5 miles
back.
