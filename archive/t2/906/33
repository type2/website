Hi Robert,

"Starts-and-dies-right-away" is a typical symptom of a large vacuum  
leak. Double-check EVERY connection and you should find success.

If not that then it might be that the flap in the afm is not engaging  
the fuel pump. To test this, disconnect the AFM from the S-pipe and  
turn the ignition to run, but don't start the bus. Now move the flap  
inside the AFM and listen for the fuel pump. If you don't hear it  
start whirring, you need to remove the cap from the AFM and  
straighten the contact wires that normally power the fuel pump when  
the bus is running.


Happy trails,
