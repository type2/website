You can get one from theBusCo (East of Seattle, WA) for very little.  I
think I paid him $20 including shipping to Lake O.  Don't hold me to
that, tho.  Is it important?  I really don't know.  I figure there's a
lot of heat right there, and it probably heats up that lower tin right
in front of the fan, eventually heating the air getting sucked into it.
 I don't pretend to know why the VW engineers did what they did, but I
doubt they'd put it there for nothing, and I'd swear my bus runs better
with it on.  Unfortunately, I changed a bunch of things when I
installed it, so I don't have proof of that.  It does seem like the oil
doesn't get as hot as it used to, though.

PS - front end update:
completed it today.  Scope of work= replaced upper and lower torsion
arms with bus-boys arms (new ball joints pressed in), EMPI 7/8" sway
bar, new front wheel bearings.  I'll have a webpage with my
step-by-step arm install process in a few days (maybe I'll have the
pictures by then too) that could augment the arm process in the library
since it doesn't really talk about the install part.  Test drive
tomorrow.  Expect alignment shop on Monday.
