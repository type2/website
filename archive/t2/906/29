This is a very good point.  If the corrosion conditions are severe enough to 
make the adjusters non-adjustable, it's likely the handbrake system is only 
minimally functional as well.  It could be the linkage and/or the cables 
corroded inside their sheaths.  IIRC new cables are available at fairly modest 
prices... though installation can be time consuming.
