Richard, what you say is good.  And it makes sense.  I will check these
positions on the double relay.

I imagined the double relay to be a simple yes/no thing.  I get voltage, yes
or no.  I don't know where the difference in 12.5 and 8.5 is getting off to,
and I want to try a workaround.  How about this:

I have a long wire that I will draw from my rear window heater switch on the
dash (remove the existing wire connection) down to the fuel pump.  When I
want the fuel pump to pump, I will pull the switch on.  This should shoot
12.5 volts down to the fuel pump.

I will just add this wire to the existing power/ground connections on the
fuel pump.

Now, this should bring out the naysayers, and hopefully someone to explain
where the other 4 volts suddenly went off to...
