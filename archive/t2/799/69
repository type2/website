I shipped my Ghia from Baltimore to Bremerhaven earlier this year for the
50th birthday of the Karmann Ghia and it cost around $1000 by the time I
paid all the fees at both ends. The paperwork is a pain but these guys
ship cars and household goods for the armed services all the time so
they've got the process about as streamlined as it can be.

 What would be the best (cheapest) way of shipping a bus to Europe?
