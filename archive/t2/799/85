Subject: electric fuel pumps

Hi Guys and Gals.  My '76 Westy with a 1700
single-weber carb motor with, yes, an 009 has purred
like a cat for the last year or so.  I repalced the
fuel pump last November.  The old one wasn't bad but
some kind of fluke with the electrical caused it not
to work just long enough that I went and bought
another.  Installed it (a $35 Cardone from Oreilly's),
adjusted the carb and wham...it ran better than it has
in the 6 years I've owned it.

Checked the old pump (Puralator) on a battery...still
worked fine.

Last night I'm rolling down the freeway on the way to
Monday Night Big Band.  Engine dies.  Pull off, into
the Knight Inn/Dino's where I used to play every
weekend, the Cardone is dead city.  Banged on it with
a hammer, checked the wiring, noghting, nada.  So I
put the Puralator back on and it works fine.  But, the
engine dies on the off ramp and at traffic lights. 
Idling too slow.  And when I turned it off, it
dieseled.  Hardly ever did that with the Cardone.

So what's up with that.  I thought the carburator
regulated how much gas it gets.  The electric pump
just have to give it at least what it wants.  I just
went and bought another Cardone ($43 now).  I'm
getting ready to put it on.  

Before I do, does anyone have any suggestions.  I'm
fine with an electric fuel pump as long as it works. 
But this is the fourth one in 6 years (counting the
original and the Puralator that still works).  Can
anyone explain why it runs better with a Cardone? 

Did my bus originally have a mechanical pump?  Should
I  go with that?  I don't care as long as the bus runs
as good as it has been.  I can't even talk myself into
changing the ignition system.  Of all the great things
I hear about Petronix and the others, why replace
something that works reliably?  The bopmobile purrs
like a Messerschmitt (sorry to whoever I plagiarized)!
 

Thanks...KR
