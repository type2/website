I think that the phrase left out is "of equal displacement".  Such an
engine would have slower rpm allowing more time for combustion.  However,
by the same logic the best engine would be a single-cylinder engine with a
trash-can sized piston.

I smell an overgeneralization, which isn't unexpected on that site.
