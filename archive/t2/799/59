A,

Gapping the plugs is only successful if you are running a hot coil (over 40K
volts). If you run a generic coil, you won't have enough spark to bridge the
gap to the electrode.

Coil systems with a points eliminator (like the Comp-U-Fire) are able to
precisely throw a spark for the entire duration of the curve. This also
helps by allowing the engine to rev freely and smoothly up the powerband.
The engine reaches peak RPM quicker, while achieving more efficient
spark-per-stroke. This has the effect of better power and gas mileage.

The only thing to watch out for is "lead footing" it because it revs so
nicely. This eliminates most fuel savings! :)

I also threw in a K&N high-flow style air filter which help dramatically.
