Anything I should know before I start? I have a 73.

Easy, if you use the proper tools and care.

Your CVs will be attached with either Allen bolts or triple square bolts.
You don't know which because both were supplied with replacement CVs.  You
need the proper tool for either of these and don't be surprised if you
have both styles.

Make sure that the holes in the bolts are cleaned out completely so that
the tool can seat completely in the hole.  Any less and you risk damaging
the bolt.

If you do damage the bolt, you can remove it with a hefty set of
vise-grips

Check the length of the new axle to make sure it matches the old one.  All
the manual transmissions were the same, but the automatics had different
lengths.

If you are replacing complete axles, the job is easy.  Just unbolt and
rebolt.  Make sure that the CVs are kept clean and well greased with
proper CV grease.  Be sure all the washers are replaced on the bolts.
Torque the bolts to spec and you're done.  Retorque after driving a
hundred miles or so for safety.
