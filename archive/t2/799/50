Subject: 73 bus vacuum diagrams

Thank you for all the replies I got last time...

I am looking for diagrams of distrubutor
advance/retard lines.  I would also like to
see a good description of the ignition
circuit.  I see there is a ?thermostat?
on the right side of the engine compartment,
several controls on the carbs, and a vacuum
switch on the roof of the engine compartment.

Also, there is a vacuum "biscuit" on each of
the intake manifolds.  What are these for?

Jen
