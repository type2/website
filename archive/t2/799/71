Subject: Oktoberbus decorate your site/bus contest

Randy Hardin and the lovely Susie have volunteered to be the sponsors of 
the decorate your bus/site contest at Oktoberbus this year.  So bring 
your decorations and see who can make the spookiest site/bus this year.  
Last year we had so many wonderfully decorated sites that I was 
overwhelmed trying to pick my favorite.  Fortunately I'm into the 
democratic process and let the people choose.

So dig out the decorations, fill your bus with them so that the 
significant other has to drive the significant othermobile and see who 
can outdo everyone else in the decorations!
