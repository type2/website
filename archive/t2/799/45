I'd bet that adding just about any volatile liquid in the tank will boost mileage somewhat. Think about it, you fill your tank until the pump stops(if the financing goes thru :-)), and then add an extra pint or quart of stuff. Now you have a full tank plus a bit more, so you're going to go a few more miles on that tankful. That's the answer that the tappet bros. gave a caller, I think it makes sense. They also say that when you try these mileage boosting snake oils, you are likely to drive more carefully, which is what really boosts mpg
