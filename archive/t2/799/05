It is real - I have seen the vehicles. 

Basically you have to have a trnedy, desireable vehicle and drive a certain number of miles per week in highly visible places. That means the guy who lives in rural Canada and drives a Chevy Citation 5 miles a week isn't going to get a deal with the ad company...

Would be interesting to know if a vintage VW Westy would qualify. Wonder what that big sticker does to your paint when they pull it back off???
