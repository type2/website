Subject: VW is to Mercedes, as hard is to find..

Ok.. real quick.

 

Which Mercedes year and sedan model have the same wheel size and bolt patern
as the 78 bus?

 

Im trying to order the Kleen Wheel brake dust guard
(http://www.brakedustcover.com/)..  im sick of the dirty wheels every darn
day.

 

Thanks all..

 

Dave.
