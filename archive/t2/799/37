Subject: Re: [T2] Lightest, smallest packed size side tents?

Thanks to all that replied. Seems I would want a Dome style tent then.
Actually I dont know about all of you, but I LIKE the floorless tents. Use
wonderful grass when you can, lay a ground cloth when required for
protection, and no mess to disperse inside some folded tent.
Weight is not my biggest concern over fitting uder the rear seat, which I
REALLY want to have as an option.
Thanks,
Al
