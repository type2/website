Subject: Re: [T2] ready to bleed breaks

Brakes bled.  Test drive taken.  Successful all around.  She feels great
on the new shocks and the brake pedal is nice and firm and the braking is
strong.  So good new all around...almost :)

One of my brand new 4 cv boots is torn.  I guess I've got my next project
lined up.

Don ...

Is it cool if I get you your MightyVac back next week?  My old man is
coming in town Thursday and we're headed up to rocky mountain national
park (my home away from home) to photograph the aspens.

Thanks all for the help and for putting up with me.
