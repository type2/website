My lines also came from NAPA and the rear ones were too long.
When I did the job I borrowed a bender tool but ended up prefering my super
duper thumb because it has more levels of freedom.

The rear lines were too long and I did a small serpentine close to the drum.
Be careful with the rim, it goes pretty far inside on the drum. Bend the
extra brake line away from the rim (ask me how I know)
I think this one was rubbing the rim.

My 2 cents : do everything while you are at it (i.e you'll have to flush the
brakes) wheel cylinders, flexible hoses, shoes, maybe turn drums (9$ at
Kragen when I did it). Do the front end as well. (Rebuilding calipers isn't
hard , you can do it with a bicycle pump and a piece of wood to press the
pistons back in)
