Subject: Gravity brake bleeding

I've used gravity to bleed the brakes on lot's of cars and trucks.
The first step is to make sure you can open the bleeders.

With the master cylinder (mc) full and the cap off open the bleeder 
farthest from the mc. Put a drip pan under it and let it drip, I'll 
usually go half the mc or a 1/4 cup or something like that to judge 
the amount drained.
Close that bleeder, fill the mc and open the next bleeder. Repeat.
Close that bleeder, fill the mc and repeat on the next.
Do it again to the last.

Fill the mc and put the cover back on then check the brakes. Maybe 
85-90% of the time this is enough.

It's not high tech or high stress but it does work. Just don't let 
the mc go dry.
