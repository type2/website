I bought an overhead cabinet from him - I paid a very low price but the
shipping was significant.  I paid in June - and have yet to receive it - 4
months!

  I remember dealing with this guy on Ebay. Bought and paid for a upper shelve
unit for my '71 westy, and he backed out of the deal IIRC.  Finally got a
refund after a month, was not fun.
