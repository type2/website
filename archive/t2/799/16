I checked and my 78 plain bus was acceptable, but then I was highly
desireable because of my location. (parked on a major commuter route in a
major city)

don't know about the removal as I never followed thru. the pay a couple
years ago when I investigated was about $250-350 a month it was
significant.
 oh and they installed a GPS in your vehicle and monitored your driving
and parking to make sure you were following their policies.
