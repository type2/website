Put some acetone in your gas! <not really!>

A good friend has sent me a couple of links that tell how acetone - in small quantities - will raise your fuel mileage. Anyone know if this is for real? Surely might be expensive to test this on a modern fuel injected vehicle only to find out 10K miles later that your fule pump and injectors have turned to jelly inside... <griN!>
