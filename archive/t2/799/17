Subject: Changing axle

I have never changed an axle on a bus before. How much work is involved? I am looking to purchase the complete axle from BD. Can someone give me some feedback on this. Bentley makes is sound pretty easy. Anything I should know before I start? I have a 73.
 
Thanks,
Corbett
