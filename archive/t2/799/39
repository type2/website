<BTW a four-cylinder engine is capable of producing better MPG than a six or eight. This is due to the longer TIME for combustion allowed by fewer cylinders for better efficiency. The longer time for the burning process in a four is twice that of an eight. Thus an eight is inherently more wasteful of fuel in theory than a four or six. This simple fact is not well known. More cylinders shorten the time that combustion has to finish the total job of burning all the fuel.>

From the acetone link... 

I think I don't understand. I thought because a smaller 4 cylinder engine runs at higher RPMs to make power that it would have LESS time for combustion... My VW Cabrio runs at 3500 rpm, a big V-8 in the family runs at about 2200 rpm for the same vehicle speed.
