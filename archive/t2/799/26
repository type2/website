Subject: acetone or methanol additive....

Acetone mixes with both water and gasoline, like methanol, so I assume 
it would work as well as those additives that protect against water in 
the tank...but then how well do they work, as I assume you just end up 
with a greater volume of the water and alcohol mixed with it?  What 
effect does methanol have on the octane?
