The wiring diagram is a good source:

Follow terminal 15 on D (ignition switch) to N (ignition coil).

There is a thermostatically controlled preheater by the aircleaner intake.

The unit on the roof is the vacuum advance cutoff:

It's described in Bentley as disabling the vacuum advance while in the lower 3 gears. It was an emission device and hurts the engine in my opinion.

I think those are the vacuum based temperature controls for the EGR pipes. See Bentley. If you don't have one, you should get one asap as it's much better than any other VW bus repair manual.
