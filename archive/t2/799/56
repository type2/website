<What would be the best (cheapest) way of shipping a bus to Europe?>

Join the Navy and get stationed in Europe. They'll ship 1 vehicle there and 1 back for free - doesn't have to be the same vehicle...

<grin!> Sorry, couldn't help myself. 

I would start looking all over the web for vehicle exporters. Was $1500 from Italy to the east coast of the US ten years ago.
