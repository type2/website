Send it UPS... <grin!>

See if there is a collector transport going west - those guys have covered trailers and solid floors. I sent a '49 Chevy 3100 p/u that I sold to a guy in upstate NY from mid-TN and it was $800... That was on an open trailer though. 

Went to the Lane Motor Museum on Father's Day this year. Met Mr. Lane and he gave us a ride in his 1500 mile Citroen 2CV and his (!!!!!!) Tatra T-87 (!!!!!!) WOW! Anyhow I would call there (Nashville) and ask for recommendations. His whole collection is European cars from Isettas to Fiat 500s (my dream car!!!) to big expensive Tatras. WORTH the trip to see too. 

Anyhow see who or what he suggests...
