Seeing as how engines were designed to run on gasoline, additives such as
acetone are probably not a good idea for the reason that you discussed
above.  Acetone dissolves paint, so if you have any coatings inside your
fuel system it will attack them.  It probably isn't good for the hoses or
seals, either.
