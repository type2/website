I've been wondering about this myself. I went to bus boys to buy a
seal, and Walter cautioned me and suggested I leave it alone and seal
it with roofing tar. I told him I had done a vanagon, and he thought I
could handle it, but after cracking my wife's super beetle windshield
the other week, and reading of someone on this list cracking their new
bay windshield has given me second thoughts.

 I am trying to put the Windshield back into my 1972 Bus after fixing the

 Much harder than any of my Beetles.  I am beginning to think that the
 factory may have make the frame smallish or the Windshield Glass may be a
 little large.  Does anyone know where I can find the dimensions of the frame
 and the dimensions of the Glass?
