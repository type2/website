For the best combination of small size/weight and quality, our Hamburg is
definitely the tent to go with. It's about 46 lbs (including the sleeping
cabin, etc.) and roughly 3 x 1 feet when packed down (scarcely larger than
one of those chairs-in-a-bag).  Our Koln is a bit lighter (37 lbs), but the
floor and build quality of the Hamburg make it worth the small increase in
both weight and cost.  As for the frame-type tents, due to newer
technologies they have gotten a bit lighter over the years (our current
Hanover is 55 lbs, and much nicer than earlier generations), but they remain
much bulkier than a dome tent when packed down. You could fit a dome tent
under your back seat; not so a frame tent.
