Subject: poly-pro gas tanks

    I spent my lunch hour cruising around in West Marine.  Fun place to 
browse, and a surprising number of ideas occur to me when looking at all the 
boat do-dads.

     One of the items that really caught my eye was the plastic/poly-pro 
fuel tanks.  I saw a couple that looked to be in the same range of size as 
our bus gas tanks.  What are your thoughts on adapting one of these tanks to 
fit in the same location as the original tank in the bus?

Here is an example (though this one might be a touch to large):

   My original plan was to find a good tank and line it using the POR-15 
tank liner.  That's probably still MUCH more economical in both time and 
money.  This was just an idea I was kicking around with.  It does sound nice 
to have a tank that's completely corrosion proof.
