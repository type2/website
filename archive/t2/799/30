Dan,

After having similar problems as yours, I found a kit that handles 
different diameter(metric) lines from toolwarehouse.net.

It puts an "iso" bubble "lip" on the end of the line...this is what a lot 
of european cars use(like ours).

Sure can't find it listed easily at their site though(toolwarehouse.net).

The local flaps folks are just going to look at you funny when you try and 
talk to them about reflaring a line.

Cheers, dave

 It's the front one I'm having trouble with.  I can't seem to bend the 12"
 ones I found at NAPA so they're not in the way.  I'm also having trouble
 finding a replacement in the Denver CO metro area.  Should any break
 place be able to cut and re-flare a break line for me?  Is there an
 inexpensive tool that will cut and double flare a line?  I think it's
 about 6" or so is all I need.
