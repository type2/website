The tolerance between the plunger and body of the lifter is the tightest in the entire engine. When the lifter is subjected to dirty oil that scores the inside, the eventual result is destruction which is usually preceeded by excessive lifter noise. When the bus is driven under those conditions the lifters fail as you saw.

I don't like their products: they seem to favor performance over filtering.

Mileage?

What grade are you using? I use 15w50 and I have no problems with hydraulics.

It would be best to talk with Boston Bob and get his advice since he built the engine and can do the detective work required to get you an answer. The armchair pundits on this list (myself included) and elsewhere won't be nearly as helpful as talking directly with Bob.
