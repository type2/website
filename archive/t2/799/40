I didn't quite get that one either.  The length of time given for
combustion is directly related to RPM, not number of cylinders.  As
you point out, in general more cylinders typically allows you lower
RPM, which should be a longer combustion time.  There are exceptions -
F1 V-10s run at ridiculous speeds, and we used to have a JD
two-cylinder diesel tractor that produced power at some pretty
ridiculously slow speeds.
