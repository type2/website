The same thing happened to me on the engine I just put in the 72. I
bought another head part number matched to the other head, and the
serial number on the block said 1700. When the new head arrived I
found out it was 2.0 also, but just took the old and new heads to the
machine shop and had the 1.7 head opened up to fit my engine.

 It's a 2.0! Arrgghhh!!!

 After the battle due to the wrong gaskets, and all the work into the
 1.7head, and I find this. Sigh.
