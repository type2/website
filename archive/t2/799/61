There are 3 campgrounds within a mile of the USFS Ranger Station at 
the lake. They are first come, first served. I doubt they will be in 
big demand during winter so shouldn't be much problem. If you got the 
bucks, the Lodge is primo. Expect RAIN, I mean, like up to 8" per day 
sometimes that time of year, showers all day and all night. It is 
after all in the heart of the coastal rain forest. When the rain lets 
up, it's the cleanest air you have ever breathed and the cleanest 
forest you have ever seen.

Bring a mushroom book. All That The Rain Promises by David Aurora is 
a very good one if you have only one. It shows all the good edibles 
that are easy to positively identify.

There be steelhead and cutthroat in the river above the lake which is 
National Forest or Park so you can fish there without a license or 
Indian guide. The Quinault steelhead are the largest varietal of the 
species in the world. Not 5 to 15 pounds but 12 to 30+ pounds. The 
Lake and river below are owned by the tribe. You can normally hire a 
Quinault guide to fish there.

Would be a magnificent venue for a Bus campout.
