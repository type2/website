Subject: New VW Van?

Hey guys,

    I was watching Detroit Autoline this weekend, and they mentioned 
inter-company "marriages" so to speak. Like, Ford / Fiat, VW / Porsche,
etc. But then they mentioned that VW was in the final stages of working
an agreement with Chrysler to build their new van off the next Dodge
Caravan platform. A couple things came to mind. Does anyone know if this
van is supposed to be, or will be the next "micro-bus"? Will it be a
modern rendition of the Bus like the New Beetle is to the old beetle?
Or is this just going to be a regular minivan that has the VW emblem on it?

Also, what does this mean for the current EuroVan? I know that the EuroVan
is no longer being made in the US, but last time I was overseas, I learned
that the EuroVan is still being made.. and is more popular in parts of 
Europe (like Holland) than the Ford F-150 is in the US. It's kind of cool
that they still call it the "Transporter" in Europe. In any case, does
this mean that they're no longer going to produce the Transporter in 
Europe too?


Just curious.


Thanks,

Todd
