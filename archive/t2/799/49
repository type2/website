Lee,
Maybe I'm a stock ride height maniac but what I really like with your westy
is that the butt isn't sagging. It makes the bus look determined to conquer
!
Could you tell me how many inches, centimeters or whatever there is between
the top of the rim's lip to the bottom of the wheel arch. It looks like
there is almost a tyre (tyre and not tire :-) height. On mine there is about
1.5 inch.

Have fun with the new toy
