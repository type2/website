Hi Chris,

I have seen several of these vehicles on the highway during the rush  
hour here in Toronto. There's a rumour of a wrapped bus in Toronto  
but I haven't seen it yet. Other than the GermanSupply.com bus, I mean.

The vinyl adhesives that are used are safe if your paint is stable.  
If the paint is still there after 30 years, it'll be OK. If it's  
latex housepaint rollered on top of fresh wax.... that's a different  
story.

Tip: Use a heat gun to loosen the adhesive on a bumper sticker before  
you pull it off. They strip off like butter that way, without  
damaging the paint. (Be careful with that heat gun!)


Happy trails,
