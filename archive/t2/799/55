Subject: More tire FART - With a twist!

I was just reading about rim widths and came across something I hadn't heard
before:

"Selection of a wider rim, from within the approved range, (T & RA tables)
stiffens the sidewall and improves handling at the expense of handling."

(From http://www.dunloptire.com/care/widthRatio.html )

And from a Yokohama site ( http://www.yokohamatire.com/utrimwidth.asp ):

" A wider wheel will improve handling at the expense of ride quality, while
a narrower wheel will improve ride quality at the expense of handling."

So the question is: A 6.5" wide rim will actually STRENGTHEN the tire? Or
just make the tire fail more dramatically, all at once instead of gradually?
