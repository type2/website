Got the engine out. Took some bending of the lip on the rear valance and
lots of prying between the valance and the engine. My pretty blue fan shroud
is pretty no more. :(

The reason this was such a pain is DPO had backed into something and the
valance was bent in a good 2 inches. Just enough to keep from clearing the
shroud.

So I got the engine out, pulled the shroud and exhaust off, and then tackled
the head with the sunk valve seat. What did I find?

It's a 2.0! Arrgghhh!!!

After the battle due to the wrong gaskets, and all the work into the
1.7head, and I find this. Sigh.

Once I had everything off I found a rebuilder's tag. That set alarms going
off in my head. So I pulled the head (which was an adventure in itself... I
hate pushrod tubes) and compared the cylinder to my "new" head.

Troy offered up one of the heads from his other engine (the other head had a
crack in the exh port) so I used that and put it on. I couldn't re-ring the
pistons since I didn't have 2.0 rings, only 1.7. But otherwise everything
seemed to go well. I cleaned up all the crap blocking the fins on both heads
and cylinders. Troy got pics of the crap built up there.

So after reassembly I scrubbed the engine and cleaned up the fins and put it
back in the bus. Install went much more smoothly... Because I left the
shroud off. heh.

After running an errand I headed back to install the exhaust and intakes.
Drivers side exhaust went smooth, but the passenger side HE doesn't want to
go on. I got it sort of on but it's riding lower with the new head than it
did with the old one and it makes me a bit nervous. Especially since 2 of
the stud bosses looked stripped out. Sigh. At 9pm I gave up and came home in
the Volvo.
