Subject: Fuel guage drops to empty and car won't idle???

My daughter just phoned me a few minutes ago and said the gas gauge had dropped to empty and the car would not idle without her keeping her foot on the gas. This car (1970 bug)has been faultless so far, does this ring any bells with anyone? I'm suspecting the wire to the gauge is shorting out and also causing the engine to not idle unless it's revved up?

Thanks,
Courtney
