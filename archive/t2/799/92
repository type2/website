Which Mercedes year and sedan model have the same wheel size and bolt patern as the 78 bus?
I'm trying to order the Kleen Wheel brake dust guard
(http://www.brakedustcover.com/)..  im sick of the dirty wheels every darn day.

All except the G-wagen are 5 x 112mm.

But, only the 140, 215, 220, and ML class have 14mm wheel bolts. All the others are 12mm.

As a MB tech of 27+ years, we do not recommend OR sell them at our dealership. Even though some brands have
slots in them, ALL of them cause overheated brakes because of zero cooling air flow.
Find a better set of brake pads.
