I am not a list-meister, but the gist of it is that no links to ebay are
allowed, period. It may not seem sensible to be so cut and dry about it, but
I think it is the KISS principle at work. If the definitions of what eBay
links are and are not allowed, it gets confusing and messy.

K.I.Simple is to say "no eBay links" and leave it at that.
