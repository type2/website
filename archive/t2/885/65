I know but purely by co incidence, I accidently met the guy who the person
I bought it from had bought it from when he saw me sitting on the side of
the road (GEX engine failure) and he told me about the guy he bought it
from who was oringinal owner.. so I am fourth owner but I only know this
by chance.

isn't being just a little nuts a requirment for owning one of these
things.
