If my posting is against the rules, I apologize profusely, and hope it can
be pulled. It just seems to me when anyone finds something for sale online
that others may be interested in but not notice on their own, a friendly
"hey, check this out!" is not innapropriate. I am curious as to what makes
the difference between ebay, and say Samba, where notifications of items for
sale crop up regularly without a breach of rules notification. I also cannot
find the charter online to research. Can anyone send a link to it?
