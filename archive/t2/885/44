It's too bad that it has become such a VW vacuum here in the Bay Area. I could put up with it until the junkyards went dry.

Shows are only as good as the clubs that host them. The local Golden Gate Chapter VVWCA is basically a social club for a few vintage owners that don't even show up in their VWs for the monthly meeting.

It used to be the case there was no space for post-1968 vehicles at Kelley Park but the turn out is so poor now they could invite more VWs in but I doubt they will. You'll see the odd Porsche or baywindow in the park that their friends bring in but the rest are turned away at the gate even though there is space inside.
