No, not nuts.

I have only word of mouth from the seller that he bought my 72 
Transporter from the original owner, and the motor was rebuilt at 
120,000. All else I knew about it before making an offer was via 
actual inspection.

I asked, do you have any records?? He said no. No reason to badger 
him about an honest answer. That IS the honest answer 6 time out of 
10 when dealing with a vehicle 20+ years old.

Now, on my 67 Porsche, I did have records to prove I was buying from 
the original owner. My inspection in that case revealed he was a 
fibber as regards other items. I didn't let on he was lacking in 
character, just based my offer on what was proven by the records and 
the actual inspection.

This lady hasn't got a clue, or she thinks that putting a guilt trip 
on you could somehow work in her favor. I would thank her for coming 
and bid her a good day and not waste more than 5 minutes of my time 
with her. You have a typical undocumented Bus at a price that is 
within the real world market. She wants something better. Advise her 
to look elsewhere. For sure, don't work up an ulcer thinking YOU blew 
the sale with this ignoramus.
