Not a chance that I was going to fly out their and drive it back. I considered
it for a minute, but then my senses came back to me. It is one thing to spend
$800 on getting it here, but plane tickets, hotels, 4 days of driving in a
vehicle that I did not know. That could have been very costly. I knew nothing
about buses back then and still don't know much. If anything had broken, I
would have been screwed and stranded. It only took the shipping company 7 days
from the end of the auction to get the bus and 4 more to get it here, so it
was not long.

That does remind me that about 150 miles after I got it home, the carb screwed
up and I was forced to remove it and clean it. After that it ran great for a
long time. I would not have wanted to do that on the side of the road between
there and here. Especially since I was new to buses and had not had a VW in 10
years.

I did fly to Texas two years later and purchase an RV.... Although I did have
that one inspected locally before I got there and did drive it back. If that
had broke, I would have been in real trouble because I don't work on it at all
and the wife was with me.... But it made it and it was a great adventure.

I felt a little more comfortable in a mid 90's RV than a early 70's bus.
Although now I would take my bus almost anywhere.
