Whew, at least you didn't say anything bad about Pontiac. But, I have to say... 
I'm somewhat dissapointed by the vehicles that are available to the US right 
now. There are very FEW vehicles that I find even remotely interesting. I tend 
to think that car companies are so concerned about what they THINK people want, 
rather than designing a car based on what THEY want. I mean, I'm not looking 
for the Homer Car, or the Edsel or anything like that... but I really want to 
see car companies produce cars that people ACTUALLY want... and what the 
designers ACTUALLY want to design.

Not EVERYONE is a Honda Accord / Toyota Camry / Dodge Caravan type of person. I 
for one would never plunk down the money on any one of those cars, or anything 
even remotely as boring / bland. It's not that I think I'm too good to own one 
of them, I mean... all three of those vehicles are very reliable and well 
built. But they're about as boring as a game of Othello by yourself. Just think 
back to when designers were in charge... vehicles were flying off the shelves 
of pretty much every car company. The 57 CHevy, the VW Bus. All of my cars need 
to have some sort of character. There are a couple of cars that have slipped 
past the bean counters... like the Pontiac Solstice, and some of the vehicles 
from Dodge. But WHY didn't Volkswagen produce the retro rendition of the VW 
Bus? I KNOW lots of people would have bought one.
