the guy from budget just called - he found me a trailer.
so now i am going to be driving a 24' truck maxed out on weight 
(16000 lbs!)  and towing a 14' trailer. and they want me to take the 
trailer to pittsburgh when i am done with it in texas.

sigh.


moving is soooooooooooooooooooooooooo   much fun.
