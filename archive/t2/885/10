from the charter-----
--Do not ever refrence an E-Bay auctions or other auctions (whether yours
or someone elses) on the list. We filter heavily for this. If we want to
know what is for sale on eBay we will go there and look.  We submitted
this subject to the list for a vote and the majority of listmembers did
NOT want to see E-Bay posts, so that's the way it is.

I would like to say however, that the charter does not forbid links to 
photographs when some sort of part identification, it just is forbiding 
auctions (as I read it).
