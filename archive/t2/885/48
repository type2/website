Subject: Wobbly Steering!

Hey guys,

    Before I parked my Bus about 2 years ago (to fix it up), the steering was
horrible. At slower speeds, and while turning, the steering was decent. But...
while in a straight line, the steering wheel would violently shake back and
forth. It FELT to me like one of the wheels perhaps wiggled back and forth.
Just before I parked it, I needed it to help me move into the house that my
wife and I are in... so I put in a brand new steering dampner shock absorber
from Bus Depot. This really helped alleviate part of the problem, but it
didn't completely fix it.

I suspected the tie rods, so I ordered a set of tie-rods from CIP1.Com
(California Import Parts). It's kind of weird. The drivers side had fixed
tie-rods, while the passenger side had adjustable tie rods. In any case, I
just got through installing them (and matched up the adjustable tie rod to the
length of the one I took off).

I'm assuming that this will solve my problem, but I figured that while I'm at
it, I'd like to see if there's anything else I should replace.

The ball joints seem to be perfect. The rubber boots aren't ripped and from
what I can tell they were probably replaced by the PO. Are there any other
pieces that need to replaced with respect to the steering that would wear?
Those three items were the only things that I saw that could be replaced.
Anything else I might be missing?


Thanks!!!

Todd
