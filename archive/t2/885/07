Isn't it different to point out a cool VW find that you are not
selling.? I thought the point of the ebay edict was not to allow folks
to take up list space promoting their own listings on ebay.
There were more than a few posts re: the release of products around the
Disney "Cars" movie.

What say ye oh list-Meister(s)?
