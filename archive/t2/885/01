Subject: Re: [T2] Next question - the charcoal filter

Isn't it true that a lot of 71 paraffin thermostat's no longer work and are no longer available? I know mine doesn't and I have read past post's from people who remove the hot air intake hose in the summer because of this. Would a ghia air cleaner be better than the bus air cleaner if the vacuum operated thermostat works? (Then there is the problem of finding a place for the bus charcoal canister to connect to on the ghia air cleaner.)

Later,
Bill

FYI,  that is a Ghia air filter, NOT a 71 bus air

Hello Lee Yes Karl is right on this. You can still use the ghia one ,it 
just isn't what came on the bus. I do have a bus one if you really need 
one let me know. You can tell a bus one by the lever that hooks to the 
flap on the intake. later mark dearing
