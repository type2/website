Subject: VW will not shut off....

...I have a friend that has a bug that will start fine, but when he turns the key
off, it will not shut off....
 
 
 
I'm no expert on bugs, but have you checked the starter relay?  It's also possible that the fan is connected wonky and feeding back into the system.
