Subject: Re: [VB] HOSED by a transport company!

  Thats one of the easiest moves there is. Go to/or call some of the  auto auction yards  in Phoenix, there are at least 10 transport companies 
out of them. You can drive your bus over and leave it there for the move. Texas is a stopping/transfer point for a lot of transport companies. 

  You should easily get it to Houston, Dallas or the port areas (is it Corpus Cristy), prices are dirt cheap as numerous trucks run daily on those 
routes from the auction yeards. 
  When I had my Barndoor brought out from texas it took less then 10 days to have picked up, moved to Phoenix then brought up here. To 
save money I had all moves made on "space available", it sat in Phoenix for a few days and came up here with a load of new BMW's on the 
way to Vegas.
