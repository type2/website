Ebay has a perfectly good search engine for those who want to look up VW 
bus stuff or VW anything.  The principle is to remove needless bandwidth 
from the list.
However, I presume it's ok to first mention what a listmember has for 
sale before putting it on ebay, but a grey zone I'd like to see 
clarified is when a listmember HAS something on ebay is it OK to 
advertize it?
