Point her to the local Toyota dealer. You don't want to sell it to her 
'casue in a week or two she'll be back with complaints about how 
something doesn't work right. Or worse she'll have an accident and sue 
you b/c you did a brake job on it 2 years ago. She prob has very 
unrealistic expectations for your bus (aka turn the key and drive it 
with only 100K maintenance just like her sister's Ford).
