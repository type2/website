This question seems to come up periodically.

The problem is separating fish from fowl.  Some ebay sellers have no
compunction against using multiple identities to sidestep "own auction"
restrictions, so it was decided by a list majority to prohibit all
auction advertisements.  That way there is no questions about what is
allowed or not.

OTOH, if a listee has something he would like to sell, he is welcome
to sell it directly on the list.
