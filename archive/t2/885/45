Subject: Re: [T2] T-shirt take 2

I think Ebay has revolutionalized commerce here (and in the rest of the  world, for that matter).  I've used it for years and have had only  good experiences.  I got a wrong ashtray for my Westy but that was  my fault.  I tought a rear ashtray would be the same whether it  was a camper or not.  I should have looked into it.  Other  than that, I've turned crap (to me) into money and have saved a lot of  money on stuff I've bought.  And I've gotten some neat things I  wouldn't have been able to find anywhere else.  I just wish there  were more places like that.  But I understand the rules of the  list.  I've seen those shirts myself on Ebay.  I just don't  much like them.  What a benign caption.  Cheers...KR

I'll take eBay/Samba any day for baywindow parts over a local swap meet especially for NOS items.
