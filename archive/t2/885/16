I don't want ads in my email about Ebay or The Samba, so why not remove them
both. If you want to offer something to the list, do it before offering it to
the rest of the world on Samba or Ebay. The Samba is full of crap just like
Ebay is. I see no difference except for the bidding part.

Just my .02 cents worth.
