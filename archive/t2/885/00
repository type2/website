Well, they did make the EuroVan here in the US. I see them every now and then in the junkyard. 
Speaking of fixing things, I often see 5 cyl VW EuroVans in the junkyard, and they're usually in MINT condition. I'm always really surprised when I see the condition of most of the cars in the junkyard. I mean, most of them have perfect paint, and straight bodies, and usually require nothing more than a suspension / brake / engine rebuild and some upholstery work. You can get them for about $250 bucks. There's at least one there every month. (I live in South Florida by the way).

Last time I went to Holland, I saw literally THOUSANDS of EuroVans. But, over there they call them Transporters (which I thought was kind of cool). Like how GMC sells variations on their work / van platform, VW does the same over there.

Be careful what you say lest you become disrespectful to my country. :) The United States bought millions and millions of Beetles and VW Busses. Perhaps it's not the "US" that doesn't get it, maybe it's VW that doesn't get it. I couldn't help but notice that the Beetle has ALREADY been re-designed.. although moderately, they've already redesigned the tail-lamps, all the bumpers, etc. What for? VW kept the original beetle nearly the same for God knows how long, and it sold like crazy. What makes them feel the need to alter the beetle now? My wife owns a 2004 VW Beetle Convertible... I don't remember ever getting a survey asking what we wanted to change?
