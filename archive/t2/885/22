Subject: Abandoning VW?

[quote] A reporter is looking to interview people
who have abandoned the Volkswagen brand in recent
years because they needed an affordable minivan
or compact SUV - the kinds of models VW doesn't
currently offer in the United States. Please send
an e-mail to jfallon(-at-)edmunds.com no later than
Friday, June 30, 2006 containing your daytime
contact information and a few words about your
decision.  [/quote]

From another reputable forum (edmunds.com).  

Can someone post to the Eurovan and Vanagon list?
 

Happy bussin'
