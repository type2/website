When did they pass the law requiring vehicle owners to track the ownership
of their vehicles from day one?  She's blowing smoke.

Yes, I'm the third, but only if I go on the verbal history provided by the
second owner.  If he decided to get creative I might well be the 6th.  I
really don't care.  Would your "buyer" have been happier if you lied and
told her that the previous owner was Jerry Garcia?  :)

So what else is new?  They also fix and replace easily.  At this point you
should have directed her to the nearest Toyota dealer, as she obviously
isn't qualified to own an aircooled VW.

Nope.  Unless the car is something exotic, or the owner is particularly
anal, nobody keeps a logbook, which is what she is talking about.
