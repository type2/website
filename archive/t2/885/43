Hi Richard,

You're from California, that's the problem.

Here in Ontario (Canada) the swap meets are filled with all nature of  
stuff... watercooled, beetle and type2 as well. There's a guy I can  
depend on to be at pretty much every swap meet bringing lots of  
little bits and pieces from scrapped bay buses. He also gets some  
splitty stuff from time to time, and it's priced according to demand.

It's damned hard work keeping a daily driver on the road in  
Ontario... I can't imagine what it must be like to be shut out of  
local car shows just because your vehicle wasn't made before 1968. I  
guess it's a supply and demand thing.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts
