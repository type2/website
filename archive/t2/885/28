hello Guys  I agree with Andy.   I am not a big fan of E  barf as I have seen 
a lot of crap sold there and it is my thoughts that it and  the samba have 
almost killed the swap meets.  The best part of the swap  meets is that you can 
put your hands on the part, inspect it and then  barder,  You can do none of 
those with E barf .  Later  mark  dearing
