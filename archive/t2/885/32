Absolutely not true. There is no reason that a vehicle produced today cannot
have any look the design, engineering and marketing departments want it to
have. It is a bunch of sheet metal and plastic and the reason it looks the
way it does is based more on marketing than anything else. It does not cost
more to produce one "look" versus another, within reason.
