Everything has to have all these automatic, LCD screeened, computerized 
extras... I guess that is the reason there are so many "good" vehicles 
in the junkyards. Nobody can afford to pay someone to fix them when they 
break. How about the upscale cars with the LCD scren that displays the 
HVAC andf the radio and the nav system and the seat warmers, and, and 
... If the screen dies you "have" to fix it.

I prefer my '97 Cabrio which has a good mix of basic with extras. Pwr 
windows, manual HVAC controls (knobs and cables), manual seats, manual 
top, etc.
