This happens all too frequently when dealing with small operators and low
bidders.  Many of these supposed 'transport companies' don't even own a
truck (or maybe they own one),often operate out of a basement somewhere, and
tend to go in and out of business fairly frequently. They're basically
brokers.  Typically they quote you a price and then ask for a deposit, with
the balance payable on delivery. The deposit is their commission for finding
a driver to haul your vehicle; the driver gets what is paid on delivery.

Once you agree to the quote, they try to network with various independent
truckers who are hauling vehicles across the country, and line up a route
that makes sense. For example, if someone needs a car moved from LA to
Detroit, they'll try to find a trucker who has to transport another car
roughly between the same two points and who has an extra spot on the
trailer. He also needs to have some cars lined up that are going from the
Detroit area back West so he's not running home "deadhead" (with an empty
trailer).  Otherwise he will charge much more for the job, as he needs to
cover the cost of driving all the way back with no cargo.

The lower the price the company quotes, the harder it is for them to line up
a driver. If they lowballed the quote, they'll never find a driver willing
to take the job unless he's pretty much already going there anyway and has
an extra spot he can't fill. If they quoted high, then worst-case they can
pay him extra if he has to go 300 miles out of his way to pick up the car,
or return deadhead after dropping it off.

The problem occurs when such a broker fails to line up a trucker to haul
your vehicle (at least at the quoted price). Then he has the option of
either taking a loss on the job and paying the difference himself, jacking
up the price, or pretending he never heard of you and hanging up the phone.
