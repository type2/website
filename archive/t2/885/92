I paid $800 to get my bus from Arizona to Virginia 5 years ago, but with the
rising fuel prices..... it is probably much more. I bought my bus on Ebay and
used Ebay's shipping service, dependable auto shippers. They guy in Arizona
dropped it off at the shipping location and they delivered it to my house.
