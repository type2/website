Ron, I  wasn't offended by your message. It gets scary in 
here if you don't follow the "charter". I'm sure that you 
didn't do it to make anyone mad, BUT it seems some volks 
get theirselves up in a bind over such things.

Although you can occasionally find good deals on Ebay, I 
try not to buy anything on there. Samba is a decent place 
for buying. Karl on Samba has just about ANY Bus part you 
would be looking for. And for dirt cheap. I see no reason 
why links to there should be a problem. The best place to 
find parts is in person at a show or a Bus campout.

I know how you feel. After watching people on here discuss 
a subject, I made a comment. I was then scolded for not 
having Bus material in my email.



Oh...I looked at my Bus today. It was pretty.
