My experience with swap meets has been that they cater to the vintage crowd.

This is fine is you have something to swap that they need but when you are a baywindow owner trying to buy a hard to find item from a vintage guy (and stranger to make it clear), I find they gouge you horribly. They have little to no interest in bargaining looking for that one sucker who will pay $120 for a used clock or other very used part they don't care about.

I'll take eBay/Samba any day for baywindow parts over a local swap meet especially for NOS items.
