The problem is that the people you know are a lot more likely to buy a
retro VW bus than the general population.  Even those of us with a soft
spot for VW buses would see the $40K pricetag and probably close our
checkbooks.  The New Bus was just a Bad Idea from the start, driven by
designers who saw only form, not function.  The New Beetle was a better
idea, but, from what I understand, it only sells well in the US.
This is probably because it is actually less useful than the Golf with
which it shares its platform.

The New Beetle sells well because of the Nostalgia Factor and the fact
that its relatively low price makes it a good impulse buy.  The Mini
moved upscale a bit, but also tends to be an impulse buy for folks
with a bit more money.

More expensive Nostalgia cars like the T-Bird, Prowler, etc, bank on
their exclusivity and serve mostly as a showroom lure to to draw customers
for more mundane cars.

Sad to say, but the chances of a New Bus that will satisfy us aircooled
addicts is slim.  Economy, safety, and production costs will make anything
with a "bus look" more expensive than purpose-built minivans.
