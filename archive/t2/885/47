Subject: Fan Shroud Separation

Quick question for the gurus out there- Do the two pieces of the fan shroud
for a 76 2.0L separate?  Im talking about the thicker magnesium alloy
portion of the shroud.  It seems that there is nothing left holding them
together except for the dipstick tube passing through them.  Id like to
take them apart for cleaning.
