Subject: Any way to ship economically from Germany?

I am looking at some bulky items on German eBay and I was 
trying to find a way to ship them back to Canada 
economically... without going the David Marshall container 
full route.

Apparently German Post is very expensive. Also, several 
eBaybers in German are reluctant to ship outside Germany. 
Does anyone know of a mail / freight forwarder who would ship 
smaller items?

Thanks,
Chris
