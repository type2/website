I have used bar and chain oil for the last 3 years and it works great.

I have not seen any further rusting and I live in Nova Scotia, and they salt
the roads here big time. I spray it on in the fall and in the spring. I
spray it in the rocker panels. door panels, sills, inside the frame members,
inside the frontbeam, basically any where there is a hole big enough for my
spray gun can get into. It's messy, but no rust for me!
