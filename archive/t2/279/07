Subject: Max RPM & Cruisin rpm of a 1600 SP

I have just been reading 'without guesswork'.
To quote from the performance section, the max & cruising spped of a 1970 
type II with a 1600 cc engine is 68 mph at 4100 rpm
It also says that the fuel consumption should be 26.4 miles per US gallon!
I guess that I can sort of fell happy going on the interstate (-at-) 4000 RPMm but 
a lot of people sat 3500 RPM>
What is the correct answer?
