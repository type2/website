Additional cost savings from DuPont to consider:
DuPont Industrial Coatings Corlar High Solids Epoxy Primer # 525-333.
Two gallons of mix can be reduced to four gallons of sprayable.
Very acceptable product, and all for under $75.
I haven't seen the 3-part Urethane material Terry mentioned.

As for powdercoat primer, the available product suitable for automotive 
application in zinc rich format is an acceptable end result in itself
for a factory look on the pedal pan. Used on wheels and bumpers, 
it provides fill for rust pitting under the topcoat in addition to the
superior rust prevention qualities.

I haven't yet experienced the problem with lug nuts loosening
on powdercoated wheels. While the anecdotal evidence is a
cause for concern, it hasn't persuaded me to change application
in my own personal use, but has convinced me it isn't worth the risk
to ignore in putting out product. It's quite simple to remove the powder 
from lugnut holes prior to bake with a quick wipe ( no need to mask ).
There will, however, be a source of rust bleed from uncoated metal.

I have avoided the Nason stuff, simply because it's Duponts replacement
for their lower end Dulux line which is NLA--Kaput.
