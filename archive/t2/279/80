Chris,

Not exactly like a dimmer switch, because a dimmer works by modifying voltage, not current. In our little circuit, the 12vdc is a constant.

I design fire alarm systems which are 24vdc systems mostly. When I put a string of horns or lights on a circuit to calc voltage drop, I don't expect the first ones to be lighter/louder. The current draw on the circuit is a constant, based on the ratings given by the manufacturer. What matters is that I have less than 5% voltage drop at the last device on my circuit, which is a function of resistance (length and size of wire) as Terry was saying the other day.

My understanding is that if a device recieves it's threshold operating voltage, then it will draw whatever it takes to operate the load at the given voltage.

Granted, on any circuit, increasing voltage reduces amperage required and viceversa.

I think your test would work better with voltage as the variable than with current.

But I could be wrong,

Billy
