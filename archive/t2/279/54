Subject: [T2] Swapping engines

Well, it looks like the engine in my '72 hardtop westy is on its way out... 
I've been giving some thought to replacing it with something that has a 
little more power. I seem to recall reading a while back about a diesel 
conversion using a Quattro(?) engine. Has anybody on the list done this 
themselves, or know where I can find some information on this? General 
engine swapping tips would also be appreciated, as it's going to be my first 
time doing it. (I will have my father's help, and he's done it in buses and 
beetles, so I won't be going it alone.)
