Dave--

Your right--it stinks like all holy hell---

But of course you use your Binks mask when you use it---right???--:>)

I just found some dynamite 3 part urethane primer from Dupont and right
now I can't remember the name of it--

My gravity feed primer gun was left with this stuff in about an hour too
long--my God it took me two days to get all the gunk out of the cup and
passages.

A glob of it set up on the stand for the gravity gun--and I picked it
of---

Interesting primer / sealer--

I can't stick my finger nail in it--and I can bend it back over on
itself and it's like rubber--it doesn't break like a lacquer based
primer would.

Interesting stuff.

I'll have to get the name of the stuff and let you now what it is--I can
see possibilities using on the nose of anything for chip resistance--

I have avoided the Nason stuff, simply because it's Duponts replacement
for their lower end Dulux line which is NLA--Kaput.

Later,

TK--
