Except that the diesel vanagon mounts the engine
at 45 degrees because of the low deck heighth of
the vanagon.  This apparently caused problems
with oiling because the vanagon diesel had
special oilers that other blocks did not.  It
also caused the need for special components
galore, ie oil sump, manifolds, etc.  The cost of
these components are expensive due to limited
supply.  No reason to sue the vanagon stuff in
the the loaf bus because you have plenty of room
to mount the engine vertically, just like Audi
did (and VW did in non-vanagon applications). 
The diesel mates up just like any rabbit/golf
engine so you could use a Kennedy adapter.  You
will of course have to fabric your engine bar,
air intake system, and all kinds of other stuff
but you'd have to with the vanagon stuff also.  

Plenty of reading available on these these
issues, although it is mostly vanagon related.  
Try www.fastforward.ca, it compares 45 degree vs.
vertical mounting

There is also a loaf diesel page in german.  Nice
pics and you can convert it using babblefish.

Finally, nice set of links at:  
http://volksweb.relitech.com/convert.htm

There also may still be a vanagon engine
conversion group at yahoo groups.  

Lotta work.
