The Vari Prime is way short of the deuce you jest of Dave---

I just got a gallon last week---I'll check the invoice and give you an
exact figure--

The whole deal of short cutting the prep work after a guy has busted his
butt sanding and whatever, is almost bordering insanity--

The beat transition is the overall long term results--:>)

What--no paint lifting ??????

Amazing !!

Like Eureka !!!

Later,

To ease the withdrawal symptoms of transition from $2 rattle-can to the
$200 / gal. VariPrime, put a marble in your paint cup. (*~*).

If you ad researched this a little more you would have found a product
by Dupont--Vari Prime acid etch zinc chromate primer--it sticks to
anything--- 
Plastic coat stuff is spray can stuff--- low or no build primer.-- 
Lots of time and money spent on not much for results.
