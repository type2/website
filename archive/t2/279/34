Subject: so, if I am testing for shorts, what am I doing wrong?

Ok, I have been restoring my 74 Hightop, Prometheis, and I got a new battery, 
and fanbelt....yeah! I installed them, and cranked her up.....sounded great, 
started right up. .......About two hours later I came back to start it up, 
and the battery light seemed to stay on long after the start then last time. 
I had had some electrical problems in the past, so I decided to test for 
shorts.

I disconected the ground strap from the body, and hook the leads of my 
digimultimeter to the body, and to the - of the battery. I kept pulling a 
fuse at a time. But there is still a full drain between the battery and the 
body. ....I pulled all the fuses.....and checked......still drawing current. 
I know I should check in amps, but really, if 12 v is rolling through, isn't 
that just as much an indicator?

Well, my question is, what else can I check? Am I doing something wrong? 

Thanks in advance for any help,

Chris
