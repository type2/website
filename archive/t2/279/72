Subject: Without Guesswork (was: Max RPM & Cruisin rpm)

Hi Folks,

This "Without Guesswork" you've mentioned sounds interesting.  Is it a 
publication available to the general public?  If so, are there copies 
available for perusal or purchase?  Is it worth spending money on?  It 
sounds like it has some interesting information that would be fun to check 
out to add to one's storehouse of Esoteric Knowledge.

If it's unavailable by reasonable means, could somebody post some info about 
the 1979 Westy?  It would be interesting to know what the gas mileage, max 
RPM, and other info for the 2.0 FI Buses is...

Thanks in advance,

Jason Upper
