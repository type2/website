Subject: Couple of more "Westy" questions

Hi there:

#1) My '81 Vanagon has large rubber seals on the leading edge of the doors
that match up to "holes" (roughly rectangular) in the chassis which serve as
part of the fresh air system.  On my '82 Westfalia the passenger-side setup
is the same, but on the driver's side the seal is missing and the hole in
the chassis is blocked of by a plastic piece that looks original, held in
place by a singe screw.  I guess this serves to shut off air flow on this
side, but I have to ask, "Why?"  Is this some sort of "camper" setup?  Can I
simply remove the plastic piece and find and install the rubber seal, or am
I screwing something up?

#2) The small metal piece that serves as part of the door latching system is
loose, meaning I can't really shut the door tight.  Looking at the similar
metal piece on other cabinet doors it looks like it's held in place by a
single screw, but I can't figure out how to get at that screw in the refer.
Can anybody provide guidance?

TIA.
