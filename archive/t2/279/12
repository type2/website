Subject: Re: water in the booster  update

Same problem here! I even had brakes lock up completely resulting in red
hot discs and melted paint on the rims ...

I since replaced the booster to experience the same phenomenom again!
After applying the brakes the pedal will not come up again by itself
(needs a little help) and after the bus was parked for a few weeks there
was a high initial resistance on the pedal when applying them. Probably
caused by water getting into places inside the booster where it should
not be.

I know that the venting hose in its place (I patched the right dog leg,
seat belt mount not too long ago).

The only possible explanation coming to my wind is water running down
inside the b-pillar and thus getting into the breather hose. I have a
rusted out wing-window/window frame on the driver's side. What about
other people experiencing this problem - is side window frame rust an
issue on your buses, too?
