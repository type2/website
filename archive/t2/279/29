Subject: Seat compability

Hi,

One question. I came accross a z-bed seat from a Vanagon 
and I was wondering if it would fit in my '69 Bus.

Thanks,

Rogelio
'69 "La Vebe"

PS. Thanks a lot for the leads on VW bus in bay area
junkyards. I found a '69 and was able to get usefull
parts out of it. (seat belts, filler neck, sliding door
hardware and panel, vent window...) Oh boy, I'm like a
kid with new toys...
