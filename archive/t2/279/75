   Could be just a simple vacuum leak...check line to the carb for
   leaks and/or perished rubber bits...

   Sounds like the one or both of the rubber seals under the oil cooler,
   not the cooler itself.
   Cheap fix,like a dollar or two for the seals but a bit of an PITA to
   access...you gotta take out  the  generator & stand,fan shroud & oil cooler
   to change out the seals.No biggie but takes a little time...

   In a Beetle,you remove the engine lid and can then remove fan shroud
   etc without removing the engine...in a Thing it may be just as do-able
   with the engine in the vehicle but can't honestly say for sure...
