   Shouldn't make any difference unless you plan to use the cursed
   009 distrubutor ...you are using the stock dizzy yea?


>Also, what dwell angle should I expect, or does it even matter?

   Well FWIW,my Compufire ignition fixes the dwell at 70 deg from memory....
   Presumably the Petronix would be similar.Someone correct me if
   I'm wrong...

   In the anything else catagory....keep your points,a condensor,a
   screwdriver and a 10mm spanner in the bus at all times to appease the
   VW Gods. That way the Petronix will give years of faithful reliable life...

   Some years ago when these things had recently hit the market for VWs,
   I bought the  Compufire kit and installed it.
   A couple of months later it left me stranded when it failed unexpectently
   late one night.Being cocky at the time I saw no reason to still carry spare
   points etc.

   The faulty unit was replaced free of charge (didn't cover the $90 taxi
   fare it cost me to get home that night however...) and the new unit has
   performed  faultlessly ever since...doubtlessly because I have spare points
   &  a condensor stashed under the front seat of the double cab...;-)
