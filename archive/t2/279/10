Subject: Re: [VB] Max RPM & Cruisin rpm of a 1600 SP

Actually, I was wondering the same thing, and was going to ask my friend
tomorrow.  I'm getting my transmission rebuilt, and for gearing, I wanted to
tell the guy, ok, this speed(assuming that I had a stock tire size) at this
RPM, you can do the rest.  Anybody happen to know?  Thanks.
