Subject: Looking for A Good Shop in So. California

I have a 1600 motor that I need to rebuild.  I want to do most of the work
myself meaning I will disassemble it splitting the case and then take the
case, crank, cam, and heads into a shop for regrinding or rebuilding.  In
the past, (Many years ago) I had the case reassembled for me and I installed
everything else, but am willing to tackle it myself this time.
 
Question
I am looking for a good shop in Southern California (I live in Rancho
Cucamonga) to do the case, crank and head work.  Please let me know if
anyone can recommend a shop.
 
Thank You
Don Miller
