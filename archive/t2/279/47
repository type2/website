Subject: Re: [T2] '77 California exhaust system needed

Craig...I go to the two pick-n-pulls in San Jose and frequently encounter
"complete" CA exhaust systems
for late bays.  Just have to be patient and check back often (at least once
a week).  I've seen busses come and go in a matter of days.  Sometimes there
will be five or six, sometimes zero.   Good Luck!
