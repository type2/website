I'm not a paint expert, but every base/clearcoat finish I have had for a
long term has ended up peeling off the clearcoat.  The way it was
explained to me was that, without pigment to block UV, the clearcoat was
vulnerable to those wavelengths and deteriorated.

These days it is virtually impossible to buy a new car without a clearcoat
finish.  The dealers say that it is because "the customers love the deep
rich finish".  I say it is because "the manufacturers want the cars
to look shabby in five years' time so people will buy new ones."

The white paint on top of my '71 is still in good shape, despite being
outside for most of its life.  Too bad they can't make paint like that any
more.
