I took out a head light tonight on my way home, rock went right through it, 
what should I do?

It is a round general electric with the number "2" on top.

Local supplier (Canadian Tire) only has a "2DL" on top, everything else 
looks identical.

Not bad price for 6 bucks.

25 bucks for halogen, but then I fear I have to do both sides.

Anyone "shed some light" on this one?

Why the number change?
