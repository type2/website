Subject: RE: [T2] Snake oil or real product

The use of magnets to immobilize ferrous wear particles is very real,
however the magnets that are sold for these purposes are typically rather
weak and ineffective. Check http://www.wondermagnet.com/dev/magnets.html for
extremely strong magnets at very reasonable prices. These magnets are not
toys and are strong enough to be dangerous to those with pacemakers. On
engines with steel oil pans, you can stick them to either the inside or
outside of the oil pan. Believe me, there's no risk of these coming off. The
#5 or a couple of the #42 magnets are good for this.... Or you can purchase
the curved magnets such as #29 and put them on your oil filter. I can almost
guarantee you that they're hundreds of times stronger than the magnet that
salesman is trying to sell you. Try the filter test with a #29. I bet you'll
see a dramatic difference in the amount of metal particles it catches.
