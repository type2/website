Alan,

The 2 vs. 2DL is immaterrial.  either will do just fine.

On halogen vs. regular, we just went thru a long thread on headlights last
week. In summary, you have three options:

Replace one regular with another - no one mentioned this because no one
really considered it.  I recommend against.  Halogens really are worth the
extra bucks.

Replace regular bulbs with "sealed beam halogens" - I like this option.
(Note that I was alone in my opinion :) Yup, they will set you back a bit
more than the regulars, and you do have to do both, but they really do
illuminate better and the stock electrical system has no problem with the
load.  They are absolutely "plug'n'play."

Replace the regular bulbs with H4 housings and H4 bulbs, either 55W or
100W.  Many people favored this option.  The best reason I read is that
they are brighter than the sealed-beam halogens.  I will let others repost
their arguements, as I do not favor them.

Comparing the prices for the three options, I went to autozone and
busdepot to get prices:

Vendor     Model                     each         Pair
Autozone   H6024 (regular)          $9.99        $19.98
Autozone   H6024VX (halogen)       $13.99        $27.98
Busdepot   HQ6014 (H4 conversion)                $34.95

At autozone, replacement H4 lamps are $7.99, BTW.  In addition, for the
H4s, if you want to run the 100W lamps, you will need heavier wiring and a
relay, which will add more to the basic cost.
