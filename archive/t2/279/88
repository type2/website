\x/ sold circular flat magnets with little spring clips to put in your oil 
sump.  Came in 25/36 and I assume also in 40hp/1500/1600 sizes.   I put one 
in my 53's engine, couldn't hurt.   I figure a speaker magnet would work just 
as well.  

    I have only pulled apart a couple vw motors that had filters on them, and 
the rod bearings looked loads nicer than those with out.  those without 
always had little marks in the bearing surface.   
Dunno how long term oil magnet would change things (w/o filter).  Muir did 
recommend a magnetic drain plug.   Are those sold by our friendly VW parts 
houses?

So I hadn't thought of bothering to put a magnet in if I had a filter on.

 plug, same goes for my most recent engine, I'm still a klutz.
 I use a magnet on a extension handle similar to a radio antenna to get
 the plug out of the hot oil.
 I noticed that I was getting minute metal particles on the retrieving
 magnet.
 Just for a hoot I tore up a Winchester Hard drive and removed the
 magnets, these are very strong magnets riveted to a steel plate and fit
 the Type IV strainer plate surface to a T. They are so strong that they
 adhere through extreme rainwater splashes and 65/75 mph speeds without
 moving a fraction on the strainer plate.
 From then on I never got any minute iron particles from my engine oil,(snip)
