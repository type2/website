Okay - maybe I've got my electricity all screwed up but if the load is 
going through the bulb - in series with the bulb - a large current flow 
will result in a bright light, low current flow, dim light. Do not run it 
parallel with the load.

Just like a dimmer switch on a light in a house.

I've not tested this, but I have fried - that is FRIED - a $20 multimeter 
by sending too much current through it on a low current test mode. Was a 
non-fused meter.

Well actually once I was done with it - it was quite fused - and melted.

Correct me if I'm wrong, I need to learn all I can.
