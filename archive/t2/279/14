Subject: backfiring, leaking oil, and undercoating, oh my!!

Hello list, thanks in advance for your help, it is much appreciated. :)

My bus backfires when I downshift from 3rd into 2nd, not like loud backfire, 
more like a....for lack of better term.....a fart.  What does this mean and 
if it's bad how do i fix it??

Also thinking about undercoating the bus in preperation for winter.  Is 
there something I can get like a Home Depot and just paint on with a brush?

Totally unrelated is my Thing.  It leaks oil inside the engine compartment 
specifically like just to the left of the pully I see it collect on the tin, 
and down in the pulley area...I'm assuming it's the seal behind the 
pulley.....also it pours out oil when parked on a slant...is this indicitive 
of the pulley seal?  One VW guy said it was the oil cooler.

Thanks,
Daniel Nelson
