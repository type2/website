Subject: Pertronix points replacement (anything else?) 

Hi Volks,
I made the plunge and bought the pertronix points
replacement for my stock dizzy and the 40,000 volt
flame thrower coil. Is there any changes recommended
when I install these such as: spark gap increase,
timing etc...Also, what dwell angle should I expect,
or does it even matter?
