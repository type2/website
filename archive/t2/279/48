I've seen Chrysler, Honda, VW and Kawasaki products with peeling clearcoat
as well.  Probably others, but I can't recall specific instances.

Problem is, the UV attacks the clearcoat, and when that looks bad the
paint underneath no longer matters.

Interesting that you think anything with the word "wavelength" in it is
science fiction.  Perhaps if you knew something of them you might know
more about that which you spray.

Caution:  easy quantum physics ahead.  Delete unless you want to learn
something :)

If you're going to discuss UV, then it is helpful
to know that UV is a range of wavelengths of light from 300-400nm, which
is shorter than the light we can see.  The
reason that these wavelengths are harmful to paint is that a photon
(that's the "chunks" or quanta that light energy comes in) of
light at these wavelengths has a lot more energy than a photon of
visible or infrared light.

When the photon hits a paint molecule it has
enough energy to change it chemically, usually joining short molecular
chains into long molecular chains that are brittle.  You can see the
effect easily on flexible plastic that is left in the sun.  It will
become very brittle as the polymer molecules link up into long chains.  In
paint, this leads to minute cracks which quickly become flakes.

AFAIK, the only way to block UV is with pigment, and in fact composite
aircraft have a requirement for a minimum pigment content in their paint
to prevent UV damage to the resin that holds their structural fibers
together.  UV and visible light wavelengths are not far apart, and usually
what blocks one blocks the other.

I doubt that we have heard it all, as we all have a lot more to learn.
Now if we could just get a polymer chemist on the list...
