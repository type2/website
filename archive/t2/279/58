I would suggest using a dome light bulb in series with the battery to see 
if it is a large load (bright light) b/c most of the $20 multimeters would 
let the smoke out if subjected to a 5 AMP load in the current meter setting.

If the bulb is bright, big load, if the bulb doesn't light or is very dim 
you might be okay testing it with the meter.
