In addtion to the other answers it's available from VWFLAPS that are EMPI or Bugpack dealers.  You can either get the socket+bit-in-one variety for $8...The bugpack tool # is 7057...

...or try Pepboys for K-D which for the same price get's your 4 bits (6-8-10-12mm I think) which fit in a  3/8" socket...

I remember ordering the triple square tool then I took a look at my cv joints and noticed they were allen heads so I cancelled my order.  When my cv boots came the bolts were triple square which I think is the modern bolt you'll come across.  You may still need a allen bit to get the old ones off depending of the bus/bug.
