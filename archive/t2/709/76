It's an option but I'm uncertain how helpful it would be.

I've typically ordered a couple times a year from some other vendors but
thought of shipping & handling as a reason to consolidate my orders and
not order one or two items at a time.

Your description might be useful for bus drivers on the road a lot who
might be stuck somewhere and need to save $ while out until they get the
part and get the bus fixed and back on the road.  Maybe membership gets
you free overnight shipping for someone in this fix.

I'd try to think up some other sort of "value added" feature to sell the
membership though....5-10% discount for members?  Some sort of purchase
points that accumulate per item and can be used at various levels for
specific items?

Free shipping seems like something that you should either offer (and
incorporate into pricing from your end) or not....Amazon makes it
available unless you need it quicker but you don't have to pay for it
(at least not upfront).  ...but then we aren't talking about books and
some items cost more to ship.
