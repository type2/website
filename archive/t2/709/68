Subject: 74 westy interior available cheep! (in philly or Balt. this 

HI Mark,
           Wish I were in a position to take advantage of the availability of 
your Westy interior... but this is not the time :-((

Do you own the "16 foot car trailer" you mention?  If so, I'd appreciate a few 
words of advice.  I have a Chev 2500HD pickup with towing package, including a 
brake controller, and am thinking about a trailer to haul several incomplete 
projects... you get the idea.  With U-Haul rentals around $80/day for local 
usage, and a scarce used-trailer picture, it would not be hard to justify 
$17001 to buy a new one.  I have no experience with electric brakes or 
inspection; nor do I know what to look for in the way of construction quality --
 would appreciate your thoughts (also recomms of anyone on the forum).

Thanx,
Glenn McComas, on the Eastern Shore of Maryland

We will be in the philly/baltimore area this weekend dropping off our 78
to its new home.  We can bring our 74 westy interior pieces for anyone
interested. Pics are at http://www.lostwater.com/74westy.htm

We will also have an empty 16 foot car trailer for anyone needing a haul
back down I-81.
