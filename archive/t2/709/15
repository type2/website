Subject: Re: [T2] koni shock settings

Just recieved my shocks from Bus Depot, ooooo a purty red shock.

but to be serious. which one is front and which back, they seem to be very
short on directions.  figured out how to adjust em basically by trial and
error.

now for some suggestions or ideas about how they should be adjusted. I
would especially like to hear from the folks that have already installed
them.

(thanks to Ron and the folks at Bus Depot for putting together this group
buy)

thanks
Bob
