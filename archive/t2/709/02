Hi Mark,

You definitely want to go shopping for the next job.

Talk to your local funeral director and ask for a referral to their 
monument manufacturer. Or just look one up in the yellow pages. Those 
guys do sandblasting all the time, and they will often pick up a side 
job for a good price. Last year we got a whole set of engine tin 
sandblasted for about $40CDN.

Happy trails,
