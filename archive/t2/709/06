I have to agree with Richard on a first-hand basis.

In my shop I charge a rather high dollar amount of money to replace the
hard drives on Apple iBook G3s and G4s.

WHY? Because I have to literally disassemble the entire iBook to get to
the hard drive, and it is a PAIN in the arse. Takes me about 3.5 hours,
all told. And I charge a premium for that time, because it is
painstaking work and I can't do ANYTHING at all while doing this. So I
charge my actually billable hours for it, and that adds up quickly. My
hands are usually cramped up for a day or two after such a job.

And yet, I still have people say "Great, when can I drop off my
computer?"

People will pay what they think it is worth to them, I guess.
