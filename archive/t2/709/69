Subject: Torsion arms

Anyone help with a problem?

I am just about to drive over to our nearest city to remove the front 
torsion arms off a 1973 bay window. The owner has already removed the 
steering knuckles and put them on ebay. What is troubling me, is after 
doing that he said he didn't know how to remove the torsion arms. It 
would probably be easier to take the whole front beam, and he didn't 
have the right tool to remove the arms anyway.

What is worrying me is, although I accept that I will probably have to 
leave the ball joints in the arms, my reading of the books is that with 
the knuckle off, all I have to do is undo an ordinary bolt, and the arms 
should slide off the torsion bars. Am I wrong?
