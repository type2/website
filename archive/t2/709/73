Subject: Re: [T2] Torsion arms

You are correct. However, when you go to put them back on, it can be a real butt-biter. I just did this procedure on my 1970 Beetle and the torsion bar leaves did not want to set back into the cross-shaped key in the inside of the trailing arm. You must insure that the torsion leaves are bundled into a precise cross pattern to insure proper fit. Easy trick- put a piece of electrical tape around the leaf bundle. It will hold the shape and will not interfere with the fit, as the tape gets pushed out of the way as the torsion bar slides into the keyhole in the torsion/trailing arm. 
 
In my case, my woes were compounded because I refused to take the spindles/brakes off, making for a much heavier, clumsier piece to work with. Next time, I'll bite the bullet and remove all the extraneous units. I know (now) it would have been much easier and less frustrating to do that. Live and learn, eh?
