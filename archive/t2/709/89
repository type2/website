Subject: copyright issues

Hi Jay,

If you read the caption that comes with George Rieger's body tattoo website,
it implies that he does indeed have an agreement of some sort with Disney to
allow him to cover his body in their artwork. He's not allowed to pose in
tattoo magazines and he's only allowed to use 2 different sanctioned tattoo
artists to do the artwork.

I have some tangential experience with dealing with Disney copyright. I work
for the Publicity section of an Air Force band, and it has been our experience
that Disney will NEVER give out permission for anyone else to record their
music. No matter how much we say please, explain that we're all full-time
professional musicians, that we don't make a dime from selling recordings
(we're only allowed to give them away, selling would be illegal...), etc, etc,
but they have never budged. You probably could get away with doing up your bus
Disney-style for a while, but if they caught wind of it, I wouldn't be
surprised if you got smacked with a lawsuit from them. And, BTW, they will
win.... they can hold their legal breath much longer than anyone on this list!
They simply don't want anyone else representing Disney who isn't on their
payroll.

It's not worth the lawsuit risk...don't mess with Disney.
