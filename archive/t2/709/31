Subject: RE:ignition switch

Hi,
Several things.  You were given some good instructions on removal.  Some 
years are a bear, some are easy.  You mentioned the switch, but then said 
you key was worn.  Note that there is a lock portion and an electricla 
switch portion to the ignition lock/switch assembly.

Just because the key ius drastically worn is no reason to replace the lock, 
though.  We can generate new keys back to new key specs quite easily.  Your 
bus originally had one key to operate everything.  If you change the 
ignition, you'll lose that feature, unless you rekey the new ignition.  
Chancesw are very good that when you try to buy an ignition, you'll be sold 
a universal lock that can't be keyed to the othersw due to using a different 
key profile.  I do have access to new correct locks, though I'm out of stock 
at the moment.

To sum it up, it's probably a worn key and not a worn lock you should 
replace.  Feel free to contact us if we can be of further help.
