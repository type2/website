Subject: Cam follower weight

My telescoping magnet isn't strong enough to pull the cam followers out of
the Type 4 case the first time. If you've watched the Raby rebuild video his
magnet can't cut it either. I'd like to buy a stronger one.

Does anyone know the weight of the cam followers? I'd like to buy a stronger
magnet for the next engine job but I don't want one so strong that it
becomes awkward to use (sticks to too many other parts).
