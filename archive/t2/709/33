Subject: Re: [T2] more on Square ports

I would be concerned about alignment of the ports. It's hard enough to
get a good seal on used heat exchangers due to warping.

I would go with the Vanagon heater boxes and install a high volume blower fan.

 Option #5 would be to salvage a set of rusted out square port heater
 boxes (79-83) and have a muffler shop cut and weld the square-port
 flanges to your existing heater box. This would be cheaper than finding
 a 1-year only heater box, but success depends on finding a competent
 and sympathetic muffler shop capable of doing the work for you.
