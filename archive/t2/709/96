For those who wanted to see the stoneguard, it's not "properly" mounted in 
the attached pics, I've only put in 2 out of  4 self tapping screws to hold 
it on between showers here, and I used the first ones I found, so they're 
not a good fit, but they show the stoneguard in the right place, if not held 
in quite the way it should be.

As I said earlier, it's definitely NOT stylish, but it's a hell of a lot 
better than a broken windscreen, the stoneguard will catch most rocks 
flicked up from the surface by other vehicles.

FWIW

BTW: Yeah, I know, Tigger SERIOUSLY needs some TLC, she'll get it as soon as 
time and money allows, she just keeps pluggin' on, she's a good old girl.
