Subject: 79 Westfalia luggage rack seal question 

Hey folks, is there a seal on the trailing edge of a
79 Westy luggage rack?  I have a new poptop seal, a
new seal for where the poptop meets the luggage rack
when lowered and a new luggage rack edging that goes
around the front and 2 sides.

There is a flat section on the rear part of the
luggage rack through which 4 bolts go to help secure
the rack to the roof.  This is the spot for which I
need to know if there is a seal.  I've looked at
busdepot, just campers, gowesty and can't find
anything and it seems like water would flow through
there at highway speeds in the rain. thanks, Greg
