Joe,

If you want to use shipping costs as a way of attracting customers, the 
best way to do so is to charge the exact shipping cost with each order. 
That means that the invoice matches the stamp. "Handling" is your 
problem, and should be part of the unit cost.

If you want to offer a bargain, do so by providing a small discount for 
orders of multiple items that will be handled all at once.

The membership idea suggests that some people will come out ahead, 
while others will have to eat the cost of shipping things they didn't 
order. One of those others might be you. I'm not interested in doing 
anything that might bust a bus part provider. I need you as much as you 
need me.

Bad idea, I think.

Mark
