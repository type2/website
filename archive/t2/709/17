Every once in a while we get a clapped out POS that
has no more value the amount of gas in it. The
customer wants something done that totally exceeds the
value of the vehicle and there is no hope of a return
on the investment. [must be a romantic attachment....]
And no one wants to work on it...
So if we can't talk them out of not wasting their
money, we 'high ball' them. Give them such a high
estimate that we are sure they will have it towed away
to a resting place. Nope.....9 out of 10 go for it. Grrrh!!
