Arnaud,

Hmmm..this is why it is usually easier to take it off and work on it.
Some acetone or paint thinner or mek poured in each end and let it sit for 
awhile usually speeds things along...but still takes a while.

The bad thing about this is that in the few that I have had to clean out 
like this, they usually end up rusting thru in about 3 more months.

Probably be better off to go get a new one.

Cheers, dave
