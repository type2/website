That's basically what I did. I just didn't make the distinction between 
shops that blast granite and shops that blast glass. I'm thinking it's 
a crucial distinction now. (There are about a dozen powder-coating 
places within ten miles, and I was only thinking to avoid those.)

As I told Chris M., I didn't want to call this guy a liar (about how 
long he took to blast each wheel), or to tell him he overvalues his 
time. I just won't go back to him, that's all.

I'm avoiding doing my own sandblasting for a lot of good reasons (BTDT).

Could be because he saw me drive up in my GTI, too.
