I don't know about the more temperate areas of the US, but I'd bet the guys 
in the desert areas would appreciate them in Summer, it was one of the more 
effective ways of keeping the bus cool without air conditioning ( which was 
VERY rare in Oz busses ).

The sun visors aren't ornaments, they're meant to, and do, cut the amount of 
sun, and hence heat, coming through the windscreen. I've got one for my '74 
Campmobile, along with the mesh stone guard to prevent the windscreen being 
smashed by rocks thrown up by other cars/trucks on dirt roads, which is even 
less stylish,. but bloody useful if you're driving on dirt roads a lot. I 
don't leave them on around town, but may consider re-fitting them if I ever 
get to do the trip around the country.
