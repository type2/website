Right I have them full soft (factory setting). My first ride felt too soft but them I realized I had not become used to them yet (much like replacing a worn out seat with new horse hair paids: wow! does that feel hard at first).

After a couple of weeks I have a good feel for them and I like them as is but the ever curious neature inside me wants to experiment: I'm going to try the 1-up setting on the front to see what the difference feels like.
