Subject: Re: [T2] Heat riser

Quick update on the heat riser : it is clogged and filled with crud in
the wole top section which runs parallel to the intake manifold (about
8 inches). With the bus lifted muffler and heater box removed, I
managed to remove an inch of carbon in three hours using 1/4 inch
vinyl coated steel cable. With six inches remaining, at three hours
for and inch it would mean another 9 hours (and maybe 20 feet of steel
cable) before completion. I'm considering  a remanufactured manifold
now.

The Monza muffler has wholes done for the heat riser. I do not know if
it came with the whole stock or if PO had the wholes drilled.
