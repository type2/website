I've heard too many separation stories about those. I'd pass. 

I'm more and more impressed with my Kelly Pathfinder Trail AP's
27x8.5x14. It snowed yesterday so there was lots of ice and hard pack
around this morning when I headed to work. Those Pathfinders bit into
the ice and snow like a dog with a nice ribeye.
