Subject: Re: [T2] sand blasting

FWIW I bought a Harbor Freight blaster and it worked well BUT buy plenty of tips. It had aluminum tips with a ceramic liner inside the tip. These do wear out. In my case I was living in Italy and I could not find replacement tips except by mail order. Buy plenty... <griN!> 

Sand: all sands are not created equal. Playground sand worked but didn't last. I also had to dry it because I recieved it quite wet. 

I try to reuse my sand to reduce my cost as much as possible. I blast over a large piece of plastic or tarp. I can buy sand intended for sand blasting from all the local tool rental places at a reasonable cost. Seems to cut better and lasts through several reuses. Heck, you might be able to rent a blaster from them too for a reasonable cost. The difference in time between a pro-setup and my home setup (pushed by a smallish compressor) was substantial. Say 1 afternoon versus several with the home setup. Cost vs. time. I usually have more time than money... <ugh!>

In Naples, Italy I bought several bags of HEAVY DUTY black sand for cheap from a warehouse that outfitted ships. If you live on the coast it might be worth a check.
