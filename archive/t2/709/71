Subject: RE: [T2] Torsion arms

>>my reading of the books is that with
the knuckle off, all I have to do is undo an ordinary bolt, and the arms
should slide off the torsion bars. Am I wrong?<<

yes. a pry bar should get them off after the bolt is loosened. my guess is
they are resting against the stops, so you may have to pry *up* & then
towards you.

anytime you are working with springs - be careful!

good luck,
