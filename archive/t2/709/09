Subject: Re: [T2] - AIRS List Project - Please Input

As I had originally said I would,  I have e-mails out with all the 
Alberta, Canada contacts on the Airs list and I will send messages to 
the contacts in both Sask and Manitoba. If we dont have anyone is B.C I 
can do those too. Things have been rather hectic work wise but with it 
slowing down I can contact those I don't hear from by Phone.

As I had mentioned to Greg some months previous I am more than willing 
to help in whatever capacity I can and I can also volunteer some 
development and graphic design services as well.

My GF had also offered to design a printable windshield brochure for 
AIRS and Type2 list if that is of interest.

Cheers,
Steve
