Hey Folks

This weekend I am going to drive my bus home after Kelly Brown the metwiz filled 
the holes.
I am very excited.  To add to the adventure my bus will only have a windshiled 
door windows and not boat on top. Its is a Safare hightop.  I have some warm 
clothes and an 12V electric blanket and hoping for the test.

Anyone want to have Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner?  My schedule is very up in the 
air other then I am flying in on Saturyday and embarcing on Sunday.  Unless I am 
passing through KY then I would like to take the Corvette Factory tour.

Any reason I should not believe MapQuests directions?
Any places to avoid?
Any must sees?
These are actually backward from the direction I am going.
