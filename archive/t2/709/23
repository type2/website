The iProduct link is a RIOT!

And yeah...it's funny about Mac users and Bus owners. One of our local
radio personalities still owns an old PowerMac 9600 and wanted to know
what it would take to do some serious upgrades to him.

Quoted a price, then gave him another price for a cheaper, much faster
system...and he still likes the notion of having a bumped-up old 9600.

Bus owners probably do similar stuff...like instead of upgrading a 69
Westy to a 79 Westy, they decide to instead do a body-off-frame resto
and have the entire loaf washed in acid first. Yeah...crazy stuff.
(This has actually crossed my mind, of course!)
