Subject: Regulator Rubber

I had the right front door apart last week and noticed that the rubber that
the window glass rests in, inside the regulator itself, was old, dry and
cracked and not holding the glass firmly as it once did.

My manuals recommend that this rubber gets replaced if the window glass is
ever seperated from the regulator.

Question:  Is this rubber of a particular variety? thickness?  Has anyone
had any luck sourcing this rubber material that bus window regulators use?
If I'm going to do the one side I'll also do the other and I prefer newer
quality materials for such things.
