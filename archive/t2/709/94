Alex has some very good points to make about copyright violations.  If you
check Gigalaw you'll find this article:

There are three major defenses to copyright infringement. The first is "de
minimis" use, that is, the amount taken was so small that it does not make a
difference. The second is that the work should not have been copyrighted in
the first place, because it was not original. The third, and largest
exemption, is fair use.

I suggest you read the Fair Use section and decide if it applies to you.


"Parody" has been used for an altered Mtv logo I made, and it's what keeps
artists like Weird Al out of the courts. By taking photos of the finished
paintjob my van, http://www.fatmedia.com/artcar/mystery/index.html and
mailing them to myself along with a letter explaining why I used the
images/logos/characters and what my planned use is I've covered my heiny if
I get pulled into court.

Hi Jay,

If you read the caption that comes with George Rieger's body tattoo website,
it implies that he does indeed have an agreement of some sort with Disney to
allow him to cover his body in their artwork.
...
It's not worth the lawsuit risk...don't mess with Disney.
