Subject: Re: [T2] Which would you choose? 

All the LT27x8.5x14s on the market that I have
seen are radial. This is a common truck tire size
and should be available at almost any tire shop. 


>My problem with recommending 28 x 8.5 tires for
a bus is the rim width.

I have a set too.  They fit fine and have no
buldge problems, even aired down significantly. 
The puncture resistant sidewalls on my 27x8.5x14
are just the ticket for driving around in the
desert, though.  A couple of pics can be seen
here:

Choose the 27x8.5x14 folder.  

My particular tires are not as stiff as my last
set of 195R14 Cooper SRMII load range D
all-seasons, and didn't improve handling as
drastically as those Coopers did.  Those
all-seasons were really good tires that handled
the snow and mud well.  

Sorry for the tire FART.
