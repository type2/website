Subject: Another question on downshifting

Recalling the thread on downshifting a week or two ago...

I just arrived in Colorado last night via driving my 84 Volvo. If the
engine hits 4000rpm (downshifting on hills) it will start blowing oil
out of the oil cap. Obviously my PCV valve (that annoying black box
underneath the intake manifold for you Volvo owners) is at least
partly clogged. I could smell oil after 10-15 seconds of 4k rpm
running.

I discovered a neat trick that may help us bus owners too...

Every 10 seconds or so suddenly let off the gas pedal completely. Just
for a moment. I was thinking the vacuum created in the cylinders would
help suck off some of the crankcase pressure through the rings. After
all, the Volvo engine has 250k miles on it and the rings don't seal
like they used to. It worked. I didn't smell any oil at all when using
that technique. A check at the next gas stop showed little oil had
come out of the cap.

What do you gurus think? Is this valid? Or am I attributing the
results to a different cause? I'm thinking reduced crankcase pressure
in any engine, VW or otherwise, would be a good thing when the PCV
valve or breather is plugged, or if the oil is overfilled.
