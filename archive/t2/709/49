Welcome to the list! Reply all will get the reply to the list and the original sender. Be sure to edit the content of the previous message to the bare minimum lest it bounced back to you by the server for excessive quoted content. 

Your bus ought to have an 1800cc Type IV I THINK... If not, then a 1700cc. Understand that the engine case will accept the 1700cc, 1800cc and 2000cc cylinders without alteration. It will also accept the 1700/1800 and 2000 cranks. It will also accept the hydraulic and solid lifter cam/lifter package (always a package, never mixed). All this means that unless you know it to be factory stock, you could have any engine displacement. In short you'd just about have to pull the engine apart and start measuring to know for sure. I had a 2.0 so I cannot comment on mpg. I have seen as low as 18 mpg and as high as 23 mpg with my stock 2.0 EFI engine. I'm Corvair powered (not running yet...) now so I've got a whole other set of factors.

Go ahead and ask about tires, electric heaters, engine swaps, oil coolers, center-mount Weber Pinto carbs, and exhaust systems now so we can break you in properly... <grin!> Reoccurring topics... Just teasing you. Check the archives and you'll be reading for weeks. 

I'll give you my regular list: check the tires for correct capacity, replace all the fuel lines/filler neck/vent lines in the fuel system to avert a fire (seems to be a given with vintage rubber lines and the bus design), replace all your rubber brake lines too. There is more detail but this will give you something to do this week. 

I think your van is a Campmobile. Someone will correct me I'm sure but the Weekender came along later in the Vanagon. That was all seats/table/poptop with bed. My goal for my bus. Search the archives for "owner's manual" and there is a link to a site with all the owner's manuals that will define your vehicle. 

Welcome again!
