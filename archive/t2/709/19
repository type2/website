Is everyone just going to try to update the current info and try to get the
current maintainer to keep the HTML pages up to date or is there still
interest in getting something set up like the page Teri Shelby did a while
back?

http://www.volks-web.org/AIRS/

Can be maintained by the people who initially put in their own info and
also by a select *SET* of volunteer "admins" to delete "deadwood" that's
reported. 

I don't like the fact that I can't easily download the entire database and
stuff it on a CD the way I can with the current HTML setup but a database
driven setup would be easier to "spread the joy" and maintain in the long
run. It wouldn't be up to one person to rewrite the HTML every time
someone's data needed to be changed.

I haven't looked at the package used but it may be possible to get it to
spit the results of a search query into a .csv file that can be downloaded
and carried along like the current HTML site.

I'd be willing to donate toward the license fee if it's a package that can
be moved to the type2.com servers for use.
