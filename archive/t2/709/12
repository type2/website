I took a piece of stiff wire and tapped it through the crud with a hammer. Wear gloves... Some sort of stiff welding rod might work. I used a piece of wire used to hold insulation against the bottom of the floor of a house (purchased at Lowe's). 

You said you are using a vinyl covered piece of wire. We used a piece of uncoated wire (broken clutch cable) which was spun the opposite direction of the twist used to keep it together so it frayed and spread out. 

Seems like I heard of someone heating the manifold and then quenching it but I'm thinking that might crack the manifold before it cracked the junk inside. 

I did remove my manifold and tapped it on the concrete and tapped on it with a hammer.
