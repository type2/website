Subject: Ignition Switch

Hey guys,

      I have 1 key for my VW Bus, and it's totally worn out. I think it's
the original. Since I'm re-doing the wiring, I'd like to also replace the
ignition lock. Can anyone tell me exactly how to replace the ignition lock?

I'm upset!! I bought the green Bentley manual, and for the life of me.. I
simply cannot find it. I don't know WHAT I did with it!!

I also had the brand new latest edition for that book.. "Keeping your VW
running for the complete idiot!" and I can't find that either!!! The only
one I have is like edition 10 of the complete idiot VW book...   ahh!!!


Thanks!!!

Todd
