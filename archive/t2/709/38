Subject: Re: [T2] 79 Westfalia luggage rack seal question 

We've just weathered some pretty heavy rains here in SoCal and I 
haven't noticed any water getting into my (unsealed) poptop. That said, 
I'm virtually certain that the seal goes only on the poptop, not on the 
luggage rack. I'm a little confused about the orientation of the seal, 
and hence mine is still coiled up in a brown paper bag on the floor of 
my bus.
