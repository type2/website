Subject: Copyright issues

Just wondering about this whole copyright issues thread - we have 
several cars over here in the UK painted and stickered as Herbie. In 
fact, there is one up for grabs in a competition, a right hand drive one 
made up by Disney UK to promote the films. Anyone have any thoughts 
about this? I wonder if copying a Disney character is different legally 
from painting one on your treasured van.
