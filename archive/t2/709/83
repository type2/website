Subject: RE: [T2] Thanks for torsion bar help

Not sure what the terms are in Europe but....

Sway bars are on the outside of the front and rear
suspension.

Torsion bars are the springs inside the front or rear
suspension. [except on older Chrysler cars and the
front of Mercedes ML's. They are exposed]

Sway bars stablize the vehicle on turns and in wind.

Sway bars do not change ride height.

Torsion bars hold up the vehicle and control the ride
in absorbing bumps.

[contrary to the mis-named shock absorbers. Shock
absorbers do NOT absorb one ounce of shock. ALL they
do is dampen the spring travel after the springs
absorb the shock]

 And the U.K. term for sway bars is?
 
  Got a bit scared when 
 someone mentioned sway bars, until I remembered we
 call them something 
 different over here in the UK!
