Allow me to suggest a third alternative. The Hankook RA08 beat the Agillis
in a head-to-head test in the German magazine Pro-Mobil Extra, and is
all-season unlike the Yoko. While not as well known as the other two brands
in the U.S., Hankook (like Michelin) is an OEM supplier to Volkswagen.  I
think their tire is a better alternative than either of the other two (and
much cheaper than the Agillis).  I say this as a long-time user of this
tire, having had logged over 100k miles on three sets of them on two
different Westies (including a cross-country trip).
