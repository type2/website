When this came up last time I had approached a couple of the database
guys at work about doing it.

"How much does it pay?"

It's for a good cause. No $$. I'll buy you lunch though.

"No thanks..."

My PHP and MySQL skills are crap. I started to learn them a while back
but my job duties changed and I no longer have time. :(

This reminds me I need to go change my info since I'm now officially
in Colorado...
