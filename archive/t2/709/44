Wie geht's, meine freunde? I am new to this list and my Westy, but not to VW's. Just a couple of questions for list vets:
 
When I want to reply to someone's post, I notice that it sends a reply back to the originator only. Is it correct that way, because it would seem that then, to send any reply to the entire list, you would have to manually insert the list address in the "to" section (I use Yahoo mail)?
 
Then, I have a stock '74 hardtop Westy. I have heard it referred to as the "weekender". True?
 
Being stock and not having studied the books (lazy git), what engine came in it?
 
It has dual carbs. What should I expect mileage-wise (understanding full well the myriad factors involved)?
 
I'm sure I'll have more questions as time goes on, but I am enjoying the amount of traffic on the list (I am on 3 other VW lists and they've been pretty calm lately). Thanks, all!
