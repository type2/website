Subject: Re: [T2] koni shock settings

Hello guys

I few month ago somebody of the list started a discution about shocks, I 
went out with my Koni suggestion that seems to be a succses thanks to 
Richard and Ron, my humble opinion is that they are superb over Monroe, KYB, 
Boge and a few other I had try before.
Maybe and it is upon the driver, you may feel in my opinion a factory 
setting a little bit soft, but as Richard said it takes a short time to get 
in the mood, but the most important I think is the driving habits do you 
have, for example I used mine in soft mode for long and that made my 
Westfalia ride like a dream, but since I am a little bit ansious and we do 
not have speed limit around here (yes I know the buses do not go too fast) 
and I have a agressive driving style,  I have been using the hard setup for 
a time now and with the Wrangler RT/S 195/R14 rated C tyres the bus performs 
like a slot car. My friends with buses do not even dare to follow me in hard 
cornering situations.
In a few words mine rides very good, sometimes I miss the soft and wonderful 
ride of the factory setting, but I can live with that.
