Subject: RE: [T2] Which would you choose?

     I am using the Yokahama tires.  Like everyone else says, they are not 
rated for snow.  If you don't drive your bus around in the snow (or mud), 
they should be fine.  I like mine just fine, because I don't drive the bus 
in the snow or mud.
     While I don't really regret buying them, I am going to buy something 
snow rated next time.  Tires are kind of a commitment.  Once you buy them, 
you are stuck with them for some miles because they are kind of pricey.  
Might as well pony up some extra dough if you have to, and get the best ones 
you can.  I will probably get the Hankook ones next time.  It's nice to have 
the option of snowy weather and mud driving, just in case.
