Hi, all,

What Alejandro says is true. There's a really nice lady in our small, 
east-central Wisconsin town who does clowning and face-painting for 
kids at festivals, fairs, etc. She charges only a token amount. She 
just loves kids. She occasionally did a Disney design on a kid. She got 
a cease-and-desist order from the big guys because someone turned her 
in. She still face-paints, but doesn't do any Disney designs. Not an 
urban legend.
