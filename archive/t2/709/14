Joe,
when you pressure wash the felt, how does the felt itself hold up?  It is at 
all damaged?

When you replace the canvas, pressure wash the inside and out. Take it to a
do it yourself car wash and blast it (outside can be done with care on the
bus, but inside must be with the top off the bus, of course). This gets all
the black crud off the outside (this is the best way to clean these, it
really works guys and gals) and as well this same pressure washing cleans
the felt inside really nice (including mold). Let it dry in the sun while
you prep for the canvas install. (that is while you pull the staples out of
the plastic strip that holds the canvas, oh and don't forget to go to the
home depot and by a powerful cordless bradnailer/ stapler) Pressure washing
the inside also gets ride of allot of the raining crystals that fall
overtime you touch the felt.

This is what I know works because we do it for all canvas replacement jobs.
We also clean and buff the top, brighten the metal trim with fine steel wool
and do a quality canvas install. We bill about 8.5 hours to do a job like
this. The canvas is $200-$350. That's a lot of money and time to get rid of
mold. But chances are that the reason you got mold is because your pop top
is needing some TLC. Don't forget the new seals.
