Yes it is possible.

You remove everything from the trailing arms out and swap.  The trailing
arms from a 73-79 will bolt right up.

Then you have to add the booster and vacuum.

Don't forget to pull the porportioning valve that goes ahead of the rear
brake circuit and insert it in the same place on your bus.

If you have drums, I'm guessing that means wide 5 bolt pattern?
If so, after the swap you will narrow 5 in the front and wide five in the
rear.  You will have to choose which to carry a spare for.

You will also need to get two wheels from the junk yard with the correct
hole pattern.

Under no circumstances, should you reuse tires out of the junk yard.  I
almost found out the hard way after laying down 100+ feet of rubber and
coming inches from taking out a light pole.  (all while stopping from
35mph!)

If you search the archives, for "disc and kn6f"  you should find the emails
where I have discussed this swap in detail.  I'm more than happy with it now
that I have new tires all around.
