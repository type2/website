Hello,
    I am new to the list today and anxious to see how this works. I have =
a '76 bus with a 2.0 l with f.i. I am just getting everything back =
together after a rebuild and have added the thermostat which was never =
there from po. I assume the flaps used to stuck open but now I want them =
to work properly since I live in Michigan and will be driving at least =
in the fall (not winter!). Here is what I see:

with the bar were the cable attaches is fully vertical(open?) the driver =
side flap is tight over the oil cooler and the pass, side flap is up =
against the top of the upper tin housing.
=20
with the bar facing the front(closed?) the driver side is raised a =
little more than half way up and the pass. side is somewhat closed but =
it doesn't seem to fit snug.

Does this sound correct??

Tony
