Subject: Oil pressure release valve??

I believe Muir refers to it as the "oil pressure release valve", it is
locted between the pushrods on cylinder #1 on a '76 2L .
If someone was to "misplace" this during a rebuild, what part would one need
to order?

Thanks in advance, and if I ever meet anyone with this problem I will let
them know ;)
