Subject: murphy's law, red light on, help?

Just yesterday I posted that my 71 was running strong, and was going
anywhere.  Today it's going nowhere.  While running errands, generator light
came on and stayed on. Pulled over to check fan belt - OK.  Drove the mile
home.  Per Muir, pushed on brushes, and sandpapered generator.  No sparks at
all, brushes felt like they were worn down to near where I was pushing, and
red light still on.  Neither Bentley nor Muir is very clear on how to remove
the generator/fan, or replace brushes while generator is still in.  I can
barely fit my head in there to see through the slits anyway.  The only other
thing I remember is about a month ago, I switched my old Aux battery for a
new marine deep cycle that I have wired through a hella relay.  The red
light came on  a day later, so  on a hunch, I pulled the fuse in the relay,
and the light went out.  Put fuse back in, and light stayed out.  This
confused me, but I figured, no light, no worries.  Was this just a strange
coincidence, or could the new deep cycle aux have somehow damaged my
generator?  I never know what to think about electrical stuff ever since I
discoverd that when I push my brake testing button, my fuel gage goes to
full.  I;m hoping I just need new brushes, but when they go, do they go just
like that?  It would seem to me they would wear, and that pushing on them
would cause a spark, even if they were worn down.  Also, are the brushes
available at a local flaps, or am I better off ordering through a vendor?

Thanks,
Don 71 Westy
