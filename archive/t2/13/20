The VW mechanic here recommended adjusting the valves just to see if 
they got out of whack.

The reason I don't think it's a valve is because of the oil spray that 
I'm getting all over the enging compartment.  I'm guessing that the 
spray is being caused by a leaky piston causing blow-by cuz otherwise 
wouldn't the presurized air just leak into the intake or exhaust manifolds?

plus it's burning a little oil..

I guess it could be both rings and seats.. errr
