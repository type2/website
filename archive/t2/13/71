Subject: Unavailable Part??

Adam,

Couldn't find it.  They have a similar part, # 071 129 967, but this is the
same one BusDepot sent me.  And it doiesn't work: too short.  The BusDepot
catalog lists it as 80-83 Vanagon; my original has part # 022 129 967AC on
it...

Anyone know where I can get one of these puppies?
