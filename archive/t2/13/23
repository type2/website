Subject: Replacing Fuel Lines

I'm getting ready to replace my fuel lines on my '78 2.0 Westy.  I bought some 
fuel injection line from a local parts store, but I'm sure it's not the great 
Mercedes line you've all recommended in the past.  Do you think regular fuel 
injection line will suffice?

Also, a majority of my fuel line seems to be metal rather than rubber.  I'm 
reluctant to replace metal with rubber.  Any suggestions?

Thanks for any help,

Beth
