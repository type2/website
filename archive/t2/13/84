Some always equate cheaper with better. A new one costs less than 1/3rd the
cost of the right one. Most of us grow out of it as soon as we become
financially responsable for ourselves and learn of neccessity how not to
waste time/money by following instructions given first. 

I don't get it,

But that's only if you apply LOGIC. A tool not in everyones bag of tricks,
particularly when cheaper is better. But I suspect it's just someone paying
his dues and learning. Don't know what's wrong. Don't know what to do. Will
do what I can with resources at hand and see what happens. Learning by
trial and error is a valid method. Most of what we know about what not to
do we learned by doing it, even though we were told not to.

Did you not have opportunity to inspect the vehicle before you purchased
it??? You are no less guilty than the PO or rebuilder for buying non-stock.

Lucky indeed, value reclaimed and put back to use. Good followup.

Is there something I don't know

We are in the age of no maintenance, use it up and throw it away economics.
The old designs that could be maintained indefinately are becoming a
passing fashion.
