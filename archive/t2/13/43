Tim, das Kapitan:
Well, there's also the matter of a proportioning valve for the rear. And two
different spare wheels if you don't change the rears.
Actually, the only parts in the front that are different are the spindles and
the hubs and a bracket on the beam for the booster.
Still, it all adds up to a lot of work.
