Dr. Tim, If you have a "Diamond-Triumph" Auto Glass  Sales/installers in your
area, try $129.00 installed for full tint, using your rubber! They've don my
'83 VW Bunny truck and a friend's '79 Van. Came out to my house(30+ miles from
shop!) and did both, real professional installation and great deal. I think
they are a national chain.

My .02 1/2.

Chris.
