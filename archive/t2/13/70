Your AFM regulates the amount of fuel that goes to your injectors (its
called an Air Flow Meter). It measures the flow of air and regulates the
fuel flow by using air temperature, air volume passing through the area
with the flapper in it.
For almost every year model the AFM will have a different part number and
sometimes it will have a suffix of A or B or other tacked on the end of
the part number.
Exchange on rebuilt are about $220.00 to $300.00 and you get about $25.00
for your core.
Used from Auto Wrecking yards the units are about $25.00 to $75.00 if you
can ever find a matching part number.
If you go looking for a used unit get your part number from the square
metal plate on top of the unit.
Unfortunately most mechanics will not give any warranty of their work if
you go in there carrying a used unit for them to install, in addition if
you buy a rebuilt unit you most likely won't get credit for your core.
If you're able to wait it out you can post your part number to the list
and probably find a used AFM from a list member.
I personally have very little faith in Rebuilt auto parts of any nature.
The new AFM is a very pricey part with numbers into the 400$ on up.
Its just a crap shoot installing either a rebuilt or used AFM.
Ken Wilford has a friend that rebuilds these units and I'd tend to trust
these hand rebuilt units better than the Jap, Chinese, Mexican or even
domestic mass produced rebuilt.
My AFM unit is the original part that came on the car and its still
working fine after 19 years. I'm just mentioning this because I think
these units have a very long lifestyle if they are properly sealed
against dust and moisture. As for myself I'd go with a used unit rather
than the over priced rebuilt because I perform most of my repair work.
If you are not a home mechanic toting around a Bentleys manual, I think
you should buy through your mechanic whether he installs a used or
rebuilt unit since you're going to want some type of warranty.
