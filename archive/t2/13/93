Subject: Distributor Shaft Removal (was: Re: [T2] Stuck valves and promises )

Mike,

it looks like my distributor drive shaft is off by 90 deg.

probably happened when i was trying to set the timing on the 009
and didn't have the dizzy clamped down -- it must've jumped.

I say this because at TDC, drive dog seated properly, the
rotor points to 5pm or 11pm.

This would account for the engine running 180 degrees off -- but
i'm saying that with the understanding that cycling through 4 cylinders
occurs over 720 degrees, so, 180 degrees off means the distributor
is 90 degrees off.  Make sense?

So now i'm trying to remove the distributor drive shaft:  no easy task!

I can't find a strong enough magnet, and, renoir's dowel rod method 
isn't working for me 
(ref: http://www.type2.com/archive/type2/020e01bf2958$2c0d6740$189762d8(-at-)renoir.html)

ugh.
