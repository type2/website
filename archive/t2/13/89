Thomas,
When the rotor is pointing at cylinder 2, it's actually cylinder 1
that's firing!  Then when it's pointing at 1, it's 2 that's firing; 3 is
3 and 4 is 4.  The 1 and 2 cables are flipped!

There is a groove marked on the metal distributor housing (with cap
removed) that indicates when the rotor is in position to fire cylinder 1
(doesn't necessarily indicate TDC because the distributor may be
turned).  That mark should be pointing to the back right (passenger) or
5 o'clock.

normal config:

3    ______     1
    /       \
   | 3     2 |
   | 4     1 |
    \_______/
4               2

or with a flipped drive dog:

3    ______     1
    /       \
   | 1     4 |
   | 2     3 |
    \_______/
4               2

               
Now, you may have a flipped drive dog, that would make your distributor
180 degrees off.  But not 90.  If it's 90, something's wrong.

Also make sure that your distributor is seated completely.  It should
lock in nicely, and when seated correctly, the rotor will have a little
bit of play but feel solid.  This "play" is actually the spring action
of the centrifugal advance.  I usually spin my rotor and push the
distributor down until I feel it lock in.  Then I push down on the
distributor casing to make sure it's seated nicely.

And if you're wondering, the drive dog will only fit in one way.

Mike
