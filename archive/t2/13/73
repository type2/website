Dear Steven.

I was interested to view your pictures of the VW-Porsche 914, 
oil-temperature sender installation plate.

Can you provide the part number of the installation plate and the screw 
thread size of the sender?

If the thread size is M14 x 1.5mm, then this plate would accommodate either 
of two VDO combined oil-temerature gauge sender and overheat switch units; 
having switch temperatures of 120 degC or 130 degC to activate a warning 
light or buzzer.

The part numbers are:- 323.803.002.002 for 120 degC and 323.803.002.007 for 
130 degC.

Regards.
          Nigel A. Skeet
