Subject: clutch problem

     Well I got the engine out.  Went pretty easy except I bent up the oil
dipstick tube.  Next time I will take it off.  I found the pilot bearing
almost completely gone.  It had a few needles left but they were all
fractured.  Most of it was just powder.  I am going to replace all while I
am there.  The clutch disc was nice & thick but you could see where it had
been grabbing.  Thanks to all again.
