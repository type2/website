Subject: Westy Tent zipper fixes?

Hi,

I need to affect some repairs to the Westy Side tent. The subject 
tent is the Standard orange and blue 68 to 79 tent. I believe this 
one to be form 1973. Several of the zippers are broken i.e. the 
zipper got stuck and off track. I think I can fix that but I will 
gladly accept any advice on the matter. I am also missing the pull 
part of one of the zippers( the handle and the thing that locks the 
teeth of the zipper together) for the part that goes next to the bus. 
I was missing when I got the tent and never really worried about it 
but I might have need of closing the tent off.  Is this a standard 
part(not even sure what the pull part is called.) Any one have a 
source for them or a spare they would like to donate to the cause?

Thanks
Chris
