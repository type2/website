whoa.  ok, now i'm seriously confused.

I'm just about to put my dist. drive shaft back in but decide
to do some sanity checking first:

bentley and muir say:  the slot in the dizzy drive shaft should be
perpendicular to the seam in the case.

looking at my vacuum advance dizzy and dizzy driveshaft, I note
that if i install the dizzy with the slot perp. to the seam in the
case, my rotor will fire like this:

 3    ______     1
     /       \
    | 2     1 |
    | 3     4 |
     \_______/
 4               2


this is how it had been firing and why, compared to the "normal config" 
listed above, coupled with the fact that my engine was running 1 cylinder
ahead/behind of itself, I thought my dizzy drive shaft had gotten flipped.

but now i note that it had been installed to spec:  what gives?

I had assumed:  perhaps very incorrectly, that the drive shaft had slipped
over a notch.  If not, did i just do my valves wrong and had the timing
seriously off, or...?

man, am i confused...
