IIRC, I bought one from Bus Depot.  You can also use a (I think) 6mm bolt here.  Be sure that it has a long enough unthreaded part so 
that the pivot isn't bearing on the threaded portion.  I used a nylock nut on it, since you can't tighten it down.  Works dandy.

Put some thick grease on this pivot when reassembling.
