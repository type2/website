You need everything from the spindles out.  You also need a proportioning valve from a '71-up.  You might want to go to the vacuum 
booster system depending upon the strength of your right leg.  You will then have to carry two spares, as the bolt pattern of the discs are 
different from the wide-5 of the drums.

If you do this, get your parts from a '73-up bus.  They have thicker, longer-lasting pads.
