Sorry to bug y'all, but I bought a '68 bus with many
p.o. mysteries:

I finally got some time to ponder my engine. From the
engine no., it appears to be an earlier 1500, which is
ok by me. (I owned a '66 splittie in another life)
1.I've got a vacuum takeoff near the adj. screws that
connects to the dist. Seems right.
2. one that goes right out the rear of the carb with a
hose with a screw in it.
3. one that comes out of the pipe that the carb sits
on top of, also has a plugged hose.
runs fine so I guess the above is ok.

The weird thing is the p.o. taped over the outlets on
the fan housing that blow air to the heater boxes.
instead, he hung a pair of electric blowers from a
newer(?) bus on the top of the engine compartment and
had them connected to the heater exchangers. There's a
switch on the dash that activates the blowers. Except,
due to poor wiring, it only works sometimes. (BTW, he
heater box outlets are tied closed and disconnected
from what is left of the pipe the carries air forward.
Most of the duct work is gone in the defrosters, etc.

Until I figure out what's what, i'm going back to what
I think is the conventional connection.Anybody want a
couple fans.

Also next to the approx. 3" holes in the sheet metal
above the h. boxes, there are two 1" holes that are
open apparently to the exhaust. What comes out of
those. Should I cover them? P.o. also cut an
assortment of additional air slots (gills) in the
corner of engine compartment. I'm covering the ones
that go down towards the ground and the exhaust. He
put addition ones in the side -- similar to what you
would find in a splitty-- and covered them with
plastic scoops. I figure that can't do any harm. (?!).

Keep in mind, the bus seems to run strong and cool.
But it had been sitting for a few months and the p.o.
couldn't tell me much about the modifications because
some came with it and others had been put in place by
his kids. Allegedly, the engine had been rebuilt 5K
ago.

Does any of this seem unhealthy.
