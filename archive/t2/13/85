well, funny that. 

so, I managed to free the valves (followup on that in a second), but
the engine is still running 180 degrees out!

scenario:  71 bus, 1600DP, vacuum advance dizzy (popped it back in as I figured 
							out the issue with it)

1. confirmed TDC with screwdriver

2. rotor points towards to 2:00 pm (towards the FRONT (FIF) of the bus and to the
right) at #1 -- doh!!!

so i guess I moved the dizzy drive shaft around 90 degrees somehow when
I was swapping dizzys, but how???

curious.  

mike, thanks for going through (confirming) where the rotor would be 
in terms of a clockface.  it really helped (as in, my predicament finally
sunk in).

ideas on how i broke this (and how i fix this) appreciated -- i'm off to hit
Muir and Bentley for a solution.

go go gadget type2 list!
