Subject: Dist. Drive Shaft Removal, et. al:  FIXED!


Maybe I should keep quiet until the bus is running, but
using renoir's dowel rod method, I managed to get the 
distributor drive shaft out and reposisitioned!

whee!

see: http://www.type2.com/archive/type2/020e01bf2958$2c0d6740$189762d8(-at-)renoir.html

for more info on how to, although I'll try to do a writeup for the
library sometime soon.

whee!

that, the valves are unstuck, i still have compression in the
stuck valve cylinders and...yeah...go go gadget type2.com!

thanks volks!
