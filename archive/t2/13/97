Subject: distributer drive endplay

Helo--

I am putting together a 1600 engine using a new case
and an old distributer driveshaft and shims. According
to Wilson, the distributer endplay should be between
0.020 and 0.050 in. My endplay (with shims) is about
0.070.

A local shop told me that extra shims can lead to problems,
and to just go with the originals. Bentley and Haynes do
not even address the issue of endplay, nor do they give
a spec.

Who to believe?
