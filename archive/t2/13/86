I simply disagree. The AFM units cannot be recalibrated anywhere except on
a Bosch bench. They hold the procedures to do this and the data as secret.
Anyone else is guessing. It's a glorified practice of poking screwdrivers
and juris rigis, doing something to see what happens without the specs, as
opposed to using knowledge given to solve the problems. Any mechanic that
practices in this way for long is certainly going to be busy with too many
comebacks in a few days/weeks/months if such attitude affects their SOP.
How many of those clients are going to be happy with the money they 'saved'
a short time later when they now must add the cost to do it right this
time, no more than it would have cost to do it right the first time?? 

I don't have a clue whether that method works well or not with Chevies and
Fords or Toyotas. I know that method will never earn anyone a good
reputation with German machines. In my mind, it's ignorance allowing
incompetance with the natural result poor results too many times.
