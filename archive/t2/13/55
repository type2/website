My wholesale cost for a Sigla (OEM) T-II widshield (they come only with
tint across the top) is $190. $292 is not at all out of reason for
installed factory OEM, but that's not for a specially designed to be thin
and cheap, low cost, loss-leader, wannabe, no name, repro glass. There is a
large difference as well between seals with value designed out and a
quality OEM seal designed to fit right. I've never used a WCM seal, but
many have and attest to their quality and fit. Some of the body and glass
seals I've seen are just junk and laughable. Spend all the time you like,
weeks, and they cannot be made to fit right and seal.  

Too many people just assume if they can't get a big discount from the going
rate for quality goods and services, their being ripped off. So be it. I
can spot you types in a minute and direct you to someone else wasting the
very least of my time.
