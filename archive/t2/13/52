Subject: <Sigh> Windshield Cracked

Hey Folks,
     Ain't been a good week for me, Wednesday my company (Fujitsu) announced
they are closing my division, so for the first time in 28 years I am out of
a job! Given that, I decided to reinstall my old fogged at the bottom
windshield rather than spring for a new one. With me on the inside pulling
the cord and my wife on the outside holding the glass, we were almost done
with about 12 inches to go, when I said "Let me seat this corner a little"
and with one very light tap, the glass shattered. Oh well, I believe this
was the original windshield, and as I said, was fogged at the bottom and did
have one star crack in the middle, so no big loss. I'm thinking of taking it
to shop, can any listee's in the N. Virginia area recommend a good glass
shop? I had already called Safelite, and was not impressed, as they wanted
$65.00 for the seal, which as you all know costs $19.95. Total cost from
them was $293.00 installed. Yeah, sure. Please let me know if anyone has a
place they've used and were satisfied with the work.   TIA, Jeff
