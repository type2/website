What I woud do to locate the problem, if I thought it was a vacuum leak,
is get a can of either, and gingerly spray it at the vacumm hose
connections.
If the RPM picks up---you have a leak.

Don't go nut's with this stuff, could cause a big bang if you go wild
with the spraying----just give the connection points a little shot, it
doesn't take too much.
