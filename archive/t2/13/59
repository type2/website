Subject: Clutch cable replacement questions

I'm in the middle of replacing the clutch cable in my 75 bus. Started
out as a precautionary measure before I put the engine back in, but I
found a few things of concern.

1. The clevis pin that holds the cable to the pedal assembly and the
hole in the pedal assembly are both quite worn. I'm afraid either one
will break soon if not repaired. I intend to weld the hole in the pedal
assembly closed then redrill it in the proper location and size. The
problem is I cant find anyone who sells the pin. Any body know where to
get one or have an extra?

2. The new cable has a black plastic tube around the cable near the end
of the cable that attaches to the pedal assembly. It is tight around the
cable, I think it is to prevent wear as the cable passes the vacuum
assist unit? There is also a clear tube on the cable that is not tight.
It's located between the threaded end of the cable and the black tube.
The clear tube is loose enough to slide back and forth on the cable.
Does it have a purpose? Checked out Bentley, Chilton, and Hayes. No
Mention of these tubes on the cable.

3. Bentley mentions two dust boots that should be installed. My bus had
neither but I have purchased 2. I know one goes on the open end of the
boden tube. Does the other go on the front end of the guide tube where
you insert the cable. The new boots seem too small but I think if I soak
them in hot water they will go on.

Any info will be put to use quickly. Thanks in advance!
Tom
