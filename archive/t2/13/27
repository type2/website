Subject: clutch question

My '70 bus clutch went out. So I yanked the engine to put in a new clutch
and much to my amazement the flywheel stayed in the bell housing. Fearing
the worst I pulled the flywheel/clutch assembly out and started examining
them for further damage. The clutch plate, pressure plate, and throw out
bearing were worn, but no catistrophic failures. The bolt holding the
flywheel on looks like it just backed out. the threads weren't even bunged
up.The dowel pins though is another story. The pins themselfs are OK, but, 3
of the 4 holes are elongated in both the flywheel and the crankshaft. My
question is can I put a new clutch, pressure plate, and throw out bearing in
and get maybe 300 more miles out of it? The reason for that is my garage is
full of building materials for a house project that I should be done with in
4-6 weeks. Then the bus is going in the garage for restoration. Until then I
need to move it around to keep the city off my back.
Thanks
