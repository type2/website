Subject: 1971 Campmobile accessories

I am new to the list, having just purchased a 1971 Campmobile. It is a fine 
vehicle, three owners (including myself) full records, manuals, etc.. with 
upgraded performance engine and almost all the original accessories, including 
the tent(!). I am looking for the stool and the ice box tray. Any ideas?
