Subject: Wiper motor & switch compatibility, for different model years

Noticing recent postings about 1971 VW Type 2 motors, I was wondering 
whether it is possible to use the steering-column mounted wiper switch of 
the 1973~74 VW Type 2 with the 1972 VW Type 2 wiper motor, which would 
normally be used with the dashboard mounted switch.

If so, which terminals on the 1973~74 steering column switch, connect to 
which terminals on the 1972 wiper motor. According to my Robert Bentley 
Manual wiring diagrams, the motors and switches of the 1972 & 1973~74 model 
years, seem to have different connections!?

If practical, I intend to help a friend upgrade his 2366cc, VW Type 4 
engined, 1972 VW 1600 Type 2, so that he can easily find and use his 
windscreen wipers & washers, on dark, rainy nights, when lorries deposit a 
ton of dirty spray on the windscreen, as they pass!

Regards.
