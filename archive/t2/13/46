Well, I brought up Google, keyed in the part number and "vw" and got the following reference:

http://w1.316.telia.com/~u31614134/lager%20FB%20200101%20ut.pdf

Which lists the part number you specify as "211 415 671 signalknapp, helsvart"

Being an American, my knowledge of languages is shamefully inadequate, particularly when scandinavian languages is concerned.  I 
think this is in Swedish.

More poking about on Google for "signalknapp" yields:

http://user.tninet.se/~mje633s/ignition.html

Which shows a picture of a "signalknapp" which is apparently a momentary push button switch, perhaps a horn button.  Since your piece 
of plastic is about 2" in diameter, this might be it.

I pulled the horn button off of my '71, and inside is inscribed "211 415 671"

Case closed!  :)
