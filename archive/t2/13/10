Subject: New Bus Owner

Hey List,
I am a new list member and a new bus owner.  My wife and I purchased our 
first bus just months ago.  Without really knowing what we were doing we 
plunked down our money for a 78 camping bus.  With some research we have 
identified "Joe" as being a ASI Riviera.  We have the Pop-Top model which is 
just the small pop-top designed to give you headroom for cooking and moving 
about.  We love it!  I changed the oil and other maintenance and headed out 
for Yellowstone National Park.  Absolutely no problems.  But I have a lot to 
learn about these things.  My Rivi has an auxiliary battery to run the 
refrigerator and other items.  I am trying to figure out if a can recharge it 
off the distributor while I'm driving or if I need to charge it out of the 
bus with a battery charger.  I haven't located a switch or anything as of 
yet.  I would appreciate any help you have to offer.  Thank you!

Mike and Emily Van De Voorde
