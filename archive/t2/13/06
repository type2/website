I use 5/76 and earlier Ford Courier rocker buttons, Part # is D27Z-6549-C,
and they only cost a couple bucks ea when I bought mine 20 years ago ;-)  I
bought 2 spares but have never needed them.

Subject: [T2] swivel foot adjusters?


hello all. does anyone out there know where I might get my greasy little
mitts on a set of swivel foot, or is it feet or perhaps footi ;) adjusters
for a '78 2L FI engine with hydro lifters? Anybody see a reason why I
shouldn't use them if they are available? Guess I'll also need to know where
to get the shims/spacers/etc..to keep the VT geometry correct, right?
Thanks,
