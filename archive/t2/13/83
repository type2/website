Subject: RE: AFM Diagnostics was: type2 Digest 

Hello,

 I just wanted to put in my $.02 worth!! The AFM should never be opened
according to the tech manuals I have read....but that doesn't mean the PO
didn't do it!!!  I managed to successfully adjust the flapper in my AFM when
the PO (or mechanic) decided to richen up the system to compensate for
vacuums leaks. I'm certain there are many competent mechanics out there who
would know how to properly readjust the spring to get it back into
specs....but only if the cover has been unsealed!!!

If you find a mechanic willing to charge you to open the AFM and try to
tweak it, find another mechanic. This fellow is unknowledgeable. Bentley
gives full procedures for validating the AFM. If it is putting out bad
data, replace it. If it responds correctly to test procedures, it's not
your problem. If your mechanic will not first follow given procedures to
insure results, find one who will. Sounds like he did determine from
inspection a problem with the AFM. Does he have the Bentley manual?? If
yes, why do you question his opinion???  What is his reputation in the
community?? Can he be trusted to give an honest opinion every time??? What
experience with Bosch systems does he have?? Does he have REAL tools or
Craftsman???? Ask him if he will warrent his diagnosis.
