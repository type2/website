I might consider that due to the higher gearing of your tranny, the cooling 
fan is spinning slower per rpm.

Also for each 10 mph, the power required to push the air increased (squared 
or cubed - can't remember).

So you are making you engine working harder for two reasons - higher gear 
ratio (which in the context of a lever - it takes leverage away from the 
engine and gives it to the vehicle. The vehicle has more leverage over 
forward momentum than it had. Or you could consider a 10 speed bike - you 
are now forcing your bus to operate in one gear harder than it used to).

The other reason it is working harder is because you are pushing 'more 
wind' at 75 mph than at 65 mph or even 55 mph.

Any time your engine is working harder you will see higher temps - be it 
the oil or the temperatures of the metals themselves.

Enjoy your bus!! Take care!
