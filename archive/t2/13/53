Subject: Re: [T2] Mountain passes in NC

I made the trip through the pass, in the company bus, with the barely
bbroken in Powerstroke engine....I was loaded only with enough parts for a
911 engine we had went to pick up......Made the trip in fourth gear, the
heads were a bit warm (-at-) 405,(the hottest it has ever gotten)....That pass
does not play......

Out west I made a few trips into those mountains, but usually we dipping and
diving through the passes at 120 knots, and tree top level...Its kinda weird
to be 40 feet above the trees and the altimeter reading near 8,000 feet!!lol
