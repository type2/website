Certainly, if they have a flow bench handy. That's what, maybe 1 in 100
shops?? But the bench alone won't do it. You also must have someone skilled
to operate it. I warrent that a new AFM is less costly, and certainly a
whole lot faster, as regards billable time, and most certainly longevity of
results.

 I'd warrant it would take about 20 minutes or so

So, if anyone needs engineering skills, please apply to John. Be sure to
verify the rate required to hire this level of skill. An aero department is
even better than a flow bench, but I don't know anyone who could afford to
hire Boeing to recalibrate their AFM.

 From there is would

When wear is the problem, the assumption must be that parts are required.

And if it doesn't and you don't have the aero department available,
replacing it is far more wise than dinking with it.

That's just superb. That's what I would do if I couldn't live with good
results from factory procedures, and had the extra money laying around or a
benificent supporter for a race team.

 More than a few companies do it for high performance

Indeed, stock ist best. Doesn't require specialized equipment or procedures.

 The only reason Bosch written FI manuals say to keep

That's not the only reason. Another is that it opens the door to
contamination. Another is any tweek you do to a spring that is out from
having lost it's temper has nothing whatsoever to do with recalibration.
You can't recalibrate, by definition, if the parts aren't spec. Have you
seen the spec for the spring loading?? Just one of many things you would
have to reverse engineer to KNOW what your are doing, as opposed to guessing.

Couldn't agree more, particularly if I don't have the data and record of
the engineer who was in there tweeking and 'recalibrating'. At the very
least I want to see his/her resume so I can deterime if he/she has the
credentials required of someone who could be expected to honor the title of
engineer and is competant to expand upon criteria of the factory team
he/she follows.  

However, I'd be willing to bet that the original vanagon list

And the one's who tried that then had to replace it anyway with another
weekend or two of futzing around less than a year later are generally
disinclined to advertise there foolishness by reporting the poor results
and additional lost time/money.

I have no problem with owners experimenting on their vehicle in whatever
manner they deem appropriate for their intended purposes. I draw the line
when someone HIRES someone to fix the problem and then this vendor ignores
given procedures 'cause they think they know better, then bill it as an
effective repair.
