Just what I was going to suggest! ;-) Really old rawhide leather belts
are the best, but just about any belt will work.

I've done the screwdriver trick before too, and it can work but is
messy and you run the risk of shearing the thin metal housing of the
filter.

Sears sells an awesome filter wrench that uses a 3/8" ratchet. It is
universal and adjustable. As you turn the wrench to loosen the filter,
the wrench itself tightens and bites down on the filter. It's really
small and fits in my little emergency toolbox.
