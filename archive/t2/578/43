Subject: Scrapping 1973 Auto 1700 Westphalia.

End of an era: I'm scrapping my 1973 Automatic 1700 Westphalia Camper.
It seems a shame to send her to the scrappy, but I've too little time,
and her bodywork was beyond rescue if I'm honest.  I'll be pulling the
engine for a future project, but the rest is up for grabs if anyone is
in need of any parts.  She's got good glass and seals all round,
there's a 3/4 rock and roll bed, most of a very dated and used
interior, and of course the automatic transmission was a little leaky,
but otherwise healthy.  If anyone's in need of some spares, drop me an
email.  I plan to tow her to the scrap yard next weekend, sans engine.
