Everything should swap over from the non-doghouse shroud with the exception 
of the linkage that connects the flaps.  The non-doghouse linkage runs through 
where the DH oil cooler goes.  There's *supposed* to be foam sandwiched in
between the cooler and the doghouse itself, but it's usually gone (disintegrated) 
by now.  I've seen kitchen sponges used on a couple of swapmeet oil coolers 
I've picked up over the years

The sealing tin you're referring to is probably the "Hoover Bit" -- there's a set of
instructions fabricate one .. someplace.  I *think* there's a link in the type2.com
library, but I've never looked too hard; I've hoarded a few of them over the years
so don't need to make one (yet).
