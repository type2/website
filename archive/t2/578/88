Subject: Buses at SpaceShipOne flight

Just got back from Mojave after watching the flight.  I was plesantly
surprised to see several bay and splitty buses in the parking area.  Buses
seem to be popular with space geeks!  Anyone else from the lists attend
the event? Perhaps we should make the next big flight a bus campout!
