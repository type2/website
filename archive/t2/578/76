Subject: RE: [T2] battery light?

Your "battery" light is your alternator light (I'm pretty sure the '72 has an alternator). Anyway, at low RPM's the voltage regulator may not be able to maintain the system voltage quite as high as normal. Mine does that too. As long as it is only visible at night, and doesn't come on to full brightness I'd consider it normal.
