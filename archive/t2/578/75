I got the bus depot canvas for my 78 and on careful measuring, found the
height of the canvas shorter than the stock- and for that reason,
fastened it to the bottom first, then stapled it along the top without
doing the fold over the plastic edge piece.  Actually much easier this
way, the staples are covered with trim from a fabric shop.  It is still
tight with the arms extended.
