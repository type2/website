Subject: master cylinder leak

I've been fighting brakes in my '69 Westy since it's purchase four 
years ago.  I have done all the rubber lines, all wheel cylinders and 
shoes, inspected all the steal lines, and replaced the master cylinder. 
   While replacing the master cylinder I stripped threads off of a steal 
line and replaced it.  I have no leaks at the wheel cylinders or where 
any lines meet.  I do have a leak at the master cylinder.  It seems to 
be at the rubber seals where the plastic brake fluid resevoir meets the 
master cylinder.  I have ordered a set of these and will replace them 
as soon as they arrive (go BusDepot).

My question concerns the brake pedal.  I have brakes.  They are firm 
and stop the bus well.  I pull to the right slightly...I need to 
readjust the shoes as it has been a couple 100 miles since there were 
installed.  The problem is...the brake pedal stops about three inches 
from the cab floor.

Can enough air be escaping at the leak to cause the pedal to be sinking 
that far without pressure?

My logic may be very, very false here...

Any thoughts would be appreciated.  Also any thoughts on how to further 
seal the resevoir to the MC.

thanks,
mjr
