Subject: Clickety-Click CV Joint

69 Bay window

What are good ways to verify that one's CV joint is on its way out?

A couple of weeks ago I began to get a squeak. I couldn't tell if it was
my driver's side front or rear wheel. Now when rolling to a stop I can
hear the faint clickety-click of what I think is a CV joint on its way
out. I think the squeak and click are the same thing, where it squeaks
when rolling at faster speeds and turns clicks when rolling to a stop.

Could someone please tell me if what I'm thinking sounds correct.

Are there any other diagnostic tests that I should conduct to verify the
problem?

What are people's opinions of the rebuilt half shafts that autozone and
advance auto sell
