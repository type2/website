Subject: Re: [T2] carb rebuild website?

One recommendation is to take a GOOD look at the throttle plate section 
to see if the small hole below the plate on the inside of barrel is 
mushroomed or not ... this can make the carb REALLY hard to adjust 
properly. If the previous owner overtighted that little wee needle 
sharp screw it makes things considerably less scientific. Also a good 
look at the plate/plate action and the bore around the plate to check 
how it seats and if there is excessive wear.

The rebuild itself is very straightforward, tuning, balancing etc. 
afterwards is a whole 'nother kettle of fish.
