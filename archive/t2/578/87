Another thing to check is your Air Flow Meter(AFM). On
my 79 when the motor was rebuilt one of my valve
springs broke which caused it to backfire, which in
turn destroyed my AFM. I first replaced my valve
spring, but it still wouldn't start, finally I tried
another AFM, then it would run.
Hope you can get it going.
