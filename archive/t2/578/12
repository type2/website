Karl,
Say it isn't so... Is there no way around this??  I currently have no
vehicles running (have had 3 different engines die in the last 3 weeks) and
am stuck at the house, so a drive to the salvage yards is not an easy task.

Several people mentioned wiring up with a regulator from a 72 bus so I
bought one yesterday as someone gave me a ride home from work.  I just can't
figure which wires go where and how to incorporate the regulator in to the
mix.

:(
