Subject: Gas gauge problem

My '77 Westy's gas gauge always reads dead empty - the needle is pegged 
low. I put a meter on the wire and see an oscillating signal - the needle 
bumps up once or twice a second. Is that normal?

My fear is that there's a sender problem. How does one access the sender?

(And, yes, there's plenty of gas in the tank!)

Thanks much,
Jack
