The nasty way is to hammer a screwdriver through the filter and use it as
a lever.

However, if the filter is stuck and the thin filter shell tears with ths
"bubba" technique you are really in a mess.

I'd forgo the filter change until you have the proper tools.  Another 1000
miles on a filter isn't going to cause any problems.
