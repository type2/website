Subject: carb rebuild website?

Hello,

Well I am almost ready to start rebuilding my PDSIT 32-34 3 (right side) 
carb from my 1700 engine. I have my Bentley, Haynes and Clymer manuals ready 
to go. All I would like now is a website that shows a carb rebuild for the 
non-mechanic type like myself. Are there any good ones out there?

Also, I have four carbs to pick from to rebuild. Most of them were picked up 
at swap meets over the years.  So I have know idea of there history. Any 
tips on what to look for? What makes a good rebuild candidate?

Thanks in advance, Phil.
