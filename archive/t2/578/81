Subject: 30 AMP generator coupled to Voltage Regulator for 38 AMP. At

Threw a motor previously living in a 66(12v) split into a 70.
Ran for about 200 miles before no start exisited. Suspected aged starter (it
had it's days in the past, on alternator supplied juice, hell 34 years use
ins't bad), replaced to enjoy a fine soleniod click, and a fine radio.
Battery tired.

Battery to be replaced with new gel cel, but realization surfaces.


70 bus = 38 amp gen and regulator
66-67-68= 30 and matching regulator.

So ,understanding little the nuances of voltage regulators, I simply ask:

Will this work?

I have no problem ordering the 'right' regulator, just want to know if that
battery I toss in tonight is best spared until proper toys accquired.

If someone could explain the function method of a v reg to me, I would enjoy
that, as far I consider them a fine silver box controlling voltage, with
mysterious insides.

Thanks,
AL
