Subject: Wheel Cylinders

Well, yesterday I was (finally!) doing the brakes on my bus...

Front pads & rotors were beautiful. Easily 1/2" of meat on all front
pads, rotor had zero grooves. Sweet. Put the new pads I bought back in
the bus. No noticable play in wheel bearings either. Woot!

Pull off right rear wheel. Bentley says to remove the two bolts,
loosen the shoes, and remove the drum. Riiiiiiggghhhhttt..... After 30
minutes of work with PB Blaster and a leather mallet the drum finally
comes loose. No grooving of the drum at all, but it's got a coating of
black film. Rub with brake fluid and a rag to get the crap off, then
clean with carb cleaner. Drum surface is perfect. Inspect the shoes.
Lots of meat (as I saw through the inspection hole) but the friction
surface is black. In fact everything is oily and nasty.

I figured I'd need to replace the wheel cylinders (among other things)
due to the fluid contamination. At least one is leaking, so time to
replace both.

Autozone has generic ones for $25. Napa ranges from $21 to $35 and
also carries a $9 rebuild kit. Busdepot has $15 ones and $7 ones
("Indian made"). Has anybody used the $7 ones from BD? Any advice with
the rebuild kits?

I'll probably buy the $15 BD ones, but like keeping my options open.

Thanks!
