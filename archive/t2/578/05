Does that regulator have any designations for the colored wires? I think 
this is how it goes

Brown          = D-
Green           = DF
Red(small)     = D+
Red(big)       = B+  This goes straigh to the starter.

Now there should be a blue wire(small) in there some where that is the lead 
to your instrument cluster Generator Light, this has to be connected to D+ 
at th regulator side.

Hope this helps and is correct I am going from the notes in my Hanes for the 
Type I that gave me fit last time I did this. But looking at the Bentley it 
seems to make sense.

Good Luck,
