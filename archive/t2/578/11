Subject: Re: [T2] Type 1 engine Alternator Wiring instead of Gen

From: "davi the mad" :

 Alternators are easy!
Big terminal to battery (wire from regulator to +battery or big post on
starter depending how you're set up).
Little terminal to dash light.
Wire as necessary.

This is true IF you use a Bosch alternator with the internal regulator.

Snoopy, unfortunately, is not.......

He has a bug Motorola alternator that needs the external regulator.
He needs to go to a wrecking yard and find a bug that used the Motorola alt and hopefully
still has the Motorola regulator under the rear seat on the left side AND still has the harness between the
regulator and alternator..... good luck!!
