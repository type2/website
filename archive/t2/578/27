Subject: Just installed new Westy canvas on a 78 and have a question

This is for a friend that does not have computer access.

He installed the new canvas from Bus Depot (looks nice) but on the front,
where the metal supports push forward at the "elbow" it rubs the canvas and
he is afraid it will rub thru.  Everytime he pops it now he puts a piece of
rubber between the canvas and the "elbow"

Is this how it is supposed to work? Or is the canvas installed wrong or
maybe event the legs bent?

Any ideas on how to correct the problem?
