Subject: Bus Depot Heads

Hi Folks,

My heads are visiting my Reputable Builder for rebuilding, and they are in 
pretty bad shape.  The cost to rebuild them is pretty steep, and I'm 
researching lower-cost alternatives.

That said, has anybody had experience with the $189 heads that Bus Depot 
offers?  Mr. Salmon, could you weigh in with some details about the improved 
valve seat design?

Thanks in advance for any help or suggestions.
