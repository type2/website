Subject: Ball joint replacement

I am replacing the ball joints on my '71.  I have the torsion arms and ball joint combo from Bus Boys.  Everything is disconnected
and I'm ready for the arms to come out.    If I was to do this again, the stops would be the first thing to come off when the wheel
is still on.  I am able to raise the upper torsion arm with a crowbar, but hw in the world do the rubber stops that the upper arm is
resting upon come off?  Please lay your wisdom upon me!
 
Joy thru air,
