Subject: battery light?

Does anyone out there know why I might be getting a flickering battery light on my dashboard in my 72 Westy?  As we were leaving the Dead shows at Red Rocks last night in a LONG stream of cars the battery light would start glowing ever so slightly while we were standing still.  It never fully lit up like it does when you turn the ignition on.  As soon as we were out on the highway, I didn't see it again till we got off the interstate in Colorado Springs and were sitting at the light on the off ramp. 
 
I didn't get a generator light or anything like that.  She is still running like a champ, just curious about that light.
 
Thanks
