Subject: buldging pop top fiberglass

Hi,

I have my fiberglass top buldging out on the passenger side so that when it is
in the down position it is rounded out.

Also, the tent fills the passenger cabin as it "puffs" out while driving.

There is some mechanical "give" up on the front of the pop top. Are there
adjustments I should be doing???

The books don't deal with this much.

Alan
