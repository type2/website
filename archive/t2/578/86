Hi Mark,

Jason Laster made some excellent points, but I will add one more 
thing...

If you have an exhaust leak (even a small one) you will hear backfires 
as fresh air mixes with unburned gas when trailing the throttle. (AKA 
downshifting or engine braking)

The fuel injection system relies on vacuum.  Chances are good that the 
backfire you heard blew the brake booster  vacuum hose off the coupling 
on the center plenum. Or it might have blown one of the vacuum lines 
off the S-pipe between the throttle body and the AFM. Until this is 
fixed you are going to have a lot of trouble getting the bus to start. 
The vacuum hose system is designed to fail in the case of a backfire in 
order to keep from damaging sensitive components in the AFM. Without 
proper vaccuum connections a running engine won't make much power.

Check all your vacuum lines carefully and see if it will restart. 
Richard Atwell has an excellent description of how the vacuum lines are 
run on this page:

Happy trails,
