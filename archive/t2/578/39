Subject: I need dog house shroud parts! 1600cc SP-DP swap

Hello list,

I am going to pull the stock single port 1600cc engine
from my 68 bus soon to replace it with a new dual port
engine that I had built. the 1600cc DP is complete
with all the original sheet metal and shroud. I am
installing a dog house shroud to this engine, but the
flaps on the used one that I bought were frozen open.
I tried to free them over the past several days with 
penetrating spray , but when I pulled them out of the
shroud, I found that someone had brazed them open.
Nice, right? They don't look salvageable so I need
some new ones. My question is, will the flaps from the
68, non-dog house shroud fit in this dog house shroud?
I also need the linkage that goes between the flaps.
Will the rest of the thermostat linkage from the 68
shroud work with the dog house? I also need the piece
of tin that seals the base of the dog house oil
cooler. On type IV engines, there is a rubber seal
that seals the oil cooler to the shroud so that the
air does not bypass it. Is there suppose to be a seal
like that on the dog house cooler?

I am currently in the process of cleaning up the used
tin and I want to make sure that I have everything
together before I remove the old engine for the swap.

Thanks!

Regards,

David Kelly
