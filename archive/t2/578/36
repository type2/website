Subject: RE: [T2] Stranded in Southern Utah. Need a helping diagnosis.

I had this same problem in my '78 bus, several years back, I could only use
1st and 2nd, I could not engage 3rd at all, never tried 4th......

Any way after a week of sweating and trying to think of a bank to rob to get
the $$ for a new tranny, I took it to the shop and was told it was my shift
coupling.... cost out the door was like $90.00

I find it ironic looking back that I was really pissed off because it I had
to pay $75.00 in labor for them to install a $15.00 part.....

Hope this helps,
Good luck
