The alternator is IN :)  And I swapped out the oil filler tube with the one
off the old engine that was tight so 2 things down.

Just need to finish up this wiring.
The alternator has the D+, D- and DF designations.

As for the regulator, it doesn't have these designations.  But the wires
going to the terminals are Red, brown and bluish-green

The wires I had hooked up for my generator's regulator were:
Big red wire from battery
Lt Blue wire (I think goes to instrument cluster)

Then the wires that went to generator:
Big red wire
blue/red stripe wire
brown wire

If I understand what y'all are saying correctly, I should:
Wire the 2 big red wires together
wire the lt blue (to instrument cluster) to the Blue/red striped wire that
went to generator

But if I do this, how do I incorporate the voltage regulator???

Confused....
