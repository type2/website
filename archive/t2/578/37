sounds like linkage, others have told you how to adjust, but you should be
able to drive it using just 2 & 4th if you are carefull.  takes a real
delicate touch on the clutch but it will work enough to nurse you
home....might be REALLLLLL slow on some of the hills and try not to stop
facing uphill if you can but otherwise you could make it...get on the
interstate get up to 55 and just keep on going and going and going

much easier to fix and less stress in your own driveway
