Hey, i just did that today...

My beam is stock, so your mileage may vary, but i got my arms off 
without removing the stops, with help from my air hammer.  After I 
removed the arms, I took the stops off.  There are sliding clips holding 
the stops on.  Look in the hole at the end of the beam, you'll see 
them.  Get in there with a screwdriver and move the clips around to free 
them up, and then pull them out.  After that you'll have to give the 
stops a smack and they'll drop off.  My clips are shot, I'm going to try 
to get new ones... haven't looked yet though.

Hope that helps.
