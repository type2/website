Subject: Re: [T2] T4 oil filter w/o the wrench

A more reliable BUBBA method I used:  Get a piece of 2x4 about 1 to 1.5
ft long.  Drive two nails through it at one end spaced to be just inside
the diameter of the oil filter- the nails shoud stick out at least an
inch.  Since carpenters may be rare on this list, flatten the pointy end
of the nail near the edge of the board with the hammer- prevents
splitting..  Hammer the board nails into the bottom of the filter and
then unscrew the filter; tapping on the side of the board with the
hammer.
