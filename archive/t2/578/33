Did you notice your tranny making any irregular noises prior to dying?

Does reverse still work?

If 1&3 are bad, it might have something to do with the shifter linkage not
moving enough to properly engage those gears.

You can at least hope it's linkage related ($) and not the transmission
itself ($$$$)

were
