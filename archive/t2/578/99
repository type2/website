Subject: Re: New: Jail Bars on Ebay (past)

Paul, I am CC:ing the list on this, because of interest:

There WAS an ebay sale of these jailbars that said

"This set is so authentic, you will even have to cut the two bars to length 
just as you would with the originals, had you ordered them from VW"

and

"The part numbers for this Jail Bar set are: End Caps - 241 853 441, Center 
Mount - 255 853 445, Bars - 255 853 417."

Bus Depot has these part numbers.  The total set would be about $220.

Since there is only one part number for the horizontal bars, there must be 
only one size, and they are then cut to fit the application, as mentioned in 
the ebay sale.  (I asked the list on how to cut my Vanagon jail bars to fit 
the bay back hatch.)

I can see that the two horizontal bars on the Vanagon are different lengths; 
same on the bay jailbars - different lengths.  So I guess the fit of the 
horizontal jailbars on the Vanagon or bay are cut to custom fit, and not 
standard lengths.

Now that I (believe I) know that the horizontal jailbars are without 
exception CUT TO FIT, I feel easier about cutting them to suit my 
installation on my '78.

BTW, the other FULL set of jailbars are going on my '76 Safare because that 
is a perfect application for them.  I will have to make some modifications 
to the back seat panel so I can flip the back seat into a flat bed, but this 
will allow me to put items right back there, on the raised partition that 
fits over the engine hatch (the mattress is suppose to fit under this raised 
partition), and help them from crashing into the rear and right side 
windows,  and from sliding forward over the rear seat back when I brake 
hard.  So there is a REAL use for these jailbars on a Safare!!
