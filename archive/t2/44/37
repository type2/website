Subject: Looking for 2l crank and rods

Volks,
I am looking for standard/standard crank that just needs a good
polishing..........also a set of 4 rods that came from the same motor.

I am tired of being burned by vendors that advertise reconditioned rods,
etc, only to find out by the machine shop during the balancing process that
they are not round.............

Any help would be appreciated........perhaps a trade for other type4 motor
parts?
