And this is going to tell you there's enough pressure in the system how?
Even if the fuel pump would pump with just the ignition on, which it's not
supposed to. There is a reason for the starter being part of the FI system.

This check is fine with carbs (3 psi fuel pressure needed). Your FI bus
needs 28 psi +/- 2 psi. I don't know where you get your coffee cans from,
but mine don't have fuel pressure gauges on them.

There's a misconception about Bentley: it's not designed to teach you how to
fix a car if you don't know how. It's designed to provide someone who knows
how to fix a car the procedures necessary to fix the Volkswagen Bus. Muir is
for someone who doesn't know how to fix a car.
