Alas, a proper pressure/volume test would answer all questions with regard
to the assumption of a fuel problem. Why not just stop guessing and run the
procedure and know for sure????? You have already wasted time/money on the
ignition components. The gist I got is you just replaced everything, didn't
test the parts to confirm if they had anything at all to do with the
problem. You could have bought a good quality fuel pressure guage for less
than the cost of the ignition parts likely not needed. Just think about
that and re-evaluate how much time/money you have left to waste before you
begin to address the problem with the gathering of facts as opposed to
acting on assumptions.
