If the heads were put back on reversed,
the sender will be on the other side.
There should still be a sender hole in the sheet metal.
If the sender turns out to be on the opposite side,
you can just extend the wire. Try grounding the sender wire
and see if the engine now runs, but very rich .
The oil leak under # 3 may just be fuel from repeated
ayyempts to start the engine. Check the oil level.
