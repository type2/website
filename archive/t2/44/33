Clutch disc springs do not change pedal tension, they are for a little 'give'
in engagement. A solid disc with no springs will chudder until you learn
how to use it ( drag racing ) . Heavy springs do not serve the bus well.
They only function at the moment of engagement.
Heavy springs in the clutch pressure plate will provide assistance in
towing applications or travel in hill country at the sacrifice of a load
on the cable and your foot.These springs provide traction at the flywheel.
They work fine with a stock disc. Perhaps that is what your post intended.
( You should have gone for the modified cam :) More power is a good thing.
