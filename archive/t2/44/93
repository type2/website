Subject: Re: [T2] Locking engine hatch

I'd be interested in the same info...  I have a '70 though.
I had a '67 Beetle that someone TRIED to steal my Dellorto 40, they got mad
it looked like and kicked, or hit the linkage with something.  It never
quite ran right again.  -Yeah, tried to order the parts for that, it was
like a 7 month wait!

I would think that with a little loving installation we could fit the lock
and button from an older VW...   anyone tried this?
