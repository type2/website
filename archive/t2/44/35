Subject: Stressed ... starting  probs

Hey gang
Well i will get straight toi the point cuz i am stressed

My bus was formerly the most reliable vehicle i have ever owned until about
a month ago
suddenly after the bus was parked for more than a few hrs it would not start
so i replaced the battery and it seemed to be workin fine started no prob
but after not driving the bus for a few days i went to start it the other
day and nothin, DEAD i boosted it and it ran fine left it sit over night and
dead again the next mornin. It is charging properly reads 13??when running
so my question is any ideas what could be killing the battery when it is
parked. A friend metioned something about diodes in the alternator ??????? I
have never done any work on alternators so i know nothin about em.

also if that maybe the case will a atlernator from a 76 2.0fi fit a 74 1800
dual carbed

and if i have to start tracing wiring to look for a dead short is there a
new hiring harness available for a 74 cuz i would rather rewire the damn
thing than fart ariound chasing possibilities
( i have rewired my beetle so i know what i am getting into)

any help or suggestions are greatly appreciated cuz i am at my wits end
thanks volks
as always you are the best
