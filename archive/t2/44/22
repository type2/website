oh yeah, I forgot.. my engine would not start at all because I forgot to
hook up that sensor!

It's located just in front (towards the front of the car) of the intake
manifold.  The wire from the sensor should then go into a little
connector which then goes into the wiring harness along with the two
injector cables.

Look to see if you have a hole where the sensor should go.  The hole is
just under a centimeter in diameter.  If you don't have the sensor, go
grab yourself one!
