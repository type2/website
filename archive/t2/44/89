Wow!  Wish you'd had these when I got mine from yoyu.  But you gave me
such a sweet deal I have NO room for complaint!  Hm..  Maybe I'll sell
off the one I have and get one of the receiver style.  ;-) 

Slight caveat:  on my california '79 deluxe westy, the muffler is a fat
round puppy that actually protrudes BEYOND the body of the bus in back. 
(Stand with the top of your head on your back hatch and look straight
down.  Does your muffler extend beyond the body?  If so, you might have
to tweak a little.)  and I could have benefited from enlarging the
BUMPER mounting slots a bit.  As it was, I ground off a tad bit of the
front-most (FIF) weld where the tongue meets the hitch, and put a dimple
in my muffler to get it on.  Apparently the muffler is a CA only thing,
others are flat/oval and not a problem.

Thanks again, Jamie!
