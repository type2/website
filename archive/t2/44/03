Electric heat is nice, but DRY!!  At our last campout last weekend, the
humidity was around 20 percent and the temps outside around 25 Friday night.
I have a humidity gauge in my Scamp and I used a Little Buddy propane heater
since my Scamp furnace was not working.  By morning, the humidity was about
60 percent in the trailer, but one of my friends who used his electric
heater was complaining about how dry it was in his bus and how dry his mouth
and nose were.  

I guess it depends on the situation, but out of the 10 bus campouts I went
to this year, only 2 had electricity.  I guess a person should maybe have
one of each type of small heater just in case.
