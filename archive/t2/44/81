Hi list,

Tried to post this on Friday, but my mail was screwed up, so please =
excuse some of the Friday style content.

Just got back from a 3 1/2 month road trip doing the great circle route =
counterclockwise around the US and parts of Canada with my faithful '76 =
Westy, wife and new baby.  I have to say it was a truly wonderful =
experience, and I recommend it highly to anyone who can try it.  Thanks =
to all the list members who helped me get ready for the trip, Frances =
(Westy) made it all 13,500 miles with only a rear wheel bearing needing =
replacement (I had spares and tools along, because I was expecting it to =
go soon anyway).  Full web site with trip report and some of the 600 =
pictures we took will be coming up as soon as I can find some time.

I was also kinda wondering if anyone spotted us along the way.  Frances =
started out standard chrome yellow with some primer spots and a gray =
luggage bag in the luggage rack, but got decorated with state names, =
people's names and many other things as we stopped and visited friends, =
family and places.  My favourite is a biohazard sign which I painted on =
the back - those who live for more than a week in a bus will know why I =
did that.  You wouldn't believe the number of people that said "I =
haven't seen a bus like that since the 60's - can I take a picture?" - =
it does have the requisite peace signs and other groovy stuff of course.

Now for a couple of questions:
Is there any obvious reason why my bus would be going through FI fuel =
pumps once a year?  I bought a rebuilt last year to replace the previous =
one, and at the 10,000 mile mark it started to make that funny whirring =
noise that means imminent death is near.

Does everyone else have to futz with timing and/or mixture to get their =
bus to make the transition from sea level to 8,000 feet?  If I don't =
lean out the mixture and advance the timing, the bus runs likes its full =
of cotton batting when I'm at altitude, and if I leave these settings =
when returning to sea level, it runs way too hot.  Thoughts?

Glad to be back on the list,
Niall (Frances - '76 Westy)
