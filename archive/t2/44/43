The red heater lever knobs for the 1974 model, differ from those of the 
pre-1974 models, which are metal & rubber, with a different fitting, so 
cannot be interchanged unless one also transplants the corresponding levers 
from behind the dashboard instrument panel.

If you don't want to do this you will need 1974 or later, one-piece plastic 
heater knobs.

Regards.
