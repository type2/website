Subject: Bus and ghia in MD junkyard

Hi All -

I frequent a junk yard in Upper Marlboro, Maryland for my water-cooled VW 
parts. It usually has no air-cooled vehicles. However, last week I went and 
they had two. 

A 73 Bus-pretty complete engine, all lenses interior, pretty much all there, 
and not wrecked, someone probably just gave it to them to get out of there 
yard. Looks like its been sitting a while. Some rust through the body but 
complete. 

Also a 73 Ghia coupe-engine gone. Most lenses there, all interior-and a crack 
free dash and very clean black interior with perfect door panels. Was a real 
clean vehicle before smashed in the back. Drivers door perfect, front bonnet 
perfect (although several layers of paint). Steering wheel has several 
cracks. 

Anyway, anyone interested in going it is on Brown Station Road in Upper 
Marlboro (Brandywine Auto Parts) or if you need something let me know, I'll 
see if its there. I usually go every other weekend (or every depending).
