Hi Volks,
    I just received the following note from John.  He would have posted =
it himself but is having ISP problems.  So it is coming to you from =
Michiagan via New York. =20

John says;
"I'd like to send a note out to anyone contemplating building my engine =
dolly
from the plan in the archives.  That thing was designed to work on my =
'71
while it was up on 4 jacks.  Not miles in the air, but all the wheels =
were
off the ground.  The dolly won't work (it's been proven) with your bus =
on
the ground, and I can't tell you what the minimum height is to slide =
your
engine out, on the dolly, and under the bumper.  If someone would like =
to
figure that, it could be added to the plans and I'll resubmit them, =
updated
and all.

I apologize to any and all who got burned on this one.  It's a good =
design
if all else is cooperating, but it's worth the trouble to figure that =
part
out first.

And yes,  I'm the one who proved it wouldn't work with the bus on the =
ground
