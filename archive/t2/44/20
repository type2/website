Sounds like it's running rich.  Has anyone messed with the AFM before
you?  But like mentioned in the previous emails, there are alot of
different things to test; injectors (for flow and leakage), fuel
pressure, pressure regulator, temp sensor II, etc.

If you can get it to run for long enough, make sure your timing isn't
way off.  If you're sure your ignition system is working, run through
the last chapter (FI) in the bentley and test everything to make sure
it's functioning correctly.

You might also want to consult the Bosch FI manual for troubleshooting. 
I'm sure someone on the list has the link to it...
