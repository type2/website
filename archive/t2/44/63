Subject: Re: [T2] On FI

Hi Tony,
I see your point and yes UK cars in general have been
bad deals in terms of everything from  carbs to
gearboxs to,well, most things.
There's plenty of British cars that I like but none
enough to stand the sort of upkeep they need. 
Part of the reason I like buses is that they are
straight forward,even the Type4 style engines,so why
VW would want to ruin a good thing I don't know.
Yes,they are getting up to the 30+year mark,but even
still,you should be able to expect some reliability.
OK, VW cut costs when they had FI designed but why
should we pay the reckoning?
And new computerised FI sets are expensive but no-one
seems to be rushing to fill that niche specifically
for Bugs'n'Buses.
For practically ANY other brand of car you can get an
aftermarket system for less than an arm and a leg yet
no-one seems to be interested in either improving
VWAG's system or providing a viable alternative that
won't require cannibalising cars of other makes and
custom building a set, or mortgaging your house for
something that's basically a modified Weber throttle
body.
Sorry....this isn't aimed at you.
I have a 67 panel which I still don't know what I'm
going to power it with and the above facts aren't
making the decision any easier.
I just wish the aftermarket community would rise above
the Cal-Look style engine...you know,bored,stroked and
machined to hell with dual 48 IDA's and an engine life
of about 30,000 miles or less:-/
I read a article not long ago on a aftermarket FI
turbo charged Karmann Ghia and they named the computer
and then glossed over it like they were embarressed!!
They didn't even discuss what was involved in the job
which was an unusual modification.....hasn't anyone
got any imagination.
If VW FI did work I'd be there with bells on!
But well,you know where I stand.
Yes,FI is the future of cars and we have to face that.
But unfortunately it's not a reliable or economic
possibility for me.
Anyone else got thoughts on the subject?
Cheers
Andrew
