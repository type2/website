I'm not sure if Busboys carries anything from Schofield, but we do carry
many (but not all) of the same products. We import a lot of parts from
Europe and the UK, and although we do not deal with Schofield themselves, we
do deal with some of the same suppliers that they do. (Some of their
products are exclusive but many are not.)

The panel for under the windshield is simply a cut-up portion of the full
nose panel that we sell. We sell several '68-79 nose panels:.

We have the whole panel (from bottom of windshield down) for '73-79.  Part #
95 56 200, This has holes for the turn signals above the headlights, and the
lower section is designed to accommodate a later style bumper. However, I
have seen some people use it for pre-73 in one of several ways (i.e. using
only part of it, filling in the turn signal holes and cutting lower ones,
using later turn signals). We also sell a lower panel (part number 95 55
220) that allows you to use this nose with a pre-73 bumper (still with some
modification).

We also sell just the top part of this (the part under the windshield),
which is what you're referring to. Part number 95 56 201. Frankly all we
(and others) do to "make" this panel is to take the complete nose panel
mentioned above and cut off the bottom half, shipping only the
under-the-windshield section. Since the top half is identical on all years
'68-79, this fits all. This sells for $114, versus $123 for the whole nose
(both prices assume listmember discount), so the cost is very close; however
you do save additional money on freight as the upper part can go UPS whereas
the complete nose must go via truck.

FInally, we also sell a lower nose section for '68-72 (below the headlight
buckets, with holes for lower turn signals).  Part # 95 55 200.

All of these can be found in our print catalog, which is a great resource
for identifying/finding bus parts.  It's $3.00 if purchased separately (but
includes a coupon for $5 off any order), or $1.00 if added to an order (but
with no coupon).  While it doesn't list anything that can't be found on our
website, the indexed layout and pictures/diagrams can sometimes make it
easier to quickly find what you need (especially if you're not near a
computer :-).
