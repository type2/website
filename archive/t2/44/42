Subject: Propane Heaters

I'm considering buying one of the new portable propane heaters designed for
indoor use (Comes with a low oxygen shut-off sensor) has anybody tried one
of these? Afre they safe to be used in a bus. I checked the archives but
didn't find anything  about these particular heaters. Thanks for your
opinions.
