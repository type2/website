Subject: On FI

Guy's, I said this before about FI and then promptly
got told that once people bought an FI bus they'd
never go back to carbs.
Is all the trouble really worth it?
I know that FI made by any manufacturer is great but
only if it works.
I seem to read lots of emails about problems that were
caused by factors that FI was invented to
overcome,like for instance,issues about changes in
altitude or local temperature.
What's the buzz?
If it's so great is there a way to fix these problems
and by-pass the flaws?
I'm not saying that FI engines are wrong,I'm just yet
to be satisfied by their supporters.
Please set me straight.
Otherwise I'll continue to believe that VW didn't
design a system that was as practical as it needed to
be.
Cheers
Andrew
