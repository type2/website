Hey Guys,

I didn't want to start a battle of manuals on this
one! LOL

Just an update:  I have changed all the plugs, the
cap, rotor and points and the plug wires just to
eliminate chance of one of them being the problem.  I
also replaced the fuel filter, and the old one looked
like it was put on backwards! What a pain to do those
filters!

Nope.  It does try to start a little better, but will
only run for 20 seconds or so and then shut down. It
will not start after that.  If I leave it for about
half and hour and then try, it will again fire up, but
then shut down after said time period.  AARRGG!

One additional item: The exhaust smells very rich
while it is running and it runs very rough.

Lost in Loaf-Land!

Sam
