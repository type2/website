1975 1.8L FI rebuild problem:

okay so i'm trying to figure out why i'm getting blowback into my intake =
headers when trying to start the completed and installed engine... my =
figuring, and from advice i've received, is that the only thing that =
would cause this are 1: valves incorrectly set (have to be intake right? =
incorrect exhaust should blowback into exhaust not intake right?) 2: =
timing messed up, or 3: cam indexing off...

so here's what i've done:
1: valves are correcet .006 intake, .008n exhaust...
2: timing is static set at about 5 deg BTDC (that is, 5 on the "VOR" =
side on my timing indicator - the red dot that inidcates where it should =
be at idle is at 5 deg after, or "NACH")...

that leaves the indexing right?

so my pulley notch is at 0deg, looking into the fan housing through that =
hole on top with the screw-in plastic plug i can see (actually when the =
pulley notch is at 5ATDC) a small nick at the apex of the V on the =
housing... slowly turning the engine clockwise past this point number 3 =
valve is just closing the exhaust and just opening the intake...

so my question, trying to figure out if the cam is indexed incorrectly, =
is that i think i've figured out where everything else should be, and i =
was hoping someone might tell me if i'm correct:

so=20
if #1 is at TDC, ready to fire, then:
#2: just beginning to open exhaust (end of power stroke)
#3: just closing exhaust, just opening intake
#4: both valves closed (start of compression stroke)

right?

which means that technically, when the pulley notch is pointed at the 0, =
shouldn't all the valves technically be closed or, in the case of the =
cylinder moving from exhaust to intake, just switching from exhaust to =
intake?

assuming i can assure myself my cam is indexed correctly, i'll move on =
to the ignition system and make sure all plugs are actually firing, then =
move to the fuel injection...

any other advice?

thanks!

bill
