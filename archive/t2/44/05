Mom's and Dad's, Boy's and Girl's---

To check fuel pump volume, let me quote directly from my genuine, VW Pro
training Type II, fuel systems manual.

FUEL PUMP VOLUME TEST ( Delivery Quantity )

--Disconnect fuel return line at pressure regulator
--Attatch hose to return line fitting on pressure regulator
--Place other end of hose in a 1 liter ( 1 quart ) measuring container
--Turn on ignition
--Open air sensor ( or bridge air sensor plug termnals 36 and 39 ) run
fuel pump for 30 seconds.
--Delivery quanity shoud be at least 500cc ( 1/2 quart )

If delivery quanity is not up to specifications;

--Check free flow from tank
-- Fuel filter is nt blocked
--ground connections clean and tight
--Available voltage is at least 11.5 volts.
