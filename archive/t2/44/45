Hi John Here
I have an idea. Why don't you start a busathon? Start by getting some 
sponsors to pay you per day or per week depending on the person. You can also 
have a buscam so people can check in on your expedition. I think its a pretty 
nutty idea
to try and live in your bus all winter and I would pay to see someone try it. 
I would start a website refrigerator expedition .com, come see someone freeze 
there nuts off in outback. I think some people would rise to the cause to 
keep you going with
supplies and donations. We could take bets on how long you would last before 
you turn into a frozen TV dinner.                          JPB2001
