...I doubt that VW, or any manufacturer of bread and butter
vehicles, would have gone to FI unless it was almost a re-
quirement to meet (then), emissions standards and (now)
fuel efficiency. The extra cost of a FI system was a bus-
iness expense to continue selling vehicles in the US. 
   But, you're also talking about a 30+ year old system.
My guess would be that the system was as practical as
the bean counters and the engineers could devise given
all the parameters involved - not an optimal system, but
a compromise involving cost, requirements, and avail-
able technology. You want impractical? Try some of the
British carb plus add-ons of the period (Owners of 70's
Little British Cars will understand ;-( You want practical?
Jump ahead to current aftermarket FI systems...Pricey
but you can dial-in performance/economy even on the
fly if you spend enough.
