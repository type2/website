I understood that the double relay needs power from the starter to energize the
fuel pump,, then the fuel pump stays energized from current from the intake air
sensor circuit

without the key in the START position,, or air flow through the intake system,
the fuel pump should not operate.

Is that correct for all years of EFI ?
Therefore any one who has a fuel pump that runs when the key is in the ON
position is in a dangerous predicament if the fuel line bursts and the key is
left on,, [like in an accident]
