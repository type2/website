Don't you mean carbon monoxide?

Carbon dioxide, which is a simple asphyxiant, and carbon monoxide, which is
both poisonous and flammable, are totally different things. Is there a CO2
detector? I know it's real easy to get a CO detector at any department
store. I have one in both my Bus and my Bug.

Considering the design of the aircooled VW's "heating" system, a CO detector
is a necessity for any VW owner.
