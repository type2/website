Subject: Re: [T2] Living out of a Bus....HELP! BUS-A-THON!

John,that sounds like a top idea!
Seeing that on the web would certainly 'cause some
interest and maybe all the people who love to email
about heat to this group could help out on how to keep
our buddy from freezing his extremities off:-)
In fact with his permission we could conduct some
valuable experiments that could benefit everyone.
Heat on a budget....snug in a bus with a rug;-)
