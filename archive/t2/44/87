We DO have the seat stand mats on our website.  You need one each of 211 863
665B and 211 867 765A.  One of these is the pair of mats that go directly
under the seats; the other is the pair that go around the inside perimeter.
It will set you back about $80 altogether.  Yes, they are listed to fit only
through '76, as the '77-78 pedestals are just slightly larger. However the
difference is small. With a little "cut and paste" you can generally make
the earlier ones work and look decent but not perfect. (Of course once you
cut they are nonreturnable, so eye it up once you get them and if you decide
against it, return them before cutting or installing.)  Since no one makes
the later version this will be your only option.
