Subject: successful sliding door fix

The "link" on my sliding door was cracked making the
door a bear to operate. I got a used one last week and
put it in Sat a.m. Incredibly satisfying repair job!
Didn't shriek and curse once. Door works so well, I
made my kids watch as I demonstrated about 10 times.

good news For those with a similar problem--I didn't
have to get a friend to help or remove the entire door
(or trim) a la Bentley.

1. Popped door open and put a jack under the rear
corner of the door.
2. Removed 4 10mm bolts holding the middle link to the
door.
3. Slid the link gizmo out of the door and down the
track to the rear.
4. Removed the rear screw that holds the track cover
in place.
5. Gently pried the cover out 1/2 inch with a broom
handle and slipped the link unit out of the track.
6. Installed replacement in reverse order.
(Tense moment when I was trying to get the bolt holes
to line up. But i raised the door a bit by pressing on
the hydraulic jack handle with my foot. Voila!)

Got a camper bed in a junkyard. Onward into the fog!
