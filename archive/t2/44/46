Dear Mike.

About 13 months ago (2nd October 2000), you posted a message about hand 
brake warning light switches and their connection to the brake circuit 
warning light.

A fellow VW Type 2 Listee is keeping his eye open in his local wrecker's 
yards, on my behalf, for for small USA & Canadian specification components 
such as these, with which to upgrade my British specification, 1973 VW 
'1600' Type 2 Westfalia Continental.

Would you please clarify where the switch is located and whether there are 
any mounting brackets for it?

Although you stated that this facility became available from 1974 onward, it 
does not appear on the 1973~75 main circuit diagram or supplements, from the 
Robert Bentley manual, but it is shown in the circuit diagrams, for 1976, 
1977~78 & 1979.

One source of possible confusion, is a disparity between the circuit 
diagrams for the various model years and the corresponding electrical 
connections, to the brake circuit warning light.

In the 1973~75 circuit diagram, terminal 61 of the brake circuit warning 
light (labelled K9) is connected to terminal D+ (like terminal 61 of a 
dynamo voltage regulator) of the alternator voltage regulator, which I can 
conceptually understand.

However, in the 1976, 1977~78 & 1979 circuit diagrams, terminal 61 of the 
brake circuit warning light, is connected to the hand brake switch (labelled 
F9) which in turn is connected to Ground (i.e. Earth).

To me it would make more sense, to simply supplement the 1973~75 circuit, by 
interposing the hand brake switch (labelled F9), between an ignition 
controlled, positive fused supply (labelled 15 on Fuse No. 11 or 12) and 
terminal 61 of the brake circuit warning light.

What are your thoughts please?

Regards.

         Nigel A. Skeet
