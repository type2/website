Subject: Rebuilding a steering rack for an 81 vanagon

Volks,
I have replaced everything in the front end ofmy 81 (the brick) and when I
go over a bump in the road, etc., there is a hell of a rattle under the
front end and i feel it in my steering.......thus i feel it may be the rack.

I see bus depot has a repair kit for $89.99 vs. $300 plus for a newly
rebuilt unit.  I have had one of these off the car before, and it does not
look all that complex.....my question is, what would said kit/rebuild
entail?
