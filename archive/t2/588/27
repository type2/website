Subject: Bay windshield question (& perhaps a free windshield for

Hey now, I pulled out my original '70 bus windshield today in order to repair
the rust holes under the old rubber. Naturally it was worse than what I could
see from the front - but not so bad that I freaked.

So would anyone attempt to put the old, yellowed all around the edges (about
2" of such) w/ 5 or 6 small dings and cracks back into the bus after I do a
thorough windshield lip cleaning and restoration?  Especially when I have the
$ to purchase a new one (Tallahassee local company - Mobile Auto Glass -
installed in my driveway for $219.00 - (already own the new seal)

If as I expect, the majority say "replace w/ new", then does anyone need an
original windshield, complete w/ an "I LoVermont " sticker, a SCI round
sticker, a Leftover Salmon sticker, and a Blues Traveller "Smokin' Cool Cat"
sticker that's partially ripped? Let me know, You can have it for free, just
gotta pay the shipping.

If you know of a better price for a new windshield please post that for me.
Thanks David -Bernie-Bernstein
