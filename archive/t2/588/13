Subject: Bus NOT for sale! :-)

Wow. Had a really interesting morning...

Wife came up to me asking when the bus was going to be sold. I
explained there was only one person from this list who had expressed
an interest, and that I hadn't really made any efforts to advertise
it. I didn't even have a ForSale sign up.

She actually BEGGED me to keep it! 

I was stunned, and told her so. She said she really liked it and it
was worth losing me a day a week working on it. Well, how could I say
no to that? So we're keeping it. :-)

I want to thank all of the listees who helped remind me why I bought
the bus in the first place, and talked me into waiting a bit before
selling. I guess it took a week for my wife to get up the nerve to
intrude on "my" domain (cars). I've saved all your wonderful emails
and am printing them out and putting them in a folder to keep in the
bus as a reminder of what being a bus owner is all about.
