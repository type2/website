Can't remember how many screws hold the cover on but it is in Bentley.  A
trick once you get all the screws out is to use a 2x4 and place it
underneath and hit the board with a hammer evenly across the bottom of
cover.

BTW, The cover is on driver's side too for RHD vehicles that had the sliding
door on that side.

Peace,
