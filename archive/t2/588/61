Subject: Valve Adjusting Screw

I was out adjusting my valves today on my 1600 singleport and while 
tightening the bolt after setting on the screw on the feeler gauge at .006  
the whole screw and bolt cracked off.

so, it seems the stud of the screw is still in the hole.  I'm assuming I 
cannot drive it.  any advice on how to fix it so I don't have to pull it 
into the mechanic.  Not sure how to get the stud out....I've never really 
worked on the engine parts except to set the valves.  Its number 3.

Thanks,
kim
