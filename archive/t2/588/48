Subject: Carb Problem

Last night my wife were coming home from a wedding when our 72 westy died at a stoplight.  I went around the back and had the Mrs. crank the engine for me.  Gas came rushing out of the breather(?) tube that comes up and out of the float bowl and into the main body of the carb.  Please excuse me if my terminology is incorrect.  I found a little hole in the hose that goes from the intake manifold to the dashpot(I think that is what it is called).  Oh yeah, one more thing.  This 72 has a motor from a 67 in it, so it is not the stock dual solex setup.

 

Thanks in advance.....
