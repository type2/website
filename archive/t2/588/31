Subject: EGR help for my 80 Westy

Getting all the parts prepped for the install of a rebuilt engine in my 80
Vanagon. When When I bought it the ERG system was disabled. The filter is
missing and the pipe that is supposed to be welded into the crossover pipe is
cut off. It looks like a carriage bolt was inserted and welded in the hole
left when the pipe was cut off flush with the crossover pipe. This leaves me
with a puzzling situation. I know I can buy a new filter, but I don't know
what I am going to do about the missing pipe. The sad thing is the crossover
pipe is in excellent shape. I would hate to shell out the big bucks to replace
the crossover pipe just because it is missing the EGR tube.

I have looked in Bentley and see the little pipe looks like a twisted S. I
guess I could try to find some appropriate tubing and start bending and
welding. Does anyone know the proper dimensions of this pipe? What kind of
metal should it be? Does anyone have a rusted out crossover pipe that still
has a good EGR pipe, or a good cross over pipe with EGR tube They would be
willing to part with at a reasonable price.

Should I just leave the EGR disabled? Does it really help reduce the cyl. head
temps? I live in Northern Arizona at about 7000 ft. and plan on some summer
trips across the desert to Phoenix and Yuma. I am concerned that I should do
everything I can to allow this engine to run as cool as possible.

Does anyone have some comparative temp. readings from before and after
restoring an EGR system?

Thanks
Tom
