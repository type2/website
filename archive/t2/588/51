Subject: Re: [T2] Carb Problem

Sounds like your either your float is toast or your needle valve (the 
brass fitting that screws into the top of the carb body from inside the 
bowl) is stuck open or toast.

If you pick up a carb rebuild kit, it should have a new needle valve.  
Basically you'll need to un-screw the carb top and while holding the 
carb top above gas tank level (while not loosing any of those damn 
screws) replace the needle valve (13 mm wrench, i believe).

If the float itself is toast, one of the local VW boneyards should have 
a replacement.  Online vendors might as well, I'm not sure, but the 
carb rebuild kits don't seem to come with them anymore.
