Hi,

I've just got round to replying -- I know, I'm sorry -- to those who'd
expressed an interest in parts of my old bus.  If you've not received a
personal reply, it's because I'm an ineffable eejit and I've lost your mail.
If you've got the patience, mail me again.

On the subject of "Necking Knobs" I'd certainly never heard them called that
but I did have one for my Auto camper -- with no gears to change, nowhere to
get in a hurry and only one hand on the wheel, it certainly was a relaxing
way to get nowhere in particular.  *sigh*  Anyway, if anyone wants one,
that's up for grabs too.  Thought I do believe they're illegal, or at least
would fail you an MoT test in this green and rainy land.

Cheers,

Chris.
