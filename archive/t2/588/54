Subject: Fan Removal Done - Oil Pressure Problem

Couple days ago I put on a new starter - went for a short drive maybe two
blocks- the oil indicator light starts to glow - gets brighter and brighter
until I turn around and get home
I find that I have oil flying around in the fan housing - not dripping under
the bottom but getting into the fan and being flung around
I figure I have a nasty oil leak causing a pressure drop ? My oil level was
still good - in between the two dip marks

After I get the fan housing off I find the housing full off oil and a fair
build up around the pump
Can anybody give me a good idea of where to look - not sure what the next
step should be
I have had no trouble with my bus at all recently - in fact I thought I was
making some head way - any help on how to proceed will be appreciated

Thanks
Eric
