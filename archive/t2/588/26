Subject: Re: [T2] How Hot is too Hot for Oil Temperature

I guess different engines will take different
temperatures, I sunk two valves on my 80 vanagon by
running the oil temp at and a little above 250F
degrees oil temp. I learned a good lesson, any temp
above 220F on mine I back off and slow down now, those
damn square port heads are high dollar.. Phil
