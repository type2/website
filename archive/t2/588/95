Depends on far you are going to restore the windsheild channel. I myself 
have to do this soon. My winsheild is a real shi$%er. It would not pass 
inspection and I suspect after it comes out it will not go back it. It has 
been hit with several rocks, just not busted through. If you see a paint job 
in the near future I would wait for the new one and do it after the paint 
job. If it is a safety/visibility issue then go for new.
