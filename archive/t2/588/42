Subject: Fan Pulley removal 

Is there a trick or something I am missing? I am trying to remove the fan
housing on my 1800 - I have the bolts holding the pulley / fan out and the
belt off - should I be able to just pull back and off or am I missing
something ? It wiggles but doesn't slide off - I wanted to ask before I
pulled to hard and broke something.

Thanks
