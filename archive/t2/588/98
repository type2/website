Subject: Middle bench seat 4 sale (Philly area)

Hi All,

I've got a bench seat from my '79 for sale. This is the 2seater for the middle
cabin. It's brown in color and in really good shape so make me an offer.

You have to be willing to pick it up :-)

I can provide more pics if needed.

Cheers,
Harry
