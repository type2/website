Subject: Air intake question

I've been restaurating a '72 westfalia, taking care to reduce noise n the  
cabin. Now it seems that about 50% of the engine noise that still remains  
coms from a vent (with grille) in the left air intake. Also, when I drive  
the car a lot of cold air comes through this vent hole into the cabin,  
thus practically eliminating all insulation an heating efforts I made.
Can anyone explain me what this vent is for and if it can be safely sealed  
off, without disturbing the engine cooling system.


thanx,
