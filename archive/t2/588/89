Those belt line pieces will stick sometimes. I THINK there may be a screw in
the center also. At any rate they can be pried up, being careful not to bend
them. They kind of slide down into a groove that is behind them. You can
take a rubber mallet and tap them up, first on the left and then on the
right, and they should come off. You can buy new seals for them too. When
reinstalling make sure to have them centered correctly.
