Hi Rob,

I'm shamelessly hijacking your post to promote Buses of the Corn.

This week's BOTC update will now remind everyone how cool it is to camp 
with the people you read posts from but have yet to meet in the flesh. 
And we have some real net celebrities coming this year:

Hard-Core campers: The people who run  EveryBus, Dixie Bus Gathering, 
BusFusion, Buses By The Falls and John Brown's Buses will be there. We 
might also get an appearance from the "Buses By The Mill" folk as well. 
If you wanna know more about a campout there is no better way to learn 
it than to ask the guy in charge, and the people who have been there.

Did I mention that members of the Buskatiers, the Full Moon Bus Club, 
The Ohio Valley Tribe of the FMBC and The Bug Pack will be in 
attendance? I wonder which club will take home the best bus driver 
award?

If you're still reading and you need to know more about the eventt, 
It's August 6th - 8th, 2004 in Whitby Ontario Canada.

Happy trails,
