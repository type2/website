Subject: Re: [T2] Fan Pulley removal 

From Eric:

 Is there a trick or something I am missing? I am trying to remove the fan
housing on my 1800 - I have the bolts holding the pulley / fan out and the
belt off - should I be able to just pull back and off or am I missing
smething ? It wiggles but doesn't slide off - I wanted to ask before I
pulled to hard and broke something.

You have the fan removed and the 4 nuts and washers removed; and now it just 
wiggles on the 4 studs?

Did you remove:
The dipstick bellows?
The aternator?
The long alternator support?
The left and right channel covers?

Did you lower the heater boxes?
