Subject: Type 1 engine oil pump removal

A friend had a knock in his engine right behind the big pulley on an upright
engine.  Last hope is a loose cam something or other (I forgot) anyway he
needs to remove the oil pump and we don't have a puller. Any idea where to
locate one or a way around it???

Thanks in advance,
Snoopy
