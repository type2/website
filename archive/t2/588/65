It's not SOOOooo bad assuming you can fit a drill under their. Just
drill a small hole into the center of the screw and then get yourself
either an EZ-Out or a left spin drill bit. Their kinda the same thing.
One made for fitting into drills, and one made for using hand tools on.
Their both just drill bits basically that go the OTHER way. But their
not really made for drilling. Their made to grab onto the hole, and get
stuck. Then using a socket, or a drill motor or whatnot, you can spin
'em around and get the screw to back out. But that might be kinda
overkill.

You might want to see if a pair of needle nose pliers will fit around
the screw on the other side, and just back it out that way untill you
can hold onto the screw on the other side and finish backing it out. 

I don't know where to get new screws, but I'm betting their a fairly
common item. Maybe even a Flaps purchase.

Cheers
