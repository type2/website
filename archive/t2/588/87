Subject: RE: [T2] Window Kits for '76?

>>>I have never seen it (kits), but why on earth would you do this?<<< 

My mirror on the driver side is already busted off, and theirs rust
under the passenger side mirror.  So I was thinking to maybe mount the
mirrors on the pillars instead of on the doors themselves. That way they
would be a little more forward, and theirfore require less 'eye' time
off the road to look in them, and they could be higher as well, for the
same reason. Not to mention, that I think it might look neat, and be
kinda origional. But the Wing windows would get in the way if I did
that. So "Down with the Wings!" I shouted! And ran inside to post. ;) 

But if it's not readily available, I'm not gonna totally knock myself
out to custom fabricate a 1 piecer. :) Theirs already some bondo on the
bus and I'm gonna be adding my fair share. I don't think this bus could
ever be a candidate for the "restore to factory condition" type of
restoration, so I'm going for a mild custom look. 

BTW, I've got the driver side mirror here now, and it doesn't seem to be
convex. Are they indeed flat? And if so, does anyone sell a convex
(things may appear closer) mirror for the bus? 

TIA
Chris
