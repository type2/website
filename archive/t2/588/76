Don't know.  Just happened to notice it on the engine.

This one is on the engine on the bottom toward the front on the starter side
of the block.  It looks like the one on the upper right-hand side of fiche#
013-00, but it's mounted horizonally (not vertically, like on the fiche).

I'm not sure that the original FI relay is still in the bus.  I'm thinking
of adding on to be safe.
