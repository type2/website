Subject: Re: [T2] Air intake question

It sounds like what you are talking about is the vent for the Eberspacher
gas heater. Is this vent on the inside of the bus, on the driver's side,
near the back corner of the bus above the spare tire well? If so that is the
vent where the warm air would come from if an Eberspacher BN4 heater was in
your bus at some point. The heater sat on the left (FIF) side of the engine
bay (where the auxillery battery on the later Westy's goes). If you no
longer have the heater than it is fine to cover that vent up. In fact those
vents are hard to come by and you could probably sell it to someone who can
use it...or better yet buy a heater and then you will be toasted right out
of the bus!!!

If this isn't what you are refering to explain better where this vent is and
we'll go from there.

Good luck!!
