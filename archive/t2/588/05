List,

Here is a link to our genuine thermostats. A bit more (OK, I admit it, a LOT
more) than the new style, but if you have a late bus, this is the only thing
currently on the market that will work. If you have an upright engine this
is a genuine VW part that requires no extra parts or modifications to fit
your vehicle.

I should have the tech article on installing one of these in a type iv
engine vehicle up on the site by Monday, and it will be linked from the
item.
