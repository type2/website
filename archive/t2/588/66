Subject: Window Kits for '76?

I'm looking for a 1 piece window kit for the front doors but not having
any luck. Does anyone know if these are made and where to get them? The
kind of kit they make for BUG's that eleminate the wing window.
 
The other window kit I'm looking for is for the large side windows. My
bay has little wing windows in it, and I would like to convert to either
Safari type windows or 50/50 sliding windows. Preferably the 50/50
sliders. Any ideas on who regularly stocks these? 
 
TIA
