poppycock.

converting to water-cooled has got to be at least double the work of
rebuilding the original engine.

don't even get me started on how the bus will LOOK when you are done.

i was at a car show this weekend and someone had a subaru converted westy.
it was too bad they didn't have an award for the fugliest car in the show,
because it would have been the hands down winner. anyone else on this list
who was at the KW bug out? back me up here...

custom coolant lines, rad mounting, engine mounts, rad grille/housing,
induction system modifications, wiring harnesses, tranny modifications,
custom exhaust, the list is huge of what this sort of swap involves, and
every area is a source of potential extra work, extra cost and even more
fugliness if not done to professional level, which most conversions are not.

as you can tell, this is one of pet peeves. why people think it is easier
and cheaper to completely re-engineer the power train of a vehicle than fix
the one that is already there is a mystery to me.
