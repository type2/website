Yep, that's the fiche.  I have them labeled by actual description of the
contents, so number-wise I'm stuck with whatevers on the fiche itself.

Sounds about right.  The replacement engine is an 1.8L.  That said, is there
a rebuild kit for the pump, or does it require a complete replacement?

Mine is a round cylinder, but since I bought it myself I know that it's a
low pressure model intended for imports.

Which explains why I never noticed a pump on my old engine, a sadly worn out
2L.

the crankcase breather tower, usually under oil/ grime.

I'll check it tomorrow in the daylight.  Should have thought of that myself.
Thanks, Alex.
