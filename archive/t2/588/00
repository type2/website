Subject: AN-type fuel line

anyone out there using braided AN-type hoses for their fuel feed? any 
one have pros / cons on this mod? besides expense!!  i have a 
barndoor fuel tap on the gas tank, and would love to go tap > short 
flex hose > AN line thru firewall > short flex > fuel pump. that 
precludes the usual welding-on of the banjo fittings.
