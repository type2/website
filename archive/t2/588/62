Subject: Alternator Upgrade

Hey everybody-

Since Im finally making progress on the engine, and it idles on its own (I 
ran out of gas for the first time today while working on it, guess that 2 or 
3 gallons I bought in September just wont go a full year in the driveway, 
haha) Im thinking about the future.

The alternator that was on there seems to work just fine.  Surprising, since 
its obvious age looks original.  However, Im going to need more current for 
camping purposes, since I want to get an AC inverter for TV and such while 
driving.  Also, Id like to add a second battery.  Stock current is something 
around 40 amps, Im guessing.  I figure I could use about 75-100A.  The only 
upgrade alternator Ive seen is 75A, and its expensive.  So, here lies my 
question.

From my other work on chevrolets, I know I can get a 105A alternator for 
about 100$.  If I can fabricate the bracketry to fit it, why couldnt I run 
this alternator?  The VW has an external voltage regulator, doesnt it?  
Wouldnt that make up for the added current and such?  Or could I even put in 
a GM voltage regulator in place of the VW.  I just dont see how electricity 
from VW can be different from electricity from GM, unless its an issue of 
load on the engine, or some complicated electrical problem that I hadnt 
thought of.

Thanks for the advice.
