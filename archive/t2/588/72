Subject: DriverSide 'Nose' totalled. Any ideas? 

Ok, I'm a pretty optimistic guy when it comes to my abilities regarding
auto-body. Maybe overly so. But check out this pic.

THAT is my bus. The door I can deal with no prob. But it's the rest of
the nose I'm having problems wrapping my head around. I don't think that
pic does justice to how mangled it TRUELY is. Here's what I've already
thought of for options. 
 
1: Buy the new nose piece I saw somewhere for $180 and weld it in. But I
REALLY don't have that kind of cash for cosmetics, so that's not really
an option. 
 
2: Pound it out as best I can, weld the tears back together and bondo
it. But the metal is fairly old, thin, and brittle. I don't think it can
take much shaping. Maybe not enough to even get it straight enough to
safetly bondo over. 
 
3: Cut it out, and replace it with Fibreglass. Then just bondo over that
to make it perfect. 
 
4: Pound out the crumbled area as much as it will take, POR-15 over it
all, then do a Fiberglass overlay on it, with a smoothing layer of
bondo. I'm kinda leaning towards this one. 
 
Anyway, anybody got any other ideas on how to fix it? I've seen 2 in
junkyards, and they won't let me cut out the body panels. If it doesn't
unbolt, I can't have it. :(  Does anyplace make just this one section of
the front instead of the whole nose, or has anyone bought the whole nose
just to use the other side? Heh heh, I wonder if Bondo would want to
sponser my rebuild. :) I could do a big 'ole Bondo logo on the side. Lol
