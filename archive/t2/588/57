Well, that will actually be one of the easier parts...

Rad mounted where the engine hatch is. KEP has some great info on
making sure air is moving through the rad properly. Plubming will just
be flex hoses to the normal locations. No need for extra pumping
capability since the hoses should be about the same length, possibly
slightly longer.

Actually, the difficult part will be coming up with a good way to heat
the bus with water. I'm thinking of making a box to house the heater
core and putting in the blower path somehow. That is later though...
Nothing that needs to be figured out immediately.

Shoot, I'm months away from even starting this project. No hurries! heh
