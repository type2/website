Subject: Re: [T2] Bay windshield question (& perhaps a free windshield

If you have the windshield out now is the time to replace it. It's hard to
reuse the seal if you buy a windshield later, and even if it is only around
$20 for a new seal the windshield is the hardest piece of glass to replace
so I would only want to do it once.

There is a little "mom and pops" auto glass shop here in Charlotte, NC where
I have bought 3 windshields for $93 each. Unfortunately I doubt they do
shipping, etc., but the point is I would try and find a smaller, local shop
and see about a better price.
