Subject: RE: Valve Adjusting Screw

I had the same problem after replacing all of my screws with aftermarket
screws - two different ones broke off while adjusting! The local VW dealer
was able to order a new set. When they arrived, the package said "made in
Germany" so I hope that this will solve the problem.

Good Luck,
Bill Moon
