Didn't John Muir cover oil temps in his book? Does anyone still read his
book? (I really can't believe people drive aircooled vw's and don't have a
copy of John Muir's book with them.)
I'm remembering that 210:f was a really bad thing for oil temps.

I had an oil temp gauge in my '71 and after I put the Reveeco (as I recall)
external oil cooler on I almost never hit that magic number. I did just
once, a full load in the summer going up that pass just north of Grants
Pass, OR on I-5.
