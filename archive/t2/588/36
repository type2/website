Doug,

If this is your 71 westy, it is waaaay too hot for a T1 engine.

about 220 might be a maximum....t4's can generally run a little hotter, 
but not really recomended.

Did you calibrate your sensor before you installed it??...as in boiling 
water so that you know *exactlly* where 212 is (give or take a few 
degrees)?

Synth oil is reputed to break down less at those temps than dino oil.
Lots of articles pro and con out there....some of the mags have done 
"tests".


Cheers, dave
