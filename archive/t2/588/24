Don, even up to date your experiences on you bus have been very
helpful for people down the road. As you continue to fix it you most
likely will be posting an entire timeline of what was wrong & how it
was fixed. Five years from now when a dreamy eyed teen finally gets
that bus he found in a backyard, he very well might have a story
parallel to yours. Keep up the good work.
