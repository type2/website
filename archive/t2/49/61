Subject: heater boxes / part question

I have been searching for whatever keeps my stock heat from really working
the way I have heard
others report it can if everything is both there and connected correctly. I
replaced those paper tubes and insulated them the best I could, they connect
down to the heater boxes nice and tightly, but when I pulled the heat sheild
from the bottom of the motor to continue following them, that metal pipe
that goes from the heater boxes to the next metal pipe (the part exactly
underneath the heat sheild) I found these two (on both sides, they appear to
be exactly the same) pipes to be rather crumbly. There is not any large
gaping holes in them, but I am pretty sure if I poked it with my finger hard
enough I could punch a hole right through with little to no effort. If I
touch them, rust/dust falls from them. In my tracing of this issue, this
appears to be the only major weak link (starting from the back, moving
forward anyway. I havent removed the guard under the front of the bus to
check those connections yet where the heat must travel up into the cab).

Now, are these pieces known as something in particular, if I was able to
order them from someone? Or any suggestions on how to fix them/workaround
replacements for this section?

It has been raining here in SF the past few days and really cold sitting in
traffic for an hour just because ppl leave their brains at home when it gets
a little wet out. I would hate to see a lot of them try and drive back in
Wisconsin in the middle of winter. Then again, maybe thier suv's would
finally have some kind of justification. (maybe!)

Thanks for any help you can pass along....
