Subject: Fuel gauge in a 69 Bus


Greetings List:

My fuel gauge isn't working and my wife the daily driver is starting to get VERY annoyed with me.

Please bear with my tortured english as I'm no electrician (but willing to learn)...

Here's the scoop:  last month while checking the turn signal wires I may have done something stupid
and fried my fuel gauge (?).  The fuel gauge had been working fine for 10 years, but when I undid
the speedometer cable and pulled out the instrument cluster I inadvertently pulled off the fuel
gauge wires.  I checked my Haynes manual and it looked pretty simple:  One wire for illumination and
the other from the fuel sender unit...Yes?  No?

On my 69, there's two "male" connections behind the fuel gauge, one with a "+" sign and the other
marked with a "G".  Per the Haynes illustration, I connected the loose black wire (coming from
nearby) to the "+" connection, and the loose pinkish wire (which led off down behind the kick
panels) to the "G" connection...Turned on the ignition and the needle started jumping around - and
it jumped around more when I accelerated.  Since this was annoying, I undid the two wires.
Yesterday I went to investigate again, hooked the wires up, and nothing.  I can't even see the
needle.  Can I "kill" the fuel gauge?  Wires just wrong?

Related question:  Is there some other "part" of the fuel gauge behind the instrument panel that I
don't know about?

Any wise readers have an opinion as to what in the blazes I am doing to my bus?

Thanks in advance,
