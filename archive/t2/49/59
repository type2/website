Subject: 74 westy w/ Salisbury State stickers- who owned it?

Picked up a westy last weekend.  It is white w/
green/blue interior and several interesting stickers I
was told were left by the previous owner.  The
stickers include an old version of the list sticker,
umn.edu version, "Salisbury State University" sticker,
and a Cape Hatteras sticker.  If the previous owners
are still on list, please pmail me.
