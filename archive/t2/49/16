Jeez! I think you're selling it too cheap! $400 seems about right to me.
Considering that progressive carbs have no plenum heating and no air
pre-heating, that number make the real cost of fixing stock carbs or FI a much
more attractive alternative.
I'm sure that someone with less skill than you might take many times 4 hours to
rejet them and get them set up correctly. I know I've sunk many hours into such
projects and made it better, but still felt I wasn't quite there.
