Yes, this type but not neccessarily this quality.  Most of them are
Taiwanese made and not as nice; they are noticably flimsier, and some of
them don't open up as wide (so they won't hold the big cups). I, too, sold
them for under 5 bucks ($4.50 to be exact) when I had them. They're not bad
for that price.  But in my estimation these ones are worth a few bucks more
(and are still very cheap), which is why I dropped the cheaper ones in favor
of them.  I figure that for most people, if you're drilling holes in your
bus to install a cup holder, you'd probably rather pay a couple of bucks
more to get one that's likely to last longer.
