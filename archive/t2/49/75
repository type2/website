Get your wallet out and wide open, you could shoe horn a hemi chrysler
into your van if you throw enough money at it.
Look at old Tommy Ivo, he had an Olds Toronado with both a front and rear
engine then to beat that he built a car with four engines. Ran like a
sherman tank but he got the job done.
Old Juke Raby is getting as much horse power out of his Type2 engines as
you'll ever get out of a TypeIV.
Most engine swaps are nightmares and I'm not talking about Tiico. Its the
homegrown stuff that renders your Van crusher material.
