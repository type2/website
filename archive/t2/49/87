Subject: OTHER WHEEL CHOICES

All this talk about wheels inspired me to shop the "mainstream" (although if 
you are buying custom wheels, they might as well be bigger right?). I sent 
in the question below to tires dot com and they sent me back the response 
you see. i doubt that 17inch wheels with 7 inches of tread width would 
actually fit on a bay window, so i queried them again and haven't yet heard 
back. does anyone know of any other custom wheel choices that fit our 
hassle-laden bolt pattern and look "cool?" my local import vw shop 
(autosport, vancouver wa) said they had a choice from Rocket Wheels, but 
"lost the faxed copy" and said they'd look for it. anyway, follow the link 
and see how COOL our busses might be...
