Subject: Type 4 questions

Hi list-

I am new to the type 4 world, and have a couple of probably simple 
questions for the experts (for my 73 bus engine):

1) Tried to time the engine yesterday, and the timing marks are gone. 
Is this a decal, and if so, where can I get one?

2) The air pump on this engine has been disconnected from the exhaust 
manifold, but is still mounted to the engine, and is connected by a 
fan belt to a pulley that seems to be mounted to the center of the 
fan.  The pulley doesn't turn with the fan - it seems to be 
independent.  Can I remove all of the air pump related stuff without 
difficulty?

3) The electric fan mounted in the top of the engine compartment. 
Does it have something to do with engine cooling?  Is it 
thermostatically controlled?  Or is it only for passenger compartment 
heating?

4) Finally, assuming that I need some engine parts, who/what is a good source?

Thanks for the help
