Subject: RE:exhaust studs

Hello,

Something like this happened to me on my 73 bus.  I think you are talking 
about the piece welded to the heater box where the exhaust studs pass 
through and holds it to the head.  JB weld will hold it for about the five 
minutes it takes for the heat of your engine to melt it.  You will have to 
have it specially welded or replace the heat exchanger.  I think they will 
have to preheat the whole part before they weld it.  Regular mig welding 
won't hold.  I learned this the hard way.  After having the same piece 
welded my entire exhaust system fell off waiting in line at the Canadian 
boarder.  I wrapped it in a blanket, threw it in the car and went through 
customs like nothing had happened.  Called a tow truck on the other side.  
Good luck, James.
