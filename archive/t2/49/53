I just recently painted the 14" rims of my '70 Westy and had 185 R14 =
Kuhmo D-rated truck tires put on.  (Hope these work!)  Now they need to =
be balanced but I am having a bear of a time finding a place that has an =
adaptor for this rim.  A friend has the high speed balancing equipment =
but no adaptor.  What does everyone else do to get their tires balanced? =
 Are there adaptors available for sale or would this be a real expensive =
way to go?  Would appreciate any workable suggestions.
Thanks.
