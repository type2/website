Neil,
Remachined lifters?  Not possible unless they can add metal, or just
replace the innards!- they can wear where the cam rubs and could wear in
the bore they ride in (not likely- they ride in softer metal) and might
wear a bit where the pushrod contacts the center piston.  The piston
could also wear where it rubs.  The lower spring-loaded piston could
also wear. They will function if the piston sits well within its limits
of travel (slapping the retainer clip or hitting the spring loaded lower
piston)- it's like nearly 2mm of free play when not pumped up.  Mine
were replaced about 130,000 mi ago.
   When you adjust, back the adjustor screw so it does not contact the
lifter and then turn it in until you just contact the piston- the screw
should turn freely by hand so you can just feel this contact even if the
lifter has lost oil.  Then do the turning in of ther adjustor to place
the piston within its range of travel (at least one turn).  A quarter
turn risks the piston hitting the retaining clip, not good as it's
rather thin!
     On #3 exhaust- if you had to turn it in much farther than the
others, then something is too short between valve seat and pushrod end-I
wonder if the right pushrod is in there, or if cam lobe is worn, the
rocker pushrod end is worn, or if valve is not seating all the way, the
valve seat in the head is too thick, adjustor screw is mushroomed or the
valve end (not likely).  It is also possible that the lifter spring is
worn and the initial "contact" you should feel is too deep - the
scientific way would be to switch it with another lifter to verify this-
ie, put a new one in there!
