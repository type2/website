Okay,

Now that I've got the engine running well in the 78, I
have noticed that the fuel lines are less than perfect
and after all this talk of bus fires, I want to
replace them.  It looks pretty straight forward, but
one question.  The line that runs from the fuel filter
to the tank is metal; is it okay to replace this with
high pressure fuel hose?

Any other thoughts on fuel line replacement would be
great.
