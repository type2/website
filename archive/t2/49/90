Subject: radio mounting/wiring

I've inherited a old Blaupunkt am-fm mono with the
usual front knobs--a la' sapphire.

Can i get the plastic (?) cover that allows the radio
to be mounted in the hole in the dash?

Otherwise, I'll have to make one out of 1/4" plywood
or aluminum or godknowswhat — and it won't be pretty. 

I also have a very nice Toyota (sanyo) radio/cassette
but it doesn't have a rear hook-up plug. Is there a
web site that give some clues to wiring it?

(I know this is more trouble than it's worth, but
cash-flow problems make even a bargain-basement new
radio impossible at this particular time.)
