Subject: Custom drawings of your own VW.

Sorry if this offends anyone, but I told my daughter I'd post it for her.
:-)

My daughter is currently finishing her last year of HighSchool and will
attend the local college to study for a degree as an Art Teacher. In order
to help fund herself, she has been doing drawings locally for some of the VW
owners. I posted her two latest drawings of Vw's at
www.nisa.net/~chook/vwdrawings for anyone who might be interested in having
a drawing of their own VW done. She will do it on standard sketch pad paper
approximately 9" X 12". All she needs is a GOOD photo or jpg of your
vehicle, from an angle like you see in the pics posted above. It takes her
about 3 hours to do one, so is charging $20.00 US. I think that's around
minimum wage. :-) Email me at chook(-at-)nisa.net if you'd like one for Xmas! or
???
Regards,
Courtney Hook
