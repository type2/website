Subject: RE: [T2] air vents

Once again another BUStedBUS specialty. These vents get trashed on the dash
because everyone puts there feet up on them, But, not to worry this is the
same part that vents into the rear of the bus through the channel on the
door and no ever puts there feet up on these. So, we have plenty of nice
ones. These sell for $7.50 and can be ordered by phone or found on out web
site. Shop under Heating then Fresh air Control this is item #45. If you
have any questions please don't hesitate to call.

68  Kombi

     I am looking for replacement round, dashboard air vents for a 68 bus.
The ones I have are cracked and feel like old dried up play dough.  I would
prefer replacements made of modern plastic.  Original  factory equipment is
not important to me.   I have looked through many on line vendors and have
not found these yet.  Does anyone out there know of a supplier?
