Subject: Re: [T2] 2.0L in a '70???

Saw this one and have to ask:

Why? What is the major difference(s) between the '70 and say '72 setups? My
previous '72 had the 1700 T4 installed and it looked like a 2.0 would
shoehorn in there O.K..... Why convert to an upright? I can imagine there
may be some frame clearance related issues on the sides but???

Enquiring minds want to know....

Thanks and take care,
