Tom,

Sounds like a good deal.  Check it thoroughly before you buy, of course,
but '78s are among the premium years in many people's opinions.  You
mention holes in the fiberglass pop-top... in the canvas or in the
fiberglass?????  Otherwise, it sounds like a fine bus, Billy!  Go for it!

We had a discussion a while back on the list as to what a bus costs and
one of our esteemed members maintained that a bus costs $5,000.  You can
either pay that for a good solid bus up front, or you pay less and then
put the rest into getting it back to being a good solid bus.  Note that
sweat can be substituted for some of the cash if you are up for it.

Err...  so what's wrong with Owsley's bears?  See:

http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~mleone/gdead/faq/dancing-bears.html

for the cultural reference.

And it's Hayduke, as in George Hayduke from Edward Abbey's "The
Monkeywrench Gang", nothing to do with Caddyshack.
