Subject: rear suspension woes

Howdy,

I seem to have a large sort of problem on the rear end
of my '71 Westy.  I have tried (unseccessfully) to
figure out the names of the parts so I don't sound
like an idiot, but here goes.  Behind the brake
backing plate, there is an arm which goes toward the
front.  This arm has a cup on it, facing up, which
should catch a rubber thing located on a separate arm.
 The driver's side set up is OK, the passenger side is
not.  Where the cup should be - it isn't.  The arm is
there but the edges of the cup which extend beyond the
arm are gone.  So I am going to try to replace this. 
My questions:

1.  What is the part number of this thing?

2.  Will the same part from a '73 work on a '71?

3.  Is this extrememly difficult? (I couldn't find
anything discussing it in either Muir or Bentley)

4.  How the hell do I get that thing off?  It appears
I pretty much have to tear down everything around it,
brakes, bearings, the arm that goes to the torsion
bars, etc.  Is there an easier way?  I want to do it
right, but I'd rather not work on it all winter.

Any information about this would help, as I am not
really looking forward to this.  However, when its all
done, my rear suspension should be all nice and
POR-15'd.

Thanks

Blake
