Subject: Cheap Stuff

List,
Just came in from futzing around in the bus, putting on a fresh coat
of Rain-X, etc.  I happened to cruise through the $1 store in town and
found a 5'X1' roll of shelving/drawer stuff that is cut to fit on, duh,
shelves and drawers.  Its tacky to the touch, and grips when you place
it between two surfaces.
I placed it underneath my front rubber mat, which always slides when
I step up, and under my custom-made console to keep it from sliding around.
 Works like a champ!  It grabs great on both applications.  I'm going
to pick up another roll to keep in the tool box for other roadside needs.

Later,
