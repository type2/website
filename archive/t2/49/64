Subject: T4 head fair market value

Hi Folks
I have been chatting with a Friend of mine, He has a stash of NOS T4 heads that
circumstances makes him want to unload.

They are the 1700  casting number 022-101-372  
also the 1.8 liter casting number 021-101-371S  unknown valve size at this time

he has a fair number of them,, and wants to sell the easiest and quickest way,
and naturally wants a good  / fair price for them,,,

I am after a couple of them, and would like to convince him the fair price....
can you suggest something like ... a GREAT deal price, a really fair price,,
just something to put it in perspective?

Thanks for any help.. if your interested, let me know and I will pass on your
info!
