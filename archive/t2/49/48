Subject: case savers

Is there a good case saver faq on the web?
I have an otherwise good case that has two studs
that won't hold the required torqe. The case
already has case savers, so I suspect that
the best thing to do is remove the bad case
savers and replace them. Anybody want to give
me advice on this? Thanks in advance.

Bob
