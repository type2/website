Look for a tiny notch on the pulley(fan).  As to any decal, no.  There is a
plastic scale shaped like a fourth of a circle more or less that has "o" and
several BTDC and ATDC increments marked.  This is attached just left of the
fan pulley.  Contact a list vender, a good Cali junkyard, etc for the
plastic piece.

I got lost in this description, but if it is an A/C system, sure you can
remove it.  Just make sure to replace any holes or gaps in the cooling tin.

This is for heating the bus.  It is switched via the red levers on the dash.

Now Dave, how can you live in Cali with a nice crop of busses and need to
ask where to get parts.  From your list of rides, I'd say the place for
parts is Daves garage.  JK, there are good list vendors that have tons of t4
parts. Junkyards and engine builders are great for the obscure stuff.
Good luck and welcome.

 Ha, I know, they are those old busses in the magazine pics of the shows in
Cali.
