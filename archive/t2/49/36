Subject: WTB 80 Westy interior components

Good Volks folks...

Title says it...I bought an 80 Westy with an engine fire to restore over
the winter, and need to replace some interior items...would be
interested in a parts bus if it's in upper NY, Ontario, or Michigan...

CHANGE YOUR FUEL LINES REGULARLY PEOPLE, THIS IS A MESS TO CLEAN UP
AFTERWARDS...if you want to see pictures, p-mail me

Here's what I'm looking for....please respond off line to save
bandwidth...

Back half (upright portion)cushion for the z-bed
Rear cushion over the engine hatch
Right side armrest from the z-bed
Corner cabinet
Side cabinet (Fridge and stove cabinet is fine)
Tray and light assembly from above the fridge/stove unit
Two upstairs cushions (if these ever get wet/moldy don't try washing
them with spray and wash, they go to shreds even on a gentle cycle)
Right side tail-light assembly
DS marker light
Rear edge sliding door mech.
Inside catch for holding the door open
Inside sliding door panel with clips

I'm in midst of rebuilding a 2.0L Vanagon engine in case anyone needs
