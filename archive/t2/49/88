Subject: Fi problem and question; 2 liter AFC injection

        Volks,
Problem on 81 2 liter.  To make a long story short, pinched AFM off of
running  van to make another run for sale.  When I went back to van to put
different AFM on, It ran really bad.  No power plumes of black
smoke.........I thought, no problem, I will put the original AFm back
on....same result.  Actually ran better with the connector off the AFM than
with it on........

The weird thing is it was running fine prior to my "borrowing" of the
AFM...........Any ideas?
