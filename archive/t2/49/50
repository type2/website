Subject: RE: [T2] Jake Raby motor reviews ?

See my earlier comments about bringing my bus home last week with new Type 
IV. This one may be a little different than most in that it's running a pair 
of dual Dell 40s, plus a few other goodies. I've only put a total of 150 on 
the engine so far, so I can't speak of it's longevity (yet), but I do plan 
on letting people know how it progresses as time goes by.

Just the work he did on the heads alone makes me feel much better about 
driving this thing anywhere.

I will be keeping a weekly log of how the bus progresses (yes, I have 
issues). If at any time you'd like to see how it's doing, please feel free 
to drop me a pmail.
