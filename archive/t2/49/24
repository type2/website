Not sure what year bus you have but I have been through this issue 
before. System is pressurized at 42 PSI. When you push the wiper 
switch on 72 and earlier of pull the arm on later models all that is 
happening is that you are opening a valve and letting the pressurized 
fluid through the system all the way to the spray nozzles. The system 
is plumbed with rubber hoses that tend to get crack with age in the 
area whey the connect to the valve(switch) the T splitter under the 
dash the runs to the nozzles and the connection at the nozzles 
themselves.

You can remedy the situation by going through the system and finding 
the leaky connection. When you find it trim about half an inch off 
the hose and reattach the hose the the plastic fitting.

It would be advisable to pressurize your system with a hand pump such 
as that for bicycles. With a one liter container you can reach 42 psi 
in a more controlled fashion then with a compressor at the filling 
station.
