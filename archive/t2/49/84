Subject: RE: [T2] Update on the beast... er bus...

Here in Texas hail is a problem.  I replaced the vent cover once 
with a new plastic one and two years later hail destroyed it and 
let lots of rain inside my bus.  At the third trailer store I went 
to I found what I was looking for - a metal vent cover.  Doesn't 
let light through but it doesn't break either.  Dents don't matter 
because it's too high up to be seen.  As a possible added bonus 
I'm thinking it would make a good ground plane for a small CB 
antenna which is important to me since my whole roof is fiberglass 
and there is no place to mount a decent antenna.  If you want a 
plastic vent cover they are available in white, smoke, and I think 
I even saw a clear one.
