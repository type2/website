Subject: RE: [T2] Dash Speaker question

Chris, I belive that the speaker attaches with screws to the existing grill
corners. It's finding a speaker that matches the hole pattern that might be
the trick.

Subject: [T2] Dash Speaker question


I am 80% done with restoring my dash. I got all new paint / dye and I
changed the colors from brown to black and dark grey (a two tone job).

I recommend it even if you are staying with the same color - mine was brown
with black areas where the OEM dye had turned color....

However, I am wanting to add a speaker to the OEM location for my CB (my
first permanent installation after years of keeping them on plug in cables
so I could move it from car to car).

How did the VW factory attach these speakers to the bottom of the dash top?
I see no mounting tabs, or brackets.
