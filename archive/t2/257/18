The mugs do seem quite benign because they are so cartoonish and 
homemade-looking, and because they are one-offs. And IANAL*, however, I 
don't think the guy has a prayer. There are VW marks all over these 
mugs, the Federal Trademark Dilution Act works against him, and there 
just isn't any fair use provision or First Amendment protection for this 
kind of stuff.

If the artwork on the mugs were obviously a parody or satire of some 
sort he might be able to skate, and some of this artwork might be 
regarded as a parody by a court. If he has the money to defend himself. 
He probably doesn't.

The bottom line seems to be that VW is sending a message, they have been 
sending the same message for at least three years, they are sending it 
very forcefully and consistently, and they probably don't intend to stop 
sending it: don't use their trademarks at all or they are going to find 
you and hurt you. I don't *like* that, but it's pretty hard to deny 
given all the evidence we have.
