Ron:

Since I just acquired an '82 Federal Westy to compliment my '81 California
Vanagon, and since the Westy has a "shot" muffler welded to the catalytic
converter in front of it, is what you suggest below a viable way for me to
replace the catalytic converter/muffler combo, assuming I don't want to stay
"stock"?  I'm intrigued because I'm trying to figure out if I want the Westy
to stay Federal or convert it to California and here's a way to make the
conversion without committing to all the somewhat-scarce left-side
components (heat exchanger, separate manifold) of the California model.
