Subject: Re: [T2] Adding Oxygen Sensor

Hi Ron:

Unfortunately I received my cat and muffler from you last month, so
unless I can
exchange them, I will have to make the mods myself. Since the O2 sensor
needs to
be placed before the cat, I had thought to modify the crossover pipe. I
also
have a new crossover that I need to install.

Before I do this however I am going to play around with the existing
deteriorating system. If I screw up the consequences are less.

Thanks for the thoughts.
