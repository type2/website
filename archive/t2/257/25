Subject: Customer Satisfaction?


I live in a rural area and plan to purchase either a long block or turn key 
(new or rebuilt) engine from one of the several mail order businesses that market 
over the internet. I would appreciate comments from anyone who has
made such a purchase in the last year with respect to "customer satisfaction" 
dealing with the business and hardware you selected.

Thank you,

Joe Delecki, from Vermont
