I should add that when I removed my Solex carbs to clean/service them (not 
the first time, but maybe the fourth or fifth time <g>) I found that thanks 
to the wonderful pot-metal construction of the carbs and perhaps to the 
carb attachment bolts being over-torqued at one point in their lives, the 
bottoms of the carbs were no longer flat, but bowed up in the middle, thus 
allowing the fuel leak which I had also seen on my carbs.  I put the 
inverted carb body in a vice and filed the bottom flange until it was 
completely flat again which, together with new gaskets, took care of the 
leak from that area.
