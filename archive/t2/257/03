Upcoming Volkswagen event

September 29 (Sun.) Brookline, MA - 17th annual Transporterfest, at Larz
Anderson Park Museum of Transportation. 10am to 3pm. Sponsored by LiMBO and
NEATO. Join us for a fun-filled day of VW Transporters old and new. Last
year we had 77 buses gather on the beautiful lawn at the M.O.T. in Brookline
(near Boston) for a day of relaxed bus-ness. Every bus gets a dash plaque
and entry for two adults into the museum for a $7 admission fee, kids are
free. We have a huge raffle at the end of the day and will be camping on
Friday and Saturday nights at Bourne Scenic Park on the Cape Cod canal, call
(508)759-7873 for camping reservation. For directions to the museum visit
