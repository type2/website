Subject: 71 gas guage in a 78

 
--Honestly dude, 

the gas sender is a 10-15 dollar part for the correct year. rather than doing a hokey wack job on your (somebody's future) bus, cough up and get the right one.

Later,

my thought was to replace the whole left piece (what ever the whole thing is called) Only difference at a quick glance is that the turn signal on a 71 has a left arrow and right vs the 78 only has one light.  Being smart I did pull the wires with the lightbulbs...so if ya think it'll work I'll give it a try.
