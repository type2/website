If I understand correctly what you're trying to do, yes.  This combination
(49-state Vanagon heat exchangers and crossover pipe with watercooled
Vanagon cat and 1.9L watercooled Vanagon muffler) will work and fit just the
same as the stock 49-state setup, but with a provision for an 02 sensor.
Compared to the California setup, it does away with the rare and expensive
left-side California only heat exchanger. Incidentally, the same exhaust
works on a '79 bus as well (if used with '79 49-state heat exchangers).
