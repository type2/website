What am I missing here?  You are doing this with the air cleaner in place?!?
Open engine hatch, remove right air tube from blower fan to tin tube.
Unhook latch holding air cleaner to support.
Remove engine cover.
Disconnect wire plug on AFM, disconnect vacuum hose to EEC purge valve on back
of air cleaner, disconnect hose to charcoal cannister.
Loosen screw clamp holding big S hose to AFM.
Lift air cleaner off support and remove out thru the engine hatch.
Takes all of two minutes and you have a straight shot to #2 plug.
