Subject: ACE / trip to Wva


FWIW, my local family-owned hardware store, which also happens to have an
Ace franchise, always has all the nuts and bolts I ever need. In stainless
too! And the owner pays college tuition for the kids who work there through
high school.  It pays to support local small businesses.

Bus content: I am leaving this afternoon to drive 450 miles to Fayetteville,
West "by God" Virginia for some kayaking this weekend.   Route plan:

	I-85 to I-985 to US 23 N through Clayton GA (110 miles)
	US 23 N to Asheville (90 miles)
	US 19/23 N through Johnson City to I-81 N (75 miles)
	I-81 to I 77 N (92 miles)
	I-77 to Beckley (74 miles)
	US 19 to Summersville (16 miles) whew!

If you happen to see a broken down 70 Westy thats primer white in the rear,
and rustoleum dark red and black in the middle, and metallic blue on the
nose, with kayaks on top (can't miss it), please stop and say hello!
Returning that route Sun. night/Mon. am.  I'm the guy with the new
hot-running 1835.

Stop the oil war,
Will

'70 Westy "Rebertha"
