You need to get a copy of the the A.I.R.S. list and join the Type2 list 
until your trip.

Close to a thousand owners - expert and amateur.

Make sure that your bus is 100% tuned and the engine is 100% complete and 
then main a 55-60 mph top speed and you will be just fine.

Don't leave home until you've replaced all of the fuel lines and fusel 
system vent lines. These busses are prone to engine fires if they are not 
maintained properly.

Get a fire extinguisher too.
