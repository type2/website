Subject: Re: [T2] So I thought outside the box...

Find out where the motor drives the door from. Does it drive it from the 
rear door support or ???

Then find out how much you've got the cut your bus...

Now do you still want to do it? <VBG>

Personally I want 4 wheel vented disc brakes on my bus, swaybars, and 15" 
wheels. Got the whole thing sourced out but disc brakes will require some 
lathe time...
