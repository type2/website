Subject: 71 gas guage in a 78

I pulled a gas guage from a 71 at a junk yard thinking it might work for my 
78.  Anyone know off hand before I pull out my guage cluster?  

I know just replacing the gas part wont because the 71 is wider, but my 
thought was to replace the whole left piece (what ever the whole thing is 
called)  Only difference at a quick glance is that the turn signal on a 71 
has a left arrow and right vs the 78 only has one light.  Being smart I did 
pull the wires with the lightbulbs...so if ya think it'll work I'll give it a 
try.
