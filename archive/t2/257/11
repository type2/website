Ding ding ding! Kinda...

The drain plug that Dolan used to block off the stripped hole for that cutoff 
solenoid had fallen out because the silicone adhesive he used to glue it in 
had finally given up the ghost from the engine heat. Points for me for recognizing 
the sound of a massive vacuum leak, demerits for not catching that there was 
a gaping hole at the base of my left carb. The drain plug is now epoxied in.

Also, I was right -- the rotor was TOAST! It's been replaced and I have a 
spare.

She runs like a champ once again.
