Subject: Vanagon Seatbelt into a Bay - pictures of installation

For anyone else contemplating using vanagon seatbelts in their Bay Window,
here are some shots http://www.nisa.net/~chook/seatbelts/    of how mine
were done using simple 2" angle iron and all the original bolts etc. Scuse
the rust. :-)
