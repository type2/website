Subject: Re: [T2] Rear axle swap?

I've known people (myself included) that got alot of of extra miles from 
worn or noisy CV joints b/c they flipped them over.

If the CV joints aren't making any noise yet you won't notice of course.

Did you repack the joints with fresh grease? Might as well.

Ciao!
