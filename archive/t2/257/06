Subject: Re: [T2] VW Trademarks/resale

what about resale? there are alot of products that are resold over and
over and the original creators never see another penny... just ask that
country singer who refused to sell his albums at outlets that also sold
used copies. if he wasnt going to make money off the album being resold,
then he wasnt going to support them. this was almost 10 years ago, BTW.

VWoA can't restrict the resale of original parts, and it doesnt make
sense that they could restrict the advertisement of their availability.
they are no longer property of VW... if they could, then Ebay wouldnt be
in business for long.

waving sadly cuz no matter what they do, i still love these cars,
