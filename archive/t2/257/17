Subject: Ben's Carbs

Volks,

I am out of my depth.  I started on Ben's problems as ignition and timing,
which are broadly applicable and have little to do with the way fuel is
supplied.  That I could handle.  It has drifted thru vacuum (which I know)
towards carbs (which I *don't* know) and now I am out of my depth.

My carb bus experience is limited to driving a single ?Weber? installed on
a '79 for a week and driving Nikki's '73 wiht the stock dual carbs from
Atlanta to Greensboro.  Nikki's dual carbs had their share of problems...
the shutoff solenoid in the "third carb" fell out and the boots for the
disc brake booster got blown off in a backfire, but mostly it ran strong
and smooth.  The single carb ran <euphemism> very badly </euphemism> due
to carb icing here in the mid-atlantic area.  I will never recommend that
conversion to anyone not living in a desert.

I know there have to be stock rebuilders and aftermarket solutions in the
single and dual carbs.  Anyone got an opinion? Recommendations of someone
who does a *good* job of rebuilding the stock carbs? (*really* clean and
new throttle shaft bushings)

In addition, I am headed for Las Vegas (family thing) tomorrow and will be
offline 'til Tuesday.  Y'all have a good weekend!!!!
