Hi all:

I'm looking for the boot the covers the guide pin/rear shift linkage
connection near the transmission, part # 251 711 167A.  None of the
internet
retailers I've contacted have it and according to my local VW dealer
no
warehouse in the U.S. has one either.  I thought I might take a flyer
and
try to contact a Germany-based retailer for this part.  Has anyone
tried
this, and can anybody offer any URL's where I might try my luck?

TIA.
