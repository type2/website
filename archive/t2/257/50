Subject: Re: [T2] VW Trademarks

I wonder what ever happened to the "hobbiest" license that was on the 
net earlier this year. I signed up WetWesties just to see what would 
happen.  So far, no word either yea or nay. And WW prominently displays 
the VW trademark.... <http://wetwesties.org> Maybe they're ignoring me 
because there's no commercial aspect.
