reversing an axle (wheel/transmission  CV joint) on  the side it was

are also a few other combinations I could try.  The last choice would be
to leave them in the same position they were in when I removed them.

I tend to favor leaving things where they are, while others favor swapping
the parts to expose new wear surfaces.  I don't think that there is any
hard data about which is best.

If you want to try changing the wear surfaces, you have to swap the CVs to
the other side of the bus.  Simply turning the axle around on the same
side of the bus does not change the direction of torque transfer through
the CVs.  Visualizing this is rather challenging and is left as an
exercise for the student.
