oooph. sounds as if its a late bay sprung a spring. pull the steering wheel
with the correct socket; look on the right side. one small tab? the other
broken or missing? you need two, plus the wacky spring for cancellation.

use the turn signal a few times while you're looking at it, see what moves.
then you'll see what i mean.  - steve
