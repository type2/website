Ben, Unless one of the castings is cracked or they were warped in a fire,
they ain't even *close* to the end of their useful lives!  Yes, they are
worn and dirty, but they are eminently rebuildable and after a rebuild
will be every bit as good as new!

Ben, I have to advise against this.  The problem with the single carbs is
that there is no provision on a type 4 motor to heat the intake runners.
Without that heat, in cool weather with high humidity (all fall and
spring) you will have severe problems with ice forming in the runners.  If
you lived in California or Arizona, that would not be a problem, but here
in the humid east, with many days where the temperature and humidity are
in the 50/50 range, carb icing is a real problem.  With the dual carbs,
the intake manifold is all of 3" and is bolted to the hot head, so ice is
not a problem.  I would stick with dual carbs, honest.

I am *NOT*, as I have said in previous posts, a carb guy, single or dual.
With one exception, I have driven nothing but FI since 1990 and I like and
am good at fixing the FI.  The one exception was a weber pregressive
single carb conversion that I drove for about a week.  It was *awful*!!!
Others will disagree as to whether carbs or FI are better, this is more
what you know and what you are used to than better or worse.  You need to
make a decision as to whether to get to know and love carbs or FI.
Neither is simple.  Just listening here over the years, I have learned a
lot about carbs, but I would never claim expertise.  There are those on
the list who have had good long-term experiences with the stock carbs and
with many non-stock variants.  I would hope to get some posts on who has
what and why they loved/hated it.

I *strongly* advise against going with an 009.  There are electronic
ignitons that will install in your stoick distributor and they are worth
looking into (I *like* setting points, but that is personal preference)
