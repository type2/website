Subject: Re: [T2] So I thought outside the box...

It does close every time.  I just don't like banging around, even
softly, with
the louvered windows, etc.  The idea of a smooth, effortless
open/close
seems to me not only aesthetically pleasing, but I imagine it
would reduce
wear and tear on the handle (the inside of which is certainly
becoming
expensive) among other things.

October will be a good month for the Bus, as I've budgeted a
healthy
amount to finish the resto... perhaps I'll forego new curtains
for one
of these units.

Incidentally, I understand that Braun sells them... I'll check on
availability
and price and report to the list.
