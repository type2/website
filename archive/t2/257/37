I don't know if the federal ECU can support the use of an O2 sensor, though
I'd doubt it; why would VW (Bosch) build in a capacity that wasn't needed?
One thing you might consider if you're going to the trouble of welding in a
bung for the O2 sensor is just monitoring its output yourself, in the cab.
It wouldn't provide "on the fly" feedback information to the ECU, but you
can tell if the fuel/air mixture is essentially set correctly and re-adjust
the mixture if it gets out of whack.  I've seen instructions for various
do-it-yourself O2 sensor monitors on the 'net, and I think these things are
even sold commercially by various outfits.
