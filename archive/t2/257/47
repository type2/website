Subject: High Temps

Winter is coming here in Central Ohio.  I will be putting the HapyBus and
the HipyBus away, and doing my winter tinkering.  Both units have a 1600 DP,
one  (The 71 Westy) has a new Mexican long block, 8K miles, with recently
installed gauges, it has 30 psi oil and runs about 235-240 temps.  The other
(66 Westy) has an O'berg oil filter, Gene Berg Heads (maybe this info means
nothing) it runs 50 psi and upwards of 240 temps.  Both have used the VDO
dipstick temp sender.
Here is my question....
I think they both run way too hot!  I have been told to check for vacuum
leaks.  I believe all the seals in both units are decent.  What else should
I trouble shoot to reduce these running temps?

TIA
