'71 Camper (Funky) is having his rotors turned.  I finally got my copy =
of Haynes from the library!  (Thanks m. I appreciate the offer... my =
immediate need is somewhat relieved!)  I have to get the rotors off by =
tomorrow afternoon to get them turned cheap.  ($5... gotta luv old =
neighbors)  To quote Haynes:

"Undo the socket head screw and undo the wheel bearing clamp nut."

How do I get the wheel bearing clamp nut undone?  The socket head screw =
was easy enough, but I don't want to screw the bearings up.  All my xtra =
bread is going to the new calipers. =20

Everyone wish me luck.  This is going to be my winter daily driver.  =
These days are quickly getting shorter!

Have a good one,
Eric and the Funkmeister
