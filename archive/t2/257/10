Subject: Variable Readings

Greetings, listfriends-

I received my new digital engine analyzer from Actron today and had to try
it out right away. I had a few suspicions about my vintage (from the 70's)
analog meter so I tested them side by side. Well, the old analog unit was
reading correctly and matched the digital meter point for point. So here's
my problem:  I can't seem to stabilize my idle speed. I have a 74 1.8 ltr
with a
34/36 DFAV Weber carb. As far as I have tested there are no vacuum leaks.
When I set the idle it pulses between about 860 rpm and 940 rpm, sometimes a
little more. Concurrent with this pulsing, the point dwell varies from 49 -
54 degrees, in perfect time with the idle pulse. The idle mixture screw has
an effect on the idle speed but doesn't cure the pulsing. I have done the
carb cleaner test for intake leaks and haven't found any at either end of
the intakes, the carb base or throttle shaft, or anywhere else in the engine
compartment.

Outside of this problem the bus runs fine. Starts instantly every morning in
any weather and runs strong at all speeds. I run around town every day, go
on short trips and long trips, all with no trouble at all--5 miles or 500
miles.

Anybody have any suggestions as to the cause of this problem? I've never run
into anything quite like this.

Regards,
Dave
