Subject: So I thought outside the box...

Okay.

You know those new minivans with *power* sliding doors?  Some
digging on the internet revealed the T&C, the Od*ssey and the
Sie*na all have them available...

Anyone but me ever wonder if one of these units could be
installed in our beloved Loafs?  It would
certainly impress the neighbors, and man - would I just LOVE it
closing every time, and quietly, too...

Perhaps a pipe dream.  I'll bet they're expensive, even from
junkyards.
