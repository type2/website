Hmmm... now I'm starting to worry about the canned VW logo on my web page, 
even though I'm not selling anything.  I wonder if they could possibly be 
upset if I replaced the logo with a photograph of the VW emblem on the 
front of my personal bus?  Or the one on my left-front hubcap?  Surely that 
couldn't be illegal - taking a photo of my own property and posting it on 
the internet??

For those wanting a new VW vehicle but not wanting to contribute to the 
coffers of the "evil company", consider buying the vehicle used instead of 
new.  There is still an indirect benefit to the manufacturer by increasing 
the value of its used vehicles, but it is far, far better than buying a new 
one, which will supply direct profit to both the dealer and the manufacturer.
