Hi everyone,
I've been unsubscribed for a while (life just got too busy)  Anyways I =
am back and ISO a part. I just built a 2L engine and the (used) heads =
have an extra hole on either side of the manifold.  running a Weber =
progressive at the moment until my dual carbs are rebuilt :(=20

I was told these holes were from emissions or FI related equipment.  =
Which I am not running.  Sooo I have 2 extra holes on either side of the =
engine.  I have one of the bolts that go thru and they had crimped the =
tube coming off of it.  I am in search of at least 3 more.  If anyone =
knows of an acceptable substitute easily obtainable at the local =
hardware store I'm all ears. If not, does anyone have any of these bolts =
they would be willing to sell?  I really need this part to get my engine =
running.  I leave for a 2 week vacation from SC to MO and back and =
really would like my bus to accompany me.

TIA

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
