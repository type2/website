Benoit,

I have looked at your page and below are my comments and advice.
Understand that while I have a '73, I have never run it with dual carbs
and have never owned a dual carb bus.  All of my dual carb experience is
with Nikki's bus and that is 3 weekends of tuning and one of driving it.

Benoit,

I looked at the page and:

Picture #1 (timing marks)

You have them correctly identified!  But 20-22 is not enough advance at
2000 RPM, but we will get to that... see the notes at the end.

Picture #2 (Timing for advance)

Yes, as I follow the vacuum line, it looks like it is going to the correct
port on the carb for ported vacuum, which is what you want for vacuum
advance.

Picture #3 (vacuum loop)

I dunno :-)  this is, I believe, the bottom of the air cleaner and I have
*no* idea what the two vacuum ports are for nor what kind of vacuum they
want.

Picture #4 (random vacuum port)

Benoit, this *looks* like the port for the vacuum retard, but I am not
sure.  The way to find out is to get/buy a vacuum gauge and hook it to
that port. If it shows 10-20" of vacuum at idle (it *should show 15-18",
but that's another story), and if it drops when you open the throttle,
then that is the port to hook the vacuum retard to.  If you do, tho, be
warned that you will need to reset timing to 10 degrees BTDC.

Picture #5 (fuel leak)

Benoit, there is *NO SUCH THING* as a "small" fuel leak!!!!  That small
leak today may toast your bus tomorrow.  The spot you are pointing to in
the picture is the junction between the carb and the intake manifold.
First, that should be a near perfect seal, certainly air (and thus fuel)
tight.  if fuel is coming out there, then it is dripping down the throat
of the carb, a bad thing and you also have a vacuum leak, also a bad
thing. It is time to remove and rehab that carb.

Picture #6 (right carb)

The "back of the butterfly shaft" you are pointing to is the input port
for the EGR filter.  If you have no EGR filter (few do) then it should be
sealed up tight!!!

Anyhow,  I am glad it is running but I have the following comments:

1) 22 is not enough advance.  You need 30-35 degrees.  the reason you are
not getting 30-35 is probably that the upper and lower parts of the
distributor shaft are frozen to each other.  As a result, the mechanical
advance is not kicking in.  Remove the distributor, take the rotor in one
hand and the drive dog in the other and try to rotate them in relation to
each other.  there ought to be ~10 degrees of movement (it should move
sensibly; not much, but it should feel "sloppy") if there is not, and I
believe there will not be movement, try pulling the felt pad out of the
center of the top of the shaft and spraying penetrating oil down there.
Try spraying it at the shaft along its length inside the dist., then work
the upper and lower parts of the shaft until you feel movement. Oil and
reinsert the felt pad.

(-at-)) your boggy idle when cold... maybe vacuum leaks, maybe a stuck float,
may be a plugged jet, whatever. From your description, it looks like your
carbs are overdue for a thorough cleaning and probably a rebushing of the
throttle shafts.  Most old dual carb settups are, alas.  New gaskets *are*
available, but the sort of cleaning you need cannot be done at home unless
you have more tools than most of us.  I had real carb problems back a
decade or so ago.  I cleaned them with carb cleaner and canned air a
coupel times with little improvement.  Then I brought my carbs up to my
brother in NY.  As a working physicist, he had access to a *big* (1 gallon
tank) ultrasonic cleaner.  We filled the tank with carb cleaner and
dropped the bits in...  they came out *clean*!  We blew them dry with his
compressor (with clean, filtered for micron particles air) and the bug
(what I had at the time) ran like a top for at least 6 months (a really
long time, for a '71 SB).

I would advise investing the $100-200 in having them cleaned by a pro,
with a strong push towards the extra $200 to have them rebushed as well,
as I believe they need it (they *all* need it :-)
