Subject: got my engine out, woohooo

Thanks for all the input for helping me get my engine out.  A friend helped 
me and we got it out in a pretty short amount of time.

I have my engine on a make shift workstand and will begin taking it apart to 
replace the heads with rebuilt ones. I'm pretty intimated by this job but 
I'm armed with the Bentley and good VW friends.

Thanks again,
Daniel
