Subject: Re: [T2] Running rich & high test & engine temps

The extractor muffler breathes better so your mechanic drilled the carb 
jets out to compensate. Now you've installed the restrictive OEM Beetle 
muffler and you need the smaller jets to get the mixture leaner.

I can't comment on the head temps versus octane but I have heard that 
higher octane makes the heads cooler but I don't trust my source on that 
comment - just hearsay.
