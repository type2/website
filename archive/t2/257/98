Subject: Re: [T2] So I thought outside the box...

Okay, folks.  I tried for two hours, but couldn't find
aftermarket power
sliding door kits.

I did discover that there are a lot of companies that specialize
in adapting
minivans with devices friendly to disabled folks, but I could
only find
references to them being sold as part of an entire vehicle.

I tried all the accessory sites with no luck.  Can anyone point
me in
*any* direction??

Oh, and the list of minivans currently offering power sliding
doors is
staggering.  90% of the hits on my searches yielded new car
manufacturers'
media releases.
