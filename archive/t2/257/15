I had one good one and one bad one.  Then someone took
a baseball bat to the good one (go figure)

I took it off straightened it with a hammer, took it
into a glass place and got it black siliconed in
place.  Cost me $5.00 CDN  or 0.25 USD :).

Not super duper pretty, but Im bac to one good one and
one bad one

Cheers
Logan
