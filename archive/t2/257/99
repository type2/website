The seat article was useful to me.  It appears TMI vends the sisel that goes
under the fabric and over the horsehair padding that I've been looking a
long time for. 28"x6' roll. It softens the seat a bit and keeps the
horsehairs from poking through as the seat ages.

When I redid my seats I was unable to find this stuff anywhere in town so I
reused what I had even though it wasn't in the best of shape.
