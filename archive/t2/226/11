Sorry about the previous post...Coffee on the keyboard...Mea culpa,
mea culpa...

Speaking about attitudes, wouldn't it just be easier to take the higher
humane road and gently explain the problems with the vehicle rather
than project a confrontational attitude? I know I get more out of some-
one who can meet me at my level rather than talk down to me. I'm a 
digilliterate, for example, and need things 'splained in simple terms be-
fore I grasp the solution to a computer-based problem...On the other
hand, it took a while before I could explain compound miters to my
neighbor who was running thru' board feet of crown moulding tryin'
to cut it on a Home Depot miter box...VW's are just as simple and
complex...They've got a rep for running forever with little maint-
nence...And probably close to true when they were a lot newer and a
lot more around. Now that they're vintage/chronologically challenged,
the story's quite different...
Give'er a break, in other words, maybe the vehicle in question is too
far gone to ever come back, maybe not...Whichever way, a little tact
couldn't hurt and might even bring another enthusiast into the fold...;-)
