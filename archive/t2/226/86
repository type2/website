Yay!

Originally it was timed one tooth off. I ended up having to remove the drive
shaft and replacing it. As far as the timing still being off, I certainly
hope not considering that factory timing is 5 ATDC and its there exactly.
Dwell is at 50.

No this is an issue somewhere with fuel. I think I might have a partially
plugged jet or an accel pump that that is leaking.  Anyone else with any
suggestions?
