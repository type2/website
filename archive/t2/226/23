it is 3-6" to the rear of the engine trans junction.  Further forward than
you might think, but I think the flywheel is the key weight factor and it
is in the bell housing, forward of the junction.

It is *HUGELY* easier to get the exhaust components off with the engine in
the bus!!!!  Once you drop the engine, it will be sitting on them, unless
you have a stand, in which case I might reconsider (but I don't have a
stand)
