Subject: Fuses...

List,
All of this talk about wiring and fuses reminded me of
something I saw in Muir that I could not locate or
understand.  I thought I had a problem with the
ignition switch on my '72, but it turned out to be a
loose battery ground wire...check the obvious stuff
first. I was going to go through the check for the
ignition switch, Muir said to locate fuse #15 and
check/replace.  I could not find fuse #15, could
someone steer me in the right direction for future
reference.
Thanks,
Billy Ray
