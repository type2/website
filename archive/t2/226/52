Subject: Buying a bus for the first time...

Hi!

I've been lurking on this list for a while, trying to find out all I can
about buses as I've been interested in owning one, and now that my chance
has come, I was wondering if any of you had any advice- what I should be
looking for, what I should avoid at all costs, etc.  I'm sure you get these
sorts of questions all the time, I just wasn't quite successful in finding
the info in the archive.  The bus in particular I'm looking at is a '71 with
a 1600cc engine.  Thanks in advance!

Kelly
