well you really need the Bentley book too, the Muir book is based on the
older bug.

well crazy is a deffinition of at  least a significant part of us

not unrealistic, most of us did this before the internet and learned that
way, and through lots of mistakes, some costly.

yes, BUT.  you will probably have to do it yourself, although the later
vans (not sure when it started) have mounts for two in the rear seats (one
on each side)

well I'm a little far, on the East coast, BUT you are near the (in)Famous

the list he might help yyou, but he is in business and he isn't likely to
do much for free.

having a spare car sure makes it easier, I lived where there was good
public transit so many a time I jumped on the bus with a part in hand
going to get the replacement.

well, I have fuel injection and since you have no bad Carb habits to break
it might not be as hard as you think

79 was an excellent year, and except for an odd exhaust port is pretty
standard.

rust can be a little devil,  if you see a little there could be a lot
hidden, especially important is to check the front beam for rust. it is an
expensive and time consuming repair.  (parts alone cost me over $600 on
mine)

> muffler). Should I not consider this bus because of the fuel injection?

your call, are you willing to learn the Fuel Injection system, it is
pretty straight forward but to repair it you must be very methodical and
follow the instructions exactly, not skipping any steps. but there is a
pretty good trouble shooting manual in the library if you can't find one
