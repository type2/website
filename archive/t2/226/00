I think you should either tighten it by hand or set your "good" torque wrench to 102 in lbs to be safe.

If you watch the BugMe video with Jake Raby taking apart a Type IV engine you can see the exact damage caused by over tightening the strainer bolt: a nasty crack where the strainer bolt mounts which is where the cam is supported.  It's a design flaw for sure.
