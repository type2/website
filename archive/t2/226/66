well   I bought my first bus (60 deluxe microbus) sight unseen about 6 AM
on a Sat morning...saw the ad and woke the owner up.

don't remember how I got my second bus (65 Westy)

the next one a 71 I bought New from the dealer...then I got married and my
wife did not like the bus so got her a 74 412 wagen (still a VW) but then
strayed from the fold (but stayed German with Audi and
Mercedes)unfortunately some years ago my wife lost a battle with cancer
and shortly there after I started "Looking" for a bus.  took over a year
even posting advertisments for "exactly what I wanted" 
   a guy called having seen one of my ads, he had just started stripping a
bus for parts but if I wanted to look at it, I did and bought it partially
disassembled, although the seller was willing to put it back together for
me.  a week later I picked up my current bus and now 9 years and over 100k
later I'm still happy with that decision.   

so what does that say?? you can get a good bus just about anywhere but the
basic rule (forget who said it) expect to spend $5000 for a good
bus. either up front or in parts and repairs.   I think that is a good
rule of thumb.

well mine is a daily driver, all mine have been, but I carry stuff all the
time so it isn't so much hauling kids (I have 6, all but one now grown) as
hauling "junque"

better might be to get a couple decent books on VWs' and a basic set of
tools.  not that the classes are no good but most are based on
"modern" water cooled vehicles and while the basics stay the same most of
the techniques are different.

always open to pizza, I'm just a bit South of you in Baltimore City. but
we have a pretty fair number of buses rattling around town here so I will
keep an eye open for you. there is a guy named Desmond that has a VW
repair shop but he frequently has some buses for sale 410-665-8787.
  he is a pretty decent carb engine mechanic and will not cheat you BUT
he is not cheap and he can drive a real hard bargain. YMMV
  (if it is automatic or Fuel injected he is not as competent and you
could get a bargain because he doesn't like working on em)

  good luck in your search
