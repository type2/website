You should not have to remove the dash.

1. I assume that these functions (All signals are defunct, as is the 
driver's side brakel ight and the horn, and defroster) were most likely 
working before the tach removal. We will try to find some common cause for 
failure and understand the wiring as we go through it.

2. On the wiring diagram  a block identified as S is the fuse box. The 
plastic cover may be long gone.

3. The fuses are numbered from left to right S1 through S12. Red are 16 amp 
white are 8 amp

4. Note in the ELECTRICAL SYSTEM  section Table a. Fuse Locations in Fuse 
Box.

5. Fuse S11  protects the turn signal wiring , the fuel gauge wiring , the 
back up light wiring, the automatic transmission kick down wiring, the 
generator warning wiring, and the oil pressure warning wiring.  (Plus any 
thing else the PO hung on it)

6. Look at Fuse S11 on the diagram.  The bottom side is the 12 volt side and 
is supplied by the ignition switch D.  Three wires come off of S11.

7. The green wire. It goes to E3 the emergency flasher control which in turn 
powers J2 the flasher and the turn signals.  The second wire (black) powers 
the warning lamps for the turn signals (both flash at the same time) , the 
oil and generator warning lamps.  The third wire (black) goes to the 
defroster control switch. If any of these functions are OK the fuse is OK.

8. Since every thing hooked to S11 is switched by the ignition key, none of 
these functions work with out the key being on.

9. The flasher  drives the turn signals AND the emergency blinkers. Same 
lamps different function.

10. The flasher J2 gets its power from the emergency flasher control E3 (+ 
white wire). The white wire is switched between E3 pin 15(green) (turn 
signal mode) and E3 pin 30 (red) (emergency blinker mode).

Any questions so far?
