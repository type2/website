There were springs in there, but no pistons for the pressure relief valves.
Both of them were disabled. If ever there was an argument for an oil
pressure guage, there it is. This thing must have had zero oil pressure,
right?

Best take another look, they can hide under the built up junk, feel around
with a long pick or scewdriver and feel for the step.
More likely scenario is they freeze in place by the crud and then higher oil
pressure.
