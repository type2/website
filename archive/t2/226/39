Subject: Re: [T2] sizes of bolts for 68-71 rear mount

Tell him to be careful on the depth, because there is a major oil pathway
near at least one of those. Look for the oil pressure relief valve just
below. I have a case that I wanted to tap and drill for that motor mount,
and I was told that it was inadviseable to do it. Actually, this is a
complete long block with low miles that I could really use about now. Does
anyone know if this can be done safely? I was told, "Don't do it".  Jan B
