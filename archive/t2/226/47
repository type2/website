Hello List,

I am new to this list.
I don=B4t own a buss yet, but I will in the new future.
The thing I am looking out for is a single cab pick up.
I am living in Belgium (Europe).
Does anyone of you have a id=E9e about what would be a reasonable price =
to pay for those.=20
And if I found one where do I start looking or what do I really need to =
check to see if it is in good condition.
Of course it doesn't have to bee showroom condition, but I don=B4t want =
to buy crap.
So if any one could give me some advise on those, I would really =
appreciate.

Thanks KEN
