Subject: gas leaking at fuel injector

Last night I removed one of my fuel injectors to
exchange it today. I thought that as long as the pump
was not operating, I would only get a residual drip
after I disconected the injector and it would stop.
This morning, I went to the bus and noticed that gas
was still dripping out. It had been doing this all
night. Is this normal?
