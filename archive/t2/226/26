Subject: re: aux. battery

i am traveling (in vermont) in a 74 westy i just screwed
up the wiring for the aux. battery -- anyway it fried (could have been a 
mess)

i replaced all the wiring but i cannot figure out which wire goes from the 
voltage regulator and the main battery to the "relay"???? or whatever that 
little box is where the wires set up before going to the aux. battery -- it 
is the little thing just to the left of the engine bay as you are looking in 
toward the engine

if i get those two wires set up then we are back in business and camping 
with glee!!

if someone can just check their bus and find out where those two wires go on 
the relay or whatever that thing is that would be wonderful
