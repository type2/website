Kelly,

the best piece of advice i can give you is to TAKE YOUR TIME
in finding the right bus. if you find one you really like,
take the extra day or two to think it over. there will always
be another (& probably better) bus for you to buy if you
really want one.

that being said, i agree with another listmembers post - rust
is your worst enemy. don't worry as much about the mechanical
side of things, b/c those types of things can always be fixed.
rust is going to end up costing you the most money in the
long run.

good luck on your search,

Joel Wilson
