Subject: Riviera conversion

Hey Everyone,
My friend has a bus, not sure of exact year (~74, I think), with a
sunroof and he wants to convert it to a riviera pop-top.  Does anyone
have a top for sale?

he's in Long Beach, CA

Please email me directly because I'm on the digest:  msoultan(-at-)csulb.edu

Thanks,
Mike
