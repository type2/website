I have to agree (father of 6) on the time issue.  if any of the above
conditions were different, no children, mechanical experience, spare
vehicle I would say different but even a small breakdown (is there such a
thing) with a small child crying can be a major stress event.

?? I am not sure tha Odyssey is that much better than a late model
(78-79) bus for the passengers.  front seat is more risky for frontal
impact though.  however the VW Bus is a pretty touch vehicle despite it's
apperance.

any vehicle can be reliable or unreliable depending on circumstances, BUT
all other things being equal, yes a newer vehicle is likely to be more
reliable than an older one but how it is maintained is also important.

another alternative would be to sell your new car, get a bus AND an older
Dodge minivan (lots of good cheap ones out there) and drive both as you
learn how to get the bus in order

of course if you MUST have a VW bus,  the new Eurovans are nice
