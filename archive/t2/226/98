The previous post on the bus time was from 60mph, not 70.  Huge difference, 
but I agree the 71 specs are not that much worse than other current 
minivans/SUVs.  If only all of the 71's on the road had brakes that were in 
good condition and ajusted properly!  I bet one in ten on the road can't 
stop from 60 in less than 170 ft.

I think one of the other values in that equation was incorrect because 7 
seconds is way too long for that stop to last.  Should be more like 2-3 
seconds.

Repeated panic stops?  I usually only have a single panic stop.  :)  The 
only repeated panic stops I make are on a road course where you have to 
accelerate and brake as hard as you can, continuously for 20 minutes at a 
time.  I switch brake shoes with some that are made for that kind of abuse, 
and go back to street pads when I leave.  The street pads are made to grip 
very well even on cold rotors, at the expense of resisting repeated hard 
stops.  Don't use your brake pads for something they were not designed to 
handle.

Driving in Naples is virtual suicide for one used to driving in the 
U.S..  Last time I was there, I took the train!
