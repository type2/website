Subject: Re: [T2] Buying

I don't know what the price should be becuase the market is different in 
Europe than in the USA and the American market is different on the West 
coast than the East coast.

Look for:

RUST 1st and foremost. Rust is tough to beat and for most beginners tough 
to repair. It is expensive to repair if you pay someone. Once it sets in it 
is hard to beat.

Collision damage. Almost as difficult to fix as rust. Many poor collision 
repairs out there. Some have cosmetic consequences and some ave safety 
consequences.

Permanent structural alterations. Don't buy somebody's hack job. What 
if:    Bubba thought cutting the roof off was a good idea one weekend when 
he had too much beer and buddies standing around. Then he discovered that 
the doors wouldn't close properly because the chassis was sagging. Then he 
tried to weld it back on but with shorter window posts to get that 
"lowered" chop top look. Unfortunately he caught the interior on fire and 
not the body is tweaked... Would you want this vehicle? Even if it looked 
good? I had a Mustang that had doors which would pop open due to a bent 
frame. Not a good thing...

Anything else is a bolt on repair that you can tackle. Blown engines, 
ragged seats, ruined transmissions, worn rubber weatherstripping can all be 
replaced by mere mortals like us.

Good luck!
