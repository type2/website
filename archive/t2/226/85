Subject: Last Dixie Bus Post

Well at least until the trip reports and pictures!  Thank you to those who
have endured and praised these necessary posts.

To those last minute partakers...

A few necessary requests..

1.  When entering the campground, please use 1st gear.  The owners get very
excited about faster than necessary traffic.

2.  If arriving later than 9 pm, drive through the camp to the blue
building, veer right around the building, and there is a drive off to the
right that will take you to our group area.

3.  We have reserved a conservative area, not knowing how many to expect.
If I am not available, please park in an organized manner.  whatever that
means.

4.  I have 40 pounds of ground turkey to pre cook, 8 pounds of veggies, and
about 42 pounds of chili beans and tomatoes...I may need a little help.

5.  Please bring your own table settings.  I have not properly planned to
have eating utensils supplied.

I am out of here.  C you all at Dixie Bus!
