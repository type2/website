Subject: wiring question


    hello everyone,

    I just had a quick wiring question re: my 79 westy. I just took all the
camping equipment out to remove some interior rust, and I noticed under the
main cupboard under the sink, a wire had been cut. It's a main wire that
runs from the fuse box, under the front carpets, through the drivers seat,
and out through the back and underneath the cupboard. The wire was just cut
and hanging there, so i'm not sure what purpose it serves. Is it the rear
back up lights? That's the only thing I can think of that isn't working in
my electrical system.

    many thanks,

    Sheldon 1979 VW Westfalia
