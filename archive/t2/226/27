Subject: Ohio 76 2-liter now starts and runs

This message is to report progress to the dozen people who helped me with 
this problem over the past two years.

Problem was: Overhauled engine in 76 Westy which would start, run for  8 
seconds, and stop. Over and over again.

Finally substituted a working spare air flow meter, and engine now starts 
and idles as designed.

Between start of problem and now, I tested for vacuum leaks,  replaced all 
the vacuum hoses, and replaced all the wiring and connections to the 
engine, battery, and nearby relays and devices, including grounds. This 
didn't hurt anything. Also replaced fuel pressure accumulator and double 
relay and all battery cables and grounds. But it was a bad AFM that was the 
big handicap.

It was a long time getting this engine back into service. Thanks for your 
patient advice.
