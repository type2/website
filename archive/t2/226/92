That could be the main power to the front (and thus the rear) of the bus I 
think. Sounds like they ran a  new one. Other option would be the faucet pump.

Not a bad thing. This allows you to inspect the old one and reconnect it 
and do things like run just the lights or stereo or a combo of those two 
and take the load off of the other wire thus making everything brighter and 
more reliable. Be sure to add fuses where necessary.

The back up lights are powered off of the coil. Wire runs from the coil to 
the switch on the tranny and then back to the backup lights. There should 
be an inline fuse laying on the left side of the engine. Typically 
everything gets corroded and nasty. Could also be a faulty switch. Mine and 
a friend's do not work. Both due to laziness I assure you...
