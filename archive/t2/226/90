Subject: STOP ! ! (please)

Lunch time reading:  Old magazine article says the 'new' 1971 VW bus, with 
the front disk brakes, can go from 60 MPH to full stop in just 167 feet.  
Rate of stop is 23 ft/sec, with a G rate about .72.

Now, 167 ft /  23 ft/sec is just over 7 seconds.

Just how loudly could I scream for 7 seconds of panic stop, all (hopefully) 
four wheel pealing rubber, and the object of my attention drawing closer to 
my front wheels with every second??

And this is a IMPROVEMENT over the 1970 ! ? ! ?
