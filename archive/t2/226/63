Subject: Re: [T2] Keeping a bus from being stolen

Here's a better idea...Wire the bus using EXTENSION CORDS!  Then use an
incomprehensible set of relays under the rear seat.  To start this bus, you
needed to push a button next to the speedo, then press the brake pedal, THEN
push a button on the other side to get it to crank.  I forgot how you shut
it off.........This was how my brother's 64 came from CA.  Now has a stock
harness..
