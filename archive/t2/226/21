Subject: to the hot wax goddess

My exhaust crossover pipe had a short stud from prior life experiences.  
It was well rusted in and not in a convenient place to put the plot in the
mill for machining.  I heated it with the sacred torch and applied the
special Amazonian-carnuba/killer-bee wax blend while chanting various
incantations to the wax goddess and casting some rose petals.  The next
day after cooling, further incantations and more rose petals, I applied
the mystical 4 oz ball pein for a little tap, tap, tap rhythm to loosen
whatever.  It felt good to me anyway.  A few more and different
incantations led to application of vice grips from the dark side. The stud
being too small for the 'goddess approved' stud remover in the tool box. A
little to the right and a little to the left, back and forth, back and
forth, and she eased right out. More rose petals and a big sigh of relief.

Much appreciation to whoever figured this trick out.
