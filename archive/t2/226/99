If i remember correctly 60mph is 88fps.  with the ability of a tire to 
grip and hold without sliding this is actually not a bad braking 
distance.  Now as was put to us in a high school physics class, add 
reality to the scenario with .5 second to recognize, .25 to decide on 
reaction .25 for reaction to take place.  You have traveled 88 feet and 
have just applied the brakes.  The scenario was used to get into labs 
for  accel decel and  friction.  We did the same lab in a college 
physics class with much more  detail.  added  temperature and true 
gripping (friction) surfaces into the equations.  Now to get scary. Take 
that braking distance rated on a standard bus and add the 600 to 1000 
pounds for a westy package to it with no change in the braking system.
