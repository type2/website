Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust loudness

One of the best ways to diagnose various kinds of car noise is to find,
somewhere, a long and lightly traveled wall, such as one might find
alongside a freeway alternate route, but as close to the wall as possible.
Sometimes a median strip with a little dividing wall will do. You may have
to go out late at night when not much other traffic is around, but you will
be surprised at the variety of sounds that you can identify coming from your
car.
The hard wall surface especially seems to reflect staccato and high-pitched
noises which would be useful in diagnosis. The lower end exhaust noises seem
to be suppressed or lost in the process.
I suppose that it also could be done, that a person could make up some sort
of a small lightweight noise reflecting panel that could be attached to the
front or rear wheel wells by means of clamps and the vehicle could be driven
along isolated roads at reasonable speeds so that the driver or a passenger
in the back of the vehicle could listen closely for details of noise coming
from these areas.
In general I find that VWs are not very comfortable from the standpoint of
noise, and I suppose that a lot of noise could be suppressed by means of
insulation. But I always liked to listen to the engine noises, the better to
know if something was wrong. I once was able to hear the difference when a
thin rocker arm assembly washer broke.
A funny note, but one evening we were driving, and I heard something that
caused me to pull over and park. I waited for traffic to clear and went to
the middle of the road where I found the source of what I had recognized as
the unmistakeable sound of a Snap-On wrench dropping on pavement. Guess
what? It was a Snap-On wrench! It went home with me, too! Yes, I listen when
I drive.
