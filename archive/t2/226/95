And modern cars from 70 mph are:

Acura MDX               205 ft          (all Acura's listed in this month's 
C&D list over 167 ft.)
Buick's Aztec cousin    190 ft.

Most of the BMW's are about 165-170 ft.

Chevy Avalanche 210 ft.
Chrysler Minivan        216 ft.
Ferrari 360             175 ft.
Ford Focus              180 ft.
Honda Civic Hybrid      191 ft.
My CR-V                 192 ft.

None of the Jags do better, close but not better.
All but 3 of the M-B take more than 167 ft.

Mini Cooper             169 ft.
GMC Sierra Denali       224 ft.


Our old VW's do pretty good I think....

The improvement is in the repeated panic stops where heat fades the brakes. 
I had a couple of Mutsangs and a couple Beetles and all had 4 wheel drum 
brakes. ALL were scary after decending a mountain or in Naples, Italy 
(Beetles only) after several 70-75 mph panic stops. Naples has alot of very 
fast drivers with several curvy long tunnels where traffic runs 70 mph+ and 
often suddenly stops during heavy traffic congestion.

Sucks not to be able to stop cause your brakes are hot...
