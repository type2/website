Subject: Re: [T2] gas leaking at fuel injector

I just tried blowing thru a fuel pump from the tank side: no flow.
I just tried blowing thru a fuel regulator from the tank side: no flow.

This tells me one of yours is bad. You will need to determine the direction
your drip is coming from....
Unfortunately, I find no specs for fuel pressure after stopping the pump. All
the specs are for pump/engine running. It would be nice to know how much and
how long the rail should be pressurized. That would help for locating
leaks.....

If you have a problem locating replacements, I have them.
