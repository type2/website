on all my buses (except my Westy) I have "boxed" in the area where the
rear seat was and then had an almost invisible "trunk" to put stuff in,
and keep tools etc organized. padlock and little paint and it looks almost
like it came with the bus.  requires removing the rear seat or moving it
most of the time though.  I've made mine out of a decent thickness (1/2
inch) outdoor oneside good plywood.  have run it all the way to the rear
too makes good sound insulation.  have an opening where the hatch is so I
can work on the engine but it works great IMO
