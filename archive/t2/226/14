Customer relations.

An air cooled VW repair shop is not a philanthropic enterprise. Men have 
families to feed. We must pay up or fix it ourselves.

A $3000 repair estimate for a Bus that we can't turn around and sell for 
$1800 can be quite fair from the mechanic's point of view.  His job is to 
make it run safely at a fair price for parts and labor or walk away. He is a 
mechanic not a financial or life style advisor.

On the other hand, any VW mechanic I trust with my Bus I can't afford.

Chuck
