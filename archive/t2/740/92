Hi Tim,

I said propane furnace, NOT propane neater. There's a huge difference.

A propane furnace burns the propane inside a combustion chamber and a  
heat exchanger transfers heat to the vehicle. The combustion  
byproducts (water vapour and CO2) exit the vehicle through a  
dedicated exhaust pipe. It's similar to the eberspacher except that  
it requires a dedicated propane tank and does not require a fuel  
pump. The cost of a good propane furnace is well upwards of $300US.

A propane heater costs about $40 and burns the propane directly  
within the bus and the water vapour and CO2 byproducts remain inside.  
This quickly contributes to fogged or frosted windows and may  
eventually lead to buildup of mold or mildew. Use within a tightly  
enclosed space can potentially deplete the oxygen content of the air  
inside vehicle and kill the occupants. Keeping a window cracked open  
will prevent this.

Karl Mullendore of MD imports Propex furnaces into the US, there are  
many other makes and models available; check with your local RV dealer.


Happy trails,
