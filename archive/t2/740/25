I think that's the key. A factory engine has no trouble trouble running at
speed but the crapola rebuilds w/ half-assed repair work and missing parts
can't perform long term under the same conditions.

The original beetle was designed, or so I've read, to run all day long at
100km/h on the autobahn of the 30s. Headline grabbing: yes. Practical? Maybe
not. History has shown that the engine required decades worth of
improvements to correct the original flaws.

Even the high priced high tech Porsche engines suffer similar head failures.

It's a design that history has passed on, that's all.

I like what Bentley has to say on the matter...

"Because of the extreme conditions under which exhaust valves operate, many
experienced mechanics routinely replace any exhaust valves that have been in
service for 25k miles".

Amusing, eh?
