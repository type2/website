Ron's right...this Westfalia is pretty expensive. We looked at one  
last year, and while I have to say I really, really liked it for the  
size and accommodations, it was pricey.

It had a lot of plusses for us, including the fact that it is not an  
enormous beast. But as a daily driver, it would be a bit much. Our VW  
is much more practical.

If someone gave me one, I'd say thanks, but I can't image spending  
that much money on a camper...
