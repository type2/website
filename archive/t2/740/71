Just a note to say I think the advice you received from Ross and Tuleja is 
quite reasonable.  Having the flywheel re-surfaced as part of a clutch 
replacement may be wise.  Buses (no surprise) make more demands on the clutch 
system than Bugs make.  And of course you'll have taken the flywheel off anyway.

I don't know where you are located, but assuming northern hemisphere, the 
weather is now favorable for working outdoors.  As to budget constraints, 
possibly you could think of ways to raise funds by performing services for 
others.... 50 here, 75 there, in pounds, euros, whatever... for a thorough 
cleanup/detailing or similar labor-intensive job, could be the way to finance 
your Type II parts and service purchases.

I knew a guy named Carl Meltzer, physics research faculty member at Carnegie 
Mellon, 'way back in the sixties when it was known as Carnegie Tech.  IIRC he 
was a VW owner, if not enthusiast. He had a son who would be ~40 yrs old 
now..... any relation?

I'm planning to dismantle my '72 panel van's Type 1, 1600cc engine
to fix its oil leaks.  A set of gaskets, a set of pushrod tubes,
and an oil seal for the crankshaft where it meets the belt pulley
are already purchased.

I keep getting different opinions as to what else needs replacing
as a matter of course.....
