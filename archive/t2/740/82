this is a classic fuel pump not running problem,  the double relay allows
the pump to run when starting but as soon as the key is released (when the
engine starts) the other side of the double relay should keep the pump
running..  check the AFM connection and push the air flap to see if the
pump runs. check the double relay.

good luck
