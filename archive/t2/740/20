I had a '66 Westfalia a number of years ago that had the governor on it and it always kicked in at 68mph, which IRC was the top recommended speed. When it kicked in it woudl not release so to speak untl I got down to about 65mph, so my effective cruising speed was 65mph. Interesting decive, especially when you wanted to pass a semi on a low grade...

if you look at the owners manual for your VW, yes max speed=cruising speed. 
This is max speed they recommend the VW be driven at, NOT the max speed you 
can push it to go. Does not mean they designed it to be floored w/o ill 
effect.
In fact, governors were added at some point to keep the rpms from going 
above what VW considered max.
