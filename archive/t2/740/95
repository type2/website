I thought it was a pain too at first. But after using it on our annual 
cross country trek last year, through some mighty wet nights in the 
Tetons, I found it to be a great asset for spreading out wet things to 
dry and expanding our living space during the storm. We mainly use it 
when we're staked out at campsite for more than 1 night.

After setting it up a number of times last summer I have gotten pretty 
quick at it.

We'll see after another summer with it whether I still like it , but for 
now it's OK
