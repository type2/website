Subject: speed in a VW bus

I was 16 in 1974 and I had a '73 VW bus. I loved that
bus and drove the h&*^l out of it. My high school
compatriots loved it too.  During junior college, I
drove it 60 miles a day round trip at 70 miles per
hour.  I was reared on a farm and hauled over a ton of
cow feed in it several times.  I once hauled a cow
trailer with a 1500 pound cow in it who decided to
walk to the front of the trailer during the trip (100
lb tongue weight on the hitch identical to Jamie
Rivers') with no apparent damage whatsoever to the bus
or the hitch.  I eventually wrecked it in 78 and got a
74 bus which I kept until 83.  

All that being said, my 73 bus broke 2 valves during
its life with me (approximately 4 years). I wish I
would have known then what I know know now about the
relative delicacy of those engines given the weight of
the vehicle in which they're placed.  Today, I drive
my 74 SC with a 1700 CB engine no faster than 65 ever.
 I'm still getting to know my recently
restored/rebuilt 79 Automatic Westy but will never go
over 65-70 mph in it.

The point of all this is to say that these vehicles
are getting some age on them, they were relatively
underpowered to begin with, and they deserve to be
driven and used, but with careful consideration for
the matching up of body weight, engine capability and
aerodynamics.  Just my opinion.  Greg
