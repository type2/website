Subject: My '72 Weekender

Greetings,
     I am in the process of bringing Daisy, my '72 weekender, back to life.
She was parked about 3+ years ago.  Actually, I drove her home, and into my
garage, planning to change the muffler.  In the removal of the old
muffler/header, I discovered there were only 3 exhaust studs actually holding
anything, the rest were loose in the head, or missing.  So in the shop she
sits, and has been there for the last 3+ years.
     So, here is what I have done up to now.  The engine is out.  I removed
the drive axles, and have cleaned the CV joints, and will reboot the today.  I
noticed there seems to be what might be a leak around where the CV's connect
to the transmission.  How involved is replacing the seals here?  I have the
transmission out, and I am also going to re-bush the shift rod (I already have
the bushing kit.)
     Getting back to the engine.  I can't decide if I am going to use
time-serts, or step studs (there is a 8mx10mmx56mm stud available.)  I am
considering getting a valve job since I don't really know how many miles are
on those heads.  If I get the heads reworked, should I go ahead an replace the
pistons and cylinders?  The engine was running fine when parked, so I don't
think there is anything wrong with the bottom end.  What do you folks suggest
I do?  I want to have a reliable engine to push her to any camp-out we decide
to go to, but I don't plan to use her as a daily driver (but I want her to be
able to take me almost anywhere, at anytime.)  I plan to clean and paint the
engine tin, and make sure I have all the tin parts in place (I have a few sets
of type 4 tin to choose from.  Anyway, what do you folks think and suggest.

Thanks,
Stuart
