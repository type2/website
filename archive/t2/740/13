If you can't floor your motor  for extended periods without running hot,
something in the combo is not  right (or not as good as it was from the
factory).

if you look at the owners manual for your VW, yes max speed=cruising  speed.  
This is max speed they recommend the VW be driven at, NOT the max  speed you 
can push it to go.  Does not mean they designed it to be floored  w/o ill 
effect.
  In fact, governors were added at some point to keep the rpms from  going 
above what VW considered max.  
 
VWs do run hotter when driven faster than 'max speed'
