Subject: Westy tent?

Ya know, I was all excited when I got my Westy tent. But it wasn't
until last night when I sat down and contemplated building it. And
then I actually set it up today.

What a pain!

So I'm selling it.

Does anybody here really like their tents? Responses on The Samba
appear to be about 50/50.
