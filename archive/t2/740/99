Good points all around Greg. The only time I ever bought a new vehicle
off the dealer lot was an 85 Vanagon. Great vehicle, but $300 per
month for 5 years while raising small children was a major financial
burden. A few hundred dollars twice a year tinkering with the bus is a
major financial relief!

 swap the 78 interior for a 1974-75 interior with the full-width rear
 bed or do some modifications.

 payments on a new car. $400/month spent on a bus will quickly bring
 it up to excellent running order, and in the second year it will be
 time for proper bodywork and paint. Think of all the upgrades that
 $400 could bring -- Heated seats, propane furnace, killer tunes,
 sweet alloy rims and proper tires, etc, etc. The third year you can
 save up for the RABY/Boston Bob engine upgrade, and so on and so forth.
