Sell your home. This Westy is expensive.

I'm not a fan of the big top and thus my preference towards the Eurovan 
Weekender with it's pop-top.

The one I looked at was $82K...

No thanks... I'll take a $25K used Eurovan with 30-50K miles...

How about a Marco Polo Vito? Again more my type. N/A in NA... Couldn't 
afford it if it was...

Makes keeping the old '78 forever VERY appealing and the $2K 5 speed 
Corvair tranny very affordable.

'78 Westy 2,7L
