I have KYB's GA's all the way around my '71 right now and the ride is a bit 
stiff.  I am considering going to the Alco shocks up front from the Bus Depot 
and see if that is better.  I really am very disappointed I missed the big Koni 
buy, I would have just LOVED to have a set of those on my bus.  I guess I 
will just have to keep on checking the swaps, maybe I will get lucky.
