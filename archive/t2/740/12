Subject: Re: [T2] Good AFM pic-inertia switch vs fuel pump contact?

The intertia switch comment- the writer feels the fuel pump contact is 
unreliable and suggests bypassing it so the pump is on with the ignition
and all is interrupted when the vehicle is suddenly stopped.  Many 
modern cars have this, but aren't there times one has the ignition on 
without running?  Anyone install an intertia switch, as it may be a good 
feature to remove all battery power (and sparks) in case of an accident?
