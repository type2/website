Westy wasn't the only company to convert VW's. 
Sportsmobile did also and is still selling mucho
poptops, mostly adorning Ford vans:

And they are just tooling up for Sprinter:

I'm not impressed by their entry into the class C
market.  I think it's a first for them.  They
stated they wouldn't be offering a poptop on a
Sprinter until after the expected redesign in
2006.  

Price will still be VERY high.  


Happy bussin'
