Subject: Baywindow Bus Sighting: Riding the Bullet

Although "The Bullet" is a roller-coaster, not the bus, Stephen King
get's up close and personal with a bay window bus in this latest made
for TV thriller.  At the beginning of the hitchhiker's journey the
main character catches a ride with a hippy wanna-be in a bay window
bus.  Consider turning down the volume while the pot, woodstock and
other references are piled on thick, for the bus ends up in the wrong
lane (I think that's the theme for this movie) and the audience is
treated to a wonderful 360 degree view as it spins at least twice into
the ditch.  At this point the rear hatch and side doors are flung open
(driver is bleeding and has spiderwebbed the front window but still
conversable) and we get a nice view of from the back.  With all this
great footage, like so many Samba ads, there is no shot of the engine
compartment.
