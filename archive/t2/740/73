Thanks guys for your advice.

The Bus is my cheapest and funest way to camp. I will consider keeping 
it and maintaining it.

One thing is for sure, it has to be driven before camping.

Anyone using a bike rack on the back?

I would love to hear about your experiences, especially as to how much 
it pulls the back end down.
