Another thing about Sportsmobile, they'll build
whatever you want.  I was playing around with the
idea of getting one spec'ed like an EV weekender,
with four captains, a rear zbed, and a poptop. 
Don't think I could do the Ford thing, even
though it probably would get nearly the mpg of a
VW.  (The VR6 EV's were only rated for 15/19MPG.)
 A Sprinter chassis may seal the deal for me.  





Happy bussin'
