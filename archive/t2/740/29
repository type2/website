If you've ever seen the original "The Italian Job", the bad guys
(the Italian mobsters) push a few of the good guys' (the Eng-
lish mobsters) cars over a cliff...But even action film makers
have limits...The silver Aston Martin is pushed to the edge
(here's the part where a good VCR/DVD player comes in),
but it's a silver Lancia that takes the dive... ;-(
