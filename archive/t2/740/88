OK, I'm ready for someone out there to give me hints
on the fabled "propane heater". Are these anything
like the Ebersprachers (in other words, are they built
in or just freestanding)? Are they auto-specific or
the same as what, say, a contractor might use on a
jobsite for heat? And finally, where do you get one? Thanks!
