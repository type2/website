Subject: 1978 CDN worth

Can anyone tell me what a 1978 CDN would be worth in good condition. I 
have kept up with the rust by grinding and tremclad. It could really use 
a good putty job and a paint job.

Mechanically, I take care of it like  a maniac.

So, how much?

I have to start thinking of my growing family.
