We are on Metlife. $110 per year per car for my wife and myself for
minimum legally required insurance only.

We heard motorhome and classic insurance was cheaper, but we have
found no insurers for less. I think we found a classic company that
had reasonable limits on driving, but wouldn't take us because we
don't garage our cars.
