Subject: Microbus DC?

Did you guys see this?

I think I like it....but, for the price of even a used mid-90s  
Vanagon, I would take an older DC and restore it and maybe beef up  
the motor or something.

I don't know about you Volks, but I really like the idea of NOT  
having car payments.

Exhibit A: We just spent the equivalent of 3 car payments on a new  
motor for Konrad the Tiki Bus.
Exhibit B: Konrad only cost the equivalent of 3 car payments.
Exhibit C: Konrad is PAID FOR after only 6 car payments.

Unless I hit the lottery or someone dies and leaves me a new vehicle,  
I think we'll be driving paid-for cars.
