Don, there is supposed to be a "bell" shaped fitting
attached to the front cover plate on the engine.  The
flexible tube would rest inside the bell.  They are
often missing.  The usual fix is to get another front
cover plate on the engine or fashion some other type
of "bell" fitting in which the rear end of the flex
tube can rest.  Greg
