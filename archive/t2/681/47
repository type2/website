Subject: Not Quite Idling

77 2.0L FI

Drove home from Buses By the Bridge today...good times!
Im having a bit of an issue.
The bus isnt idling well. It not starting on the first try either - if at
all.
When I can get it started, it will die right away if I dont step on the gas.
If I get it started and hit the gas pedal, it will run, but if I let off it
dies.

My first inclination is vacuum leak. What are your thoughts?
Thanks
Eric
