LoL! 

Where did this come from? 

I love that things like bumpers don't cost $1500. Or rebuilt engines
$3500 (unless you really WANT to spend that).

I also love that busses are relatively rare. I spent a week in Denver
recently and saw a total of 5 busses, only 2 of them on the road. One
was painted up to use for a Mexican restaurant, and the other 2 were
in various states of disrepair in someone's driveway.
