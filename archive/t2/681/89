Love could be the appropriate word.  I know from the experience that having
a pre-owned tuna can is not a stress free relationship.  Nor is it cheap for
that matter.  But, those times involved with our bus (whether good or bad)
always seem to be more memorable and leave a longer lasting, heartfelt
impression on our family than those involved with our Saturn VUE.
