Money can't be much of a factor because I think these vehicles are inexpensive to own and provide decent reliability. IMHO if you can't afford a VW you can't afford a car. I can't really think of a less expensive vehicle to operate (beetle not withstanding) other than a motorcycle.

Time in a another matter. Working on my friend's 72 bus has made me rethink how easy these vehicles are. When major problems crop up they can really throw you as you hunt down hard to find parts and labor over PO abuses. I've tried using exaggeration to speed along repairs but it only seems to work for posting messages.

This list is invaluable for helping people keep these vehicles running, myself included. My bus was a dead corpse 3 years ago and the state it's in today is a direct reflection of help I've received from the list.
