If the penetrant suggested by others does not work there is a more radical
solution which is used on Triumph TR7 engines, which have an odd cylinder
head design which leads to stuck heads.

What you do is get one piston at BDC, then feed some soft rope into the
sparkplug hole, as much as you can get in there. Carefully turn the engine
over so the piston pushes the rope up and it should move the head with it.
The rockers should be removed first so the valves stay closed.

As long as you go about this carefully, no damage will occur. Some of the
TR7 guys have had much success with this odd technique.
