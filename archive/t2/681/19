Subject: Re: [T2] Scale for balancing?

Sorting through all the advice on this, it seems that (given the price 
of a scale with the necessary accuracy) this is a job better left to a 
competent engine rebuilder, if you are only building one engine. I'm 
trying to wean myself away from insisting on doing everything myself.
