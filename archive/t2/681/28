Subject: [T2] Scale for balancing?

Cortney. What a wonderfull site for info on VW stuff. If it wasn't for the 
post on balanceing to a dime I wouldn't have got a chance to add this info 
site in my VW BUSS file. Thanks to all the posters and to type2.com for all 
the great information. Cree 79 Bay
