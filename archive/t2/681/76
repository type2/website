Most cannister systems I have seen have the hose connected to the
shroud on the left side as seen in your picture. I have never seen a
nipple on the inspection hole cover.

 On my friend's 72 bus I noticed this hole in the shroud:

 Normally I would suspect it was for the charcoal canister so the fan could
 blow air through it on the earlier models but this engine has the opening on
 the top (the converted inspection hole for 411s/914s/etc):

 Was there a plug on the side of the shroud originally?
