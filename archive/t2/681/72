[g] that card is available, but i just went about it another way. you were
in my thoughts. but the dewd is a hater, i could see him reloading and he
needed equilibrium. i put a wide piece of vw tape on the situation. and we
left it as "haven't seen one of these in years". its not the first time this
happened either. few years ago i went to a welder to have a gusset put on my
68 DC passenger door. they crack around the mirror and i had to have
something done on the inside to sure it up. welder says that's the ugliest
car i've ever seen. i got defensive. i said i just found this in the trash,
as trash, loaded with wet sopping trash inside and out a few months ago,
give it time. didn't matter, hippie truck. its a eugene theme coming from
the invaded species directed toward the invading species.
