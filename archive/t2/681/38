Subject: Re: [T2] Hose clamps?

I have them. Jim Thompson sold me all the miscellaneous parts for my 
FI, including those short lengths of hose, and recommended using 
clamps.

I've notice that Richard Attwell, among others, does not use them. I 
suspect that they become necessary once you've pulled your runners on 
and off a few times.
