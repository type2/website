Subject: charging/no turnover diagnosis ?

My 79 Bay will do this once and a while. All I have to do is to use a 
battery charger with the boost to start switch on or a separate battery 
hooked to my battery with jumper cables. Notice I said seperate battery not 
one hooker up to another car. I think that when my battery is not putting 
out a full cvharge it will not activate the selonid. Adding the juice from a 
separate battery or charger works everytime for me. Keeping a full charge on 
my battery I never have a problem. I have a separate ampilifer that was 
always drawing a small current from my battery. The lights worked perfect 
but it would not start. Now I have wired the amp to only turn on when I turn 
the key to start. It seems when my battery drops to a certain level it will 
not activate the brain or selonid.  Cree
