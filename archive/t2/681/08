Subject: [T2] Scale for balancing?

A good balancing shop does the job to .1 gram.

I've found that Cofap, Mahle and OEM VW pistons are most always within 1
gram.
With a little swapping around of wristpins and selecting the right rod to
make a set with the piston I can always come to a ZERO gram set of rods and
pistons.
Weighing the assembly several times and having the same weight reading is
important.
