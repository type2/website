Tom,

I don't have one, but rest assured that your bus is safe to drive without
the plug or TDC sender (only present on '73/?4? buses).  The hole is not
allowing "air pressure to go places it shouldn't" as there is no air
pressure there that has anything to do with engine cooling.  The
flywheel/clutch/bellhousing cavity has no effect on engine cooling
whatsoever. For cosmetic/dust control reasons, it's nice to have the cover
but it is open as often as not and has no effect on drivablity.

OOK!
