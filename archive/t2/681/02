 Something I've wondered about the propane conversions is why mount the tank
inside the cab?

Since you'd only use gas to start, then switch over to propane I'd assume
you could ramove the stock tank and install a small two or three gallon one,
then you could mount the propane tank next to it.

[(gas)( p  r  o  p  a  n  e  )]

An alternative would be to mount an outside tank under the frame by my 10
gallon propane tank for the camping stove.

I just would'nt want a propane tank inside the cockpit anymore than I would
a gasoline tank.  The small gas tanks are readily available from sources
like Moon Eyes, and would fit just fine.
