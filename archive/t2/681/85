curious has anyone ever purchased the (flywheel) crankshaft seal 029105245b  ????????????
 
i am in a pickle and that is the only place locally i can get it right now within next couple of days...?
wanted to see what the other bussers thought before purchasing and installing engine.
do not want to have to pull engine again if the seal isnt worth nothing...?
the engine is already out btw but needing a flywheel seal to go back in...
its my daily driver and 
 
it is a bent and berkley or something not a Viton.seal like at bus depot...
........
 
peace and love
