Sorta...At 102 octane, propane powered engines can be boosted to 
muscle car compression ratios without detonation...Properly geared,
a propane engine can return about the same mpg/miles per fill up 
as gas engines...Another return is the cleaner exhaust and cleaner
engine at tear-dowm...John Sheally races a propane powered Plus 8
Morgan and beats gassers consistently...
The down side here in the USA is planning your trips around fill-ups...
Most RV stops can do it, but the corner gas station can't... ;-(
