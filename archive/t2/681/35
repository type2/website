No offense was taken or intended, and if my post came across that way I 
apologize.  When I wrote the message I had two dogs trying to climb into my lap / 
onto the keyboard, my wife telling me to get off the computer, and a frustrating day 
of being unable to do anything because of the half-inch of ice coating my road (and
my front/rear porch, and my windshield, and ...)
