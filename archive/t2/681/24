Subject: Re: [T2] Scale for balancing?

And you did a great job too Hal, I balanced my rods end to end using Mike
West's method which consisted of an engineers ruler (one of the prism shaped
ones), and a small scale from school. He also explained how to find the
longest rod using a piston pin and the same straight edge with feeler gauges
 He was a genius. He has left us now, and gone on to that next big adventure
in the afterlife. I also used my wife's scale at work which measures 1/10
grams to see what my flywheel weighed after I'd turned it down on a school
lathe. Lots of people use simple methods which work well. I congratulate you
on your abilities to think of simple ways to get the job done! 

 

Mike West's brilliant down home ways to get the job done are posted at our
very own beloved website

Although he was primarily a Type 1 guy, there is very little differences
between the engines, and his methods would work equally well on a Type4
engine.

Courtney

IIRC, a quarter weighs five grams (been a long time since I read Muir).
Factory spec for

balancing pistons is "within 10 grams". Since a dime weighs less than a
quarter and

since I wasn't building a race motor, getting them to weigh "the same"
within the

margin of error involved with the average weight of a dime was close enough.
I built

that engine with 95% used parts (new rings, exhaust valves & valve springs)
and got

60k miles out of it before an oil pump failure killed it .. far more than I
was expecting.

 

I was relating my experience to others on the list with the idea that
someone might

appreciate the creative solution I came up with given the tools, equipment
and finances

available at the time, nothing more.
