Subject: How rare are doublecabs?

Later this year, I'd like to have a double cab, one of the later ones 
so that I could install or revive the a/c in it and use it for a daily 
driver even on 100 degree days. Seems like they're pretty rare, and 
priced accordingly. Single cabs seem to be a little more plentiful, 
relatively speaking, and would probably be easier to air condition, 
too. But I do like the look of the double cab. So how rare are they? I 
haven't seen any on the samba; what do they go for in fair condition?
