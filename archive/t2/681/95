Subject: Twisted frame??

Volks,
I had a flat today. It was a construction nail. Itook the flat to Big O 
Tire - where I have warranties - for service. This they did fine. But, 
now I've a problem. As they raised the 77 VW High Roof, the left set of 
floor hoist arms lifted and slipped. They caused my van to shift 
horizontally to the right and bounce before they right arms balanced the 
van. Now, the rear cargo door over the engine won't shut without 
pressing on the left bottom part of the door. And, the engine door is 
also twisted out of true. Both doors are now angled out of true. I'm 
concerned that my frame may be twisted. I'm going to a frame and body 
shop tomorrow for this. But, I wanted your thoughts. I got it documented 
as an incident at the shop, and they were very nice about it.

The manager was in a bit of denial about the frame being damaged, but 
your thoughts are welcomed!
T.
