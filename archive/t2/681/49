Hello Steve    While this is mostly true Vw did improve the later type 1 
cases using a harder alloy so that the bearings saddles were stronger ./ If you 
ever talk to Boston Bob Mcdonald(Bosto Engines) He is always looking for late FI 
bug cases for building motors in Zambowias (SP)  the things that smooth ice 
rinks , which are very hard on motors. Some of these use the VW diesel motor . 
Balancing the rotating parts on a motor will only help it last longer . only 
cost about $75.00 down here   .   later and have fun Mark Dearing   PS  Bring 
what it is that you need an architect for with you and I can help you out  .
