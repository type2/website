Subject: once upon a pre-owned tuna can

not directed at jason, but he can answer: this morning on the conscience of
every type2 listee is the question why would anybody go from air cooled to a
mitsubiache. i thought i've heard of all the good reasons, and all i can
come up with on my own is this car company's sex-driven super bowl
commercials that run inbetween light/lite beer commercials all year long.
heavens to betsy them new model vacuum cleaners never go slow through
tunnels [wink, nod] and unripe 16 rpm hip-hop lyrics placed over a dancing
seat belted double tank top can be you.

the other day i saw a photo of a naked man having very strong wishful
feelings for the front corner of his split singlecab. cannot we learn from
this image? or, does that say too much mitsubiache.

other important bus content: i went to pick up a piece of drywall in my
doublecab and the feller welcomes me by saying he wouldn't be caught dead
driving around in [my] truck. can you imagine the nerve - to think he could
drive around dead. AND, never having been to one show. duck hunter...
