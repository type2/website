No doubt you'll get there .. I was aiming for a "friendly encouragement/
friendly ribbing" tone, but I guess I missed :-)  My bus started out last year with 
a blown motor, no heat (missing parts), shot poptop canvas, worn-out tires and 
a Westy interior that'd been gutted of everything but the Z-bed by a P.O.  When 
we moved into our house in Feb, the Bus made the trip up here on a towdolly 
behind a Uhaul with the (old) engine in just inside the slider.  

If you'd like some in-person moral support and congeniality with fellow Bus 
owners locally, a group of Samba-istas usually gather at the Hawthorne
Lucky Lab on Monday nites .. except this week.  C'mon down sometime 
if you feel up to it.
