pick up the phone, call Ron at Bus Depot, have him "Express" ship
overnight a rebuilt head.  spend today getting the engine ready for the
new head, get it tommorrow and start putting it in, use Thur to tune and
make sure everything is ready to go, take a hot shower, get a good night
sleep and enjoy your trip.
