Subject: Westy Tops

Hey everyone...I was at the Bug Jam in PA a few weeks ago and noticed that 2
of the (few) westy's there had"new" looking tops.  It looked like a
slick-finished top that looks a lot nicer than the age that my top is showing.
did someone do a good cleaning job on these or can you buy them new?  I looked
around a little and couldn't find anything on them.
