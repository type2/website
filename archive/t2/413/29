Subject: '71 intermittent problem

My '71 intermittently sputters and dies (as if it were running out of gas) 
while freeway driving. After a 5 or 10 minute roadside rest, I'm back on the 
road as if nothing happened. This will reoccur a day or week later. New 
points, plugs, condenser, coil and a cleaned float valve have not solved 
this problem.
