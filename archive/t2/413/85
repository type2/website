Jamie's lowered westy features a "shaved" propane tank :-) 
I have some more photchops I have done posted at Vintagebus.com if anyone is
interested.

Where did the propane tank go?  I guess this model is only for camping in
WalMart parking lots :)
Looks like maybe this setup would be a good candidate for height adjustable
airbags?
