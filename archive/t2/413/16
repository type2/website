Subject: Manifold Vacuum Source

Greetings Great & Knowledgable List,

I recently replaced the single vacuum advance distributor that had been on
my '72 Bus with the correct dual advance unit for my engine ('73 CD code).
Now that I have the dizzy in and the vacuum advance hooked up to my Weber's,
I realize that I have no immediately obvious souce for the manifold (retard)
vacuum.

I do have the large vacuum hoses coming off the base of the manifolds (one
appears to be a balancing hose running between the left & right side) and
one that I assume is the vacuum source for my brake booster.

What is my best option for tapping into the manifold vacuum source for the
small vacuum tube that goes to the retard side of my distributor?  Should I
tee into one of the lines and then progessively step the hose size down to
the 4.5mm line that feeds the dizzy, or is there an easier and more direct
way?
