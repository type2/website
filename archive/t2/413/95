Subject: Front License Plate

I got a ticket the other day for not having a front license plate on my bus. 
I hadn't ever really noticed it was missing. What type of plate holder 
"officially" went on a 1979 Westfali?a. 

Also, what parts of the wing window does one have to replace when the little 
black knob falls off?
