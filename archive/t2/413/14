I fear this may start another wire gage discussion

If you talk to the "battery experts" they will tell you it's not a good
idea
to charge your camping battery with the engine.  The reason being after
a
night of camping, your battery will be pretty well drained and the
voltage
regulator will kick the alternator into high gear giving the battery a
high
charge which can boil the battery pretty quick.
