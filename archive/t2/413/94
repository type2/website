Subject: Re: Westfalia FS in NYC

I drove this White Westy from Houston to NYC, then cross-country to CA and
back.  Problems on the trip were limited to a temp. sensor in PA and a CV
Joint at Donner's Pass.  Shortly after returning to NYC the clutch
throwout-arm snapped in a McDonald's parking lot.  I was on the phone to AAA
when two ladies started checking out the van.  They were shopping for one, I
told them about the broken clutch, they were still interested.  They pushed
it across the street to a tranny shop, drove me home and got the title.

AT THAT TIME (two years ago), there was zero body rust.  The body was super
straight and the white paint looked good.  New curtains and upholstery,
except the front seats.  She (the new owner) has told me that she had NY
shops do all of the work, some of which was repeated.  I think the clutch
was done twice.  She had a new tranny put in.  I can't remember if she said
the brakes were also done.  I think so.  You should really contact her
directly for more up to date info.  But I will attest to the fact that she
is an honest, conscientious person who has really put loads of money into
this van.  She will fully and straightforwardly divulge the vehicle's
condition to interested parties.  At $1700, I think she's obviously not
trying to hide anything.

A year after I sold her that one, I was in Wisconsin and put together a 90
Carat with Westy parts and Subaru engine, which I now drive.  If I didn't
have that, I would probably be hustling to get the 84 back.

Let me know who ends up with it!
