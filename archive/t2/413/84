Bus Content: We're doing a limited first run on sliding door inner handles.
The "stock" color for our handles is tan, but we can do a variety of colors,
too.  A local club member wants a purple one. :O)

The last one that I got was addressed as if it came from a listee, but it
addressed to "undisclosed-recipients" rather than to quattro(-at-)audifans.com.

I'm running Nortons AV, which nailed the message, disinfected it, and
indicated that the attached file, "KPG EXHAUST-1864CFM.doc.pif" was infected
with the "W32.Bugbear.B(-at-)mm" virus.

This is the second time in 30 days that this virus has used listee addresses
to set up false "From:" addresses in infected emails.  It's probably not the
fault of whoever's address is picked by the virus and used to ID the
"sender" of infected messages.
