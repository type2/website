Don't hold me to this but I was reading a research
report that tested different brands of oil filters.
Some filters, such as Fram, are so cheeply made that
they can cause engine noise. I bought Mahle oil
filters from the bus depot. They are suppose to be
good but I have not taken a road test yet. I wish I
could find the link to that study. They say that
Puralator (sp) filters are very good. I do agree that
what you are hearing is pretty normal though. Good
luck and take care!
