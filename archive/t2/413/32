Subject: Re: [T2] exhaust tip sizes

It might be the incorrect tip.

I bought a complete exhaust system for my '82 Vanagon from you-know-who
and ended up spending lots more $$$ because they or their supplier sent me
the wrong catalytic converter and I was too naive/inexperience to notice and
too stupid to return the item.

The incorrect cat converter had a 2 inch pipe.
