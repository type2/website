Subject: 75 FI troubleshooting

Hi Volks,

I'm undoing a mess the PO left behind on my 1977 Auto Sunroof when he 
converted it to a single weber, replacing its messed-up engine with a 
2L VW of Canada reman pre-configured with '75 FI.

The starter occasionally refuses to engage, but if I wait a few minutes 
it will be fine. The starter wiring from the key is intermittent at 
best so I have a jumper wire from the battery that I use to start the 
bus. Once I have the engine running I will resolve this.

I have replaced the weber's low-pressure electric fuel pump with a 
stock FI pump from a 75 westy. The pump gets voltage temporarily when 
the starter is engaged but as soon as the starter is disengaged the 
test light goes out. Wiring the pump direct to the coil gets me a nice 
flow of gas at the cold-start valve connection, so I know the pump is 
good. All the fuel lines are brand new. I checked injector #4 and it is 
delivering a nice spray pattern. The double-relay tests OK according to 
Bentley.

I have replaced the coil, plug wires and cap with new parts. 
Compression is 110/120/120/120. The points were cleaned up and 
re-installed, the dwell is about 46 degrees. A bit low, but I would 
expect it should still start. Except it doesn't.

All of the vacuum lines and connections are accounted for as per 
Richard Atwell's wonderful diagrams.

Questions:
There is a white wire coming off the harness just under the air box, 
it's about 3' long and reaches across the motor to the coil. The PO of 
this engine had it on the negative side... Is this correct?

I'm open to ideas, as I really want to hear this thing run.

Otherwise I'm liable to do something stupid and put that weber 
progressive back on it.

Happy trails,
