Subject: Part Id

I have a cream coloured electrical part ( wiring box of some sort) that I
cant id- It is above the rear lid pass side - It has a number of wires going
in all directions - looks like to tail lights and into the main harness -
the main wire to the poss side of the battery is terribly frayed - I am not
sure what this part is - can anyone help
I also noticed after a couple hard starts that the battery grounding strap
has turned grey - looks burnt and gets extremely hot - any thoughts

Thanks
Eric
