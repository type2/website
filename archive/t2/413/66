Subject: Free Front Pop-top Section 78' and lock question

I found a non-warped pop top for my 78' and replaced it last weekend. The
PO had been stuffing rags and towels in the sides to try and stop air leaks
and it warped the top so badly that a new seal would not close it up. So
when I got the new top it was a lot cleaner than my old one and I decided
to replace the front section as well. This is the luggage rack part from a
late model bay pop top. I have the old one and anyone who wants to pick it
up in Arlingotn VA is welcome to it. It has minor cracks and needs to be
sanded and repainted but is really not it bad shape. I will not ship this
thing.

Now for the question. While I was at my favorite boneyard on the eastern
shore I picked up a lock tumbler for my sliding door. I called a local
locksmith and he says he can re-key it for 35-40 bucks. He has not seen
this part yet and I wonder if he really can do this job. Anyone have
experience having locks rekeyed and if so whatdid you pay? I want my one
ket to fit all of my doors. The slider was missing its lock tumber when I
got the bus.
