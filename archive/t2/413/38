Subject: Power Converter Documentation

Hey there Volks,

I've scanned the copy of the factory manual for the power converter thats found
under the zbed of late model baywindow westies. Someone emailed me via my
webpage asking about it, so I figured that I'd share it w/ the list.

and

It's a one page deal folded in 2. I got this from an PO of a 78 westy 'cause
my 79 didn't have any of the original documentation. Feel free to right click
on the images and save 'em. I can't promise that I'll have 'em hosted there
forever, but they'll be there for at least a couple of days.

Enjoy,
