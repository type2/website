Well, I have two small children that travel better if they are amused. I carry a
tv unit that has dual 5" LCD monitors to keep my kids entertained while we trek
across Ontario and various trips to the USA.

Imagine two kids under 5 in a Bus for a trip from the east coast to the west
coast? This is why Mr. Lyons has a play station.

I think technology in a van is a wonderful thing, unless ofcourse you are
travelling alone.
