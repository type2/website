Subject: Bad engine noises!!!

Hey guys.... 

	Well, last night, I started up my good ole 1973 VW Bus! It has the
1.8 with Hydraulic Lifters (GEX rebuild, motor from a later Bus I guess). In
any case, usually when I start it, I get a little lifter rattle.. because,
well.. since the motor is a flat-4, all the oil drains out of the lifters.
It usually goes away in about 4-5 seconds. Well.. this time, it lasted for
about a minute or so. I took it for a drive, thinking it would quiet down.

It sounded like it quieted down, so I parked the Bus. Then maybe a minute
later, I started it back up again, and it sounded perfectly normal.

Any idea what's going on? I'm guessing obviously that one of my lifters
wasn't getting oil. I checked my oil on the dipstick and it's still VERY
clean. Could this be a symptom of a clogged oil filter maybe?


On a side note, I'm using 10W-30 Castrol Synthetic. Should I be using 40
weight oil? Most motors are specifically designed for a type of weight oil..
like I know the small block chevy uses 40 weight oil... and the V6/60 uses
30 weight oil. So what does the flat-4 use? Or I guess the better question
to ask is, what kind of oil did it come with from the factory?
