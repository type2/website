Subject: Receiving type2 messages w/ attachments (?)

Hello,

For the past few days I've been receiving some type2 messages direct to my
e-mail box - and not via the digest as per normal.  What I find strange it
that all the messages get cut off about about 15 lines, and they contain
funny .doc.pif files at the end.

What's going on?

Thx,
Shawn.
