Subject: Newbie yield to advice on fuel lines !!!!

Bob Hoover's sermon was great..
Although I thought going threw the whole hardware
thing seemed timely..
I have a heavy gauge braided fuel line wrapped around
my metal line where it passes through the firewall..
this way its protected, but for how long??

Anyhow I also replaced my fuel line while my engine
was out, I bought 4' for main line and carb.. the
quality german stuff, no FLAPS here.. all for $7.00
not to steep considering it will save my ride..

peace and chicken grease,
