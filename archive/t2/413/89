Subject: virus

Hello,

I just read a message with regards to a virus.
the document that was mentioned was KPG exhaust 1864cfm.doc.pif
This has somehow originated in my computer without my knowledge and
I have no idea how this originated.i am sorry that this is from my source
and i am not intentionally sending viruses to people as someone on the list
has mentioned.
I have scanned my computer with Norton Anti virus but no viruses were
detected
and i could not locate the kpg exhaust document.
Can anyone give me some pointers on how to get this out of my computer?
I recieved a message yesterday about this and have tried to find any viruses
but no luck.

Thanks,
Darren
