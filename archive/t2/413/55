Subject: Re: [T2] Door latch interchange question

Chris,

I'm pretty sure most of the latch IS compatible, if nothing else, the
"potmetal" piece in the external handle that engages the latch IS, because I
poached it out of my '72 SC to fix my '75 driver's door ( they break and
it's not a part that you can buy, as far as I know. )

I'm pretty sure that the window winder for all Bays is the same model
number, and therefore should be a worthwhile spare, too.

Regards,
