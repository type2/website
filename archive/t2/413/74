Subject: Need listmember coupon code!!

I have a $500 order on the computer right now, and i called the customer
service line AT the bus depot.no one could provide me with the code!  So i
asked if i typed in "vanagon list member discount" in the coupon code like i
have the past few years would i get the discount........"NO.......you need
the code.............search on the vanagon site to find it.we do not have
it"  Go figure.......
