there is a double relay that controls the Fuel pump, the starter engages
the double relay until the engine starts and then it shuts off and the AFM
triggers the relay to keep the pump running.  it appears that your double
relay is not triggering the fuel pump when the engine is running.

double relay is usually mounted on the firewall abovee the #3 cyl  quick
check, with ignitiion on slide a pencil into the AFM and slightly push the
flapper in there, as soon as it moves the fuel pump should start...if it
doesn't there is a problem in that circuit...
