Subject: Door latch interchange question

Are the latch mechanisms the same for an early Bay ('72) and a Late Bay ('78).

Getting ready to scrap a good early Bay door and want to know if it's worth 
the trouble to extract the latch.

How about the window lift?

We're trying to sell our house to buy what I call a garage with attached 
house. Keeping my fingers crossed.
