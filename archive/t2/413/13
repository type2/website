Subject: Re: [T2] Color of U-piece for sliding door hinge

Yours should be silver. 99.9% of them are silver. I have seen a lot of them with overspray from crappy paint
jobs. That .1% that was not silver was chrome.... I have only seen one like that so I grabbed it from a
wrecking yard bus. Not sure what I will do with it... I thought about putting it on my 77 Westy but I have not
yet. It is around here somewhere....
