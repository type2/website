Hiya Zach,

The sprayer jets on a 70 are simple press in moldings. To get them out it 
would be a good idea to remove the hose.  Then, with a pair of ducknose pliers 
(or anything else in the pliers family) simply reach up and squeeze the molded 
"arms" and press forward at the same time.  That should clear the sprayer from 
the body.  And, as you mention, if you break one of those molded arms, not 
much is lost.

And as to your antenna thread...............  if your 70 is stock you have a 
one-piece mounting base for your antenna.  This base has two threaded 
attachment points which are inserted into two holes in the body.  The top attachment 
point/hole (the larger of the two) is also the opening for the antenna cable.  
The bottom attachment point/hole simply secures the antenna in a single 
position.  Both of these attachment points/holes and their respective securing nuts 
can be seen from under the dash over on the passenger side.  In all liklihood, 
all you need to do is to tighten up these two nuts.
