I have those brackets $10 a set (plus $5 /priority mail)

I can order a child cot from anyone.  What I can't
seem to find is the brackets that mount to the bus
itself.  Let me know of any source new or old.

I am a "virtual" wrecking yard, selling
GOOD USED PARTS, mostly ORIGINAL STOCK.
These parts are thirty (+/-) years old,
That I pulled from a parts bus or traded...
I would use them on my buses, but they are
USED parts.    "HAPPINESS GUARANTEED"
