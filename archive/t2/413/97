Well, I did respond with my experience, I guess it wasn't conclusive.  :-/  I'll try again.

My opinion is that you should not do this because of the extra length of the 091 tranny.

I have used the 091 tranny with 091 input shaft with '74 bell housing, starter, 215mm clutch and 2-liter engine, just like you are planning on doing and I had no problems with the input shaft length.  I did however end up going back to an 002 trans because of the tranny length issue.
