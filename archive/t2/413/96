Subject: Camping / Beach Bumming - DelMarVa??

Anybody chilling this 4th July weekend near a coastline in Delaware, 
Maryland, Virginia??

If not, how about the Outer Banks, NC??

I am just looking for some  happening, or bus persons' gathering, or general 
direction to head towards, from northern Virginia
