Glenn,
go to fullmoonbusclub.com, register and post to the Technical forum what 
your problems are.  you will  hear a lot of suggestions.  there is a guy 
in Boiling Springs who could use some moral support right now if you 
know anything about tuning the 32/36 carbs, what goes around comes 
around.  I'll be in the southeast for the end of Aug-Sept 14 if you want 
me to try to arrange to take a look at your bus.
