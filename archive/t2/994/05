Hi Volks,

I was up at the park today to check out the facilities and I thought  
I should mention that we do have some construction going on in the area.

If you are coming from the west (Toronto or further) I would  
recommend you avoid Taunton Rd, as it is single lane for several  
miles through to Brock Street. (HWY 12). This is just a minor  
annoyance, unless you happen to be traveling through the area between  
4:00P and 7PM, in which case it might be a bit more of a pain.

The recommended detour is as follows:

Take HWY 401 to Brock Rd, and travel north 5.7 miles (9.3KM) to HWY  
7,  or, (if you don't mind toll roads) Take Hwy 407 to its end at  
Brock Rd.
 From there you go East 5.7 miles  (9.3KM) on HWY 7 to Coronation Rd.
Turn right on Coronation and travel south 1.3 miles (2KM) to  
Lyndebrook Rd.
Follow Lyndebrook .7 miles (1.1KM) all the way to the end, the gate  
to the campground is on the right.
Another .8 miles (1.1KM) of gravel road will bring you to the  
campground, and there you are!

Happy Trails,
