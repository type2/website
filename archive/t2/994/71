I looked for the specs on the hankoooks, but was unable to find them. The
Continental Vanco 8's, which should be a close match in the 195R14 size are
26.2" in diameter and roll 797 revs in a mile. The only Michelin tire I
could find specs on in the 205-70/14 is a p metric Harmony which measures
25.2" in diameter and rolls 826 revs per mile. That's about a 4.5% reduction
in revolutions per mile.
