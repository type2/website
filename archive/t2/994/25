Hi David,

None of the engine choices you are looking at are likely to stress  
your transmission. The type2 transmission is heavily over-engineered  
and is practically bulletproof when connected to an aircooled engine.  
This is why it is in high demand with sand-rails and other high- 
performance applications. Unless you are very well off you will  
bottom out your wallet long before you break the transmission.

The 914 engine is difficult to match up to an early baywindow, but  
nothing is impossible if you have enough time and $$$. Even if you do  
have the time and $$$ available, you can find as good or better  
performance cheaper in a type1 engine for the same $$$ with a lot  
less work involved.


Happy Trails,

1600 DP
1776
1914
1918

(I would also consider a Porsche 914.)

My requirements are simple:  reliability and "adequate" power.  I am
considering an air conditioner, but don't want to end up with so much
horsepower and torque that I overdrive the rest of the transmission.
