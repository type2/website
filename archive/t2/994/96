tried that on wheels, and did it last OK?"

Dr. Robt, I painted my wheels a month or so ago knowing not might ensue. 
Didn't use Hammerite, just an off brand. I started by removing as much 
rust as possible with wire brush, sandpaper, etc,. prepped with 
Rustoleum rusty primer (spray can) about three coats and then a spray or 
two of cheapo aluminum speckled stuff. Did all this with tires/wheels 
off the bus and left them all night stacked vertically with two 100 watt 
trouble lights under the bottom tire providing a drying influence. Then 
I let them dry for two days w/out heat applied.

To my surprise, the paint hardened and became quite chip resistant. And 
they look great, too.
