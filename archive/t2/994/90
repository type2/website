Subject: Hammerite on wheels (was:Re: [T2] jack practice)

I had my wheels sandblasted a few years ago. Then I treated them with
Loctite rust treatment to be on the safe side. Finally I sprayed on 2 coats
of "Smoothrite" - the smooth version of Hammerite. Within 6 months the
surface was rust marked. Not badly but annoyingly bad enough.

I subsequently brush painted with POR15 after a rub down with a sanding
disk. In 18 months the faces have stayed clear of rust.

Hope this helps.

For me this will not be a mere rehearsal: I'm about to paint
my (original steel) wheels.  My best guess for non-bling protection
is Hammerite, the Brit 'mottled' paint.  Has anyone tried that on
wheels, and did it last OK?
