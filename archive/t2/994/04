Jamie asked:


> Q.1 - can I connect a vdo tach to the cal electronic ignition.

I don't see why not, although I have not tried it.

> Q.2 - is it ok to power up the ignition module from term 88a on the double  relay? It seems to work fine.

I always go to + on the coil. If it works on 88a, ok fine.

> Q.3 - I don't have the throttle body with the retard port,, so I left the 
 dist retard port open,, and connected the advance to the throttle body vac 
 port,, and timed it at 7.5 nach .... is that correct? 

Yes, correct.

> Q.4 - should I look for a throttle body that has the retard port... anyone 
 have one for sale? 
 
 Only if you have to worry about passing a smog check test like here in California.  Otherwise save your $$.
