Subject: starter swap-ability

There are a few different starters out there for the VW bus/vanagon,
and I thought someone on-list might be able to help with this.  I want
to know if the wasserboxer starter is compatable with a 002
bellhousing.  I understand that the late bay/early vanagon can fit, but
without the bushing.  Could it fit with some modification to the
starter, using longer bolts, cutting part of the starter shaft, etc?

What I have so far... These all fit into a 002 bellhousing and will
work without modification.  The last 2 will work if the bushing is left
off:
SR15N Starter, 12 Volt, Bus 1967 to 1975
SR15X Starter, 12 Volt, Bus 1967 to 1975 (MT)
SR17X Starter, Bus & Vanagon 1974 to Early 1982 (AT)

How about the water-cooled starters?  WBX part number is SR19X or
SR401X.
