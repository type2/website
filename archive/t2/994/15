Subject: Re: [T2] fire extinguishers

I wonder what this stuff is---??
Your supposed to mix it in an extinquisher bottle?

I know halon is the best for putting a fire out right now without really
screwing up the surrounding area, but some of the green people don't
seem to care for it.

I've got a automatic Halon system in my boat, and a small bottle that's
in my Westy.

Halon rob's the oxygen from the fire-- POOF-- it's out right now and
doesn't make any kind of a mess of anything that wasn't burning.
