We should see more "attaboys" for outfits like Bus Depot.

In a similar vein, Ventura Warehouse Group (VWG) does some amount of drop
shipping for Bus Depot.  Recently they had a California customer with a
sheet metal problem from a drop shipment by VWG to the customer.  Turned out
that the manufacturer appears to have inaccurate application information for
the piece not only to VWG & Bus Depot, but to many others in the marketplace
as well.

After doing a bit of research on my own as well as the BD customer doing
some on his own, I was able figure why the BD customer (and perhaps others)
may have been receiving an inaccurate replacement.  The problem is being
fixed, BD has credited the customer, the customer is returning the wrong
piece to VWG and subsequent credit will be issued to Bus Depot and they
won't be stuck with the item to take up precious space there in PA (I've
been to BD - they're not exactly "roomy").  VWG will not be "stuck" with the
item either, as I now know what year application the item really fits and
they're still very saleable.

BTW, the manufacturer has been informed of their inaccuracy.  Whether that
helps or not remains to be seen, but VWG has altered their Vendor Part
Number & info to correct future re-supply of said item.

The gist of this is Bus Depot does go out of their way to correct or solve a
problem, if there is indeed one and it's been my experience that most of the
time it's not their fault and in many cases, not the fault of the supplying
vendor (in the sheet metal case, VWG), but sometimes the manufacturer
itself.  It can be hard at times comparing notes 50 to 3000 then to 8000
miles away from all concerned parties, but we do expend the effort.
Unfortunately, not all supplying vendors to BD or even to VWG are not as
progressive in this vein.

Besides, it's one of the many hats I have wear at VWG to "put out the spot
fires" that flare up like this from time to time. :-)
