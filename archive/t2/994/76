Something seems amiss here, as this description doesn't sound at all like
RA08's. They have a comparably stiff sidewall to the Michelins and shouldn't
be squirrely at all.  In fact the Type2, Vanagon, and Samba archives are
full of overwhelmingly positive reviews of them (many from people who
previously used Michelins or Conti's); I don't think there's even a single
other report of them being "squirrely."  What's more I have never had a
single complaint from my customers (nor have I noticed this myself, having
used both Michelins and Hankooks extensively).  Are you sure you have the
RA08's?  185's or 195's? (A taller sidewall will have slightly more flex,
but with only a 1/2" difference it shouldn't be as severe as feeling like
the bus would blow over on every wind gust.)  Did you inflate them properly?
(Compared to 205 series tires, 185's and 195's will require significantly
higher inflation; see your door jamb sticker.)  Did you take the one tire
back to your local Hankook dealer?  Did you make any other changes to your
van at the same time (i.e. shocks)?
