Subject: digital timing light power source...

Man!  That was fast!  Thanks for the quick replies Terry K. and Al L.!  Both
said that you can run a 12 v timing light on a portable 12 v battery and use
it to time a 6 v system.  That would be great for around the garage at home.

Okay, next question, anyone do this before?  Do you have to drag a full size
12 v car battery around on a road trip in a 6 v car in case you might need to
run the timing light, or can a small/tiny 12 v battery of some kind do the
trick?  What would work?  I know about those small 12 v jump start batteries
units about the size of a small briefcase, but I'm wondering about something
even smaller.

Ideas/experiences?

Thanks again!

Bill Bowman
