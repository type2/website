Subject: My jacks got jacked

What a piss poor experience this whole brake deal has been.

The other day, my friend came over and tried to open my sliding door while
my bus was jacked up (on the old school style jacks), not on jack stands yet
(I was positioning them) and I was under the car!

Needless to say, the dumb-ass caused my van to shift to the side and broke
on of the jacks! The big screw just snapped.

Today, I was jacking up the back end again to try to do a complete
adjustment on the brakes and lube up the star wheels and what not.

As I was lowering the van on one side, I BROKE THE OTHER JACK!!! WTF???? I
had just greased the damn thing up to keep it working nicely too!

So at this point, I am without jacks that I can take with me for travel. I
have seen the updated style that BD sells, but I figured I would ask what
everyone else uses that might be compact and yet does the job?

Two broken jacks within 2 days of one another - this sucks.
