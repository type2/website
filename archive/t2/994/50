Hello Y'all,
             I've been on this list for several years; just recently relocated 
from Maryland to South Carolina.  My family (from new) 1969 Bay is now up on 
jackstands in our east-side Spartanburg garage, awaiting restoration.  That 
might take awhile since a number of less interesting projects, i.e., not VW-
related, are on my frau's job list; but I am very interested in learning about 
VW Type 2 clubs/resources in the western Carolinas.  I've heard of a Bus Club 
and a fellow who specializes in engine rebuilds, but have lost contact with the 
list member [Mr Anderson] who mentioned those to me.  Thanks and stay cool!
