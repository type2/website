Subject: fire extinguishers

I've been following the thread on fire extinguishers.  I have a small powder unit behind my passenger seat.  And I have a big water-filled in the garage.  But I need a CO2 unit.  A good source for them is your local commercial fire protection supplier.  Mine sold new CO2 extinguishers for upwards of $200.  But they have some good used ones, certified, filled, etc. for around $100.  I haven't bought one yet but that's where I'm going.  Look in your yellow pages and check it out.  Cheers...KR
