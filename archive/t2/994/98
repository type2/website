I've had good results with rustoleum too. Both rattle can and quart
cans in my HVLP sprayer.

But DON'T use the rusty metal primer. It has fish oil in it and if the
oil isn't baked out you can end up with trouble. I went through some
serious fisheye issues because of using the rusty metal primer when I
had removed all the rust.

Wipe the metal with Prep-n-prime or some other rust converter, then
use the clean metal primers.
