Subject: ok to drive w/o "r"

while my "new" transmission for Maude (72 riviera) is
in transit for the right side of the country, is it
safe to be driving her even though reverse is totally
non-existant? other than around town stuff, i need to
get a friend's place tomorrow, about 150 miles round
trip. 

Why is it when you have 5 cars... only one runs at a
time?

lets  see- 1999 ford ranger with cracked block. Engine
is out and i'm just waiting for some time. 4wd, paid
500$ for it. 

1986 syncro singlecab- just died, randomnly. still
troubleshooting

1972 (maude, above)- no reverse

1986 syncro westy- runs great :-)

1999 volvo v70 awd. burley cyclic idle, still trying
to figoure out. got it for dirt cheap though.

-cheers
matt
