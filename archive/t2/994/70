Bill,

There's another consideration as well.  I put a set of these on my 80
Westy, and the handling got definitely squirrely on the highway, relative
to the Michelins I had been running.  With every side gust, it felt like
the bus was going over.  You might not like the effect.  I don't think I'd
put another set on there now.

Also, one of them came apart on me on the highway with quite a bit of
tread left, say, a half inch.  It could just have been a bad tire since
it hasn't happened again on any of the others.
