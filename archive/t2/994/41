A set of 88mm machine-in P&C, a 74mm crankshaft and go! I don't even  
think there is much clearancing needed for a 74mm stroke, so as  
stroker engines go, it is relatively simple to assemble. However, no  
"B" (stroker) machine-in 88mm P&C are available, so you need some  
large spacers under the cylinders to accommodate the long stroke.
