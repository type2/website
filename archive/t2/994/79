If the reverse gear has slipped out of engagement with
the key that slides it into and out of engaging, then
the gear is floating on the shaft and can engage /
disengage depending on the attitude of the bus. If I
remember correctly, a nose-down position disengages it
whereas a nose-up position could engage it. There is
the possibility it could get really ugly really
suddenly! -BaH
