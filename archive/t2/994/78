Subject: jack practice

	A cobber of mine recently told of his touring N. Amer. in a 
decade-old splittie camper (but I assume the moral would apply to the 
similar-construction Late T2).  After a lot of sightseeing & fun with 
his wife & two children, he was cheerily heading into NYC his planned 
port of departure when a tyre went flat.  No worries, he chirped  - 
the jack & spare wheel are to hand.
	The jack worked smoothly, to his relief (not having been 
tried during his ownership).  No worries, he intoned.
	Then he noticed that while the jack was still rising smoothly 
the bus wasn't.  The explanation was soon apparent: the jack had 
simply ripped free a section of frame & floor severely weakened by 
rust, which continued steadily skyward leaving the bus stolidly 
unmoved.

	It would follow that we ought to practise [yes yanks, that's 
the verb; practice is the noun] with our jacks in benign conditions, 
not waiting for a dark night heading into parts of Noo York that you 
might not be advised to split into.
	For me this will not be a mere rehearsal: I'm about to paint 
my (original steel) wheels.  My best guess for non-bling protection 
is Hammerite, the Brit 'mottled' paint.  Has anyone tried that on 
wheels, and did it last OK?
