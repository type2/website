There are a few different starters out there for the VW bus/vanagon,
and I thought someone on-list might be able to help with this.  I want
to know if the wasserboxer starter is compatable with a 002
bellhousing.  I understand that the late bay/early vanagon can fit, but
without the bushing.  Could it fit with some modification to the
starter, using longer bolts, cutting part of the starter shaft, etc?

What I have so far... These all fit into a 002 bellhousing and will
work without modification.  The last 2 will work if the bushing is left
off:
SR15N Starter, 12 Volt, Bus 1967 to 1975
SR15X Starter, 12 Volt, Bus 1967 to 1975 (MT)
SR17X Starter, Bus & Vanagon 1974 to Early 1982 (AT)

How about the water-cooled starters?  WBX part number is SR19X or
SR401X.

Not sure what you mean  "The last 2 will work if the bushing is left
off "??

The difference between N and X is New and Rebuilt.

When you say "I understand that the late bay/early vanagon can fit" you mean the 2.0 starter which is the
SR87X. It will NOT fit, no way no how.
The drive is too long.

The SR87X fits 76 to 1/81, 2.0 air cooled.
The SR19X fits 1/81 to the end of 85, 2.0 air and 1.9 water cooled. They will not work on a 2.0 bay because
the position of the solenoid moved up higher and hits the bay floor. Imagine the SR87 solenoid at 9 o'clock
and the SR19 at 11 o'clock as you look at the back end.
