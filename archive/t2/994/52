That is A LOT TOOO HIGH! ......... sometimes the bushings,, or the shocks 
seize when the beam is stored... take the shocks off and jump up and down on 
the front bumper,, with the wheels on the ground.
the suspesions should spring up and down...
grease the front end... put the shocks back on...

when you say,,, sits lower... what do you mean.. 

when you look at the shock tower,, the upper bolt should be close to the top 
of the frame of the body.. 

here is a picture from Richards site... it shows the correct location
