Subject: vanco 8 discontinued, I hear.

to all,

Read this on the EV list, regarding Continental discontinuing the Vanco 8:

"The tire line that will replace the Vanco 8 is the Vanco 2 due sometime
in the third quarter of 07; however, we are not expecting full
availability in the US until spring 08'. The VANCO 2 tire will have the
same specs as the VANCO 8 and it will be rated a Load Range D."

I liked the vanco 8.

Mark
