"Adequate" varies from person to person.  For some, 3rd gear on hills at
35MPH is adequate.  :)

As others have said, the further you get from stock the more trouble you
will encounter.  Consider if the time saved while driving is worth the
time spent building and maintaining the big engine.  Of course, if
building engines is considered recreational you can shoot for the moon.

If you decide to go for the type 4 power, you might want to trade your bus
for a slightly newer one that is made to go with that engine.
