Hmmm, what's involved in building an 1800? 
I have a 1600sp that is a candidate for a rebuilding. Is this a suitable base for this kind of thing?

I am running this combo and have been VERY happy with the set up.
There is a lot of torque for the hills and pulling away fron a stop.

My bus' nick name is "My Pop Top Sports Car" for this reason!

Have fun,
