Subject: Re: [T2] E-Brake vs. Foot brake

I just got done with the rear drums and the parking brake is still not
nearly as effective as it should be.

I had to remove the drums because the star wheels were frozen solid. I got
them fairly loose and then got the wheels on to adjust the brakes.

I am pretty sure I did it right, but I don't know if I went too loose due to
the fact that I was being hyper sensitive on the whole - tighten until you
get friction, then back then off a tad. Maybe my tad is too big.

It has been a loooooong time since I have done brakes.... is my method
correct?

When I got done, the parking brake WOULD hold better than before, but that
was after applying some muscle to the lever in a nice strong pull.

Are they still too loose?
