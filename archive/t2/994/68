Subject: Re: digital timing light power source...

I don't have a digital to try it on,, but I bet they would work on a 9v 
radio battery for a few minutes.. long enough to check timing. 

It would be easy enough to try,,, 

same idea as putting a 9v battery in the cig lighter before you pull the car 
12v battery,, so you don't loose the radio programming etc,,
