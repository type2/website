Subject: RE: [T2] VW Bus water bottle

Starbucks has a mug that you can put in a picture of your bus.  If I could
ever figure out this new-fangled internet picture thing I would post a
picture. $9.99 IIRC. However that is a sign of a very vain serious addiction
to your bus. Guess that's why I bought one.
