Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Recommendations for a digital advance timing

	These here digital gizmos would appear, from different T2ers' 
experiences, to get by on 6 V in some models, but to require 12 V  - 
which can take some little trouble to provide.
	Ifg it is true that some digital timing lights can scrape by 
-  tho' less bright  -  on 6 V, then (all else being roughly equal, 
which they may not turn out to be) it would appear to be best to 
choose the models that can work on 6 V requiring no boost.  Then 
those who indulge in 6 V olde VW, or old 6 V Meteor flathead V8s, can 
use the same light strightforwardly on both 12 V and 6 V vehicles.
