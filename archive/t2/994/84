<<... I always carry a timing light. I've had several occasions where a
point set has gone south requiring a replacement.... and of course, 
that leads to a need to reset the timing.>>

A Tach / Dwell meter would do you a bunch better to dial in the points
after replacing the broken ones on the road---or at home .

I've hardly ever seen the timing change one iota after swapping a point
set.

But I've never moved the distributor either when I've changed them ---

The tach / dwell is more essential than the timing light--you can ear
the timing in a pinch , and only be a hair off if your good---
