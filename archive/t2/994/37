Subject: accelerator pedal

Well, my pedal keeps popping off.  Evidently I'm missing something, but I don't know what it is.  I have the pedal which has a clip on it (I originally thought it was a spring) that clips to the top of the accelerator rod/bar/whatever.  But nothing to hold it on.  Then at the bottom, on the left side, the pedal slides onto a rod fastened to the floorboard.  If it fastened on the right side, that part has broken off.  That's all I have.  I can put it back on  but it doesn't take long before it pops off again.  Nothing about it in Muir.  What's missing?  

I also found, laying in the front floorboard, a curious looking device.  It is about the size of a 30 cal. rifle shell casing made of brass (I think).  It works just like a push-down trigger switch.  It has a spring-loaded 'button' on top with a groove in the center that obviously holds something.  The bottom is an open hole and air is forced out as you push down on the 'button.'  I can't see that it fits anywhere on the accelerator and the spring in it is pretty tight.  But I have no idea where it came from.  Does it sound like a bus part?  

Thanks and cheers....KR
