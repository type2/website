The only thing that I can think of was that I used some anti seize compound on
the threads of the plugs.  It is not on the electrode.  maybe I should go get

That could be it...It's not just the electrode, the plug grounds to the case
through the threads...You might just have a non-cunducting anti-seize on
the threads...
