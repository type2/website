A new seal may not fix the oil leak. The curved surface of the
flywheel (and fan hub-rear seal) that rubs the oil seal, must be
perfectly smooth. If you can feel pits, or much worse, if you can
feel a groove that goes all the way around the flywheel, then a
new seal won't stop the oil leak. A groove that catches your
fingernail will <pump> oil out of the engine like an Archimedes
Screw. The groove will likely not be perfectly parallel to the
end spin of the crankshaft. The crooked spiral acts like a pump
because the groove acts like a reservoir that fills up with oil
when it passes through the seal into the engine. Then the filled
up groove reservoir moves to the outside of the seal, away from
the engine and toward the clutch. There the reservoir slings off
the oil it had just collected . You can use 400 grit sandpaper to
polish out light grooves and pits.

I think you are already chancing engine failure by going over
50,000 before a valve job
You can easily get 200,000 on a bus engine by doing only a head
job and ring job every 50,000 miles
Of course it is always better and more reliable to do a complete
engine rebuild, but the bottom end of the 914 Type IV bus engine
is much stronger than the old 1200-1600 bug engines that should
have never been put in a bus. I have found that you always have
to line bore a bug-bus engine because the crankshaft knocks the
main bearings into ovals. The Type IV case rarely has to be
linebored.

If you are frugal and not planning to drive around the world, do
the head job with new exhaust valves, new  exhaust guides,
whatever necessary with the intake valves(which easily last
200,miles with 50,000 mile regrinding) and hone the cylinders and
re-ring the pistons. If you are rich, tear it all the way down
and replace everything.
