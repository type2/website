Hello,

Wow, 243 k, never a rebuild, were you doing my suggested 50 k
head jobs?
a head job, is not quite really a "rebuild" job.

I am sure impressed. You must be a great driver:

    I'll bet you never "lug" the engine.

I sure am interested in your maintenance schedule: oil brand,
plugs, valve settings, timing, gas octane, etc.. oil temp
auge  - never let the oil get over xx degrees, head temp gauge -
never let the head get over xx degrees. what what what do you
do?!

I'll do exactly as you say, sir, whatever you say, no questions
asked. Just let me know how to get that kind of engine life!

oops, what engine class are we talking about here,

    the inferior (1100)1200-1600 bug engine; or,

    the superior "914 Porsche Type" VW Type IV based engine?

do you have a web page with info about this engine?

I am not trying to be mean here, but you do know that the day
will come when that engine will eventually die. I hope you have
thought about this before it happens and made plans and come to
terms with this sad fact. When the engine does die, please
perform a thorough post mortem and let everyone (me and the type2
list) know what part failed and what exact work had to be done to
prepare the engine for the next xxx,xxx miles of use.

Thank you,

bye

Gary G. Martin
