Check that your cht sensor is within tolerance.  If that's out of whack, 
or not connected, you'll have alot of trouble starting.  I came in kinda 
late on this, but have you checked that all your spark plug wires are on 
correctly?  try taking a plug and hooking it up directly to the coil 
with a plug cable and verify that you're getting descent spark.  Be 
careful that you don't shock yourself ;)  I'm assuming that you've 
checked out your points and all that's within spec?

you might also want to verify that your AFM has the proper resistance 
values per bentley.
