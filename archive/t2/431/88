Subject: Re: [T2] Now end play..was mystery leak

With 220K on my original engine, out for replacing that failed clutch, I
noticed out of spec endplay and calculated/installed the right
shims....and noticed that when I "wound" the engine (turn it in
direction of running) the endplay was way too tight.  Indeed, some of
the play is in the flywheel side thrust bearing (could see it go in and
out)- so I backed it out.  Check your endplay in this "wound" state; if
within spec, leave it alone.....and if you aren't me trying to see what
will finally fail, consider a rebuild....
