Cha (& anyone else w/ carbs that are looking for your temp sensor II).
It's a FI only item. It varies resistance depending on how hot it is &
is mounted in the 3/4 cyl head to measure heat. The AFM takes the info
& adjusts the mixture to suit the conditons. How do I know? b/c if
that little $18 part is fubar the whole bus runs like total crap :)
