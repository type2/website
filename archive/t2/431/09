Subject: Re: How do you buy a new/old Beetle from Mexico?

I saw the posts from a few days ago about the Mexi-Beetle and getting the new
air cooled cars up here from Mexico.  I've got a body from a 2001 Mexican Air
Cooled Beetle.  I bought it from someone that was converting Beetles to
HumBugs in Mexico City.  He moved his company up here and isn't doing the VW
conversions now but he brought along one of the bodies and I bought it from
him.  The body has factory white paint, that looks new.  From what the man
said that I got it from the only time the car was driven on the road was to
travel from the factory to his shop.  The car has all the doors / hatches,
glass, factory rubber seals / window gaskets, mirrors, fenders, bumpers,
complete interior minus front seats and carpets.  My plan was to put it on a
pan, have some front seats recovered to match the interior, and then put my
Mexican 1600 in it.  Then I'd have as close to a new air cooled Beetle as is
legally possible here in the U.S.  I'm moving soon and hoping to take the body
along with me but it's a long move 2500 miles approx. and I've got too many
vehicles so some of them are going to have to be sold. In the next few weeks
I'll know what vehicles are going with me and what I have to sell.  If anyone
is potentially interested in the Mexican Type I let me know and I'll give you
a chance at it first before I list it for sale on the net and in papers. Email
me and I can send you a few pictures.   I've also got a storage container here
with parts in it and I know I've got some bus parts in there that I need to
sort out and sell so I'll try to list those here in the next few weeks.  I
only subscribe in digest mode so please email me directly at
