--- George,

    yeah you are right... but these also had undercoat
spray all over everything so I figured the WD would
soften it..which it did.. the shocks I took off musta
been on there since 74! ;-) the the nuts/bolts
loosened
easily..once I was that far I just cut the sleeves 
with a 4" abrasive cutter wheel (carefully)..
   As soon as I cut a slot in it..not all the way
through...they turned fairly easy with vice grips..
  There wasnt much rust under the sleeves.. just
enough to weld them in place..
  Grease? Yep... a dab of white Lith. grease.
   I realy like the "new ride".. not harsh stiff but
it just feels much more stable and steady. The big
test was getting behind a Semi in the tailwind.. I can
still feel it of course but nothing like before.
