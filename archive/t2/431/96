Subject: Yreka Mystery Solved And............

Hiya All,

Recently there have been a few questions as to the nature of the VW wrecking 
yard spotted on the southern fringes of Yreka, CA just off I-5.  I had to 
deliver my daughter to college in southern California and decided to stop in Yreka 
and find out about this possible source for parts.

Turns out the wrecking yard is run by Garcia's Foreign Car Clinic.  23 Buses 
in the yard of which 6 were splitties.  Overall, I was impressed by the care 
of the vehicles.  Clean yard.  I found a pair of early bay front turn signal 
housings in very (VERY) good shape.  And, unless you've had to look for these 
things, you won't know how hard a pair of really good ones are to find.  $10.00 
apiece including the lenses and rubber seals.  Lots of other cars there too.  
Mostly Bugs, but there was a 412 also.

Definitely worth stopping in and looking around.  Info:  2035 Fairlane Rd., 
530.842.5516, generally open on weekdays - closed on the weekends.

AND..........if that weren't enough, Serf (the fellow I talked to at Garcia'
s) told me about another place in Corning, CA.  So, since we were headed south 
on I-5 we kept a lookout for this one also.  We found Reilly's Mufflers at 
2351 Carona Ave., 530.824.4086.  Bill (?) is an old hand at VWs and although he 
runs a muffler shop his first love is VWs.  He also has a wrecking yard - not 
as extensive as Garcias.  But he has a beautiful shop setup and lotsa VW parts. 
 Great guy to talk to.  When we were there he was trying to peddle a 
customer's 68 single cab.  Very clean, complete, and no rust.  Customer wanted $5,500 
for it but Bill thought it should go for $4,500.

If you're planning on traveling I-5 yet this summer, give these two a 
look-see.  I had a great time at both places.
