2 problems there.  WD-40 isn't a good penetrating oil, and one day is not
nearly long enough for pre-treating.  Use Liquid Wrench or Kroil and give
them a healthy soaking for several days before you take things apart.

I hope that you put a thin film of grease on the stud before you installed
the new shocks.
