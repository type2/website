Subject: Help with mystery leak

I'm about half way through my first major road trip with my 76 Westy.  She
is running like a champ.  No problems and she even handles the hills in PA.
However, upon arriving in Philadelphia I've discovered a leak and I'm not
sure where it is coming from.  I changed the oil and filter before I left so
the oil is a nice light brown color after 955 miles.  The leak that I have
is dark black and is coming from the front (front being the front of the
bus) of the engine.  It looks like it may be coming from between the engine
and the tranny.  Isn't tranny fluid red?  My mechanic supposedly changed the
tranny fluid out last September.  Anyways, I haven't had any issues with the
engine overheating, nor have I had any problems with the clutch.  I'm
wondering what I'm losing and how would be the best way to determine exactly
what the fluid is.  I'm in Bensalem, PA for the week so if someone wouldn't
mind giving me a hand that would be awesome.  I'm still learning how to take
care of my bus.

Thanks in advance,
