Subject: dual carb to single conversion.

  I have a 71' bay window.  I pulled a 2L out of a 74' westie and somehow 
got it to fit.  I would like to go from the dual carb to a single, but alas 
am having little luck finding a kit.  I know there is one out there, and it 
would be a lot easier on me to find one than try to buy everything 
individually.  Any suggestions?
