Subject: Re: [T2] Distributor Drive Shaft is Stuck - How to Remove?

The "tool" you need is a dowel, just slightly larger in diameter than the
round hole in the center of the drive shaft that holds the spring.  Whittle
a slight taper in the last inch or so of the dowel and jam it down into the
hole (spring removed, of course) and then carefully lift up the drive shaft,
rotate it, and set it back down.  You then wiggle your "tool" free of the
hole.
