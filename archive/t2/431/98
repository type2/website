Unless he has a 71 engine or someone has installed a dog house oil cooler,
both upper bolts will be behind the fan shroud. Do not confuse him by calling the fan shroud
a 'dog house', this is incorrect. The dog house is only the tin section that was added when the oil cooler was
moved out of the fan shroud air flow.
If he has a dog house, then the left upper bolt will be accessible from the trans side of the engine.
