Subject: DPO owns up to lowering bus

Hey Gang,

Latest in the constant string of bunk-a$$ volks-knowledge I've been getting from the DPO of the '65 standard is the admission that he had the front lowered (torsion spring removal) because the back looked low.

HHHMMPHH.

This guy's considering picking up a new '64 bus project so I'm telling him everything I'm changing about the project I bought from him to try and steer him straight.

He works at the liquor store around the corner from my house, and as I enjoy a cold one on these 90+ days coupled with some regular volks-blabber, I stop in frequently.

"hiya ralph, took off those eyebrows today"

"hiya ralph, pulled of the homemade tint job and put the oilbath filter back in today"

"hiya ralph, pulled of the plastichrome wheel trim rings today"

Well, I know the shop that did it, and I'm gonna hit him up to do the work and not charge me for parts since he probably has my originals there.

How many hours of labor should I expect for this job? From a professional.

Could you all please comment on time required to adjust the rears also? I'd like to put the bus back to stock ride height/suspension quality.

Tired of the wife refering to the bus as a lowrider/hoopty and grinding my steering box off on the driveway.

In other news, the future owners of my first bus (76) will make their last payment in a few weeks and takeover. I will miss this beast and it's wonderful california '79 engine.

But, as Yoda said, "there is another."

The 79 deluxe sunroof lurks in the garage, beckoning for the first time in years.

Thanks to those who followed along,

Billy
