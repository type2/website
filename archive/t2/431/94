Subject: I'm gonna pull my engine

Ok, it's official, I need to pull my engine. This is the first time for me so
be gentle.

Is the Haynes manual and the idiot manual sufficient help for someone who's
not a genius, but not a complete dolt either. Is there any places on the web
that help too? I would appreciate any input.

Thanks,
