Yo Teddy--
One additional comment here bud---
If in fact the oil doesn't stink like gear oil--and it isn't thick like
gear oil--it's your engine seal leaking.
The reason it's black, is the oil is being thrown around inside the bell
housing and picking up all the clutch dust, and dripping out the bottom
-- that's the reason for the black color---

Still--a slipping clucth situation, hence the power loss.

It's going to be an interesting trip back home.

Take Care--
