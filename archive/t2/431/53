Scott and Karl,

Thanks for the help...I thought it should go there, but wasn't sure.

It's in now(in and out 3 times) and the engine is mostly bolted in
the 78(as of Sunday night at 10:30pm).

Will hook up the rest of the fuel, electric and FI stuff tonight...I 
expect to get it started tonight!

Cheers, dave
