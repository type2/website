Subject: Re: [T2] '80 Vanagon Backing plates on a '78 bay

> If I pull the backing plate (et al) off a '80 Vanagon, is it a simple
 replacement onto a '78 bay?? I will pull everything from the Vanagon backing plate to the drum
 Reason: want to upgrade the '78 to self adjusting brakes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

I am going to try this swap when my rear brakes need replacing. I have all the pieces already.
A couple of people asked about doing this before and I offered to be the test subject.... but I do not need
rear brakes yet.... they seem to last longer when they know something is up :-)
