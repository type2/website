I've got the same leak, Ted, and my mech says it's probably the front engine
seal.  We're going to pull the engine in early September to deal with it.

If your's is like mine, it gets worse with driving and it appears that it
can affect the clutch, too.  (Splash, maybe?)

Whatcha doin' in Bensalem?  That's my ol' stompin' ground, just around the
corner from my folk's place. :O)
