Subject: Distributor Drive Shaft is Stuck - How to Remove?

Dear Type II,

 

Can anyone give me some tips.  I am stuck while working on my VW engine.

 

I need to lift my distributor drive shaft out just a hair to rotate it
and get it to its proper alignment at 12 degrees off centerline.

 

My magnets are not strong enough to pull it out.  The Bentley calls for
an expansion tool.  I can visualize what an expansion tool is but still
have not found a store that sells one that will do this job.  Puller is
perhaps a better term.

 

Do you know of an expansion tool that will work for this job?  A make
and model number would help.  Or is there another way to get the shaft
out?

 

Thank You Volks,
