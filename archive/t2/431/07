> Sounds like you have the 68-73 double-ended handle. It is made that way so
you can work the door from the inside.....68-73 Westies have the sink unit
standing behind the pass seat, with very little clearance between the door
and the sink unit with the spice rack/shelf.

Thanks, Karl.

We had our monthly club meeting yesterday evening & one of the 10 or so
buses that were able to come had one of these handles, but only the top
part.  The handle part on the bottom had been broken off.

Since this bus didn't have the sink unit in place, I couldn't see any reason
for the extension on the handle.  From your description I'm assuming that
the top of the handle sticks out above the edge of the sink unit facing the
sliding door.  Right?

>From what I've been told this handle is hard to get, so I might go ahead
with the mold.

The repro handle that I sold last night was the same style as the one in my
`77 bay.  I had dyed it deep purple to try to match the club member's bus,
and it was almost a perfect match!  I was pleased that it came that close to
the body color, without my having the bus nearby for color checks.
