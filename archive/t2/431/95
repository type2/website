you should have no prob.
just remember the bus only needs to be jacked up
enough for you to climb underneath and disconnect.>> 
Heat Exchangers,
Fuel Line,
Throttle Cable, 
and unbolt two bottom bolts from trans,to engine.
You also need to support the transmission with a wire
to the chassis this way it will stay put and wont sag
down when you remove engine. 
 
Remember there are two more top bolts you must remove
but this may be done from the inside, the bolts are
located behind the dog house. 
You must also remove the engines cross member, and at
this point make sure you have your jack under the
engine.

When you pull the engine back slightly make sure you
have cleared the transmission by about 2" before you
lower the engine to the ground.

wash up and go in side to eat your cake,

peace,
