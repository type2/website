Subject: starts but dies?  78 westy   update no change

Triple checked all vac and elect. connections=  all are where they should be.
The only thing that I can think of was that I used some anti seize compound on
the threads of the plugs.  It is not on the electrode.  maybe I should go get
a fresh set of plugs and put them in?

thanks for the replies!
