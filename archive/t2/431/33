Subject: 1600 compression/new engine dilema

My '71 has 67,000 mi on the current rebuild. I believe the front seal is 
leaking, definite leak in that area and the clutch will try to slip a bit 
when things get warmed up and there's an extra load like a hill or even a 
strong headwind.
I plan on replacing the clutch, and w 67k on the current rebuild, thought it 
would be time for a new/rebuilt engine at the same time. I just checked the 
compression w a new guage and was surprised to find 115-120 in all 
cylinders. The Brazilian Bosch W8AC plugs hadn't been pulled for 22k, but 
looked not bad, light brown #1, medium brown #2, darker brown #4, and a 
blackish but not real oily #3.
I drive her pretty mindfully, rarely over 60; keep the revs up on the 
climbs; oil, valves, dwell, timing at 3k.
My impression is that 67k is about due, but the compression readings and the 
plugs make me hope that she might be good for another 15k or so. My dilema 
is new engine w the clutch or clutch only for now.
Any experienced feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Best wishes
