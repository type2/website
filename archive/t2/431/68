Subject: RE: [T2] Help with mystery leak

There is no slipping at all.  The clutch and engine are performing great.
I've had no loss of power at all.  If it is the engine seal, how do I go
about fixing it?  Do I need to just keep adding oil to it until I fix it?
The oil doesn't feel thick at all.  It feels like regular old motor oil,
just the dark black color threw me off.  How hard is it to replace this
seal?

Thanks again Terry,

Yo Teddy--
One additional comment here bud---
If in fact the oil doesn't stink like gear oil--and it isn't thick like
gear oil--it's your engine seal leaking.
The reason it's black, is the oil is being thrown around inside the bell
housing and picking up all the clutch dust, and dripping out the bottom
-- that's the reason for the black color---

Still--a slipping clucth situation, hence the power loss.

It's going to be an interesting trip back home.

Take Care--
