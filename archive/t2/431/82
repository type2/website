Yes, in some instances the larger endplay is just a bit of wear on the
thrust surface of the #4 main bearing. If the overspec endplay is the
bearing moving in the case (case needs to be cut on the thrust), then no
amount of frigging with shims will fix it anyhow. Type IV motors are less
prone to this sort of wear than type 1.
