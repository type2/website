This sure isn't gospel, but here are my thought on it. If movement of
the crank is bad (read more binding on rod bearings & wrist pins) then
taking up some slack created by worn parts should be acceptable. I
have not seen mention in any of the books I have come across that have
said that after innitial assembly, not to reset endplay, but there are
published specs for the 3 spacers & what size they are made in.
Sooooo, as long as we don't exceed the 3 largest spacers all should be
okee dokee. Since excessive endplay usually indicated a well worn
engine I would say it's just a band-aid for one that needs attention,
but you know how us bus people are :)
