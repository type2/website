Subject: Fw: [T2] Carb Mixture

 I have a single Weber progressive on my 78 2.l in a 76 Westy. I have
hesitation in low RPM range, but it picks up nicely once the RPMs increase.
What can I do to remedy this?
 
 All others factors are ok (timing, valves, etc)
I don't have the cash right now to upgrade to dual carbs, and I don't have
the resources to go back to FI.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Nik
