Subject: Wheel Bearing Identification

I recently bought a what was supposed to be a bus rear wheel bearing 
(211 501 283) for a couple of bucks.  Well, it turned out not to be 
that at all.  It looks to me like an early bus or bug inner front wheel 
bearing.  It's old enough to have balls instead of rollers.  It does 
have some identifying markings: The initials 'FKC' and the number 
'17304'.

Here is my question:  Is there a database somewhere which identifies 
bearing applications by the numbers marked on the bearings, maybe with 
a cross reference to VW part numbers?

Or does someone have this same bearing and happen to know what VW part 
number it corresponds to?

Thanks in advance,

Kabayo
