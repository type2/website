Ok its Friday:

Did he say that? That seems like rubbish to me. He wanted a car that could 
appeal to the masses, wouldnt overheat, or freeze, got high mileage, and was 
affordable.

As far as looks go, if you look at any 1930's era car its about the same 
only smaller.

I saw this on the news, and then read it here, and I just have to say, FIRE 
that reporter.

If I am wrong I will eat me words.

Um what do digital bits taste like? I guess I want a byte.
