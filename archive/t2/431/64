Ted,
If your trans is automatic---it's red.
If it's stick--it's black---
But it shouldn't be--if the idiot in Arlington changed it---
Gear oil is light tan or kinda clear like your engine oil--only
thicker--
Smell it---gear oil has a distinctive aroma--
Rub some of th oil betwen your finger's--you'll know if it's gear oil or
not.
If the trans seal is leaking--next thing to expect--clutchation
slippation.

You have much bigger gonads than I---

Arlinton Ht's. IL. to Pa. in a 76 Bus ?? --your one heck of a guy---:>)

Later,

I'm about half way through my first major road trip with my 76 Westy.
She is running like a champ. No problems and she even handles the hills
in PA. However, upon arriving in Philadelphia I've discovered a leak and
I'm not sure where it is coming from. I changed the oil and filter
before I left so the oil is a nice light brown color after 955 miles.
The leak that I have is dark black and is coming from the front (front
being the front of the bus) of the engine. It looks like it may be
coming from between the engine and the tranny. Isn't tranny fluid red?
My mechanic supposedly changed the tranny fluid out last September.
Anyways, I haven't had any issues with the engine overheating, nor have
I had any problems with the clutch. I'm wondering what I'm losing and
how would be the best way to determine exactly what the fluid is. I'm in
Bensalem, PA for the week so if someone wouldn't mind giving me a hand
that would be awesome. I'm still learning how to take care of my bus.
Thanks in advance,
