Subject: RE: [T2] PopTop Refinished...body paint question

I checked the Camper and Commercial Magazine and found out that the paint is
called coach paint or coachworks enamel. I have read that Tekaliod
(spelling?) is the best. According to the mag this stuff can be applied just
as good as a sprayed job if done right. 

Their is actually a bus that has an awesome paint job on it featured in the
magazine and it was all done by hand. So it looks like it can yield quality
results if the time is taken to do it right. This type of painting does seem
to be bigger in Europe. They do recommend some practice for the novice to
get the feel for the time the paint takes to flow and to dry. 

I might try this for my old Chevy which has a strip of gray around the
bottom. Good place to practice, if I can get my hands on the paint. It is
also supposed to be cheaper than most other paints.

Hope this helps.
