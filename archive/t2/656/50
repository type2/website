My Paint experience;



My personal experience has been the higher the temp the better. The
automotive paint sold at Napa and Shucks works well. I think it is
called Hi-Temp Engine Paint, and comes in colors such as Chevy Orange,
etc... Multiple coats are needed to make it look pretty, and don't use
the painted part until fully cured otherwise it will bubble and peel
really quickly.
