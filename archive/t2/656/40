Yes, about 10 gauge.  I'm surprised that the shop didn't notice that the
wire wasn't routed back through the firewall to the starter (and that I
didn't catch it).  I'll slide under the bus tomorrow and double check to see
if all of the wires are on the starter.

Does anyone havea suggestion for how to route the wire through the firewall
to the starter?  I mean that I can probably figure it out, but wiser heads
than mine have already done this many times.

I use mostly polyurethanes, of different hardnesses.  From a rubbery texture
to rock-hard.  Heat can affect them, especially if they're thin in
cross-section.  I don't have the facilities for melting down and molding
polyethylene.  I believe that polyethylene is injection molded.
