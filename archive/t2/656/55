The reason I went with them was my new CDI ignition ... I was worried 
about radio noise because of the non-resistor rotor, and these wires 
were described as the ones to use to suppress that noise.

Yah, it was a bit of work -- like I said, that was the only part that 
annoyed me about them.

Anyway, once I get the new plugs in next weekend, we'll see if all the 
effort was worth it :-)
