Subject: Re: [T2] Starter bushing in tranny?

Craig said:

 I seemed to have misplaced the starter bushing. Yikes! I didn't even know
there was one until the  FLAPS rep asked me if I had one.  I aware of things
that fall from overhead and I'm pretty sure I'd have se3en or heard bushing
drop. I did a thoruogh sweep of the ground...nothing.

The archives hinted at the idea of the piece falling down in between the
flywheel, etc.  Is that possible?  I don't know.

The shaft of my starter has a collar that is 'circlipped' into the groove of
the  shaft.  The hole in the tranny case is the same size as the shaft. Can
someone please fill in the picture for me?

 Also, I'm curious and suspiciuos of the work that was done to this unit
when I took it to the Starter/Alternar Only Market. I fully expected the
re-worked unit to start when I put it in, but it sounded and seemed like it
was still doing the same thing. UUUUmmmm......

IF your starter bushing FELL out, you have bigger problems!

The bushing is pressed in the trans bellhousing. It is a tight fit.

The bushing is pictured here:

The collar on the shaft is the stop for the starter drive when it extends.

If your 'rebuilt' starter growls and turns slow when it is installed, you have one of 3 problems:
The starter was rebuilt crappily.
The bushing is worn out and the armature is rubbing on the pole shoes.
Or, the starter is a POS and you need to replace it with a NEW one.

I have given up on rebuilts, most are crap and don't last more than a month. Bus Depot used to offer a new one
for $99 that fit 76 to 1/81 buses. Works very well on both my 77 Westies.
