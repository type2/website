I'm not sure how similar the orig solex that come with the bus is to
the newer solex that CB Perf sells, but I can tell you I have the
below tool. It does not fit correctly (i.e., the smallest od of the
tapered part is still larger than the carb throat. However Instead of
an adapter that goes on the inside of the throat you need one that
will fit well around the outside (like the air filter connection).
Reason is the choke plate seems to get in the way.

gosh vauge is a nice way to put it :) I've been contemplating just
using a pvc pipe adapter with rubber grommits to make up the
difference, but haven't needed to sync them since thinking about it.
