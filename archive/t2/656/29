Subject: Timing

Ok so here it is - were finally bolted back together, almost.

I have checked that No1 is at TDC - both tappets loose.  Timing mark on
pully is at zero (from library). Timing mark on dizzy is lined up at #1.
 BUT my dizzy is pointing at South West - NOT South east like in the book.

I moved the leads to match the dizzy and it works for a few seconds then
stops.

Am I OK to keep working on this, refining the timing and sorting out the
(rebuilt) carbs or am I missing something??

Its a dual solex, 1800, 1973.  Newly rebuilt engine (professional) rebuilt
carbs (me).

Thanks
John
