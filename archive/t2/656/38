Hi Don,

Gerald sounds right on. If nothing he suggested checks out, I'd say
you have a dangerous wiring short situation that could cause a fire if
not found. With your battery discharging so fast, you may already have
melted wire insulation that needs to be found.

I don't remember what year your bus is, but on earlier models, you
could remove the hot wire from the coil and run a direct jump from
battery to coil positive and drive temporarily on that. Don't think
you can get away with it on fuel injected models.

 Now that I"m more relaxed and have a few Cap'n & Cokes in me, I'm
 thinking more clearly. . . heh  What is the possibility of me having
 shorted a wire while messing with the wipers and blowing either the
 regulator or the goodies in the alternator? (I've got this image of a
 burned out diode or bridge rectifier in my head that won't leave...)
 The only thing that keeps me from being sure is the fact that I *do*
 get dash lights under some conditions. Many of my tests were done with
 the Volvo running and jumper cables attached. So I definitely had
 current available. But something's sucking it up...
