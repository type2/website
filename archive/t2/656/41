Sounds like it is already attached to the battery cable? I thought the
other end was hanging loose. If so, it goes through a hole in the tin.
Supposed to be a rubber grommet in the tin to protect it, but this is
often missing and should be installed, or at least something else,
like fuel hose, used to protect the wire.

 About 10 ga?  Hooks to the battery terminal of the starter and yes,
 that's what charges the battery.
 
 Yes, about 10 gauge.  I'm surprised that the shop didn't notice that the
 wire wasn't routed back through the firewall to the starter (and that I
 didn't catch it).  I'll slide under the bus tomorrow and double check to see
 if all of the wires are on the starter.
 
 Does anyone havea suggestion for how to route the wire through the firewall
 to the starter?  I mean that I can probably figure it out, but wiser heads
 than mine have already done this many times.
