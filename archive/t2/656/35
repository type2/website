Hey John, 

Go by where the rotor is pointing when at #1 TDC, not by which way the
dizzy is pointing.

Your drive shaft is just out of sync, but that doesn't matter. The
important thing is that you know that when you are at #1 TDC your
rotor points at #1 spark plug wire.

Then plug in the rest of the wires per firing order, clockwise direction.

If you have this straight, you still may have to tweak the timing a
bit to get it to idle. A jumper to the starter solenoid is handy for
this so you can make your starting attempts from the engine
compartment instead of having to go forward to the key.

If in doubt about your cards, work the throttle to see that your
accelerator pumps are putting out gas. Spray some carb cleaner down
the throat for a prime to see if it fires off that.

I've never had luck rebuilding stock carbs. I end up adjusting the
idle speed screws way high to get them running, and then they have no
power, so I end up canning them for a better carb.

 I have checked that No1 is at TDC - both tappets loose.  Timing mark on
 pully is at zero (from library). Timing mark on dizzy is lined up at #1.
  BUT my dizzy is pointing at South West - NOT South east like in the book.
 
 I moved the leads to match the dizzy and it works for a few seconds then
 stops.
 
 Am I OK to keep working on this, refining the timing and sorting out the
 (rebuilt) carbs or am I missing something??
 
 Its a dual solex, 1800, 1973.  Newly rebuilt engine (professional) rebuilt
 carbs (me).
 
 Thanks
 John
