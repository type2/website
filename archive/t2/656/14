Hi Sami,

I've been running with 1.8L L-Jet FI in the westfakia for about 6000 
miles.

The 1.8L FI is definitely "close enough". The computer is designed to 
produce mixture based on airflow, and if the airflow is 10% higher, the 
ECU will provide more fuel to compensate. There is some risk that you 
could wind up in a lean condition when running at WOT, but since that 
is well beyond the useful operating range of a 1.8L installed in a bus 
I don't think it's a problem. YMMV.

Interestingly, the 2L engined buses got an increase in top-speed gear 
ratio that halved the difference in airflow between the 1.8 and 2L 
displacement at a given highway speed. So the difference in fuel 
metering is *probably* even less than the 10% difference in 
displacement would indicate. Only the VW engineers know for certain, 
but the empirical evidence shows that the setup is close enough for my 
needs.

Happy trails,
