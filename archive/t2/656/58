Uhhh...

This is a reply to all of the messages about which paint to use on
cylinders. 

For general info, paint is a pretty darn good insulator. The cylinders are
an integral part of the cooling system and are designed to have air flowing
over them to remove heat from the pistons.

Gonna be hard for the air to do its job when the heat is trapped under
"multiple coats" of insulating paint.

If I remember correctly from browsing the sermons and reading several VW
lists over the years the *REASON* Bob H. suggested getting any old black
paint and "cutting it with gasoline" was because he didn't reccomend
PAINTING the cylinders, only using a "color wash", as thin as possible, to
make them look good. A black wash will show the dirt brought in by the
cooling air less drastically over time than any other color.

A pretty painted engine might run great for 10s of thousands of miles. But
you're adding heat where it's not necessary and if some other, relatively
insignificant, part performs in a marginal manner that little bit of extra
heat could be the difference between a 5,000 mile rebuild and a 50,000 mile
rebuild. 

*Opinion* -- Painted engines should be reserved for trailer queens and
seldom driven "show dragsters". Same with all the chrome toys advertised by
the rags.
