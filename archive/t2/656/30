back into the mechanic thing.)  The only thing I've been able to find is
maybe the voltage regulator is shot...

A long time ago I asked the list about a stray wire in the engine
compartment.  I noticed it after I brought the bus home from an engine
replacement.

It's a heavy red wire coming from the hole in the tin on the right, just
behind the alternator and passenger side heater inlet.  When I got the bus
back, I was surprised to see this and another wire loose and not connected
to anything.  I wire tied them out of the way to keep them safe and really
didn't think anything else about them.

But now I am.  I looked at the color wire chart for my bus and there is a
red wire coming from the alternator, but I'm not sure where it's supposed to
go as the wire doesn't reach any point outside the engine compartment.

Could this be the culprit?  I can imagine the mechanic forgetting to hook it
back up, common enough mistake.  This is a heavy red wire with a round flat
connector (with a hole in it) on the end, the sort that would be held in
place by a screw.
