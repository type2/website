Does anyone have info on smoke generators?  These are used in theatrical 
productions as well as photographic set-up shots.

Anything that creates smoke might be used around a running engine's intake 
components.  Of course, there is some risk involved in using a lighted 
cigarette.... tho I've seen it done.  A non-flammable smoke source would be 
better.  Maybe the model train guys have an idea [Seuthe??]??

....One trick woodwind instrument repair people use to look for a leak is to 
blow smoke into the "sealed" instrument and look for escaping smoke.
