Yah, I am planning on calling Mallory tomorrow to ask about that.

I'm not sure the distortion of the casing is actually caused by 
"melting until it's liquid"... the bottom of the casing is still pretty 
stiff... I think maybe the top hatch is pressing on the casing a 
little, and thus distorting the softened plastic.

In any case, I do want to find out if it's normal for it to be that hot.
