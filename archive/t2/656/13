Subject: Bushing news

Yes indeed !  A bushing pressed into the bellhousing. I had envisioned the
bushing pressed onto the shaft.

The bushing doesn't appear to be buggered in any way .

The starter, when under 12 V ,  goes.." cclick.........clik, clik clic",
then stops. Maxxed out, I suppose. I'll do some more work and post the
outcomes.

Thanks for the imput, Craig
