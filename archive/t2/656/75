Subject: RE: [T2] Brazil new buses

They are neat but I prefer my old GERMAN produced buses. The Brazillian VWs 
just don't compare to the German VWs. Take a look at the Foxes, I wonder how 
many running Foxes I've seen for under 500.00. There's a reason for that, 
they are inferior to their German counterparts even of the same year.
