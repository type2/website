Subject: Aurora Super Mag Plus wires

Hi folks...

I installed some of the Super Mag Plus wires that aircooled.net sells 
today.  They seem like very nice wires, except for one very annoying 
problem: they come with the wrong plug ends for a Type 4 engine.

I ordered the wire set for Type 4 engines with the stock cooling tin 
(there is also a wire set for Type 4 with DTM).  All the wires are the 
correct length, but they did not come with the bakelite extensions 
needed (especially on #2 and #4) to reach the plugs through the tin.  
The aircooled.net online catalog mentions this fact (it says "use your 
old ones"), but, well, read on.

Fortunately, I picked up several spare plug connectors on my last 
junkyard trip.  Unfortunately, I had to somewhat butcher the new wires 
to get them on:

1. The Aurora wires have plug connectors that are crimped onto the 
wire.  You have to grease the boot, slide it back, pry off the 
crimped-on connector, and trim the end of the wire so that the 
extension can screw onto the end of the wire.

2. The wire jacket is a little too big to go into the bakelite 
extension.  You have to trim some of the jacket back so that it fits, 
otherwise you can't screw the extension on far enough.

The end result looks ok, it just just a bit of work to retrofit them so 
that they would work with a Type 4 engine.  I was not expecting to have 
to do this after ordering the Type 4 wire kit.  It would have been 
better if the wire set simply lacked a plug end at all, so that one 
could simply screw on their old extensions.  (Even better -- include 
new extensions like other plug wire sets do!)

Anyway, the engine seems to run fine with them (and my now-working 
CDI).  I have not yet installed the new 0.045"-gapped NGK plugs ... 
next weekend's project.

I decided to compare the resistance of the old Bosch OEM-style wires 
with the new Aurora wires.  Note that #1 and #3 have short extensions, 
and #2 and #4 have long extensions.

      OLD WIRE        NEW WIRE        DIFFERENCE
#1   970 ohm         1670 ohm        +700 ohm
#2   1460 ohm        2220 ohm        +760 ohm
#3   950 ohm         1650 ohm        +700 ohm
#4   1550 ohm        2050 ohm        +500 ohm
coil 7720 ohm        390 ohm         -7330 ohm

In both cases, the longer plug extension adds ~500 ohms to the wire's 
resistance.

But, the Aurora wires seem to have a bit more resistance to them... not 
something I expected from high-performance wires.

But check out the difference in the coil->distributor wire!  Is the old 
Bosch wire specifically designed to add that much resistance, or was my 
old one just worn out (it was only a year old)?  I measured the old one 
3 times just to make sure I got it right.

Anyway, unless I am misunderstanding something, I still should come out 
"ahead" in terms of total current to the plug.

Does anyone with high-performance wires on their engine have resistance 
specs they can share?
