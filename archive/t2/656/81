Subject: Re: [T2] Depressing afternoon working on the bus...

I've never had to pull my wiper motor...I'm not hoping to either. It sounds 
like some preventive maintenance would be in order. Can someone give a 
procedure for lubing important points preferably while the motor is still in 
place? Like for example spraying white grease spray up from below or into 
the shafts from outside? Or is it only a remove and dissassemble deal?

Are you saying that's ironic?

That's what motors do when they can't move. My electricity theory is rusty
but iirc the back emf keeps the motor from accelerating and drawing excess
amounts of current.
