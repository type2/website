Subject: paint for cylinders.

I'm doing the top end on my 75 and was going to give the cylinders a
coat of paint. Do I need to pick up paint for a specific temperature
range? I purchased some up-to-450-degrees-F black for my kiln frame, 
but don't know whether or not this is adequate for the cylinders. 

Digging back through the sermons, Mr. Hoover mentions buying the 
cheapest glossy black paint available and cutting it with gasoline 
for a flat surface. However, the labels on the cheap stuff say not to
use them for applications which will exceed 200 degrees F.

May I solicit recommendations for good paint for my fresh from the
machine shop cylinders (why do I feel like such the dirty old man when I
refer to them as jugs...)?

Thanks in advance,

jack
