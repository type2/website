Subject: Re: [T2] paint for cylinders.

I just finished reading Fisher. He says actual tests show up to 80
degrees off the hottest points on the cylinder when painted flat
black.

He just says a thin coat of flat black enamel or stove pipe paint. He
says to avoid any paint that claims insulating properties like an
exhaust paint. A subsequent chapter recommends black anodizing.
