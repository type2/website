Subject: Service along California's Central Coast?

Seeking recommendations for air-cooled repair guys along US 101 in the 
San Fernando Valley, to Ventura, Santa Barbara, Santa Maria, Pismo, San 
Luis Obispo, San Simeon, then up Highway 1 all the way to Big Sur. I 
have the opportunity to take the Wonderbus up the coast a week from now. 
Reckon it would be smart to bring a list of places where broken bits can 
be repaired.
