Subject: Quick help needed: 73 WON'T START!!!!

I must have jacked something up yesterday when messing with the wiper
motor. After I had reassbmbled everything I made sure the bus would
start. No problem.

Then this morning, family waiting, it won't start. Acts like a dead
battery. Jumping does nothing. Test light glows strongly at battery
(my multimeter got ruined in the rain).

Tested the big fat black wire to the coil. Guess what? I'm getting GROUND! WTF? 

None of the wires under the dash are shorting as far as I can tell. I
tugged and wiggled and everything looks as good as possible
considering the rats nest the wiring was when I got the bus.

I shouldn't be getting ground on the positive side of the coil, right?
(I know, but I feel so frustrated, I could be losing my mind...)

I pulled the wire and ran a jumper from the positive side of the coil
to the battery, still no juice.

Bentley doesn't say, but is there a fuse somewhere else in the
ingition circuit that may have blown? All fuses in the fuse block look
fine...
