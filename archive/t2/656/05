Subject: RE: [T2] Dumb Thermostat/Heat Flaps Question

Thanks to you all, I know understand how the air flaps should work.  My next
task is to get under the bus, remove some stuff and check out the
thermostat, cable and pulley.  Can't fit bus in garage and it's getting cold
outside - so it'll have to wait 'til spring.  At least I now know that the
flaps are open - very important.

My list of spring projects is growing :-)

I hope you all had a great thanksgiving and wish you all a happy holiday
season.
