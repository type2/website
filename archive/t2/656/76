There is a better reason. The oem wires are not insulated enough for CDI
with the plug gap open. You can get arcing from the wires to the tin and
case.
When I ran a cdi I never opened the plug gaps. Doing so increases the
spark voltage because it takes more V to jump the bigger gap.

Do you have a modified rotor with the resistor jumped out? The resistor
will break down in time with the cdi running. You can modify it yourself
or I think Aircooled sells them already done.
