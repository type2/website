Don,
      If you look at an electric motor and an electric generator from a 
distance, they appear quite alike.  If you spin a DC, permanent-magnet-field 
motor such as your wiper motor, it IS a generator.  The idea of "back EMF" is 
that when a motor is running at speed, it creates a voltage opposite to the 
voltage applied, thus reducing the amount of current being drawn.

In other words, if your wiper motor cannot get up to speed, it will draw more 
current than its windings were designed to dissipate.  The suggestion that you 
free-up the motor until it spins nicely is exactly correct!

FWIW there was heated debate maybe 100 years ago about electric starters.  The 
engineers said the starter motor would burn out if it were run constantly under 
the high load of rotating a cold engine's crankshaft etc.  They were right... 
except that you don't run a starter (under reasonable conditions) for very 
long.  It can and should cool down between usage intervals.

Wonder why Diesel-electric locomotives start their trains so smoothly?  No back 
EMF at rest means large current through the traction motors, meaning high 
initial tractive force -- just what you need to get a train moving after a 
station stop :-))

End physics 101.  Now go free up that wiper motor!

If you have the motor out, why not dissasseble it to see if maybe
you've got binding bushings you could lubricate, or burned brushes and
armatures you could clean and otherwise generally refurbish it if
there is no permanent damage like burned out windings?

If Richard hasn't gotten back to you yet, it's electro-magnetic force.
