...as long as they're not solid-core wires -- Mallory says specifically 
not to use solid-core wires with the HyFire.  I may pick up a set of 
Big V8 non-resistance wires, modify them, throw them in, and see what 
happens.

I haven't measured the resistance on the old rotor to compare to the 
new one yet (I'll do that tonight and follow-up to the list).  But I 
know that those bakelite extensions definitely add resistance to the 
plug wires (they're even marked with a resistance value), and there's 
pretty much no way to avoid using them on a Type 4 engine with a stock 
tin configuration.
