Subject: which is better?

Hi,

I have two manual transmissions that I have taken out of two different '73
Bays that I own - both start with 002, but one is a 3 rib and one is a 5
rib. If both work equally well - which one would be a better choice for
highway driving? or do they have the same gearing?

 

Rob
