Sounds to me like it could perhaps be a fouled plug or something wrong 
with the distributor cap. I.E. not a very good spark at all but #3 plug. 
It's also possible there is something more major like burnt valves or 
something wrong with a head. If new plugs don't work out, I would 
consider doing a quick compression test to verify the engine is 
mechanically correct.
