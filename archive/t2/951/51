Hey,
 
The chemical properties of water states, a melting ice cube will stay at 32 degrees F (that's 0 degrees C) until all of the ice cube is liquid.
 
Using this property, it should be better not drain the water due the thermal mass of the system will maintain the temperature of the cooler better and longer.
