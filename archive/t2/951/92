Subject: Re: [T2] Backfiring and not start - suggestions sought

The backfiring could be from the lean condition of yet
another massive vacuum leak or it could be
cross-firing in the distributor cap from moisture or
cross-firing between sparkplug wires. It could have
even been caused by a drop of water making its' way
through the fuel system but I find that unlikely.

You are accustomed to having one or another vacuum
hose blow off, so I'm sure you know that you need to
actually grab hold of each end of each one and check
that it really is firmly attached because the
preformed hoses appear to be attached when they are
not.

One that usually gets overlooked is the air bypass
valve hoses which are buried and take on so much heat
over the years that the entire undersides blow out. I
have seen several such cases. Check every hose for
decay / cracking / splitting.

If you still have the decel valve, it and the hoses
connecting are also likely. -BaH

 on a '78 FI 2.0 liter stick USA..
 
 Coming out from work to my parked VW, I got a small
 backfire and the VW
 would not start.  It would catch but not run.
 
 Obviously, my brake booster line blew off my air
 mixture box, or my AFM vane
 blew off its track, or I developed a massive vacuum
 leak as a result of the
 backfire...
 
 Well, the brake booster line was solid and all the
 vacuum lines were intact,
 so I tried an experiment [perhaps the brake booster
 line blew off AFTER the
 one-way valve - doubtful...] .  I pulled the brake
 booster line off the air
 mixture box and put in a rubber cork.
 
 When i tried to start the VW again, I got another
 larger backfire (this was
 only the second one from when I left my office).
 
 I did get a few more revs of the engine before the
 second backfire, but not
 enough to even count.
 
 I have a vacuum gauge setup at the driver's area and
 I could see at least 5
 (psi or inches or whatever) before it would die
 after it caught before.
