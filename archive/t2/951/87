Subject: Backfiring and not start - suggestions sought

on a '78 FI 2.0 liter stick USA..

Coming out from work to my parked VW, I got a small backfire and the VW
would not start.  It would catch but not run.

Obviously, my brake booster line blew off my air mixture box, or my AFM vane
blew off its track, or I developed a massive vacuum leak as a result of the
backfire...

Well, the brake booster line was solid and all the vacuum lines were intact,
so I tried an experiment [perhaps the brake booster line blew off AFTER the
one-way valve - doubtful...] .  I pulled the brake booster line off the air
mixture box and put in a rubber cork.

When i tried to start the VW again, I got another larger backfire (this was
only the second one from when I left my office).

I did get a few more revs of the engine before the second backfire, but not
enough to even count.

I have a vacuum gauge setup at the driver's area and I could see at least 5
(psi or inches or whatever) before it would die after it caught before.
[sorry if I 'm not making sense].  % psa/inches is enough to run the VW, as
I have experienced in the past when I had a vacuum line that I forgot to
attach and I was reading this minimal vacuum.

So, what's causing the backfiring??  I bought three more rubber corks so I
have a bit of leeway in my experimenting.  The original cork is no where to
be found!!

The VW Westy is near the Eisenhower Metro station in Alexandria Virginia, if
anyone is local and would like to share the discovery experience Monday, the
President;s holiday, or next weekend, when the weather might be warmer.
