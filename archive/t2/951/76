The A means special designation which could mean that they were
modified just for VW and hence only available through VW channels or
vendors with access to those parts from Mexico.

Try searching for 101 000 047AA (pack of 4).

I've also seen 101 000 047AB but I'm not sure what you get.

You'll find BP5ES (stock# 7832) in circulation where NGK plugs are
carried.

 From the Mexican FI manual:

Spark Plugs  NGK BP5ES-A (3/4 thread length); Champion N12Y
(VW part # 101 000 047 AA  set of 4)
Plug electrode gap 0.7 mm (0.028)
