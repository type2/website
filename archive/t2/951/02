Subject: Interior heat should be independent of the thermostat ??

I'm just sitting here wondering why my 77 Westy has such poor heat inside. My auxiliary fan mounted above the engine in the engine shroud blows great air up to the front of the van, but it is barely warm. If I drive on the freeway for 1/2 hr., it gets warmer. My thought was that the thermostat which has failed, is the culprit, but wait a minute! 
The heat is produced in the heat exchangers, which blow the exhaust heated air forward, so the thermostat has nothing to do with this does it? Hmmm, I am really perplexed about this one. I wonder what else it could be? I am assuming that with the amount of air blowing out when I turn on the fan, there are no holes in the large pipe that runs under the van, or I wouldn't get such air??
Hmmm,
Courtney
