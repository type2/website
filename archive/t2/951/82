I had the Kooleraire product and really liked it.. it kept the beer and my
tent cool..  

The thing about this cooler is that when I used it in Arizona (a very dry
climate, near Phoenix) it worked well, but when I moved to Maryland (a much
more humid climate near DC) and tried it there, it really stopped working at
all.  It would blow cold, but really didn't cool anything.

I do have a complete aftermarket AC designed for the Baywindow.. complete
unit was bought for $3500.. yeah I know.. not cheap.. 

Bit, I'd sell it for $2800..  anyone interested?

Dave.
