Subject: Type-1 problem with zamboni engine and propane

folks, gotta friend with a bad zamboni. It has a good
boston bob engine, single port and runs propane. It
cleared almost the whole ice and then 10' from the
gate started to sputter and finally die at the gate.
it idles ok, but as soon as it gets gas, it dies.
Kaput. it will run with any one plug wire removed,
othre than #3. when #3 is out, it dies. This is
propane, otherwise i would suggest it was a fuel
filter (filters on propane??) I know nothing about
propane engines. He maintains it has a full tank of
fuel. The thing is, it wsa parked for 2 weeks prior to
use ,if htat helps. hmmmm.
thanks
mp
