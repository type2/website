Subject: Re: [T2] which is better?

I beg to differ ... I went from an early to a late (091) trans in my '74 for
one main reason: bring down RPMs on the highway and it does just that.

In 4th at 4000 RPM it is difference of 10 km/h (or about 6.5 mph): 108
(68-73 trans) vs. 117 (76-79 trans).

Now, there are special cases: like the early trans with a .77 or .82 final
drive. But unless you hit the lottery, your early trans will have a .89
final drive. Supposedly, there is something like a "pyramid" case early
trans that is likely to have the desirbale tall final drive.

But David is right about towing. With the old trans I rarely had shift down
into third when towing cars on the highway. Now, I somtimes have to go into
third uphill. But if you don't use your bus for towing heavy loads (I am
talking car + tow dolly), then the 091 is great because you can cruise at 80
mph without feeling guilty of over-reving your engine ...

They will be virtually the same for highway driving (4th gear).  Around
town (gears 1-3), the 5-rib tranny is significantly taller;   That is,
you will go about 10% faster in every gear except 4th with the 5-rib.

I'd recommend the 5-rib unless you need a stump-pulling 1st gear.
