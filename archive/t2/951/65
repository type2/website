Subject: Looking for Shop in LAX Area

Help!  I'm looking for a good auto repair shop that works on air-cooled VWs,
specifically my 78 bus.  The bus is currently down in Bell Canyon (north LA),
California.  Right now I have it going to Alpha Omega Auto Repair in Conoga
Park, CA.  I looked up shops on The Samba site and the closest I could find
was Steve's Pit Stop in Simi Valley, CA.  Does anyone know either of these?
Is there another in the area that I can count on?

Thanks.
