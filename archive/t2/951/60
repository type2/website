Subject: Re: [T2] My Daughter Wants to Go to Bonnaroo

There are sooo many reasons I'd advise you to chain her to the bed for the weekend.  I'm not far away but wouldn't go if even if I had an 18 yr old girlfriend.  But if she goes, buy her a set of rubber boots and rain gear.  That place is a mud hole most of the time.  And tell her you're going to give her a drug test when she gets home.  Cheers....KR

My sweet girl has declared her intention to go to Bonnaroo with her boyfriend. Her boyfriend  is 18. If she is going to go to Bonnaroo with a boy, then I guess he will do. There are worse boys. She has always been very provincial but now lately she wants to have Adventures. (Room to make the big mistakes, as those lovely girls on the record put it.) The day had to come. I am sad and broody about it but the day did have to come.

Anyway. If there are any kind souls on these lists who plan to go to Bonnaroo, and who might let these teenagers caravan with you and maybe you could let them park near you, and maybe glance their way every once in a while and see that no harm comes to them beyond what is self-inflicted, I would be grateful. I'm sure they would think it very cool to camp with some Volks for a while.

Off-list messages would be great. They would be headed to Manchester from the west. Thanks,
