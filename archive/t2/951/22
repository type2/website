OK---

How used was it before you bolted it up?

I have never see a coil do the Lucky Luciano concrete shoe mambo brand
new outa the box.

This sounds like a used , abused, & hung out wet to dry  part caper. 

If it was new--I'd be tossing it through the parts guys front window.
He'll understand why.

Bolting up used parts is no reason to cry out loud.
