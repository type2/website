Hi Matt,

I would check the points. If they have closed up you might not be  
getting enough dwell to build a decent spark at speeds higher than  
idle. The fact that it won't run without #3 supports this, since IIRC  
the type1 dizzy retards #3, giving it a longer dwell by default.

If the ignition system checks out OK, I would start looking for a  
propane specialist top check out the fuel system.


Happy Trails,
