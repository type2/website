Subject: Stinky Upholstery

I picked up a beautiful pair of seats from a Vanagon last week. The
upholstery is in good shape, and the foam is still intact. They were
dirty, but I figured a few hours of quality time with the Little Green
Clean Machine would take care of that.

Well, I got them to look reasonably clean (some stains that I could
still work on), but they STINK. I think the guy had a dog that peed on
them and it soaked into the foam. There was quite a bit of short fur
in the cracks.

Any suggestions? Or should I toss them?
