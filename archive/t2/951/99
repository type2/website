Subject: Will type 2's ever get there?

I just saw a red and white 1964 21 window go for $41,000 at The RM Classic 
Car Auction in Monterey CA. The show aired at 11am Sunday, Feb. 18.

That bus looked enough like my 76 Westy to claim at least brother or 
sisterhood.  For years I have believed that my bus is a very worthy 
vehicle, and I'm keeping it in good shape because I enjoy driving it now 
and then. I've owned it since the 80's. Much like this forum, the auction 
reinforces my hope/belief that I'm not irrationally eccentric and some kind 
of nut. I might even have a good financial investment. It sits outside 
under two feet of drifted snow, but in a few months that will all be gone. 
Then I'm gonna fix that surface rust on the driver side, along the 
rockers.....and maybe this is the year for the expensive paint.  Thanks for 
all your support, Terry....and the dozens of others that contribute to this 
forum.
