You may want to look into getting yourself a window mounted vintage swamp
cooler. They work like a charm and save a ton of headache. There are a TON
on eBay every spring/summer.

Installing an A/C system can be the biggest PITA mod you can do to your VW.
Not impossible, but if they are as hard to install as to remove from a
bus...yikes!
