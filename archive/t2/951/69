Correct.

Not for certain.  You also have to consider the thermal conductivity and
heat convection properties of the water.  The ice may well last longer
without the better heat path afforded by the water.

OTOH, with the cooler drained, the temperature of the air inside the
cooler might be higher than it would be with water in the cooler.

Do I feel an experiment coming on?
