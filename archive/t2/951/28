<<You may want to look into getting yourself a window mounted vintage
swamp cooler. They work like a charm and save a ton of headache. There
are a TON on eBay every spring/summer.>>

Jon,

How right you are.

The swamp cooler's work very well, as long as you are living / traveling
in the Gobi, Sahara, Painted, or Death Valley desert's.

If he was living in New Orleans, Louisville, New York, Chicago, Omaha,
Houston or Biloxi  he could very well have a side business growing
sphagnum moss from his headliner.  

Swamp cooler's are only for dry heat--no or low humidity area's.

Unless you enjoy the green stuff hanging.

There was also a floor mount swamp cooler made for a Bus or Van way back
when.
You could fill it up with ice and water, and it recirculated the cool
air with the windows closed.

It aslo was able to keep a couple of beverages cool as the inside of the
vehicle got cooled down.

I have a couple of them available  .
