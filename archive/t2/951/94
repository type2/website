Subject: Re: [T2] which is better? (Rib Count Confusion!)

I'm sorry if I started the confusion! I just went out
and counted my ribs and all of mine are 6-ribbers. All
these years I thought they were 5's and that whenever
someone referred to a 5-ribber they were referring to
an 091. The original poster did point out that they
were both 002, so I should have paid closer attention!
Good thing Schwarze caught it. -BaH
