Subject: Bosch sucks a***

So much for Bosch blue coils. This one was in my vanagon two whole freakin'
days when I go to start the bus and the thing does a Jimmy Hoffa. Nothing.
Nada. Check the voltages, everything's OK, points working, but the coil
resistance has gone waay up and of course no spark. The made in Mexico
sticker didn't give me much confidence, but I expected a few more miles.
No i didn't connect it wrong, nor did I leave the ignition to on. It was
running fine when I parked, and when I went to start it, no go.

I'm wondering if I should shoehorn an integra coil in there. Last one of
those gave me almost 300,000k
