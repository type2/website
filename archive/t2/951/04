Going totally from experience, no science or proof involved, I am getting a lot more heat with a functioning thermostat AND the tin that covers it.

I feel only a little air before starting my engine from the extra fan ('77) but the faster it revs the better it blows, which makes sense because it gets help from the motor.

I think that the issue is that the heater boxes hang in the wind and can easily be cooled down on the outside as you travel, having the tin and the thermostat means that at least the side of the heat exchanger towards the engine will be in a warm environment, without both the tin and thermostat it is getting cooled all over the outside, which is a much larger area than the exhaust has on the inside.
