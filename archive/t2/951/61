Subject: Re: [T2] Type-1 problem with zamboni engine and propane

Okay, I'll bite. You led us to believe that it was
running with all the current setup two weeks ago and
it was parked, and now, with no changes in anything,
it doesn't run right. Was it running properly in the
ice rink environment? In the COLD environment? My
suspicion is that the carburetor is icing up, but you
did not address any black smoke and I'm sure you would
have mentioned that. The propane tank - it was filled.
Was it filled on the machine or taken somewhere to be
filled? If it was filled in a vertical plane and is
mounted to the machine in a horizontal plane, there
may not be enough space for gas - that is, you may be
getting liquid flowing instead of gas. Other than
that, a thorough check of the ignition system, all
vacuum lines, and make sure the carburetor component
parts are all snugly bolted. Let us know what you find
out. -BaH

 folks, gotta friend with a bad zamboni. It has a
 good
 boston bob engine, single port and runs propane. It
 cleared almost the whole ice and then 10' from the
 gate started to sputter and finally die at the gate.
 it idles ok, but as soon as it gets gas, it dies.
 Kaput. it will run with any one plug wire removed,
 othre than #3. when #3 is out, it dies. This is
 propane, otherwise i would suggest it was a fuel
 filter (filters on propane??) I know nothing about
 propane engines. He maintains it has a full tank of
 fuel. The thing is, it wsa parked for 2 weeks prior
 to
 use ,if htat helps. hmmmm.
 thanks
