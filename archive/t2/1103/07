Subject: Re: [T2] engine woes....

is it possible there was a fuel system failure? running rich with turn the
oil black so fast, and the fuel mixing into the oil will wash out the
viscosity of the oil. fuel residue collects on the cylinder walls, the rings
do not clean it off. the oil is diluted further with more fuel on each
stroke, and carbon buildup ensues on subsequent combustion. Soon the oil has
lost enough lubrication properties that the bearings will seize.  Oddly
enough I JUST had this conversation two days ago with a friend who is an
aircraft engine builder. We were talking about electric chokes and how in an
aircraft engine running that rich will cause the need for an oil change at
least every 20 hours or you risk a catastrophic mid-air engine failure. It 
came up because ive just finished rebuilding a type I motor and have decided 
to remove the electric choke from the Solex PICT 30-3. The previous build 
had a weber dual barrel progresive. It was dumping so much extra fuel that 
the oil in that motor was black as a witches heart in three or four days of 
driving, and the girl who owns the bug only drives about 20 blocks to work 
and back in the evening.
