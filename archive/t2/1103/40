Hi Alan,

I went the other way in the summer of 2004, and it's been much smoother
sailing ever since.

My $.02:
1.  Get the FI manuals from www.ratwell.com and give them a solid
read-through.

2. Get yourself to Canadian Tire or your FLAPS and pick up a fuel pressure
gauge, a vacuum gauge, a volt-ohm meter and a 12V test light. With these
simple tools and the logic in the manuals you can sort out ANYTHING in the
FI system without spending yourself broke in the process.

There are some nifty test lights available now that have a buzzer as well
as light up; they can be very helpful for testing voltage where you can't
see the other end of the circuit. (fuel pump or starter, for instance)

FI will give you a much better combination of driveability, emissions,
fuel economy and power than available from any carb conversion can dream
of.
