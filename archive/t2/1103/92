Subject: Re: [T2] Steering box

I replaced mine with a good used one and it made all the difference in 
the world.  $75 on Ebarf.  Ron used to sell rebuilt ones at Bus Depot.   
I never realized how bad it was until I replaced it.  Best I remember, 
it is a sealed unit and doesn't need oil.  But I have a bad memory.  :)  
Good luck.  KR
