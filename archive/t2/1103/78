Subject: Re: [T2] Westfalia fiber glass insulation

Fiberglass insulation makes great mouse nests, as I have found when 
taking down the inside front roof panel or the rear hatch panel, and 
they can take it away from other hidden areas for nests.  Only plus is 
that it is not flammible. Solid foamboard (1" or 0.5") has much better 
r-value, can be glue-tacked in place (use gorilla glue!), but can be 
flammible or give off noxious fumes depending on which foam.
