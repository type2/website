Most of the early T-3's shipped to US were F.I., certainly by 68. I 
had one of those in the early 80's. They were notorious for poor 
grounding of the injectors at the cooling tin screws. Lots of people 
put Weber kits on them when the only problem was loose screws. That 
was a Bosch MPC (manifold pressure control) system. The T-4 injection 
was the next step system and used as well on the Porsche 914 with a 
separate dual set of points installed in the dizzy to time/signal the 
injectors. The first T-2 injection was another step, the first with the AFM.
