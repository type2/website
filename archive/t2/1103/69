This got sent to the wrong list so, belatedly, I now send it to youse

Maybe yes maybe no. You need to verify that the pressure relief valve
is functional. If the vaccum hose fell off of that, you would have
excess fuel pressure and no electronics would prevent excess fuel
delivery. Also, does this one have an oxy sensor?? If so, it can give
a false reading to the ECU and excess delivery is again possible. The
plugs will show excess mixture via black carbon deposits, and for way
over rich, will short out is short order. Raw fuel destroys the
insulators ability to insulate and no spark happens. Also verify that
the flap in the AFM is not hanging. They can stick and not return to
idle position. Very prudent as well to use the proper DTC plugs for
the injected engines to rule that out of the equation of non spec
synergy you got going on.

That strongly suggests that mixture adjustment won't fix anything.
Something else if foul.

Verify in order, mechanicals first (compression and balance, valve
adjustment) then spark energy and timing. Only when those are spec
will any fuel delivery adjustment have meaning.

No, rich or lean can happen with faults within either system.
