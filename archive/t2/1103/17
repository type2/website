Hi Mathew.  And thanks for this stuff.  Unfortunately, when you follow 
the link from the Samba site, you get a page saying that you've exceeded 
your monthly traffic quota.  Which means that there's a whole lot of 
downloading going on.  :)  And you might post a direct link here rather 
than referring to the Samba post.   Ciao....KR
