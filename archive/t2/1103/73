Exactly, that's why so many end up just swapping parts until they find it,
a very big waste of money on parts not needed. And parts swapping as a
"diagnostic" tool also will be found as standard procedure at just way too
many "professional" shops.

And certainly not just FI diagnostics. I had a fellow come to me just after
replacing 2 alternators, one starter, and a battery in the course of some 6
months. In 15 minutes I found and fixed the bad ground that caused it all.

A good guess will sometimes save money, but among any 5 guesss will be
the full range of good, bad and ugly.
