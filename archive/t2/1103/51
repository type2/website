 From the Bentley Manual, as produced by VWOA, ie, US production 
models, Brake Section, 1st paragraph:

"The 68 through 70 Type 2 VW's have four wheel drum brakes, while 71 
and later models have disc brakes at the front and drum brakes at the 
rear. On models with front disc brakes, the master cylinder is 
operated through a vacuum powered brake servo..... (snip) On vehicles 
with front disc brakes, there is a pressure regulator in the rear 
brake circuit..... (snip)"

That's official, but I know a few minutes ago, before I dug that out 
and read it, I would have said I have seen earilier T-2's with a booster.

I do know of a certainty that there are some US delivery chassis's 
with equipment installed in varience to the Bentleys. In the early 
70's I bought a lightly used  1969 T-2 utility van. It had a factory 
suitcase 1800cc motor with dual Solex carbs similar to the T-3 
1500-1600cc vehicles of the era 66 on. At that time I had never seen 
a Bentley. The Haynes manual I had then did show these carbs and gave 
adjustment procedures. This T-2 Bentley shows no specs whatever for 
that motor or those carbs. Officially, per VWOA, it never existed. 
These carbs were nothing like the later 72-74 PDSIT carbs. Nothing 
like them is shown in the T-2 Bentley.

Also, the Bentley for the T-3 is totally silent on carbs and shows 
only the FI system for US delivery which WAS far more common for US 
T-3's. But I know for a fact I have seen T-3's with factory dual 
carbs delivered to the US. The Haynes for T-3 again, shows them.

Just shows to go you why I have always advised having both the 
Bentley and the Haynes manuals for your VW.
