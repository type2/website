This Spring the Green Bean is sidelined with a bad clutch but I try to 
make that run on both Spring and fall.  The views are as wonderful as 
the drive can be hair-raising.  Great on the beach camping at state 
parks as well, Doran's Beach,Van Damme, Mendocino headlands, etc.

Enjoy.  My clutch goes in next week and then I'll be out there too.
