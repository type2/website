call around, find a REPUTABLE spray polyurethane foam insulation 
installer. closed cell foam gives about R6.8 at 1 inch. it's sprayed 
into place, bonds with the metal, is a vapor/moisture barrier. i can 
help you find an applicator if you want. be a good idea to have the 
interior stripped and masked...
