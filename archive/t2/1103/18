as far as the exhaust goes I am not sure. Reason would dictate yes it would 
be black exhaust but if it was only a LITTLE rich I am not so sure. When you 
run your car with the choke fully on the exhaust is not noticably blacker 
(for me at least). In the case of the aircraft engines which are basically 
the same as our type 1 engines I cannot remember 100 percent positive if my 
friend told me that without the choke in use (summer months) they required 
an oil change ever 50 or 100 hours, but I think it was 50 hours. If 
operating the choke cut that service life of the oil to 20 hours from 50 
even that is a HUGE impact, and if he had said 100 hours then that is just 
an amazing amount to cut the life of an oil change.

As far as then having too much oil because you are mixing gas into it I 
think you actually end up burning a lot of that off in combustion because it 
doesn't take many revolutions with improperly lubricated cylinder walls 
before you have worn the rings to the point you are blowing combustion into 
the crankcase (possibly what forced the oil out of your filler tube?)

$0.02 of my own smoke blowing :D
