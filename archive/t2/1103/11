This, of course, is at the heart of the VW philosophy which keeps us
loving our vehicles, but the T2 is quite heavy, and the disc brake
system is not engineered for running without power. It takes too much
pedal pressure and stopping time is too long without the power assist
working well. It is definitely a safety hazard to take it out for more
than a test drive, or use temporarily for transportation while you
wait for repair when the power assist is not working.
