I don't know.

I personally had a T-3 Squareback that had dual carb engine in it and my 
father had a T-3 fastback with a single carb. both fully American bought 
sold and I have the records for mine so it was a full legal import.

this is not the first time that I have seen errors of ommision in the 
Bentley manual.  cars built over long periods of time in various parts of 
the world would obviously have certain differences mostly minor but some 
you know.  the first Fuel Injected VW engine I think I ever saw was in a 
Type IV itself. about 73 or so....
