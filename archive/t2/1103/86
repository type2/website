Well decent weather today, and a little break in the afternoon. I undid the
screws you mentioned. I can pull the steering wheel backward, but not up and
out of the way. I think I need to pull this up to be able to access the base
of the column, where the wire is connected. I can get the whole contraption
to go up about 1/4 to 1/2 an inch. It seems like if I wanted to pull it this
way, I would need to disconnect the base of the column under the floor pan.

I feel like I am  missing an important step or info about this plate at the
base of the column. Is it attached permanently to the tube? Or is there
another way to get it off/up and out of the way.

You don't need to remove the wheel.  Just remove the phillips screws 
underneath the box which is below the wheel on the steering column (the 
one the stalks go into).  Then you can pull the column outward (towards 
the rear of the bus) and upward.
