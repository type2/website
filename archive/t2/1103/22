and the oil change about 1300 miles ago showed no untoward indications of 
anything out of the ordinary. the oil was darker than when put in but it 
wasn't "Black" and I usually "feel" the oil when I check it and I would 
probably have noticed that it "Felt" different even if I didn't know why. 
none of these occured. so I am pretty confident that this is not the 
problem in my case.

as soon as it stops snowing and gets above 20F I am plannig on pulling the 
oil filter and seeing what is the state of things, also can hopefully get 
some oil that has not been to contaminated, and if I pull the thing apart 
see what it has been "collecting" from the oil.
