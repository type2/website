Something that has been missed so far on FI buses is the most common
reason
for rich running........

The head temp sensor screwed into the left cylinder head in front of the 
#3 spark plug, NOTORIOUS for coming loose, the connection falling apart
or just 
the wrong one for the application. 

A normal part of my yearly maintenance is to get out my specially ground 
box end 13mm and give it a light snug, makes all the difference in the
world.

I found this years ago when looking for a die out, sluggish accel problem
on a customers bus and have had the same problems, symptoms and
resolution
on MANY FI buses since.

I am not big on parts replacement ......... unless you have a LOT of
time, money and
a total lack of understanding and patience.

We can choose to pick them up or expect that someone else will.
I choose the first.
