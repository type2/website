Howdy y'all and happy Friday. I just thought with all the troubles on the
list as of late I'd chime in with a positive note.

I just passed 10,000km on my first, 1600dp rebuild.  Its been purring fine
in my '71 hightop since last spring. Good temps/compression, no leaks, runs
strong.

Drove her from Seattle, WA to Pismo, CA and back in the fall, hugging the
coast along hwy 101 and 1. That is a gorgeous drive! Lots of folks waving
and smiling too. Although scary as hell when you catch a good crosswind off
the cliffs on Hwy 1. That hightop seems more like a spinnaker sometimes!

Cheers,
Ryan
