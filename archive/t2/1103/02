I was curious about how to get microfiche converted, so I wrote the UC Berkeley campus library, which my girlfriend used to work in.  Here's their reply:

 Thank you for your question.  I can make a couple of suggestions that could be helpful for you.  If the quantity of fiche is not astronomical you could use our fiche readers in our News/Micro Collection.

 http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/doemoff/newsmicro/

 The fiche readers have both scanning and printing capabilities.  Scanning, to a flash drive, is free and printing is 15 cents a page.  Scanning and printing are both self service.

 On a larger scale, you could contact our Digital Publishing Group (DPG) to see if they would be willing to tackle such a project.  I am not certain they take on projects outside the library or university but it might be worth asking.  Please take at look at their page for further information and contacts.

If you are interested in having the content scanned then maybe you could look to local library/universities as well.  

If that doesn't work for you and since digitizing is free at UCB I'd be happy to help out in doing the scanning and conversion to pdf (especially they were to feed back into the OACDP project).

If you can get me estimates of the size of the project I'll continue to follow the leads toward the UCB Digital Publishing Group and see what info I can get there.

Cheers,
Elliott
