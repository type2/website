Hey David,

Thanks for the tip, I've been waiting for some decent weather to get back on
it...I think Sat. may cooperate.

I'll let you all know how I work it out.

You don't need to remove the wheel.  Just remove the phillips screws 
underneath the box which is below the wheel on the steering column (the 
one the stalks go into).  Then you can pull the column outward (towards 
the rear of the bus) and upward.
