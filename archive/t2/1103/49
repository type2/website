Subject: Re: '71 Bus Brake Woes

My memory is that 1700cc vans from '72/'73 always had servos.   Certainly all
four that I drove at work from '73 to '75 did, as does my current '72
(actually a '73 model).   However they certainly are not safe to drive with
the servo disconnected.   I did drive one 1600cc van during the same period
and I'm pretty sure it did not have a servo.   All the same the brakes were
good enough, if not quite as good as the others, which would concur with
Robert's experience.   According to UK parts suppliers the non servo master
cylinders are quite different and cannot be interchanged, certainly not
without modification, which probably meant they multiplied pedal pressure more
than the servo master cylinders could with the servo disconnected.   (I hope
that makes sense, grammer was never my forte.)

So my understanding is: 1700's from the period had servos as standard but
1600's did not - but it may have been a factory option on 1600's as well.
