That is absolutely my favorite drive. Used to do it every year! A bus
is so much fun on those hairpin turns, and then when you crest a hill
or come around a corner and catch a breathtaking view, it's
exhilarating!

 and smiling too. Although scary as hell when you catch a good crosswind off
 the cliffs on Hwy 1. That hightop seems more like a spinnaker sometimes!
