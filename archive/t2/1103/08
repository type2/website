	My '73 has disc brakes in front, a long-delayed requirement 
which, while slapping discs on the front of the much lighter types 1, 
4,  VW unaccountably kept from this heaviest vehicle they were mfg.
	Without any vacuum assist, I find this braking system quite 
OK.  Who needs power or vac assist?  Now this thread leads me to 
suspect that the gain (lower pedal pressure needed, when vac working) 
would be outweighed by the risk of these subtle treacheries mentioned 
by Jamie.
	I keep recalling the wonderful Renault 8 & 10 which had 
all-wheel discs and no assist.  Worked fine. No power assist was 
needed.   I fail to see why other mfrs couldn't emulate that 
achievement.  (Admittedly those vehicles were down around 1600 lb. if 
I recall; ours are in the region of double that, no?)
	Simplicity is the only real solution to the pile of failure 
modes lurking malevolently in anything so complex as a bus (let alone 
a nuclear power station  -  this quip eased in seeing as how it's 
Friday 8-)).  If you can avoid the need for power brakes, do.  (We've 
avoided the need for power steering, by slapping the power train as 
far from the steering wheels as possible.)   I detest the trends to 
power brakes, power steering, power windows etc.  These are among the 
reasons I deem the T2, once it got front discs and an alternator, the 
choice design.
