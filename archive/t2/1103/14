I sure wish my '74 single cab came equipped with power assisted brakes. 
Although it has front disks, stopping it quickly is indeed a challenge
especially when loaded.  I'm sure it would be a lot worse if it came with
power brakes and the power assist was not working but it's bad enough as-is!

This, of course, is at the heart of the VW philosophy which keeps us
loving our vehicles, but the T2 is quite heavy, and the disc brake
system is not engineered for running without power. It takes too much
pedal pressure and stopping time is too long without the power assist
working well. It is definitely a safety hazard to take it out for more
than a test drive, or use temporarily for transportation while you
wait for repair when the power assist is not working.
