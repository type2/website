Yeah, I went back and looked at them via the good links.  The quality of 
the originals is pretty bad.  At least for the late bay like mine.  It 
would be nice if somebody could get a clean set up somewhere.  And make 
pdf's, index them, etc.  :)  Lots of work.  Maybe somebody will take the 
time some day.  Ciao...KR
