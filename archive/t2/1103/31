you trying to restart a flame war???? lol

it can be done and there are about as many opinions as there are members 
of this list.

my feeling is if it was a carb leave it a carb. if it was a fuel injected 
leave it a FI.   the carbs are simple and complex to get adjusted right. 
the FI is complex but once dialed in is dang near bullet proof.

give your FI another chance it is not as bad as you think.

step by step each part has to be there, no short cuts and it will work. 
the black box rarely fails but vacuum lines can be a real PITA until you 
know your bus and it's quirks
