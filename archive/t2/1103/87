Hi Alan,

At that milage it isn't unreasonable to expect some issues with suspension
and running gear components. I have similar milage on my bus and before
the next long trip I am thinking it's about due for front bearings, a
steering box, tie rods, and ball joints. The only part I've had to replace
is the steering damper, and that was about 6 years ago.

Seat cushions are also important, but I replaced mine with Vanagon
captain's chairs quite a while ago.


Happy Trails,
