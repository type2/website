good points all, BUT my engine is a fuel injected engine and being 
overrich suddenly would mean an electronic failure. which would probably 
prevent the engine from starting...  it did pass an emissions test a year 
ago and I haven't done any adjusting to the fuel mixture since.

so this one probably falls in the catagory N/A in my case 
but important to those who have carbs.
