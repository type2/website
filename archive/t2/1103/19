Good theory to know, but I don't think it fits Bob's case. First,
there's been cases reported on the list where a stuck carb needle
valve has filled the crankcase with a LOT of gasoline. If this had
been the case, Bob would have noticed, but even so, engine damage is
not sudden and catastrophic. People have actually driven their buses
before they realized there was a problem with excess gas in the oil.
Wear is even more gradual when the mixture is just rich enough to
reduce the effectiveness of cylinder wall lubrication.
