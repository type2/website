I put a floor in a dirt gagage once using 4x8 sheets of plywood 
decking. This is 1 1/4" thick with tongue and groove edges. I set 
bricks on a 4x4 grid leveled with a stringline, then just layed in 
plastic to control humidity from the earth and the sheets of decking 
so they were all supported at the corners and centers. Might go to a 
2x2 grid of bricks for a big increase in load carrying capacity. Very 
quick way to have a 16x20 foot floor or any multiple of 4x8, clean, 
dry and flat. If you wanted you could seal and paint with some 
industrial duty goods to protect from lubes and chemicals typical of 
wrenching activities. Cost you maybe 10% to do it yourself as opposed 
to hiring a cement contractor to pour something better.

It really was a very big improvement over dirt. Cuts the humidity 
hanging in the garage air way down. The savings in corrosion losses 
to tools and vehicles will easily pay for the floor in a few years.
