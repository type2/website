	Am I to understand that my '73 (presumably UK-model kombi, 
sold to the Devon firm to slap in their good plywood camper kit) was 
meant to have vacuum brake assist but has been deprived of it since? 
The pedal pressure needed to stop pretty fast might be taxing for a 
very light person, but I don't find it onerous; and the NZ Govt's 
measurement of braking, on a roller 'brake dynamometer', is passed 
readily.
	I had supposed the T2 was produced with front discs but no 
assist for a couple y, and then vac assist was added.  Was that not 
the history?
