Actually he was referencing the jerseylooker.com links (cool domain BTW) further down in his post.  The link with the "exceeded monthly traffic" warning was to the old OACDP host on freeweb7 that won't provide a redirection to the new hosting.

But I agree that it probably takes less time to scan them than you think, just a lot of repetition ;)
