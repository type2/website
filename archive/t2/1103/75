Subject: Westfalia fiber glass insulation

Hi Folks,

This last year I have unfortunately not done much driving of the bus but
have been working hard on getting body work taken care of. Replacing some
exterior panels led me to remove the interior baltic birch panels exposing
the fiber glass insulation behind. I combed through the archives but could
find nary a reference to the stuff. Is it just common home insulation,
should I go down to my local builder supply store and pick up the highest R
rating that I can fit in the space?

Thank you for your insights,

Max
