Subject: Defective steering box?

I bought a rebuilt steering box a while back from one of our online  
vendors.  Once installed and it seemed like it might have had a tight  
spot at the center of travel.  I thought nothing of it, hoping it  
would work itself out.

There seems to be a more serious problem.  I noticed that the steering  
coupling bolts have rubbed through the cover plate that connects the  
column tube to the floor.  On closer inspection, I find that with  
enough rotational effort, the steering column itself (and thus the  
worm spindle) is thrust upward.  That is to say, there is at least 2-3  
cm of play along the axis of the worm spindle.  Can this be normal?
