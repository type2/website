Assuming your engine is stock - doesn't the FI engines have a much 
milder cam and smaller valves? That is, wouldn't you be running a 
detuned engine with a carb compared to getting the EFI to work correctly?

I prefer the EFI thought I have dual 36mm Dellorto DRLA carbs on my Type 
IV powered Beetle. With stock EFI heads and cam it was pretty mild. I'll 
be upgrading those items when I rebuild the engine. Good part is that it 
was pretty resistant to overheating b/c I pulled a car from VA to TN 
with it in the July heat.
