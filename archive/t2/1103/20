A LITTLE rich is not a short term problem, OVER rich from a dropped 
float or jet falling out or just too far out of adjustment is a 
totally different thing. Adjusted properly, the choke adds no more 
than necessary for clean running during warm up and is of no 
consequece unless in conditions of frequent short run driving.

The early VW manuals called for changing oil every 6 weeks or 1000 
miles under servere conditions. Rule of thumb miles or time 
maintenance cannot hold a candle to actual inspection of the color, 
smell, and feel of the oil. Change it before it gets dark, looks 
milky, smells gassy, or feels like grit, regardless the time or miles 
of use. Monitor your oil and use empirical evidence to note the 
correct interval for the way you use your Bus, not rule of thumb from 
your Dad or the manuals.

If your float sinks, you will fill your crankcase with raw gas. 
Whether it fills a little or a lot depends upon how much you load the 
engine. Under heavy loads it will seize much quicker than under light 
loads due to lubricant dilution.
