  the black box rarely fails

True that. Bosch stated that over 80% of the ECU's sent back as cores 
were FUNCTION NOMINAL. Yeah, mis-diagnosed the great majority of the 
time. The very few ECU failures I have seen ALWAYS show inside one of 
the following:

1.) Corrosion, due to a drop or two of water or just high humidity over time.

2.) Heat stress, and there is ALWAYS something else that caused it, 
so find and fix that or you will burn up the new ECU in short order. 
Follow the burnt circuit back to the pin. Check the diagram to 
determine what that pin goes to. Check that. And all the way back to 
battery ground however it gets there.

3.) Under an 8x+ handglass in good light, the solder joints will show 
cracks. They will ALWAYS go from a bright finish to matte, due to 
heat cycling, due to age. If the solder joints are bright, good deal. 
If they are dull gray, get out the hand glass and take it out in the 
sunlight for close inspection.

Same goes for relays and virtually all electronics. Have a close look 
inside for empirical evidence. In most cases of failure, the evidence 
inside is OBVIOUS if you what to look for, and how to see it.
