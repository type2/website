Subject: Re: [T2] FI to carb

THanks guys,

I called my favorite "young-smart and brazen" mechanics.

He fixed the horn on my jeep when countless others could not. He just
undid stupidity and corrosion until he was sure it would work. 6 years
of no horn on my Jeep. I could go onnnnnnnnn.

Called him today and started to talk about that problem and he said he
did a 1976 Superbettle, which is basically what we have.

He remarked on all the white wires and a few other things.

Then he said something that blew me away. "I have a source for those
double relays new".

Sometimes people say things that tell you they know what they are
talking about.

This guy did, he gets my biz.

As far as the horn goes------------------------I have nothing to say
other than he fixed it. He know that prongs on the socket side of a
connector have to be able to flex out to make contact.

I think I will stay off my back in the driveway and let this mechanic
have a couple of hundred of my bucks.

I yearn for a shop. I have a garage with a dirt floor.

Alan
