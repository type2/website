Subject: 1970 camper progress

Continuing on tasks to fix up my gifted 1970 camper...

My most recent request was regarding the oil pressure light remaining on.
Thanks for your suggestions.  I replaced the oil pressure sensor ($6.00) and
all seems well.  Thanks again for all suggestions (which ranged from simple
suggestions to private wonderfully lengthy dissertations comparing various
opinions.  Love it!).

Last thing I need to fix in order to pass inspection is the flashers/hazard
lights.  Every so often both hazards and flashers will blink appropriately.
More often than not they just light up and do not turn off.  The hazards and
signals always exhibit same behavior so I assume the relay is at fault.
Decent assumption?

I am trying to find the location of the dern relay in a 1970 type2.  My
goodness where is it?

My first thought would be (after locating it) the terminals could even be
oxidized.  I found out that when my wipers weren't working (fuse would blow
every time they turned on) after cleaning terminals on the wiper switch and
replacing wires - the problem is fixed.  So I thought Id at least clean up
connections on relay/wires and see how it then behaves.  Although the bus is
now in the NC mountains - it's previous life on Florida's salty coast can
create some strange filmy connection problems such as described.  After
cleaning contacts, next options is to replace the relay.

Please offer some guidance in locating the relay (location/appearance) and
suggestions for replacement relay vendors.  Thanks so much.  As always your
expertise in any regard is valued.  Take care,
