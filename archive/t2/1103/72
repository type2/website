Very thorough analysis. I think most people looking for FI trouble
don't go this far in their thinking.

 a false reading to the ECU and excess delivery is again possible. The
 plugs will show excess mixture via black carbon deposits, and for way
 over rich, will short out is short order. Raw fuel destroys the
 insulators ability to insulate and no spark happens. Also verify that
 the flap in the AFM is not hanging. They can stick and not return to
 idle position. Very prudent as well to use the proper DTC plugs for
 the injected engines to rule that out of the equation of non spec
 synergy you got going on.
