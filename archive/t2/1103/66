The Type 3 (Fastback and Squareback) had D-Jet FI from '68 on in the US. 
Other countries continued to get carbs, but all US-bound Type 3's got 
FI. The Notchback was never officially imported to the US, so Notchbacks 
in the states were meant for some other country and probably carbed.

The 914 used both the D-Jet (MPC) and L-Jet (AFC) FI at different times 
during its production.

Having owned a carbed Bus, a carbed Ghia, a FI Bus, and several FI Type 
3's, I gotta say that I prefer a FI based engine.
