 The Haynes for T-3 again, shows them.

Likely these are purchased abroad and then brought into the US by

Thus invisible to VWoA and Bentley, but Haynes being a UK produced
publication has coverage. Haynes likewise includes coverage of dual
Solex Vanagons which were not sold in the US as I recall.
