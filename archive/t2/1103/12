Not to forget the driver behind the bigger brakes on our Type 2s, the 
design was for commercial vehicles to carry loads, so the brakes were 
designed to pull up with extra load on board, hence the reasion why we 
dont NEED rear disks to get serious braking ( I was reminded a few years 
back that my '74 campmobile could pull up a lot shorter than a new car 
when I did a panic stop to prevent running over a kid's dog (li'l bustard 
called him from across the road so he bolted across under my front 
wheels), and then watched in the mirrors, a new car slide across the 
bridge and tail end me), was glad of the lowbar that day, I could drive 
off while he had to wait for a tow truck because the towbar took out his 
radiator.

Anyway, the poiont was it's not the bus weight that necessitates the 
boosters, it's the loads that the busses are designed to carry.

FWIW
