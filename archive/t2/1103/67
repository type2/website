FYI

914's were equipped with FI from day one.

1.7L versions had MPC, same as Type 3 (extra contact points in bottom of
ignition distributor 
fired two injectors at a time.
1.8L versions were AFC, same as Bus and Bug FI in U.S. (not to be
confused with later FI
used on Mexi bugs
2.0L in 914 had MPC (Porsche felt MPC could provide more precise fuel
control)
914-6 had Mechanical injection like early 911 (911E models)

912E (late type, 1976 model year ONLY) had 2.0L with AFC (just like our
buses!) except
with mechanical lifters.  Shops I worked in made a lot of swaps in 914's
and 912E models
with bus cases and hydraulic lifters, with no loss of performance, but a
noticeable loss
of noise!

912 (early type) had Porsche specific engine similar to older 356 mill,
with dual
Solex carbs much like Kadrons (but better quality), most of these were or
have been swapped 
out for Weber replacements that have much better adjustability.
