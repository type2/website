Highly likely you never had it running right before the swap. For 
normal street and hiway driving, nothing purrs so clean and smooth as 
stock & spec.

I had a Weber on my Bus for a short while. Ran much better than the 
worn out stock carbs. Then found and remounted new stock carbs. I 
went from night, to overcast at dawn to bright sunlight. Bad MPG to 
good MPG to Best MPG right along with it.
