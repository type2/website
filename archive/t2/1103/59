Subject: RE: [T2] wall paper ... 

I've never hung wallpaper before but it seems pretty simple. I bought this
stuff today and I'm happy with the match ... I used a blow dryer to peel off
the remnants of the old stuff ... sanded down the panel a bit with a sander
... primed the panel with high tech primer ... cut the paper a couple inches
too big each way .. as soon as the primer is totally dry I'll slap on the
wallpaper ... I think I'll do the 78 next but I'll try and find a perfect
match .. with the 82 I'm doing all of the interior so a perfect match is not
necessary. 

I think the only tricky part will be the headliner over the driver's seat
and the panel on the sliding door ... because in those cases it will be
necessary to match seams.
