Hmmm.... you shouldn't have to jump through any hoops to get that out.
Think about how the glass shop would get it out. No magic, just a
little thinking. In my experience, as the bottom starts to lift up, it
should start to clear the bottom rail, which leaves you enough space
to start tilting the bottom, which should then give you a little more
clearance at the top, which lets you lift the bottom a little more,
and so on.

Also observe the track or rail at the bottom. Look for a key or slot
that may only allow the frame to tilt out when the slider frame is in
a certain position.
