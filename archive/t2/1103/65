See your Bentley. That tight spot at center is supposed to be there. 
It should be barely noticable at the wheel. You might want to back 
off the adjuster screw just a hair.

Replace cover plate

The column if firmly attached to the dash. I can't figure how it 
could be thrust upward.

Too much play for anything except perhaps Santa's elves on a January 
holiday in Jamaica, Mawn.

Whatever is happenin, it sure don't sound right. Don't think I can
