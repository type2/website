Not so, Grasshopper. My spezial 69 Bus was US delivery as evidenced 
by the VWOA VIN sticker, originally sold by a Portland, OR, VW 
Dealer, taken in trade by the same dealer where I found it and bought 
it with, if memory serves, some 30k miles. It was a Commercial Kombi, 
vacant of anything behind the front seats except an original rubber 
floor mat. I used it a coupla years, then traded it at the same 
dealer for a new 75 Scirocco. It was many years later that I came to 
understand just how rare that T-2 was, as I have yet to ever see 
another with that 1800cc suitcase motor. And I have serviced and 
documented hundreds, count 'em, hundreds of T-2's.

I have seen one T-2 with a transplant 1600cc suitcase from a T-3 with 
a burned up tiny T-3 clutch and flywheel. That was a hi-top camper 
loaded to the gills, and he burned up the clutch trying to get the 
rear wheels out of a ditch he backed into. He had driven it from 
Chicago to the San Juan Islands several years before. Just amazing 
how God and German engineering protects the ignorant sometimes.
