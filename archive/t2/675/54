Those who have read my posts over the years know that I'm not one to
automatically recommend the more expensive option.  Sometimes the cheaper
option is just as good, or even better, and I'll be the first to suggest
saving your money in such cases.  But frankly this is not one of them.  Most
of the monza style exhausts are made in Taiwan or China using very poor
materials. Besides rusting quickly, the seams tend to split. They do not
compare to ones sold 5-10 years ago; the quality has slipped dramatically on
these.

The $60 price difference for an OEM type setup will pay for itself several
times over. The quality difference is day and night. You have not yet
learned this because your monza-style system is only a few months old, but
unfortunately you almost certainly will.
