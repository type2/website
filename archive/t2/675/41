kick me of the list then. When a known crook is trying to come across to the

list as one of the good guys, I'm going to say something, especially when

nobody else is.

 

I only say something when he scouts for new victims. Because you have heard

it before means nothing to someone that is new to the list and knows nothing

of Marios antics and history.
