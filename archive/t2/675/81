Subject: Rubber seals

Hello everyone...
Greetings from Portugal

I need to get new rubber seals for almost all windows of my '68 bus. I'm
planning in get some from Clip1.com (german seals) but maybe this doesn't make
sense, since i'm from Portugal.
Does anyone knows about a online store in Europe where i can get them and
other spareparts?

Thanks in advance

Joao Ribeiro
