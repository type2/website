Subject: Re: [T2] cleaning out fuel injection.

It depends on whats wrong...
With my '78 that sat for years, after removing everything I discovered the
fuel injection components to be fine. What ended up being wrong with my fuel
system is that the fuel tank was rusted badly and so was the metal line to
the fuel filter. Everything after the fuel filter was fine. You have to
lower the engine to remove the tank, and it had to be wrested out. Also,
it's kind of easy to destroy the fuel filler neck(but most of them have to
be replaced anyhow when they get old). I theorize that was the ROOT problem
on my bus, as it was torn, old, and letting water in.  I've read that VW
doesn't terne treat their tanks to prevent/elimante rusting... I believe it.
Good luck to you.

Thanks,
Mark
