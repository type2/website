Subject: Monza style exhaust,

So I really like the look of the Monza style exhaust, twin tips,  but 
I'm searching for "the one" to go on my upcoming Boston Bob 2L for my 
'73. Anyone got a line on where I can source a good monza style exhaust 
? I am going to be keeping my stock '73 HE's.

Thanks !

Steve

(Thanks for all the emails re Boston Bob longblocks from you all, I'm 
just getting all my ducks in a row to get the block, clutch and tranny 
in my '73)
