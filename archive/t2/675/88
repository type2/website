Subject: brake resevoir line dilemma

awhile back, i started nosing about for a new m/c... never found a 
german 2-holer for the 70 within my budget (and how DO you get the 
brazilians w/ ONE brakeswitch to work?). just as well, as the main 
problems turned out to be the rubber seals holding the main reservoir 
to the m/c, and the 12mm plastic tube that runs from the cab 
reservoir to the m/c res.

replaced the m/c seals easily enough.
upon inspection, i remembered that i had looooong ago replaced some 
of the (cracked) tubing with rubber hose, and clamped it to the m/c 
res. this hose was allegedly brake fluid-compatible, but i doubt it: 
soaked in fluid, and dripping. not only that, but letting lil black 
bits of rubber run into the brake system!!

i DO have another plastic tube  (#55 on this fiche: 
http://www.ratwell.com/technical/Microfiche/t205100.gif) but it is 
dodgy. plus, who the heck has seal #59 still in stock?  FLAPS had 
never heard of 12mm brake fluid-compatible line... but had some fuel 
line i could try :P

i can't go the route of simply replacing the fluid res with a 72+ one 
and using the 9mm blue brake hose, as it still wouldn't fit onto the 
m/c reservoir nipple (12mm, remember?). besides, it is a really NICE 
original round one king karl VS sent me, and i am attached to it.

so, anyone heard of 12mm brake hose?
