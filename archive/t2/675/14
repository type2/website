Subject: Need Vanagon dash Ideas

Trying to dream up ideas on how to dress up the top of my dash in a 1980
Vanagon. The PO had drilled holes all over it to mount who know what. Thinking
of doing something in fiberglass that sit on top of the dash (bolted or
screwed to top of dash) that would also make room to mount my guages.

Does anyone have a web site illustrating anything like this?
