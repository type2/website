With the FI it's probably a cracked vaccuum line somewhere or a clogged
filter as mentioned on the VVW list.

It'll be 30 years old this year. Drop the motor and pull the fuel tank.
Replace every rubber line you can find. Fuel and vaccuum. Fuel especially.

After that's done and it's all back together you may want to run through
the tests in the Bentley FI section.

Then, when it's running, go buy yourself 3 cans of SeaFoam. It's about
$6.00/can but it will clean any varnish that has formed in the injectors. 1
can per full tank of gas for the first 3 tanks. If it's running badly after
that just bite the bullet, pull the injectors and take them in to be
professionally cleaned to be absolutely sure that's not the problem.

My only FI experience is with domestic vehicles. A ford that sat for 2
years and a Chevy that I drove until it ran out of gas and sucked in some
really fine silt like crud from the bottom of the tank that made it through
the filter. The Ford injectors had to be cleaned. The Chevy stopped
stuttering after 2 cans of SeaFoam (it has some really funky electrical
problems now though -- I think I made it mad at me).
