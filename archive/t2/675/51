Response:  Ok, my 1978 has this muffler:

(1) My 78 exhaust config differs a lot from your '73,
but I presume the exhaust muffler solution above is
comparable for a different model year.  Notice the
similarities.  Perhaps even the same manufacturer.
(2) I paid $80 plus shipping.  Say, $95.
(3) It used-to, and still does sound studly.  I love
the way it sounds!  But read on please.
(4) Within a month of installation, it was badly
rusted.  I did not attempt to paint it with high temp
paint when I should have.  Bad Clifford, bad!
(5) I purchased it from CIP 28 months ago, and it's
developed noisy exhaust leak holes.  It's rusting-out.
(6) I would not purchase another.  As much as I like
the sound, the fact that it will only last about 3
years for about 25k miles, I would classify my
purchase decision as a mistake, by reason of quality
and longevity (or lack of both).
(7) My bus is under-cover, is always driven long
distances (i.e. seldom does trips which don't allow
the exhaust system to come up to temperature), and
muffler failure is not due to misuse or abuse.
(8) The CIP part description says "EMPI GT Bus
Exhaust."  I don't pretend to have all of the answers
but in the future, I will not buy another EMPI exhaust
system.   And such a purchase is in my near future.
