Mark,

I have one of these and modified it for the t4 engine by cutting short two 
of the mounting studs.

Pics here   http://www.shockwaverider.com/avp/picture-009.html

It was a close fit, but *very* sturdy and solid.

I did mount my heater boxes with it on the stand.  Very nice and easy to 
do when you rotate it to upside down....you can actually see how things 
fit....and get the nuts on and off with ease.

Cheers, dave
