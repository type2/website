What is often done is that when a complaint is made, the parking
enforcement officer (or an ordinary cop) will visit, put a chalk mark on
the running surface of the tire, and leave.  72 hours later he will return
and check the mark.  If you've just rolled the vehicle a bit the mark is
likely to still be there.

Ordinances of this sort sometimes have a stipulation that a vehicle must
be away from the parking location for a period of time between parking
periods.

As long as you drive the vehicle every few days you have little to worry
about, as long as the complainer doesn't have a friend in Parking
Enforcement.
