Subject: 73 Westy 4 mpg

My 73 westy seemed to use a lot of gas, so I decided to start
recording mileage. To my chagrin, I learned I was only getting 4 mpg.
This has me somewhat mystified because the bus does not emit black
smoke at the exhaust, not even when cold, starting up, or revving the
motor. Nor have I observed any leakage under the bus.

Is this normal because it is winter, and I live only 5 minutes from
work, so my choke is only just disengaging when I arrive, and also
because driving residential streets I am mostly in 2nd gear?

Thanks,

John
