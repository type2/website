Subject: Re: [T2] Maaco (was Re: Anonymous threatening letters)

I had an Earl Scheib in the 70's that had peeling problems shortly
afterwards. I had a Maaco job more recently that seemed good. They
were using a mainline paint, Dupont IIRC. Heard they take a little
extra care when they see you do good prep work.
