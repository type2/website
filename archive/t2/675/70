As other's have suggested. Greyhound. They don't WANT it in a box unless
it's something that can be easily damaged otherwise. They pack for space
and crates take up extra space. I've taken Greyhound trips and watch my
bags being stuffed in among uncrated steel fenders, bumpers, etc. And
they're generally quite reasonable. 

If it's an item is under 100 pounds and small emought to fit in one of
those HUGE cargo bays they'll take it. The towbar will probably have to be
wrapped in bubble wrap to protect other baggage from it's edges.
