Subject: Muffler and exhaust systems protectant

I do not know of any product that could be sloshed inside the muffler but 
there has to be a slosh sealant or protective coating that you would pour 
into the inside and slosh around to coat the inside for longer life. Of 
course it would have to be thin enough as not to be trapped by the sound 
deadening stuff inside. Maybe something like the Dupont Vari-prime product 
which is a 2 part primer but I don't know what temp range it would withstand 
after cureing. There is also a product that is a slosh sealant for aircraft 
fuel tanks that has great adhesion on almost any metal surface but again 
temp is the factor. Maybe it is as simple as a thined down BBQ paint for the 
slosh. Cree
