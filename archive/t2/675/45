I have the Empi twin tip muffler on my 73:

I think they're fine IF you do a little work to the m first. As you
can see in my pics, the paint on the muffler burned off almost
immediately. It then rusted. The fit wasn't bad though...

If you strip off the cheap paint and use a high temp header paint or
BBQ paint on them I think they'll last a reasonable amount of time.
Still not as long as a stock muffler, but better than they way they
come out of the box.

Just keep in mind that they are loud. I happen to like them that way,
but it's something to consider.
