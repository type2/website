Don't most mufflers use some kind of glass batting inside? If so,
anything you slosh in there will just plug it up and probably cause
you to blow your muffler right off the car. ;-)

I forget who on this list does the ceramic coating, but this question
is for you: Do you coat the insides of mufflers? Or just the outside?
I understand that pipes are pretty much a no-brainer, but the mufflers
themselves are the question...
