Subject: sliding door update

to all who replied to the slider saga: all is... well, better, if not 
well. i cleaned, lubed and lubed again everything; replaced anything 
that looked worn w/ a less-worn used part, and adjusted the door a 
bit. now it SPRUNGs out like it is supposed to! however, it rattles a 
bit at upper right, and is no longer flush at upper left. i am 
debating whether to live w it, or try and readjust and possibly lose 
the SPRUNG action again.
not a pressing issue tho, so long as i can get in without scrabbling 
at the lock!
