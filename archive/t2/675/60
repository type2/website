take the 94 to 90 route Montana does a better job of snow removal and
depending on which part of Norcal your going to you can grab 15 west of
Butte and miss the big passes going thru SLC and head west or stick to 90
and go thru Portland. 80 is prone to white outs-those gates you see on the
freeway aren't for decoration and 70 requires heading over the Rockies and
more black ice.
