Subject: Tow Bar -- shipping ideas?

Every now and then, someone posts on the subject of towing a Type II.  I'm 
looking at a tow bar ~400 miles from here, wondering how to get it transported 
at reasonable cost.  FedX is quoting $85 and the seller would need to make a 
box for it.  Questions:

(1) Does anyone have favorable experience shipping an object like this, via 
FedX Ground, or maybe UPS, or other shipping services?

(2) Is there a list member in the Detroit area who would be willing to accept 
the tow bar and hold it for me, until I can pick it up?

Thanks to all and a very HAPPY NEW YEAR
