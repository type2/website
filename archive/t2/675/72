I suggest blocking popups or being quick at closing them, it throws a fair
sized flash popup at every page change.

I've downloaded the source and will be investigating altering it to do
daily/hourly rather than just weekly charts. I have to modify it to work in
a "regular" Apache environment first, he's got it all set up to run from a
single directory and all of my servers have separate /cgi-bin directories
for perl cgi modules to run in.

When I get it done I'll offer it up on http://www.phorce1.us or
http://www.phorce1.com. 

If anyone else out there is better at modifying perl/html source than I (HA
-- that would be just about EVERYBODY that's messed with it for more than
10 minutes) then fix it up and email the modified .tgz to me.

Directory structure for phorce1.us (or .com) is:

/var
  /www
   /phorce1.us
    /cgi-bin
    /htdocs

So, the html files, images folder, and users folder should be in
/var/www/phorce1.us/htdocs/gantt and the .pl files in
/var/www/phorce1.us/cgi-bin
