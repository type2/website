Subject: Gas in Oil Revisited

I just received a report on the gas in oil issue. When this was
brought up recently, it was not clear how much gas was in the oil.
Without a clear response, I assumed we were talking about light
contamination.

What I learned last night is that there is an issue where a sticking
valve in the carburetor can allow gas from the gas tank to siphon into
intake manifold where it can run past worn rings and fill the
crankcase so completely as to make the oil a watery consistency.

I also learned that this is not only an issue about ruining your oil,
but is also very dangerous because the gasoline will run out of the
combustion chamber through exhaust valves to fill the exhaust
manifolds and muffler with gasoline.

I do not know what kind of condition inside the fuel pump exists to
allow this to happen.
