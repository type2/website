 i DO have another plastic tube  (#55 on this fiche: 
 http://www.ratwell.com/technical/Microfiche/t205100.gif) but it is 
 dodgy. plus, who the heck has seal #59 still in stock?  FLAPS had 
 never heard of 12mm brake fluid-compatible line... but had some fuel 
 line i could try :P
 
 i can't go the route of simply replacing the fluid res with a 72+ one 
 and using the 9mm blue brake hose, as it still wouldn't fit onto the 
 m/c reservoir nipple (12mm, remember?). besides, it is a really NICE 
 original round one king karl VS sent me, and i am attached to it.
 
 so, anyone heard of 12mm brake hose?

#59 is easy!  It is part number  211 611 833C  called a Grommet. Available 
from the VW dealer IF he is willing to order it for you. Cost is around $1.70
I just ordered a dozen and mailed on to another listee, so VW still has them in
stock.....

The plastic tube is 69 and 70 only, because it goes up front. 69 to 79 are all the 
size [12mm] but the length is different. 71-73 goes up behind the drivers seat.
74-79 is the shortest, only goes to the floor at the front corner of the drivers seat.
68 is a metal tube.

Buses never used the blue 9mm hose.

I have a nice 69-70 tube......
