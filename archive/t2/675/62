Tony,

I've had one for several years.  So I have the non "pro" one.

It works ok, the biggest problem is that to blow it out in order to change 
powders, you have to unplug/unhook *everything* and carry it all outside.

I looked it over last night to see if I could make a quick connect for the 
Hi-tension wire.  Might be able to do it...don't know for sure yet.

You and your buddy might check here  also  http://www.columbiacoatings.com

These folks have a lot more info on their site and I have had good 
dealings with them on buying powder.

Don't know anything about their guns.

Don't forget to check here too!

bus content...all of my engine was powder coated in various flavors of 
powder coat except 1 piece I couldn't get in the oven.

***Highly*** recomended!

Cheers, dave
