Subject: [T2] Muffler and exhaust systems protectant

I forget who on this list does the ceramic coating, but this question is for
you: Do you coat the insides of mufflers? Or just the outside? I understand
that pipes are pretty much a no-brainer, but the mufflers themselves are the
question...
--------------------- Clip --------------------------
I do the ceramic coatings on Headers, Mufflers, Motorcycle Pipes, Heads,
Pistons, Industrial parts and 90% of coatings are done only to the outside
of pipes.
The reason being is that anybody that says they can give you a lasting
finish on the inside by the ceramic coating process is simply lying to you.
Please ask them how they prepare the surface so I will know!.
I sand blast with Aluminum Oxide and coat exterior of pipes.
The exteriors are coated with thermal barrier to keep the heat in and are
subject only to light splashing with water and the ambient humidity of the
zone you're in.
When you throw high temperature with exhaust gasses, acids and combustion
pulses onto the interior of pipes the coating will stay on "Only if it is an
electro coating" such as Copper, Nickel, Chrome and that doesn't last long.
I've seen Porcelain VW mufflers from back in the 60s that came from South
Africa and although the outer shell was coated the insides were not. The
same manufacturer offered a full line of Porcelain coated mufflers.
Don't confuse "Your Standard Bathroom Porcelain with Ceramic" the two are
significantly different in many ways.
The specialty ceramic coating that is used on AA Fueler and Funny Car
Zoomies only last about one season.
