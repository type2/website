 So what did it cost you for all the pieces including
 shipping?

I believe it cost around $200 +/-.  I got the same
density foam as the original (Good point Greg Potts). 
I believe it was called medium density.  The foam is
blue.  But I also got some type of batting on it which
makes it a little more "sittable" but does not affect
the dimensions at all.  I believe I ordered 8 feet x 4
feet of 1 3/4", (for the upper bunk) 3 feet x 4 feet
of 2 1/2" (for the cushion over the engine
compartment) and 3 feet x 4 feet of 3" (for the fold
down rear seat). CAUTION!  please measure your own
cushions as I'm doing this from memory here!  Except
for the color of the foam and the additional batting I
ordered, the density and every thing else about it is
just like the original. I've already stuffed 2
cushions and it looks great.  Greg
