Subject: Re: [T2] 1st fuel injection?

 '72 was the first year of the 1700cc pancake with dual carbs then went to
 1800cc in '73. Fuel injection was introduced in '75 on the bus with the
 1800. '76 went to the two litre FI.

Weeeellll......almost correct. FI was first introduced on the 1974 Calif 1800 bus 
with auto transmission. :]
