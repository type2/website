Using a digital VOM, you want to read milliamps. Just using a testlight, you
may have enough of a draw to light the light but it may only be drawing 50 or
100 milliamps. Not enought to drain a battery until a month goes by, like a
quartz clock running. Using the cable-to-battery post 'size of spark' to gauge
the amount of draw is a little false.... it may be the clock winding on an
older analog clock. It draws a lot to get it moving, but is not constant.

A domelight will draw 600 to 700 milliamps. This will kill a fully charged
battery in 2 to 3 days. 600 to 700 ma is 1/3rd of an amp per hour draw. 500ma
is 1/2 an amp. 1000ma is 1 amp. Amperage is measured in one hour increments.
Just like your example of the battery being rated at 60 amphours. That is the
amount of a constant load, 60 amps, that will drain the battery to zero in one
hour.  i.e. 1000ma = 1 amp = 24 amps per
day.
