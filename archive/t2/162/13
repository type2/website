Subject: electrical woes... ugh...


Ok, about two weeks ago I noticed my alternator light coming on in my 76
Westy while driving (dual battery's with a "Sea Gee" switch and a BN4
heater,) it would flicker... go out... flicker... go on... go off...
flicker... etc...  two days later my clutch burned out, so I brought it to
the mechanic to replace the clutch, and while it was there I had them check
the alternator and battery, and told them about the light.  (these are good
mechanics and I trust them) So I get a call saying I need a new
alternator... I say ok do it.  They throw in the new alternator, and since
my battery was under warranty they replaced that too... next day my bus wont
start... I call AAA, they come out, give me a jump, it starts right up, AAA
man says the battery is charging fine... I call the mechanics they say bring
it in, which I do, they test my 2nd battery, which was dead, so they
warranty the first one, replace the second one and off I go... she's fine
for about 2 days, now she won't start again... dead battery... It seems as
though my battery is discharging with nothing running...

I also found a red wire that was loose in the cabin of my bus (where the
cabinets used to be) I traced it back to find that it is the wire for the
Auxiliary heater main current circuit (the 16 amp fuse that hangs down in
front of the fuse box.) It isn't connected to anything, I don't know if this
is related or not... but I thought I'd mention it...

ANY suggestions would be GREATLY appreciated...

Thanks,
David
