Subject: Sunroof problem

Hi all,

I removed the headliner panel of my sunroof today and
adjusted the rear lifter on the back of the sunroof. I
followed the directions posted here by another bus
owner. The headliner panel came out rather easily but
I'm having lots of trouble getting it back in. My wife
and I tried just about everything we could think of
including using a screwdriver to pry it back into its
runner. It started to get bent up pretty bad so I
decided to ask here if anyone has experience or ideas
that might help. Thanks in advance.

Mike
