There remains today one trademark VW doesn't own.
It is a proper and fitting replacement for the VW logo.
It is a solution to the deletion of copywrited trademarks
from the internet and the alphabet.
VWoA cannot prevent it's display.
It is strictly forbidden to be displayed or
placed on merchandise for sale in Germany today.
It is an original symbol of peace in the world,
and predates the volkswagen by 3000+ years.
It has been used by Native Americans and Coca-Cola,
as well as the Boy Scouts and John Deere.
It is a fitting protest to the current dilemna.
