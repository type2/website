Subject: [T2] Question about head....


Hello all,
            Well, after some help from some very nice people from the
list, it was determined that #3 head is cracked.  Valves are ok but
compression is about 10psi.  :-)  So, although I Steve Dolan may have
one that I can use, I was thinking of other options in case he doesn't.
As of now the plug and fuel injector are pulled from number three
because its not doing anything anyways.  No performance change in engine
from doing this.  Question, since the head is probably shot anyways, can
I try and use something to fix the crack temporarily??  Like epoxy or
JBWeld?  Or would these not be able to withstand the heat?  Right now I
can get by with three cylinders.  Would I be asking for more trouble to
push that cylinder right now?  For the record, this is a '78 bus with
Type 4 motor.  Fuel Injection.  This is a California model. Thanks for
you help.
