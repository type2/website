I shoulda thought of this... especially since i had exactly this happend
to me less than a month ago.  Do check all the hangers, especially the
front one.  On a bay, this is a metal block with two bolts thru it. On a
V'gon, it's a plate bolted with 4 bolts.  For both, there is then a rubber
bushing bolted to the trans.  Check that all is secure!
