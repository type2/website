Subject: Anyone got a transmission...?

Hi,

I posted this earlier, but I'll ask again.. 

Anyone have a tranny for a 72 that they are willing to part with? I am in 
california and I will pay shipping and something reasonable extra.

The part I really need is the bell-housing and some internal pieces.

Let me know if anyone can help!

Thanks as always.
