Right on, man. 
I take 4th down to 40, but the other thresholds are
about the same.
My beast never sees WOT - especially on a
grade...which we both hate. She gets a nice
coast/cooldown on the other side if
allowed...sometimes we pull over if it was all just
too much...

230K? Wow. 
You guys should start a club...both of you!
