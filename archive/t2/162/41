Subject: Weird sound... sounds bad... very bad...

Help!

My bus ('70, 1600cc) just sprung a new sound on me today and it doesn't 
sound good. Here's the details...

1. Sound only occurs when in gear and clutch is out or being let out.
2. No sound when clutch is depressed.
3. It almost sounds like a tire rubbing against the frame, but it occurs 
even when the bus is standing still (if I let the clutch out).
4. Visually inspected CV boots and they're fine -- didn't check out the 
insides yet.
5. Bus will drive, but the sound gets worse.
6. Happens in all gears.

What should I be looking for? I've got Bentley and Muir, but don't have the 
gear to pull tranny or replace CV joints (either of which I'm hoping I don't 
have to do).

Any ideas/suggestions welcome...

Thanks,

Sean
1970 Microbus ("Mimi")
