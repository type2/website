I had a starter that went bad once, it would drain every ohm and erg out of a 
battery instantly and it seemed to me that the battery was the problem, when 
in fact it was the starter.  If you check the voltage drop at the starter 
when cranking the bus (standard caution about being in neutral with wheels 
blocked etc.) it will tell you if the starter is the problem.
  Otherwise, to check if you have a battery drain with everything switched 
off, connect a test light between your battery positive terminal and the 
disconnected positive lead.  If the light glows with everything turned off, 
something is draining your battery.  Disconnect things that you suspect until 
the light goes out.
