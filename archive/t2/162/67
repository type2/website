Noise when clutch not depressed?  I get a "referred noise" that changes
when the shift lever is pushed to the side; had it for years; changing
the front bushing did a lot to remove it.  The rear bushings are not
present, so I still get some noise (tranny vibration?).
    If your cltch cable is too tight (as in your lining wore on the
clutch disk) you may be always contacting the throwout bearing.  Make
sure there is free play before hitting the bearing.  I check with a hand
on the pesal, not a foot.
