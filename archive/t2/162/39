Mark,

As a general rule, with orignial heads, the valve stems should be at the
same level.  The problem is that these days, when the youngest aircooled
van there is is old enough to vote and in most cases is on its second
engine and third set of heads... well, I have seen freshly rebuit heads
with valve stems that are 2-3mm out of line.

With the rest of the symptoms as you describe, however, if your valve
stems don't line up, then I think you are well on your way to discovering
the cause of your missing compression.
