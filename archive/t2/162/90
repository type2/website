Subject: FI problem, engine starts, runs for a minute, dies.

Hello List.

I recently rebuilt my 1800cc Fuel Injected type4. It fired right up on the
first attempt and ran for a good 5 minutes until i shut it down. Since
then, I haven't been able to get it to run for more than a few minutes. 

It will run great, throttle works perfect, then it will just die,
seemingly no matter how much gas im giving it. It will do it at idle and
also has done it around 2000rpms. Just dies, just like you switch the key
off. When restarting somtimes it starts right up and runs for like 30
seconds and does it again, others it just fires for a few revs (fast) and
dies again.

My first idea was that the problem was a vaccum leak. I clamped down some
vacuum lines that are common problems. In doing so, I noticed a that the
#2 injector was leaking, both at the connection to the fuel rail  and the
connector to the injector (that little tube inbetween). This is something
i plan to fix immedeately, but I'm not sure that its related.
Could it be? Othewise the
vacuum system looks good, no obvious leaks and the brake booster is not
connected. However, I haven't done the starter fluid check ( i don't like
doing that). 

My guess is that something (like the aux air) is shutting off air to the
engine when its not supposed to. I checked the troubleshoot manual for
L-jet but didn't really help, so i look to the list for advise. 


thanks,
