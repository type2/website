I wonder if all the used car dealers know that
they are infringing upon VW's rights by selling
merchandise with VW (tm) badges affixed...

Or if Haynes knows it is not allowed to
photograph a VW (tm) in its repair manuals...

Or if all the photographers know they are not
allowed to photograph any VW (tm)...

Or if all the products that have been named
"buggy" (tm?  you gotta be kidding) know that
they are infringing on VW's (tm) intention to
maybe use that name in the future...

Or if germans know that they cannot use their
word for "folks" ...

Or if VWOA (tm) knows it can kiss my butt.  One
of these days, I'll research whether people sued
(I mean sued-- not sent a letter or email) can
receive attorneys fees when they prevail over
VWOA (tm).

Peace and blessings,
