Subject: Some seat repair pics

I repaired one of my front seats on the weekend.  My hat off to anyone doing
upholstery repair for a living.

The old seats were down to springs and I got so used to it that I couldn't
believe the difference at first.  I did discover that the original padding
had foam sandwiched in between the horsehair (another VW special) which the
repros didn't have so the repro seat padding is probably firmer than the
original.  I think they may last longer though before they disintegrate into
"tabacco".

My final opinion: firm.

I went with the horsehair because I'm a sucker for original and too many
messages in the archive said that foam overstuffed the seat.  The horsehair
is a perfect fit especially if you are worrying about stressing the original
fabric.
