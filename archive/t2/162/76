Sounds like a mild lean miss. Begins after the rich start-up time is over. 
T4's tend to run lean. What do your plugs and tail pipe look like?

With no EGR your engine tends to run leaner. Also if the "disconnected" EGR 
is leaking air you will run leaner for sure. Block it at the air manifold 
EGR port as well as at the sample port.

I back off a degree on my stock distributor idle timing (7.5 to 6.5 BTDC) to 
compensate for no EGR. It makes me feel better.

Vacuum leaks in the brake assist line.

Intermittent fuel pump dropout, double relay. Should measure approx 60 ohms 
to ground from pin 36 on the the mass flow sensor cable. 100 ohms is way too 
high. This relay resistor can be replaced. BTW fuel pressure does make a 
difference.

Misadjusted C0 (top of the mass flow sensor). Try a turn clockwise for 
effect.  If this helps follow up with a gas analyzer idle alignment.

Also I found a non stock muffler caused a leaner running condition.

I am sure there are many other possibilities.  Hope these help.
