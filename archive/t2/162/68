Subject: Re: [T2] VWOA Trademark Licensing Program

I don't know if Ford is as protective about their logo with the T-Bird
crowd, but Harley-Davidson employs a virtual army of lawyers to harass
anyone using their logos. Harley's devotees approach religious fanaticism
regarding the marque, but that doesn't stop H-D from releasing the flying
monkey lawyers on shops such as "The Hog Farm" in some jerkwater burg. I
wouldn't be surprised if their lawyers try order tattoo artists to pay
licensing agreements or try to collect royalties from the Hell's Angels for
member's tattoos.
Perhaps the old joke: If Harley had as many engineers as they do lawyers,
maybe they could build a better bike, could be adapted to VW for their heavy
handed tactics.
