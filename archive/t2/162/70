Ray,

As someone else said, if you have to keep screwing the nut on, then the
cable is too long.  Wearing clutch means letting the nut out, not in.  I
have *never* had to loosen the nut.  the cables stretch (and break) way
faster than the clutch wears.  Generally the sign that you need a new
clutch is that it begins to slip.  hear the engine race!  watch the speedo
crawl toward 55!!!  Replace the clutch disc!!!!!  For a cable that is
too long, tho, replace the cable.
