       In my ongoing quest to get my 73 Bus running right after its =
rebuild I ask you this question. Does the R/H stock solex 34 PDSIT-2/3 =
carb have an accelerator injector tube? This is the bent brass tube you =
see down the throat of the L/H carb but I don't have one in the right. =
Is there supposed to be one?!
  Thanks All.
