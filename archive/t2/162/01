             Hi All.

Well I finally got the engine running good in the Contraption.(1700cc =
dual Solex)
Now a prob arises! While adjusting dwell I stripped the adjusting screw =
hole in the moveable plate in the distributor! Has anyone else done this =
and what was your fix?
I pulled the distributor and cleaned the threads of the screw and was =
able to retighten it adding a little Loctite to the threads. I'm afraid =
if it lets go it'll leave me stranded. How about opening up the hole and =
retapping it with a different screw?
Not sure of the thread size in there now. I'm sure it's metric. I was =
checking my Imperial tap set and an 8-32 NC seems the next step up =
although then I'd have a Bastard distributor. Any thoughts?

Thanks
