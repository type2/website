Okay, here's the scoop, and the price...

The '68-79 Bentley manual is NOT available on CD-ROM, nor are there any
plans to offer it in the near future. It is way, way on the back burner
according to the sales manager at Bentley, with whom I spoke on Friday.

What _is_ available (and might have been mistaken by some as the above
manual), is the 1969-1979 official VW microfiche on CD-ROM.  This 2-volume
set contains actual scans of actual microfiche, minor scratches and all.  It
covers all aircooled VW models (types 1,2,3,4) thru '79.  Because it is from
the original fiche, it will show part numbers etc. that even the current VW
Etka disc would not.  It also contains wiring diagrams for all models.

The CD's use Bentley's eBahn software (included), for searching, etc. but
the fiche files themselves are PDF's. (Bentley has warned me that due to the
size of the files, access is quite slow.)  Since it is possible to read .pdf
files in Mac, etc. I asked whether the pdf's could be accessed from the disc
without the use of eBahn (thereby working on a non-Windows PC), and was told
no.  Supposedly, even though they are pdf files, they are not saved as .pdf
file extensions.  I don't know if Bentley merely renamed the extensions to
"force" you to use their eBahn reader or whether it's more than that.  So,
knowing that these are pdf's,  I would guess that there might be a way to
make one read in Mac, but I certainly wouldn't guarantee it (and Bentley
won't support it),.  Therefore we'll have to call it Windows-only
until/unless a listmember proves otherwise.  Full details on this disk are
at http://www.bentleypublishers.com/product.htm?code=VFAC .

The microfiche CD-ROM is $99.95 from Bentley.  I can offer five, and only
five, copies to listmembers at $69.95.  This will be offered to the first
five people who email me directly.

PS  Steve, I'm assuming one of them will go to you?  Alternatively, I might
be able to get the whole 12 volume set for around $425 if you really want it
and let me know today.
