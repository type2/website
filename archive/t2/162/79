Hi Juan,
     I too have a '70, and have experienced the very same.  If you KNOW your 
master cyl. is O.K., then it is a front wheel cylinder.  I had even pulled 
the drums and no visible leak to be found.  The cylinder was actually 
'breathing' through the dust boot!  CHange the cylinders on the side 
opposite from the side pulling hard.  That should solve the problem.
