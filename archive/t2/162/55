If the CVs were bad, it would only make the sound when you were rolling, right?

Check the mount--that big rubber block at the front of the tranny, see what 
that looks like. Also check the little coupler thingy right up there, it's 
like a metal square with a rubber block inside it.

Another possibly is that it could be coming from the front shifter mechanism.

If they're OK, you'll have to find the gear to pull the engine/tranny.
