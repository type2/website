Subject: New Clutch, or What?

I'm pretty sure I need a new clutch.  Why?  The adjuster nut on the =
clutch cable is screwed all the way in and can't be adjusted any more.  =
So, am I correct that its just time for a new clutch?

Second question, it appears that there are clutches for '64-'70 that =
have a "release collar" and for '71 that doesn't have the release =
collar.  Is there some way I can tell which one I need before I tear =
everything apart?  Or should I just buy both and then return what I =
don't need?

BTW, the van in quesiton is a '71 westy but I'm not sure if the tranny =
is original.

Thanks,

Hal
