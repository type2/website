I've heard the same thing about the music industry.  If someone from BMG
happens into your place of business and hears even the radio playing, he
sicks his big dogs on you for using the music(without license) to persuade
people to buy whatever it is you are selling.

If someone actually ever got sued over any of this nonsense, maybe we could
pull a Preston Tucker on the case.  When the trial is underway, everybody
bring their aircooled VW to the courthouse and drive around the block time
and again to prove OUR point.
