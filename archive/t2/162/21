That is correct for your auto trans bus. It should have part number 022 133
551C on it. The large disc style pictured in the Bentley is the manual trans
one, it ends with a B.
You should have a U shaped rubber hose between it and the big S with part
number 022 201 919C on it.

What is wrong with your valve?
