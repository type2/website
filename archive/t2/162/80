So a friend of mine was trying to remove the heads from his type 4, and =
three of the four nuts on the top of the head are pretty coroded on. =
While trying to turn these three nuts off, the stud came free first. The =
bently makes reference to holding the studs steady while trying to take =
off the head nuts, but makes no mention of what this would be.

He has tried putting vice grips on the studs, but can't get a good =
enough grip to get the nuts off the stud. Where does one go from here? =
He is hoping not to have to take the jugs off the pistons. Does that =
have to be done to replace the horrible corroded and frozen studs? They =
won't come out through the jug.

He said the engine was making terrible racket and that it sounded like =
it was comming from number 3. I can't turn the engine by hand very far =
in either direction without it binding up, so I suspect a dropped valve =
seat. So he pulled it, but didn't do a compression test first.=20

The bottom end suposedly was redone five years ago, so who know what =
kind of shape it is in now. I recomended taking it all apart to inspect =
the bottom end, but he was a little hesitant. Thoughts on just doing the =
top end on an unknown motor. Just asking for toruble I think, but what =
do I know?

Thanks,
