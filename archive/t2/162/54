Dear List,

Have a problem with my brakes,  First, I must admit that my 1970 Westy =
is the first vehicle I've owned without at least front disks or a vacuum =
assist.  So I'm not sure if what I'm experience is actually a problem or =
just par for the course.  First,  my brakes do not provide a sense of =
confidence, seems like I really got to step on the pedal to slow down in =
any meaningful way.  Secondly, occasionally (very intermittent) when I =
hit the brakes the van will pull violently to the right and I must =
counter steer to the left to maintain a straight line.  I've tried =
bleeding the system but it hasn't helped.  I read the archives and =
thought the left front brake line might be clogged but wasn't able to =
determine that no rectify it by bleeding the system.  Bleeding did seem =
to give the pedal a firmer feel though.

Is this typical? if not any ideas on what to do next?

thanks,

Juan
