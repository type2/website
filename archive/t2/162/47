Subject: Re: [T2] New Clutch, or What?

If the clutch is not slipping or wasted, I have been known to cheat and add a
few washers to the bowden tube. Large center hole washers to put a little more
bow in the tube......  Gives you more threads on the adjustment.

I'm pretty sure I need a new clutch.  Why?  The adjuster nut on the clutch
cable is screwed all the way in and can't be adjusted any more.  So, am I
correct that its just time for a new clutch?

Second question, it appears that there are clutches for '64-'70 that have a
"release collar" and for '71 that doesn't have the release collar.  Is there
some way I can tell which one I need before I tear everything apart?  Or
should I just buy both and then return what I don't need?

BTW, the van in quesiton is a '71 westy but I'm not sure if the tranny is
original.
