Subject: Valve question

The Van:  82 Vanagon Westfalia, 2L Type IV motor.

    Spent part of the day trying to track down the total lack of compression
in the #1 cylinder.  I believe it to be a valve related problem as the
crankcase back pressure is seemingly normal and a bit of oil in the cylinder
make no difference.
    Pulled the valve cover of and noticed nothing major amiss.  Pulled the
rocker assembly off and have a question about what I should be seeing when I
look at the valve ends.  Should both the intake and the exhaust be at
approximately the same level?  In other words, are both valve stems the same
length?  As it sits right now the intake is sitting about 3/16" further out
than the exhaust.

Have I found my culprit???
