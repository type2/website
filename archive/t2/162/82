Good call.  Fascist German car company?  Who'da thunk it?  This whole 
thing is just making me angry.  It's my car.  I didn't pay them for it, 
but someone did.  Does that mean that if i want to sell it to someone, i 
have to ask them if it's ok?  no way.  It's mine, i bought it. and if i 
want to take part of it and make it a clock and sell it, that's my 
business.  There's no rule that says you can't sell parts off your own 
car.  Damn greedy bastards.  I hope they do sue someone, so the court 
can tell them where to go.  Not to mention the road trip involved.  

Oh, here's a link to a picture i once found and saved because i thought 
it was just strange, but it seems to make sense now:

 From a kid who saw an indian peace sign at a museum and then drew it on 
a notebook in 6th grade and got called a nazi, goodnight.
