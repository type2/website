Subject: new single vaccum advance dist. question.

Hey Everyone.

MY 72 camper is up and running now thanks to Kurt Mezger and the guys (and Lady) at Vintage Performance. (www.vintageperformance.net)  They put in a new alternator for me and helped me get the motor timed right for the new distributor I recieved from aircooled.net.  It is the single vaccum advance one aircooled.net suggest for webber progressive carb applications.  

My question is, Kurt and the guys at vintage performance say that the suggested specs for the distributor is way to hot for my new AVP type IV engine.  Aircooled.net said to time the engine to 7.5 before at idle, 32 degrees advance with vaccum disconnected and 42-45 connected.  Is this right?

We turned the dist back a bit from what aircooled.net told me.  It ran better that way.  Any thoughts?

Thanks,
Ed Hilton

PS  If you're in the Philly area, stop by vintage performance.  They have a souped up bug there that has a NOS system (Nitrous Oxide, not New/old stock)!  I couldn't talk them into NOS for my bus though...hmmm  that would be fun, helpful up those long hills.
