Subject: carbs leaking?

hi everyone...workin on my buddies type4 73transporter. he just put in a tranny and we're tryin to get his dual carbs set up now. we both have very little knowledge of workin on carburators. so we could use a little help. 
he has dual solex34 on it. and where we're currently having problems, is with a gas leak, we believe, to be coming from the linkage out of the front of the throttle body. 
when we had it started,the idle was real low, and we were not able to get it adjusted with the idle screw.
but now that we've noticed this gas leak, we are definately hesitant to start her back up before we figure out why it's leaking. 
any help that u can pass our way, would of course, be much appreciated. 
*shine on* -Chris
