Get an ammeter (good VOM's usually have this function to at least 5
amps).  In the dark, repeatedly touch the positive lead briefly onto the
+ terminal- the size of the spark will tell you the load.  Put the VOM
between the pos terminal and the lead when it's set to ammeter function-
will tell you the draw.   Hmmm- how big a draw will drain a 60 amp hr
battery to below 9 volts in 2 days?
