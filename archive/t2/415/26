Subject: Just want to die with my (cv) boots on

Replacing my cv boots (1974) with the German kit from Bus Depot and I 
can't seem to get the first boot to slide over the first shoulder at 
the spline. I don't recall having this trouble with the other set, but 
that was months ago.

I've applied a modest amount of grease, and I did the twist...but still 
no go.

I just noticed in Bentley where it says to tape the spline so as not to 
harm the boot (oops). I'm going to try this next, see how it goes. I'm 
afraid this will just add several mils to an already too-tight spot.

Anybody else have this problem...and a solution?
