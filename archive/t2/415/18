Subject: Re:smelly noisy brakes + loss of power

Kyle,
    In recent posts to the Type2 list you reported that it seems like
your bus has had a loss of engine power and that there is a smell
coming from your brakes.

    Well here's a wild guess that ties both problems together.  I'm
guessing that your brakes are dragging.  That would make it seem like
you have a loss of power and if your wheels are getting hot you might
very well smell that.
    After you drive your bus give it a wakaround inspection to see if
the wheels are hot.  Be careful as the wheels could get hot enough to
burn your hands.  Approach each one as if it were hot and then
determine if it is or not.  If the brakes are dragging it could be
caused by a number of different reasons.  Solve that and you may solve
your power problem too.
