Subject: h2o cooled and auto tranny

ok guru's, who can answer my next question.  i have the autotranny bus now
and am still thinking i want to go with a h2o motor.  is this even
possible, is the tranny too weak or does KEP even make a plate to do such a
crazy thing?

next ?  can i have FI with an auto tranny?
