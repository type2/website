Hello,

With mine, I used a Dremel tool with the snake like
extension that you can get for it. The extension
allows you to wire brush quite a bit of the inside of
the vent because it fits through the vent slots. I
used that with a pencil shaped wire brush attachment
and some paint stripper. I will spray Por-15 grey to
cover the area and then I will use Por-15 Whitecote to
finish it. I will mask off the outside of the vent so
no Por-15 gets on it. I will just paint the outside of
the vent with regular automotive paint when I paint
the rest of the bus. 

Good Luck!
