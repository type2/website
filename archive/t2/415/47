Subject: Hillbilly Cruise Control

While driving around the beautiful state of West Virginia, my accelator begins
to develop a mind of its own.  When I take my foot off the gas, the bus keeps
going along at a merry clip.  A friend calls it "hillbilly cruise control."
When I stop at a traffic light (which thankfully are rare in W.V.) the engine
is loud, though not deafening.

This is dangerous, because on our mountainous roads I need to downshift to
slow the bus, but downshifting doesn't slow the bus when I am in hillbilly
cruise control.

Did I mention this is a 1979 Westy?  Anyhow, when I go back to the engine
compartment, and pull on the little piece to which the accelator cable is
bolted, the roaring engine quiets to a whisper.  But the problem immediately
repeats itself.

My "hillbilly fix" was to hook a spring onto the accelarator clamp piece, and
attach it to something else in the engine that was in the right location.
That helped a little, but now I have put a huge spring in, and while the
roaring is much reduced, the accelerator is hard to press and I am afraid I
will snap the accelarator cable.  (I should mention, this new spring is in
addition to the spring put in by the factory, which attaches to a little arm
on the throttle assembly.)

I just spent about an hour in the archives and library.  I found some good
info, but each case seems different, and I am a little overwhelmed where to
start.  My mechanical skills are pretty rudimentary.  Where should I start?
What to check first?

Thanks to one and all!
