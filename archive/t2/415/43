Subject: distributor suicide

Any thoughts on what is going on here? 

Short version:

There are tons of metal flakes/dust inside of my distributor cap. It
doesn't look like the rotor is hitting anything, I think the distributor
is literally eating itself alive. Is there any salvaging it, or is that
the sign that it is finally caput? 

The whole story:

I just put in a Crane electronic ignition system, and after resetting
the optical trigger about a dozen times, I still have this huge loss of
power. You can put the petal to the metal, but the bus just slowly works
its way up. I can still get to highway speeds, it just takes me much
longer, and instead of cruzing up hills, I gradually putter down to
about 50 mph till I get over the hump.

Now when I keep opening the distributor cap to adjust the trigger again,
thinking that is the cause, I keep seeing all of these metal flakes
inside of the cap. It is getting worse and worse. When I had the
distributor out the first time, I noticed that if you attempt to turn it
manually outside of the motor, it makes these terrible metal-grinding on
metal sounds at some angles. I think my distributor is killing itself
somehow, but what can I do about it?

Before I installed the Crane ignition, I had full power, no issues. Now,
I am missing a lot of power, and there is metal dust in the distributor
cap. 

*sigh* that's what I get for not leaving well enough alone.
