Just in case you were wondering I found a wide assortment of these kits at
the Pep-Boys store in Annapolis, MD. I have found better luck using them as
my FLAPS than any other store in the DC/Northern VA area. Worth the drive
IMHO. The store is tidy, everything is on the wall where it's label says it
should be. There are actually a few guys who know something about parts
there, and almost everyone there speaks very good english. (I need a lot of
work on my spanish)

Thanks for all the replies though,
