Subject: RE: distributor suicide

I had this thing happen on my 61 Opel that uses a similar Bosch distributor:
One of the springs that hold the weights broke. So one weight was rubbing on
the distributor wall wearing a groove into the case and eating that bearing,
resulting in metal flakes all over the distributor. This led to a loss in
power in the Opel too: all the little flakes were shortening the sparks
resulting in timing to vary.

Sounds like the Crane was only a bandaid (or Verschlimmbesserung) in the
first place for a distributor that was already eating itself up at that
point. If you still had points you would not be moving at all, because the
flakes would shorten the points giving you a dwell of 90 degrees.

Basically, it is kaputt. You may be able to salvage the distributor itself,
but you do need a second one to gut it. You need it as a donor for the
weights and the springs. Should be the same as (or very close to) your old
one as the weight/spring combination determines centrifugal advance.

Any thoughts on what is going on here?

There are tons of metal flakes/dust inside of my distributor cap. It doesn't
look like the rotor is hitting anything, I think the distributor is
literally eating itself alive. Is there any salvaging it, or is that the
sign that it is finally caput?
