phil,

is the absence of a reply from karl, the real guru of type 2 tin, the short
answer is yes, no and maybe.

there are lots of common parts, but there are lots of different ones as
well. as a whole, the answer is no, the whole package will not interchange.
without going into to much detail, some of the parts are common, some are
different.

the maybe applies because if you use 72-74 exhaust on the 78 motor, now it
will almost all work, except the hot air pipes. most of the different parts
are somehow connected to the differences between 72-74 and 75-78 exhaust.

oh yeah, the alternator support bracket is different too. it bolts to the
heater box, so it is different for the different heater box types.
