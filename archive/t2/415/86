    While doing this put your googles on and take an air blower , blow 
everything off, then P B blaster all moving parts, then spray lube (Wurth HMS2000 
works for me) , now check the throttle . If you can get under the bus then also 
check the tube(if its stillthere) and make sure the cable isn't fraying or 
binding, now while you are under there lube the clutch cable also. Play with it 
you'll figure it out. Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  salem Import Service
