chris,

no, this is not correct. all VW distributors have mechanical advance. well,
maybe not all, i haven't seen them all, but all that i know of. most vacuum
advance units are Single Vacuum, Dual Advance, hence the acronym SVDA.
single vacuum refers to the vacuum canister having one nipple. dual advance
refers to the fact that they get advance from dual sources, the vacuum
canister and the mechanical system of weights. the SVDA from aircooled is a
good replacement for any bus distributor with single vacuum.

some late bus and beetle distributors have two vacuum circuits, one for
advance and one for retard. these can be called DVDA units.

the rebuilt SVDA distributors from aircooled are well made and can be
specified with an advance curve which is suited to your vehicle. this is one
advantage of these units over other available replacement distributors.
