Subject: elec ignition ?'s

 Hello,

Well, I have my new Crane ignition system installed, and I think I have
everything hooked up correctly - however now I have a sudden loss of
power it seems. Any clues as to what would be causing that? 

Also, it does not fire right away. It fired quicker on points I think.
The timing appears to be spot on, and I made sure that the edge of the
optical trigger hits the first part of the window when at 7.5 before
TDC. 

Thoughts, tips, clues?
