Well I still recommend the 5$ standard ignition for someone looking for a
QUICK & EASY way to install new ignition switch at the front.  Obviously
there are many types of van owners, and really it depends on the time and
money you want to put into issues as they arrise.

All I know is last time I opened up the steering column I began to get
horn-contact issues that have remained present for a couple years.
Speaking from experience, I'd say a universal gizmo is an excellent way to
get out of a jam.  But hey, we're all different and some are more picky
with their van(s) than others.

Keep in mind no drilling in required by using the lighter location, and you
can always go to the more expensive and time-consuming repair later.... if
you feel you need the 'real' switch.  The 5$ part always makes a good spare
if you choose not to use it forever....

Good luck,
Shawn.
