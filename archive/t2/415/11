the spring should never be messed with, there is an air ajustment screw
but you really need an exhaust analyzer to accurately adjust that.

without knowing what was done it is hard to know what to tell you

you need to find someone who has an exhaust gas analyzer or buy one but
they are $$$  you can never get those adjustments right without one...

I get about 16-17 in town push 19 on the road (20 downhill with a
tailwind)

yes, and you adjust it when you have an exhaust gas analyzer and someone
who knows how to adjust it, they glue the lid shut for a reason

sorry if this isn't the answer you were looking for
