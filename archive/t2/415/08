Subject: 71 Westy wood "headliner" re-staining ????

Hi all....

the wood "headliner in my 71 Westy is peeling, 
probably due to the heat over the years

what do I need to do to re-stain it, or varnish it

Home Depot stuff......

I have been sanding off the flacking old varnish, going the direction of the 
paneling....

do I need to get it all off ?  I know the flacking stuff but what about the 
non-flacking stuff....

just want it to look nice , as close as possible to original, but "close" is 
good enough

thanks for your help.......
