With my last FI connector problem, I ended up just cutting it off and going
to the local scrapyard in search of a replacement.  You could ask the
people if they've got any old VWs or Audis, and try the connector for a
match.

In my last search, they had an old Jetta at the yard that was on the scrap
table w/ the needed connector.
