Subject: Phish? (late friday question ...)

Sorry about the irrelevance of this topic ... but I figured I might stretch 
it and give it a shot.

I'm going to see Phish at the Gorge in Washington on the 12th and 13th of 
this month.  Anyone else going?

If my engine was in my van I'd suggest a caravan or ... well something ... 
maybe just a friendly meeting.  But, since it doesn't look like the van will 
be up for this weekend, does anyone have an extra seat down to George 
Washington for me?

Thanks!
- Ian
