Subject: Re: [T2] ingition switch

Here's a great how-to link on a ingition switch replacement.  As far as 
I know a 78 is virtually the same as your 75.

I'm the kind of person who absolutely loathes a jimmy-rig electrical 
repair for various reasons.  So instead of cutting wires, buying a 
universal something, or screwing things into your dash, I strongly 
reccomend that you purchase a new ignition switch.  You'll feel much 
better if you just do things the right way.  You can still buy the 
switches new or used, sometimes locally and always mail order.  The 
correct way of doing will be easier, definately give you less trouble, 
and keep your bus looking like a bus.

If you insist on adding the toggle switch you'll have to force yourself 
into buying the bentely and looking at some wiring diagrams.  Most bus 
owners consider the book a must anyway.  A test light and voltmeter 
would be helpful to be sure your cutting up in all the right places.  I 
imagine the switch would come with some very generic instructions but I 
personally have no advice except not to do it.
