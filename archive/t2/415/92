Subject: ignition switch

Does the key turn?  Or not?  If the key turns there is no drilling required
either to fix the part.  The problem would be in the electrical portion.
The electrical portion can be fixed by ordering the switch ( I got mine from
Advance Auto $20, as Bus depot did not have it, Go figure)

Remove bottom plate from steering wheel, on 72 and 73 this is only 3 or 4
screws.  Remove set screw from ignition housing.  Remove plastic end from
ignition switch , the part the wires go to and the part you got at Advance.
Cut about 5 wires (same colors, hopefully as the new one)  Ignore the grey
wire on new switch as it is for accessory.  Replace plastic part back in
ignition, replace set screw, replace bottom plate and screws.  Yes, it's
that easy!!!

This works for a 72 and 73, never tried on other models.

Hope this helps...
