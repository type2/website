Subject: does anybody know?

I know I already asked this, but noone answered. And since it was right 
before July 4th I figured I'd try one more time. Sorry if you already read 
this, but I really need to know. I'm going broke.
I had a spring in my air intake sensor box adjusted in CA. It was supposed 
to make my bus use more gas, but make it run cooler. It was to help get over 
the Rockies. Well, my gas mileage sucks. I need to adjust the spring back. 
It isn't worth it. I get like 14 mpg.
Does anyone know what this spring is or how to adjust it.
Thanks.
