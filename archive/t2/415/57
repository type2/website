Subject: cleaning a gas tank, recommended products, advice..

I've done everything i can think of to get my bus
running right. (it sat idle for 7-8 yrs)
Im rebuilding the carb today, but ive noticed that the
new 91 gas i put in it appears a darker color, I
compared the 91 to 87 and noticed its considerably
darker then the 87, is this normal??

Im thinking since it sat so long, is the gas tank
somehow tarnished or something?

would it be adviceable to simply drop the tank and
clean it??

What is a good solvent/cleaner or whatever to use on
these things, I have never done anything like this
before..

I need to get my bus on the road, PLEASE HELP
!!!!!!!!!


thanx,
robert
