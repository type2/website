Subject: Extra wire in Alternator Harness

I am reinstalling my engine in SnoopyBus (mostly a 73 with a 2L)  and found
a wire loose and can't find it on the Bentley Wiring diagram  :(

IT is the black wire in the harness that goes to the alternator.  (the hi
output alternator) the other 3 wires go to a plug in that goes directly into
back of alternator.  Anyone know where the black wire that is in this same
harness goes?  OR what it is for?  The other end of this wire goes to a
black rectangular VW connector and has a male end.  It looks like it
connects to another wire that heads up to front in main wiring harness.

In the Bentley the best I can come up with is the connector is T1b (which
just says wire connector, single in engine compartment.)  Big help huh...And
it goes to a red circle 14 ,which is not on legend  :(


Any ideas?

Peace Brother and Sisters,
Snoopy
