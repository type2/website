Subject: Wring question

Working on the front signals of my 69  beetle Sedan  today - got the pass
side working nicely- blinks great - the driver side however blinks and
lights with the driving lights turned on it is very dim compared to the
other side - the bulb is the 1157 dual but it only lights up on one filament
( the taller one  On the other side the short boy blinks and the tall boy
lights with the headlamps-) no matter whether its lights,blinker or hazard-
checked the bulb - ok - the wires are bringing power but it seems not
enough- seems to be operating very weakly - any suggestions on what to look
at - It makes the blinking noise - the indicator in the car blinks with the
pass side and flicks on only once with the driver - still makes the blinker
noise -
The other issue with them is grounding - the wiring diagram shows them
grounded- I don't have a ground terminal on these - Are they supposed to be
grounded ? If so how and where ?

Thanks
