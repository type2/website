I have a camper light switch (looks just like the headlight switch but it'
s to the right of the steering wheel). Dunno know what that toggle switch

stuff first.)

switch. I haven't blown myself up yet.

Sorry I couldn't be more help. You have discovered the great mysteries of 
the Adventurewagen.
