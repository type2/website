Subject: adventurewagen ?'s

ok, i got the 73 adventurewagen home no i am seeking knowledge from you
great gurus of the bay busses.  i have several switches that while they may
be working i can't seem to make them do anything.  the 2 fans, the camper
lights and the toggle switch on the dash seem to do nothing.  i do know my
aux battery is dead as the volt meter on the side of the fridge says so.
their is a switch on the upper cabinet that seems to have something to do
with the propane and i have yet to switch it as i'm really unsure of it's
function and don't want to screw anything up.  so if one of you could
please tell me what i'm doing with this then i would be most greatful.

as an aside, i have a nice adventure top on my 72 right now that anyone can
have for 100$.  i have made a nice wood headliner for it and it would be
totally cool for anyone who is having trouble with their sunroof and want's
to camp instead.  i can't deliver it as i have no truck anymore but i
brought it home in the back of a toyota p/u the wife used to own so if you
have something that size or bigger then your set.  btw, i'm in the long
beach area of so. cal.  and i'll be more than happy to help you load her
up.
