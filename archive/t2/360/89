Doubt if this is related.

No. 1) Verify battery cables are clean and tight both ends, and also the 
ground strap at the front of the tranny, and also that the starter mounting 
bolts are tight.

No. 2) Verify battery voltage. Minimum of 12.5 volts at rest. If not, 
charge battery and retest. If that fixes it, test the alternator/generator.

No. 3) If 1 and 2 are good, then jump the big lug to the ignition switch 
wire terminal, both at the starter motor, with a piece of 10 ga wire. If 
the starter works, then verify voltage from the ignition switch to the starter.
