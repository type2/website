Subject: RE: [T2] Terrible engine noise????

check to see if something has been pulled into the fan or rubbing the
alt or belt

- I don't *think* that is it, just because the noise goes too well along
with the firing of the motor. It's pouring rain out right now, but I
think I will head down there and see what I can see. Maybe it will just
be gone this morning! (I wish)


can you determine where in the motor it is coming from?
have you lost any power?
does it run differently or just noise??

I'll see if I can figure just that out.
