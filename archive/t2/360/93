I'm not sure what year you are referring, however if you mean 72-79...

Bus Depot was the only supplier I could find them at and when I got them
they were cut the wrong length. The manufacturer was supposed to redo it but
I haven't heard an update on that in 2 months.

Maybe Ron could fill us in?

As you can see it's neither half the length or full length. 411 941 123 is
the part number.

You are supposed to need two per taillight for a total of four.
