Subject: master cyl woes

Well, motor's back in thr frankenbus and running great. Might as well make
it stop too. Sooo, can anybody tell me the difference between a 68-69 master
cyl and a 70, I mean, something other than the o my god you must be kidding
difference in price. Anybody make a rebuild kit?
thanks all
