Subject: Drain Plug Oil Temp Wire Routing

Greetings List -

I have a Drain Plug Oil Temp sender, and am wondering how any of you routed 
the wiring down to the plug. I have the (rest of) the wire running down the 
passenger side of the '69 Westy.

In thru the motor compartment and down from there somehow?

Thanks -

Mike & Itch
