Subject: Terrible engine noise????

Ok, I drive someplace last night, park for 5 minutes, come back out,
fire it up, and suddenly it sounds like I have a baseball card inside of
my motor, that makes a loud clacking sound as the RPM's increase. I just
checked the oil level before I went out, and that seems to be ok. What
in god's name is this terrible new sound? 

The best way I can describe it is to say it sounds like a baseball cards
in your spokes.. Loud clacking sound that seems to go along with the
pace of the motor. 

I have been pretty paranoid about the motor lately possibly needing a
rebuild, and I think that is what this has finally come to. =(

Now, how to finance it? I guess I might have to take that BA6 project
along with me to Kelley park this weekend and try to get rid if it there
somehow. 

Any advice as to what this could be? I don't feel like I have any loss
of power, but it sounds really wrong. 

Scared poo-less,
