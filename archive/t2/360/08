Subject: Pass Smog Forever

Here's a little tip from the Hillbilly State.

Arkansas requires neither smog nor safety inspections. All you California
people have to do is re-register your vehicles in Arkansas and you are home
free!! Renewing your registration can be done via the mail. I don't know how
stringent they are in your proving residency status.

Just a thought. I keep reading posts from folks agonizing over their smog
inspection woes.
