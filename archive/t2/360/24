Subject: Re: [T2] louder horn

Hiya Willis,

Profit from my experience, if you will.  Like you I wanted to "boost" the 
sound of my stock horn.  I thought I might buy an aftermarket horn at my 
local FLAPS and team it up with my present horn.  I'd wire up it up in dual 
horn package much like one would find on a Karmann Ghia.  However, I found 
that the aftermarket horns (and they are Hella horns) were all a generic Bug 
sound.  The original Type 2 is a little "throatier".  So I dumped the idea of 
doing an aftermarket horn.  I visited a few local boneyards and turned up a 
Type 2 horn.  Turned out to be a non-worker, so I pulled a couple of horns 
off a VW Fox.  I still wanted to do the dual horn thing so I tried wiring up 
the Fox horns.  Sounded just like a piece of Detroit iron.  Then I tried my 
existing Type 2 horn with the lower range Fox horn.  Not bad, but still 
pretty domestic.  Finally I tried the Type 2 horn and the higher pitched Fox 
horn.  Cool!  Reminds me of a French Horn,  Definitely a "European" sound.  
And louder than blazes.
