Subject: Re: [T2] Broken into again. (fed up)

Sorry to hear about that. I too have been victim of the dreaded bus
break-in. I was moving. Almost everything I owned was in that bus.
They took all of my tools, the stereo, and worse of all, all my tapes.
That wouldnt be so bad, but some were very personal, sounds of me as a
child, songs I made with friends, and the worst part about that
is that they have no use for that stuff!
To add insult to injury, I had locked the slider with a key, so they
couldnt open it even from the inside, so they decided to slit my screens.
Bastards.

Anyways, the truth is getting into a late model bus is well known.
The screwdiver trick on the vent window is so easy to do, I have been
known to do it.

Well there used to be a "lock" that could be put on a vent window. I
dont know where to get one nowdays, but I have seen them. Maybe
some one could point us to them?
