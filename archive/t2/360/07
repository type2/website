Subject: Mystery wires...

Uh Oh. I hate it when wires are left over. I'm not sure why I didn't label
them; maybe they were disconnected when I pulled the engine...or maybe not.

I'm seeking wisdom as to the disposition of two wires which come out of the
the FI harness very near the ECU end.  They are bundled together, have
female blade connectors, and they probably each used to have a long square
plastic protector around the connector.  The Bentley diagram doesn't show
these wires.  I'm wondering if one of them goes to the alternator harness to
provide power to the ECU?

I've already accounted for the FI ground wires, I think.  They come off the
other side of the harness, and there are three ground wires; one with it's
own connector, and two which share a connector.

I will have some unused wires since my heater blower and tach (TDC?) sensor
are not installed.

In Suspense,
