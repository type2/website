:-P

I believe you mean the thin washer on each end of the spring on the rocker shaft between each pair of rockers?
#26 in the 68-79 Bentley, section 5, page 31?

You have a 78, does UK type 4's use hydraulic lifters?  If yes, you should not be using the spring. Hydraulic
engines use a spacer, 2 wave washers, and 2 flat washers instead. In the same pic above, 11A is the spacer,
12A are the wave washers, and 12 are the flat washers.
