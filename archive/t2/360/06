Subject: Thanks!

Thanks everybody,
Thanks for the insight.  I do already have the hot start relay installed, so 
not having it isn't my problem.  I forgot to mention that in my post.
thanks for the other info I will see what i can do this weekend,
Rick

Oh yah, are there any suggestions for removing sheared bolts from the case 
with the engine still in the bus?
