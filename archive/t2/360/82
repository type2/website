Subject: Huston, we do not have ignition...

First, I replaced the headlamps and turn signal switch.  I've done nothing
else to the electrical wiring or circuits.

Last night while out shopping, sometimes turning the ignition key while
starting resulted in no response form the starter.  Two or three turns
later, the bus would start.  Today, a few minutes ago, I tried to start the
bus and failed.  There is a little change in the electric fuel pump's sound
when the key hits the start position, but not much.

Any connection between the headlight circuits and the starter's?

Everything else in the bus works, and I read the messages in the archive
about the after market installation of a relay down under, near the starter,
and the alternate installation of the relay near the battery.

Is the after-market relay the best route to go?  Right now I'm stuck here at
the house and a bit ticked that I can't run errands tonight.  I'd intended
to go look at bilge blowers this afternoon, but got sidelined by the "no
start" situation.
