Subject: Looking for a bare balljoint beam or comlete one for a Type1

I'm on the hunt for a bare beam to narrow, or a full beam if the price is
right. If anyone has one locally or close to Nanaimo, BC I'd be very
interested. Anyone going to the Puyallup swapmeet this month that might be
bringing one?
