Good Idea Robert--

But answer me this small glitch in this concept--

Where does one accquire an address in Ark?
Especially when he may be 2000 miles away--
Interesting concept--but sounds like an impossibility--

Here's a little tip from the Hillbilly State.
Arkansas requires neither smog nor safety inspections. All you
California people have to do is re-register your vehicles in Arkansas
and you are home free!! Renewing your registration can be done via the
mail. I don't know how stringent they are in your proving residency
status.
Just a thought. I keep reading posts from folks agonizing over their
smog inspection woes.
