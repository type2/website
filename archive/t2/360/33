Terry,, it isn't all that hard to get an address anywhere you want!

plenty of people have an address in another country that they get stuff sent to
then have it forwarded.  There is a cost involved of course.
Do you remember the adventures of Diana? She had to get a Tn. address, and
drivers license to be able to drive home.
