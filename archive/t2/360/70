Subject: Headlights

Upgraded the old incandescents on the bus to GE H6024 halogens, until I can
install the H4's (right nomenclature?).

Even though they're not eye-searing bright, they are a world above what was
in the bus before.  We adjusted them courtesy of a nearly white cinder block
wall (the seams made marking the positions easier), and I can finally see
where I'm driving.

I was appalled at the nearly non-existent output of the older lamps.  It was
almost like driving without headlights (which I was use to in the military,
but am now old enough to appreciate brightly lit highways and byways).

Now if I could just run down why the alternator light comes on dim when the
running lights are on, and gets a bit brighter when the headlights are
turned on (and a bit brighter still when flicking over to the high beams).
When the lights are on and I use the turn signals (the new t/s switch is
very nice), the light pulsates in time with the blinkers.

But they do all work!
