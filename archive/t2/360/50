Subject: Re: [T2] Type 4 rocker assembly Q

unless im wrong the washers act as spacers so that the tappet doesnt meet 
the valve stem dead on. The tappet is supposed to be slightly off center 
with the valve stem so that it (the valve) rotates and wears evenly. Or 
something like that. i cant remember where i read this so can someone else 
back me up?
