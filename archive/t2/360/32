I have been working on a 72 that I rescued from a
barnyard after sitting for 3 years. Its up and running
but the only time the headlights will work is when the
ignition switch is in the OFF position. Obviously,
this is exactly backwards of how it should be, they
work only when the ignition switch is in the ON
position. So, anyone know what may be happening here.
Matt Roberds, do you have any suggestions for me?
