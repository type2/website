Hi Mike,

VW designed the fan to push air through the system. This way the air in 
the pipes is always pressurized in comparison to the outside 
environment. So if there's a leak, the air flows out of the pipes, not 
in. This is important, as it helps keep exhaust fumes and engine smells 
out of the interior of the bus. If you have an inline fan drawing air 
forward then it will create a low pressure zone in the pipe "behind" 
it, increasing the likelyhood of drawing in unwanted fumes if there's a 
leak.

The original blower fan pushing air into the heater boxes could easily 
be adapted to pull air from the interior of the bus, which would help 
improve the heating efficiency, and you get fresh cabin air instead of 
potentially stinky engine compartment air. I haven't done this to my 
bus yet, but I'm considering it.

I'd suggest you get a replacement 77 blower from a local wrecker or 
bustedbus.com.

Happy trails,
