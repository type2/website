Subject: Re: [T2] Low compression problem found!

Just a little FYI:  You mentioned a problem with the EGR port.
It is NOT EGR. It is air injection. Two TOTALLY different emission systems.
EGR allows spent exhaust to enter the INTAKE to lower combustion temps to keep NoX emissions down.
Air injection allows fresh air into the EXHAUST to clean up hydrocarbons. The exhaust has unburnt fuel and
spark, but lacks fresh air.
