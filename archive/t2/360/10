The extra two wires you are looking at, with the female spade connecters, 
are probably the altitude compensation circuit.

You could hook a rheostat in there and make your bus run a bit richer. I 
think it's richer. I've seen a wiring diagram for that somewhere. It was of 
some interest to me when I had my bus in Colorado.
