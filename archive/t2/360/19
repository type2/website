Subject: Bilge blower Conversion Questions (& I _did_ surf the T2

I've gotten enough info from the Archives to do this, but I had a couple of
questions related to the installation:

1. My aux blower is completely shot.  I tried to turn it by hand tonight,
after flipping the lever got no response, and the fan turns with difficulty
and the fan motor seems to be turning and shifting in the housing.  I plan
on removing the aux fan completely, but wondered if I should simply install
a couple of filters on the tubes, or duct them up into the cabin area.
Suggestions?

2. I'm thinking about going with the Dodge light switch idea, as I like the
variable speed option that it provides, and wanted to make sure that I
understand the wiring correctly.  If I understand the posts that I reviewed,
I'll need to run the hot wire that feeds the bilge fan from the battery
through a fuse to the light switch and back through to the bilge fan.  Does
this eliminate the need for a relay?  Will the Dodge light switch handle the
load?

3. What about the melted fan issue?  Can this be somewhat controlled by
adjusting the amount of heat let through the system by the heater flaps?
Or, would a temp sensor that auto cuts the fan out help to prevent this from
happening?  Or, would adding an inlet that adds cabin air to the mix just
before the bilge fan help?  Or, all three...?

Thanks for the help! :O)
