Subject: Re: [T2] Aftermarkey wheels for a Bay

I've got the VW 15x6.5 alloy wheels on my 77 van and they work great.  My 
local Santa Cruz VW shop has them as takeoffs for about $100 a piece with 
tires.  Try volkscafe.com.

The larger rim makes for a smaller tire sidewall.  That reduces the body 
roll.  For my 77 bus, I run passenger car tires on them without any handling 
problems.  The ride is much smoother.  I like the 205/70-15 tires with a 44 
psi maximum inflation pressure such as the Bridgestone Turanza.  I think the 
1500 pound load rating is plenty for a bus.

For a VW van with 15 inch wheels, I think you should try to get as narrow of 
tires as possible so as to keep the rolling resistance down.  205/70-15 are 
plenty wide.  I know some people run wider tires than 205, but it's just a 
waste of gas unless you are using your van like a sports car.  The tire 
contact patch is already much wider than the stock tires.  

I used to race cars for a hobby and any racer will tell you that tire 
compound is much more important than tire width.  If you want better 
traction, get softer tires.  That makes a huge difference.  They wear fast, 
but they stick a lot better.
