Brilliant. Well done. You realize that among the billions of messages
spammers send, only the tiniest fraction lead to purchases--but the
economics of the situation dictate that these few morons who send money,
make spamming profitable, and guarantee that it will continue.

Thanks.

I hope you enjoy your shirts. Certainly your gratification is the most
important thing of all...
