Well, I thought about the pressure differentials and decided that maybe
mounting the bilge fan over by the driver's side "stack" (whatever the air
inlet thing built into the side of the bus is called), running the heater
air intakes over to it, and letting it draw air from there might do two
things:

1. Keep the positive pressure concept and avoid CO problems.

2. Since the fan isn't drawing hot air from the engine, it won't melt down.

Now what would be neat would be if I could figure out a way to duct cabin
air to it with it mounted in that position... well, I'm planning on moving
the spare tire to the front.  Maybe I could convert the tire well to a
filtered air intake for the blower.

On another topic, does anyone know if it's safe to post links to those
crying bus graphics?
