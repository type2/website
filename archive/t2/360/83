it could also be your ignition switch.

bus depot sells one for ~$8 -- made by bosch and a snap to install (under 
20 minutes if that)

Here's the caveat:  I'm having the same problem and the hot start relay 
didn't fix it.  I've actually been meaning to post about it but I wanted 
to check my ignition switch first.

My deal:

- 1971 bus
- new starter
- hot start relay installed

issue:  doesn't start all the time, but I hear a "clicking" from the area 
around the starter when I turn the key.  Sometimes the starter turns on 
the first go, sometimes it turns after the 5th turn of the key, sometimes 
it doesn't turn over at all.  Bridging the terminals on the starter with a 
screwdriver ALWAYS works and turns the starter.

My gut reaction -- on hearing the "click" from the starter was that I 
don't have enough juice in the battery to turn the engine over, but if it 
sometimes works on the 5th try, that doesn't seem to make sense.  I'm 
banking that it's the ignition switch or the "new" starter, but any ideas 
from the peanut gallery are welcome.
