Subject: CA Junkyard stuff

Went to BYOB in Aromas, CA. Rained a lot and didn't expect to see much
because it was mostly for splitties but the swap prices were outrageous:
$100 for ratty old torn mud flaps. Found one guy with three bay window
clocks (1 black, 2 gray) but he wanted $100 each and wouldn't budge. $35 for
a SWF 72-79 taillight lens? Heard of eBay dude? I don't think he sold
anything. At least I got to meet Gabriel Garcia, the other well known VW
locksmith.

On the way back home I stopped at the Moss Landing Pick-n-Pull and found
some good stuff. They have 4 busses there at the moment (72, 77 and two 79
CA models).

The camper interiors are gone but there are dashes, speedos, westy seats,
etc. The "easy" stuff is gone (fuel pumps, side markers, window winders,
license lights). If you are nearby and need any of this stuff you know where
to go...

- nice set of brown headrests
- 77 ECU
- 77 AFM (0 280 200 020) $25 when I asked
- 79 CA ECU (2 of these)
- 79 CA FI wiring harness complete (another one cut in half)
- 2 GD engines (complete)
- Assorted engine tin
- 72 heater levers
- 77 mechanical egr valve and tube (no filter)

I can't remember much more but those busses haven't been as picked over like
the Bay Area Pick-n-Pulls. A lot of the windows are gone so stuff is getting
wet. I tried to put stuff in dry places but the engines were too heavy. ;-)

Anyone need the heat-sink module for a 79 CA distributor? They're hard to
find right? I don't need it but I pulled it for the first person who
replies.

Who was asking about the vacuum diagram for the 79 CA model (Scott Lyons?).
Here's a picture along with the timing sticker.

Notice how the white vacuum hose was overlaid in the wrong place.

That 79 CA bus was so clean, all 4 plastic caps on the front bumper bolts
were still there. It was pretty clean underneath too.
