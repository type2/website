much
 lower then with solids, because they have to be so much milder on the
on/off
 valve seat events with hydraulic lifters, and then you only have 1.3:1
X at
 the valve.
  This does not jive with Karl's assertion that the t2 hydraulic cam is
no different from the nonhydraulic and can add hydralic lifters, as we
did to a top end rebuild of a 75 bus?
