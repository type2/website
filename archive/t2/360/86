Hi,

I ran the wire from under the bus and through the hole on the left 
side of the engine room where the harness come through a grommet. One 
wire goes to the VDO oil pressure sender and the other through the 
engine compartment seal to the sump. I has held up fine so far but I 
check the connection to the sender occasionally just in case.
