Subject: Bad check valve?

Hello all

After servicing my brake system today I noticed that when I press the brakes
the RPMs increase slightly. The RPMs also increase stlightly when brakes are
released. The bus idles fine and I cant find any vacuum leaks inside the
engine compartment. I searched the archives but couldnt find a definitive
answer for this. Could this be a bad check valve on the brake booster? I kind
of ruled out a bad booster since the idle is fine but maybe I am wrong. This
is on a 78 with stock FI.

Thanks for any suggestions
Jasan C.
