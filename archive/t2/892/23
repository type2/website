The Buoy will be held at Dixon's Campground Cape Nedick, Maine,September
8-9-10.
We will be 15 minutes from York Beach, to the South,or Oguncuit, North.
Prizes,50/50, a scenic caravan ride and lobster at Foster's (really
famous) Clambake Restaurant. 
Come for the thrills, the shopping, a nap under the pine trees, or a day
of sun and sand. We offer it all (hyperbole).
