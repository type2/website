Subject: Safety First!

Since this happened while working on my bus, I guess that makes it bus related. How many of you out there who wear glasses (and even those who don't) skip wearing safety goggles when doing metal work? I know I've always been bad about it. Not any more. I just got back from having a sliver of metal removed from my right eye, not a pleasant experience. Yesterday I was working on a small rust spot on the right rear corner of my Westy, grinding it down with the Dremel. I never felt a thing until about 2 hours after I was done, I had that sensation of "something  in my eye". I rubbed it bit (not the thing to do!) but it was still there. I finally checked it out in a mirror, and there it was, a piece of metal stuck in my eyeball! Wife insisted I go the emergency room, but I was stubborn and refused-go to an emergency room at 6:00pm on the 4th of July?  No way, miss the fireworks!? This morning I went to my family doctor who took one look at and then sent to an eye specialist. He numbed the eye with drops and got the sliver out, then told me I was lucky it didn't have to be stitched up. First time something like this has happened to me in 30 years of working on cars. I stopped on the way home and bought a new pair of safety goggles, and I will wear them from now on!       Jeff
