Chris,

It looks to me like it could be "flashing" created on the install of the 
valve guides.  I wouldn't consider it a big thing if you could get it off
without too much trouble.

As long as there are no cracks in the aluminum hiding underneath the 
flecks, I wouldn't worry too much about it.

If the aluminum head surface was "pittted" where the two pieces came off, 
just smooth it gently with a dremel and go on.  You have a lot more 
surface area holding that valve guide in than those little pieces.

Here are the pics of my AVP when I got mine a couple of years ago.

I *prefer* permatex.  Been using it since 1968 to seal motors and other VW 
engine parts.  Tried other stuff and haven't always been that 
impressed.....including the hi dollar stuff that the Porsche folks use.

Cheers, dave
