Hey I'm in Richmond VA. I have a 76 Green Westy I'm parting out. It has the  
doors but, I don't recall the condition. If you call me Wednesday I will 
check.  If you don't call I will forget. I'm open 8-6 M-F I'm usually very busy 
moving  cars around in the morning so might try after 8:30. It's not DC or 
Northern VA  but, close enough I guess.
