Subject: OE Engine colors

A few months ago I read a fellow's website which carefully documented the
original colors for the Type IV engine paint.  Now I can't find it!  

Anyone know the URL?  

To jog your memories, he discussed how the fan housing was actually not
aluminum color but rather cadmium.  He also found the original color of the
intake runners which he had powder coated.

I'm hoping Boston Bob will have my rebuild finished before long, so I need
to get my pieces over to the powder coater soon!
