Hmm... After perusing a certain unmentionable auction website, I found over 
600 references to Filmore in both of the versions that I now have.  Now I 
know where the other ones have all gone.  Maybe I'll wait ten/twenty years 
to sell mine!  In the mean time, if you know where to look you can get one.
