The difference is that pointers to event announcements are not susceptible
to abuse like pointers to auctions.

 

"As you know, some auction sellers

try to rustle up bids as much as they can by widely publicizing their
auction through posting repeated announcements.  It would be nice to have a
policy of moderation for this, but trying to explain moderation to some
auction sellers is impossible.  The solution was to simply ban all auction
pointers."

 

Question from uj. I have been bombarded with E-Mails to continue what I was
doing. I know that some come from the Samba, but that is not a bidding deal
and None come from E-Bay. There is one set price on The Samba,and I only do
AridZona because I can then check out the Bus for the prospective buyer, if
it is near me. I will do whatever the list managers want.  Not a problem
here. I want no special treatment, I just want to be useful and abide by the
rules.  Please let me know, uj
