Subject: Re: [T2] Alternator bolt size

Factory Parts Fiche shows just a standard 8x1.25 thread 13mm hex nut
(N110088) with a Spring/Wavy Lockwasher (N1224111).  No self-locking nut
shown originally, but a self-locking (not nylock) would be acceptable,
especially since they're so hard to get to in this application.

Any yes, nylocks are *supposed* to be used only once, as well as most
self-locking nuts I know of.
