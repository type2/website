Subject: cash for pnw or bay area travelers to oceanside, ca.

i need a 1/2 rack brought down to oceanside, california asap.
it is light [20lbs] but oversized for conventional shipping.
58X54 and 16" legs. anybody between vancouver and eugene heading that  
way, pm for details.
rack is in eugene. i can meet you on the frontage road of interstate  
5 with zip ties if that helps.

rack can be in the bay area at the end of this month.
will trade for parts/cash/ both.  thanks, steve
