It looks like the valve guides were replaced when the head was  
rebuilt. I can't tell if they bored the hole too small or mishandled  
the guide during installation.

Either way, you certainly don't want those pieces going into the  
combustion chamber. Send those pics to AVP and get their advice  
before proceeding.

The budget rebuilders seal up their cases with silicone to prevent  
leaks that would cause warranty headaches.

This happens when they use those metal straps to tie the engine down  
on the pallet.

The case and heads are like that. It causes the gaskets to glue  
themselves to the case and makes a clean removal difficult.
