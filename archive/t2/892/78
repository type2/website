I managed to pick up two of the diecast Filmores from WalMart, then 4 of the 
McDonald's ones yesterday.  Had to got to four local McDonalds before I 
found one that had the buses.  Apparently it was in an earlier phase of the 
promotion and most McDonalds had given them all away.

The Cars items at WalMart didn't last long either.  Went back to see if I 
could get any more of the diecast and there wasn't really any of the Cars 
stuff left.

One of each is now in my desktop collection of buses.  I'm still playing 
around with the idea of auctioning the others off.

Now to go see the movie a third time... :O)
