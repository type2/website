Subject: Rim Color

Good day People,

I just got some new tires, Michelin LT 195/75R14 93R. 6 ply...They have been
suggested by my local mechanic.. what you guys think!  Mega Tread on that I
tell you...

Any how, has I probaly will have those tire for ever...(bus life wise) I'm
getting ready to get the rim heat coted (baked), I wonder what is the the
spec on the original color for a Transporter '77.

The original color of the van is ..Top white and bottom senecal red...I'm
thinking white but what are the facts..!!!

regards

Patrick
