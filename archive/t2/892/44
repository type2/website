Cut off no doubt.
 
It is a picture vehicle. You would be shocked and amazed what happens to
picture vehicles. Having worked for many years in the film industry and
having a lot to do with picture cars, I can almost guarantee that the actors
position in that shot (Alan Arkin sitting facing out of the bus) was well
planned in advance and that it was mandated to modify the vehicle to suit
the shot. It happens all the time.
