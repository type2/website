Jeff: I for one am glad you took the time to write this. For just 
about 20 years I too have been using the Dremel with brass or wire 
brushes and only now and then have I worn the shield or goggles. Just 
thinking about rubbing an eye with a sliver embedded in it is enough 
to make me change. Glad you are OK.
Jack
