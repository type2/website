Here' s what my fiche says:

(hubcap) L70 grey silver
(hubcap) Models 241-244 L41 black
(bumpers) L581 cloud white
(bumpers) Models 271, 274 L567 ivory

1971 - 1972
(wheels & hubcap) L91 chrome
(bumpers) L90D pastel white

1973 - 1975
(wheels & hubcap) L97U grey aluminum
(wheels) Models 221-228, 241, 244 L91 chrome
(bumpers) L90D pastel white

1976-1979

Models 241-244 is a 8/9 seat deluxe passenger bus
Models 221-228 is a 7/8/9 seat passenger bus
Models 271, 274 is an ambulance

L91 is the most commonly found paint formula for the wheels. You can
get a can of L91 from the dealer (ask for L 009 103) if you have
nothing to match the color to.
