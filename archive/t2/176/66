Subject: RE: [T2] VIN numbers - what do they mean

For 1952 model year chassis numbers for Type 2 were just a running 6 digit
number in the range 021094 to 028511
For 1962 model year chassis numbers for Type 2 were just a running 6 digit
number in the range 802986 to 971549
For 1972 model year chassis numbers for Type 2 were 10 digit numbers, 2 for
type 2, then the model digit, then the year digit, then the digit 2 to
indicate a 1970s vehicle, followed by a 6 digit number starting at 000001
each year.

No possible confusion between 1952, 1962 or 1972.

So 2222164407 is the 164407th Type 2 chassis made in the 1972 model year
(August 1971 to July 1972) and it has an 8 or 9 seater minibus (not deluxe)
body fitted to it.

For Sample VIN: 2-2-2-xxxxxx, we break it into four parts (A,B,C, and D).
"A" (2) being the Type of vehicle it is. The above example VIN is a Type
2.
"B" (2) is the second number or the Vehicle model type--9 or 9 pax bus
"C" (2) is the second letter of the year of manufacturer. The sample
being either a 1952, 1962, or 1972 model.
"D" (xxxxxxx) represents the last six digits being the chassis number:
Interesting that you can get three different years.
