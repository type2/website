Two good points...  now let me sketch a real nightmare scenario (which I
have done)....

In NE New Mexico there is a national park....Chaco Culture National
Historic Park. In this park are the ceremonial centers for the Anasazi
peoples.  The Anasazi built a number of ceremonial centers in this one
place over the course of 400 years over 1000 years ago. They were
abandoned for some reason about 800 years ago and have bee sitting for all
those years.  The dry climate of the Southwestern desert has preserved
them to an amazing degree and if you visit the park, you can lay hands on
thousand-year-old artifacts. To get a sense of scale, imagine being able
to run your hands over the shroud of Turin.  The sort of place that would
have to be put entirely behind glass to protect it from visitors in any
accessible place.  The National Park Service protects it by refusing to
pave the 20 mile road to it.  Neither do they service that road more often
than semi-annually.  It is absolute HELL to get to, at a top speed of 10
mph in second.  It is also worth every mile, by far and away the most
amazing national park I have ever been to.

Now, imagine being there and having a rock cut the flex line to your slave
cylinder on your hydraulic clutch.  Imagine having to be towed out the
~200 miles to Foreign Aid in Albuqueque to have your hydraulic clutch
rebuilt and bled!

My question is not 'Can I install a hydraulic clutch on a bay?' but rather
'Can I install a cable clutch on a Vanagon?'
