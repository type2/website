Subject: motor mounts replacement questions 82 westy

After examining my motor mounts I believe i need to replace them.  Both
outer mounts look split.  This would answer why my engine swivels way too
much on starting.
When i look at the positioning of the mounts questions come up.
can i get to the mounts by simply lowering the engine support bar?
how much upper equipment do i have to remove to get to them?
thanks
