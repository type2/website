Where can I find the number printed on the distributor, looking at it
installed in the engine?

Bentley says my engine should be GD, but the archives says GE and the engine
is stamped GE.  It's a Canadian model.

I had the rev limiting rotor, 04016 and I put in 04033 to save money.  The
points and cap were the correct replacements.  Only the condenser is
different. Here's a picture of it:

What was unusual was that instead of connecting the green wire directly to
the coil, it connected to a black box that is inline with terminal 1 on the
coil. 211 035 257.

Can someone help me identify the two item in this picture that might lead to
identifying the correct condenser.
