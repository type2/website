Tom,

I suspect so.  I don't know much about the EGR for a '75 bus, but in 
general EGR is only supposed to be in effect at part throttle.  Not at 
idle, not at WOT (wide open throttle).  So that would indicate that it 
should be teed into the vacuum line that goes to the vacuum advance port on 
the distributor.

By having it hooked to the other port, you are getting EGR at idle, which 
will likely cause the symptoms you describe.
