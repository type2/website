Subject: Re: [T2] VIN numbers - what do they mean

Modified from the archives
For Sample VIN: 2-2-2-xxxxxx, we break it into four parts (A,B,C, and D).
"A" (2) being the Type of vehicle it is. The above example VIN is a Type 
2.
"B" (2) is the second number or the Vehicle model type--9 or 9 pax bus
"C" (2) is the second letter of the year of manufacturer. The sample 
being either a 1952, 1962, or 1972 model.
"D" (xxxxxxx) represents the last six digits being the chassis number:
Interesting that you can get three different years.
