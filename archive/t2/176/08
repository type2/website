Not sure if this went through the 1st time cause noone replied, so I am r=
eposting it.
Sorry if it did already.  But if someone could take a look at their fuses=
 I would really appreciate it.
I am trying to make my sink, fridge and outlet work.
I am trying to replace the fuses first.  =20
The one in the water pump is blown.  I don't think it was the right one.
The one that is in the panel for the fridge is questionable.
The one in the converter under the seat is a total mystery.
I have never seen a fuse like this one before.  The spring from the cap t=
hat holds the fuse in place has left a deep imprint of itself where it ma=
kes contact with the metal of the fuse.
I showed it to the guy at my local FLAPS (in this case the F does not sta=
nd for friendly).  He had no idea and tried to just sell me something tha=
t I know is definetely wrong.
Can anyone tell me what fuse each location needs.
Also, both the Bently manual and my VW owners manual say that my 79 bus s=
hould have 2 16 amp fuses under the dash.  However, they do not agree on =
the location of these fuses.  =20
Any ideas?
Thanks,
Kyle
