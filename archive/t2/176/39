Subject: Oil Cooler/Filter

Ive seen oil pumps that allow an oil filter, and i've seen em with outlets 
for an external oil cooler.  How would I set up both?  Where do I mount the 
cooler, and how do you prime all that space with oil???  Wouldn't the case be 
overfilled?  Is it worth it to add a fan or thermostat?  Any suggestions on 
products and/or kits.

Thanks,
Matt
