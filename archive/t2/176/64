Tom,

I believe the wear limit according to Bentley is .004" on the teeth.

You can make the cover and pump body face flat by following the 
instructions in the hot rod book.

Buy a piece of replacement house window glass...cheapest easiest 
size...9X12?  !not plastic!  It needs to be *flat*.

Buy some wet/dry 300-400 grit black sandpaper.  Lay the sandpaper on the 
glass, flood it with parts cleaner(non explosive) and start sanding the 
cover plate using even circular motions with an even "all over" pressure.

It doesn't take long....piece of cake.

Cheers, dave
