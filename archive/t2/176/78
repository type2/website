Subject: Hard Start/Won't Start When Warm

Friends,

I've been creeping around the archived messages looking for some insight
on this problem with no luck.

Basically, my '70 loaf will start up great in the morning.  After it's
been warmed up (let's say I've driven 20 minutes or so) then shut off...

[elapsed time ~20 minutes]

...I try to start it and the engine just won't catch.  It turns over
just fine, but it has a tough time firing up.  When I go around back and
open up the engine room, it smells like gas (and no, I'm not pumping it
full of gas while trying to start it).

Sometimes, simply opening the engine room door then trying  to start it
again works.  Sometimes not...now that the weather is warming up, it's
become a more frequent problem.

Unfortunately for me, this usually happens to my girlfriend when she's
driving it, and instead of rationally thinking of what the problem may
be, she freaks out all over me.

So, there it is.

Any thoughts on what may be preventing the thing from firing up would be
appreciated.

Enjoy,
