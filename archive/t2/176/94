Subject: frozen brake drum

I removed the two little bolts but I'm having a tough time getting the left
rear brake drum off.  Bentley has some crazy puller I don't have.  Do I just
whack is with a hammer until I comes free?  The left rear was stuck also but
I managed to get it off.

Is there a easy trick for getting those rubber dust plugs back in?
