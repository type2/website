Excellent advice!  Couple trivia points below, but what dave Wrote is
right on!

Look for "float glass".  There are few things short of an optical flat or
a machinist's "surface plate" that are flatter and it's cheap!  Another
alternative, not quite as flat, but less prone to breakage is a
formica-covered sink cutout from a countertop.  I have one that, in
conjunction with a couple sheets of wet/dry sandpaper makes the *best*
knife sharpener!

If you start with 220 then move thru 400 to 600, you will wind up with a
plate that is dead flat, glass-smooth, and leak-free.  300-400 will do the
job, tho, and provides a perfectly acceptable smoothness.

Amen!  and worth the effort even if it took all day :-)
