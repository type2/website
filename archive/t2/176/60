Vege (Dutch) have a good reputation.  If you are going for an off the shelf
rebuilt they would be a good choice.
Changing to 2L - this depends a lot on geography.  Where are you?  I know
that outside North America these engines are quite scarce, so you might have
trouble finding a complete set of tinware, flaps, fan housing etc.  These
are no longer available new.  You might need to buy a complete used engine
just for the bits.  There are aftermarket carbs and linkages available so
this might not be such a problem.  The other thing is the transmission - I'm
not sure but you may need a different one.
