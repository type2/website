They can weld a tool steel rod to it. Sometimes that works. I should have 
said, consult a MACHINIST. This the the type that will have the advance 
equipment and skills necessary to remove the broken cobalt, then the broken 
stud, then rethread with a timed insert.

Left hand twist cobalt drills will work for the stud, but don't normally 
work with hand held drills. Must be jugged up in a press if trying to 
remove a hardened stud. If the easy out is cobalt, you will need a diamond 
drill. A machinist won't do, you need a MACHINIST Cum Laude.
