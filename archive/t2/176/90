 From a surepower instruction sheet  purchased at pepboys.   Bosch 
alternators fall into group three.  Group three requires a special group

voltage regulator out of the alternatorand do some soldering,  And then 
run another lead from the alternator to the isolator. This is probably 
why VW didnt use them when they put aux batteries in.  they use an 
isolation relay instead. After looking at that work on the voltage 
regulator i went to the RV store and bought a relay and did as VW did. 
The isolator i bought is sitting in a storage bucket for some future 
other use.
