Subject: Re: [T2] long front bumper

All that was done here is add a bumper extensions, and a sheet metal
filler panel with a box on it---

Looks kinda weird---having that bumper stuck way out in front like
that--


Later,

Where do busses get those longer white front bumpers with the bix quare
box over the nose mounted tire? Was that an EU option only? 

Yes this is a euro thing. Some countrys have laws against mounted the
spare tire on the front of the vehicle (it's probably a good idea). The
bumper and square box is to house the spare tire.

I just dont get how its any safer. The spare is still between the nose
and the collision. Why does it matter what its attached to? I would
better understand a prohibition from modifying the front bumper and
crumple area whatsoever.
