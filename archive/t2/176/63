If your fuel outlet and return stubs have rusted off, they are not easily
replaceable.  I am sorry to say I have seen many FI tanks with this
problem and I have a bad feeling about it getting worse as time goes on.

The stubs are welded to the tank, no nut on the bottom like on the '68-71
tanks. It is possible, but difficult, to find somone who will weld on a
gas tank.  Usually it is cheaper to buy a junkyard replacement.

You can buy and use metal brake line as a replacement for the netal in the
straight sections.  The fule ring is a junkyard item, tho you might check
wiut VW.  I bought an NOS Fuel ring there not too long ago.  the hose is
available from any VW supplier.

Yes.  The quality is so widely variant that it is tough to say anything.
My general rule is that the "Monza" style rusts faster than the "stock
look" but I have seen solid old Monza style and have seen the stock look
rust out very quickly. One important point on the 76-78 exhausts is that
all four corners of the heater boxes are supposed to have support bars
that bolt them to the engine case.  I rarely find them in place and they
are important!
