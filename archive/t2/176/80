Subject: cooling FAN interchange? solution? 

Long time lurker here:
I soaked my 77 bus fan and pulley in degreaser overnight and fubar'd it by
not reading the cleaner label. I found a used fan to replace it and the bolt
patterns are identical, but the center hole on the replacement fan is larger
b/c it doesn't taper like the 77 fan center hole.  It looks like it will fit
fine, but would I be in danger of throwing things out of balance if I use
this fan?
Does anyone have a fan/pulley in their parts stash with part #1 021 119 113

Thanks for the help.
Jay
