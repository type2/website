Subject: long front bumper

Where do busses get those longer white front bumpers with the bix
quare box over the nose mounted tire? Was that an EU option only?

Hey there Christopher,

Yes this is a euro thing. Some countrys have laws against mounted the
spare tire on the front of the vehicle (it's probably a good idea).
The bumper and square box is to house the spare tire.

If anyone is wondering "what the heck are they talking about ?" it
looks like this:

Hope this helps,
