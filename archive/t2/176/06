7 mintues left for a auick story to all you newbies:

My 71 had poor compression in one cylinder (broken
wrist pin). (FYI I ran it for about 6 months like that,
blew lots of oil!) It wasnt until my new wife and I
decided to head to the coast in it that I replaced the
one cylinder/piston set.

Thanks to having read the owners manual I was always
putting the "right" oil in it, and I drove it for
another 3 years no problems.

I sold it to a friends sister and found out that it
only lasted another three months before it packed up.
After they came around and we played twenty questions,
it was determined that they were putting in 10W30 in
"like any other car". Coincidence I think not!  Of
course refering them to the owners manual I'd left in
the glove box got me out of that.

If you are a newbie search for "oil 20W50" in the
archive. Dont drain the thick and put in thin.
