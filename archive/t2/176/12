Paul,

Please tell more!  Why the returns???  

Didn't work?
Not bright enough?
Didn't fit right?

I assume by theft list, that you mean shoplifting?

I too have been intrigued by these, but not enough to pay $48.50 for them 
knowing that each led is probably about a nickle in cost.

The other factor is that led's provide light in pretty much one direction 
and not 360 degrees as a true 1157 would....so viewed from the side, they 
would not be bright(or maybe even visible) at all.

Cheers, dave
