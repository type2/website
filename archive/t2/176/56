Hello all... I'm pretty much a newcomer to the list...  I bought a '76 Westy 
(my first) about 7 weeks ago... The pop top and luggage carrier are pretty 
grungy and I was wondering what you all would recommend for cleaning them - I 
think some of it is oxidation and then a lot of it is just dirt and grime...

Thanks in advance,
