Hi everybody,   I just picked up a new project and need some help with it=
.  It is a 78 westy with a stock 2 liter.  It's been sitting a while and =
has some rust underneath and on the body panels.  One of the bad spots is=
 the exhaust and fuel lines.  One of the things I need to know is if ther=
e is a way to repair rusted fuel outlets and returns on the gas tank.  Th=
ey are rusted down to little stubs coming out of the tank.  I felt around=
 to see if there is a section that is removable but I couldnt tell.  I ha=
ve a feeling it is not replaceable.  I ordered the Bentley for the bus bu=
t i was curious in the meantime.  Also I was wondering if anyone knew of =
a good place to get a full set of replacement fuel lines for this engine =
(metal and rubber lines).  I need to replace some exhaust parts too.  I h=
ave seen these aftermarket mufflers that supposedly "replace six pieces w=
ith one" they eliminate the crossover tube and elbows and such.  Has anyo=
ne used one of these mufflers?     If there are any Volkswagen technician=
s out there please email me, I am considering going to the UTI Volkswagen=
 training program and would like some information about being a tech for =
VW.     Any response would be greatly appreciated  =20

Thanks, Brian    71,78 westies
