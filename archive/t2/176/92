Tight!!!  Tight is far worse!  clattery means loose and that is
embarrasing, but not really a problem.  Push it far enough and you might
mushroom the end of the valve stem (heard of it, never seen it) but too
loose is what to aim for if you are just starting out.

None, if they are loose.

loose: slight loss of power, stays the same
tight: slight loss of power, gets worse as your valve burns.

Frank,

The standard is .006, as you probably know.  That being said, .006 for me,
.006 for you and .006 for some random 3rd person are probably quite a few
ten thousandths (.0001) of an inch apart!  If you and I and the 3rd person
were all trained machinists, they would be damn near identical, but I
ain't, you ain't and as a result, it does not matter whether person #3 is
or isn't :-)

In my case, it has also been the better part of a decade since I have
adjusted valves on a regular basis... I *love* hydraulics valves!!! :-)

But, you ain't got 'em, so what do you do?  Well, ideally, apprentice at a
machine shop for a year or so.  *That* will teach you *exactly* what
.0001" is!!!  or get your knuckles rapped by a steel rule!  (you think
nuns are tough?  Just wait!)  As a second (and less painful :) best, go
out and look for a set of go/no go feeler gauges.  I found a set available
via the web at: http://www.autopart.com/tools/file/part158.htm for $5.95 +
shipping by searching google for "go/no go feeler gauge".  Your flaps
*may* have them.  They can certainly get them tho many are reluctant to do
special orders on tools for some reason.  With the step gauge in hand, you
may be amazed to find that your .006 is really .010.
