I think it mainly depends on how fast you can get the Bus up to before you
pop the clutch.  If you've got a nice hill to roll down, by all means use
second gear.

However if you've got only flat ground and limited room and only yourself
pushing (BTDT) then you won't have enough speed to use second, so use first
as it will give better mechanical advantage to start the engine.  You can
also use reverse.  BTDT too.

There's no harm in popping it in first as long as you are not going too fast
to use first gear.  Don't want to overrev the engine.
