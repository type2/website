Hey all,

If you don't have a PalmOS database ignore this.

I have an alpha version of a PalmOS based database application.  The data
in it is garbage I used for testing.  I am still working on the real data.

It will also let you record info about cars you spot.

If you are interested in helping out please following link below.

Please send me your feed back, in the form of bugs, features, and
suggestions.

Thanks for the bandwidth.
