The sequnce number is repeated on the M-code plate.  The complete VIN is
imprinted on the steel to the left of the engine compartment in the rear.
If all the VINs do not match.... run away!!!

The type4 motor is correct.  It was originally a 1700cc motor, but that is
not the original carb.  The '72s came with dual carbs.

Your question scares me a bit... doesn't the title say what year?  *Is*
there a title???  Unless you are buying it to part it, buying it without a
title involves an extra level of "PITA".

A straight, rust-free body counts for a lot!  The westy stuff is all added
later, tho as a westy would have had a VIN starting 232.

> Is the engine compartment in all bay window buses the same size?

Yes and no... they are all the same cube, but the cutout for the engine on
72-79 buses is very different from the cutout for the engine on '68-71
buses.  In Europe, buses came with T1 engines all the way to the end, but
there are differences... just how many I am finding out as Pat Flynn and i
install a beetle motor in his '75 DC

After ?63?, yes, but before that, when VW was just using a sequence number
VIN, it was vital to have the list of what bus was made in what year...
not better or worse, but different.
