We might have lousy weather, our gas may cost us more per litre than you pay 
for a gallon, our busses can rust out before our eyes, but we can still buy 
new busses even if they are overpriced, In my busses annual test the exhaust 
emissions where not checked. And we drive on the correct side of the road.
