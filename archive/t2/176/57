X-14, a bleach based cleaner works really really well, and will get your 
top very bright, with the proper amount of scrubbing and brushing.  It 
can be purchased from any supermarket or wherever you like to buy 
bathroom cleansers.  I also use a power washer on my top about once a 
year, and that works ok, but not as well as the other stuff.
