Almost everything you guys are talking about with regards to splitting 
engine cases is Greek to me, but I'll tell you what I would do - though 
this may only work in my garage at home...

This has happened a bunch of times to me, but I'll give you a specific 
example - when I assembled the cv joint the wrong way round, got it 
hopelessly stuck, noway the thing was going to budge one millimeter to 
allow me to put it together the right way - I almost threw it out...but 
I left it alone for a week, came back to it, and it practically fell 
apart in my hands when I picked it up.

What I think is, that my house is haunted by the ghost of a VW mechanic, 
and he helps me out of hopeless situations (and I create a lot of them). 
 Maybe you should just wait a couple of days, see if some "body" splits 
your case for you while you're not looking! : )
