Subject: what happened?! getting desperate!


It must have been a *bad* day in Germany when they built my 78 Champagne 
edition....probably built on Saturday or something.

I have absolutely *NO* Mcode plate!!!!

I have my bus almost ready for the painters this afternoon.  

Radio out, wiper motor out, plastic underdash fresh air vents out.
I cleaned the top of the air box from the passenger side door to the 
steering column brace.  Started looking at the other side and....

No mcode plate...holes for it are here.

What the h*ll do I do now????  I need the codes for the paint 
colors for the painter.

I *really* needed them for the interior color seats and panels as the 
colors on my "cloth" inserts really don't seem to match what other people 
have.  I was hoping to catch a clue about the carpet color also. 

Anyone with a standard 78 Champagne edition with a copy of the mcode 
plate?  Someone had a pic of one that looked like mine, but I can't 
remember who.

Anyone? Help??

Cheers, dave
