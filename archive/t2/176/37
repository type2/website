also the AIRS list and the state maps of every state you are going
through, they usually list all the state parks and their facilities, also
helps to figure out where you are and are going

excellent advice, try your hand at roaming between 3 or 4 nearby state
parks, gives you some practice setting up and tearing down camp, what

a good idea is a roll awning that can be mounted to the rain gutter on the
sliding door side

install a cigerette lighter and get a flashlight that uses batteries that
can be charged from the lighter, also maybe a cup of water heater and a
light that will also work from the lighter outlet.  (use while engine is
running)

also a good idea to have either a oil presure or oil temp guage (both are
better)

and a good spare that you are willing to drive 1,000 miles or more
on.  also a hydraulic jack

em.

I like that foil tape but don't forget the old standbys,  duct tape and
WD40
