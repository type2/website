Yes. Use a proper penetrating fluid, not WD-40, and soak around the hub and 
at the screw holes and the wheel lugs. The vibrations from pounding will 
help it soak in. Repeat application of penetrant and pounding and it will 
eventually come free. If the drum has any cracks (unlikely but possible) 
they sure will propagate with the pounding but that would be good to know 
so you could replace it.

Push very hard and twist. Use a little light oil as well if they are really 
old and hard.
