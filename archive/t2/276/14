Yeah, I wondered why I always saw semi-truckloads of Toyota and Nissan
pickup beds headed north from LA.  It seems that the Japanese
manufacturers evaded the tariff by importing cab-and-chassis vehicles and
installing beds in the US.  VWs, being of unibody consruction, could not
take advantage of this loophole.

Kind of makes you think that the tariff was a nod and wink arrangement
between the US and Japanese governments, doesn't it?  The same thing
happened when Harley got the government to put a tariff on motorcycles
over 700cc.  the Japanese manufacturers suddenly dropped their 750s to
699cc and continued on thier merry way.
