Subject: Re: [T2] tick tick tick while driving

It's starting to go bad,
get a new one
you don't need one with the EGR counter on it
so you can get the earlier, cheaper one
it goes to the grease cap on the left front wheel
my 78 does the same thing, but haven't replaced it yet
willis

me that it's probably the speedo cable since the noise is in time with
driving speed.

What's the best way to lubricate this cable?  Remove it and grease it or
pour something down?
