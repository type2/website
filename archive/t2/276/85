Why overload any wire at all?  I'm not saying you should use one 12-gauge wire in place of two 12-gauge wires.  I'm saying (for example) use one 10-gauge wire in place of two 12-gauge wires.  They can carry the same amount of current.

Why run dual 12-gauge wires all the way back to the battery when you could run a single 10-gauge wire?  Much easier.  Let me ask you this - does the toaster in your kitchen have a wire all the way back to the power company?  How about your iron?  Your TV?  Are you saying they would work better if they did?

>You can get a better ground off two wires than one of the same gauge.

Agreed, but I never suggested that.

Your logic here confounds me, just as it did when you were extolling the virtues of Marvel Mystery Oil a few months ago.
