Subject: Ride quality

Two things to report.

First, the 1800 miles I drove from TX was with a seat restored using the
horse hair reproductions from Wolfsburg West and the ride was enjoyable. My
hip gave out after 13 hours of driving but my bum was no the worse for
aches.

The shocks I installed several months ago were KYB Gas-A-Justs.  I found
them pleasant on Austin roadways but here in CA it's another story.  On
nicely paved sections of highway the ride is firm and confidence inspiring
but on stretches of I-280 where the road goes ga-dunk-ga-dunk for miles and
miles I'm wondering if OEM Boge's wouldn't have been a better choice.

Opinions from some locals?
