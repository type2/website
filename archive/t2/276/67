Two issues here, battery+starter and carb+choke+fuel delivery+spark.
ANY slowness in the turning of the starter can probably be blamed on a weak
battery--cold weather is when this makes itself known.  Time to check
your battery, no matter how new it might be.  Harbor Freight sells a nice
load tester.

Your main problem seems to be a choke issue.  Have you adjusted the auto
choke for the winter?  I adjust the auto choke so that the choke plate is just
barely closed, on a cold morning.  In the summer I re-adjust them looser.
Be mindful that any timing/ignition issues are liable to show themselves 
more in the
cold.  A complete tune-up, and oil change to a lighter oil, are good 
winterizing measures.
