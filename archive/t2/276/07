Subject: Re: [T2] Stored Engine Starup Question

I would soak the cylinders with oil first - a light oil like 3 in 1. Soak 
it over night maybe.

Roll the engine over with the starter (coil unplugged, spark plugs out) 
until the oil light goes out.

This gets oil into the crank bearings and oil all over the cylinders.

Fire it up.
