Subject: optical VS magnetic

Any thoughts on which is better for electronic ignition systems?

Crane makes a unit for the bus, but it has optical trigger, while the 
pertronix uses "Rotating cobalt magnets"

The Crane costs a little more, is it a little better?

I received advise from another listmember some time ago about getting the 
Crane one instead of the usually available for bus ones out there, and just 
wanted to see what the consensus was. Anyone use both and have better luck 
with one over the other?
