Subject: Excellent tune up

Hi,

My dealer did a tune up of my van that was excellent, I cannot figure out 
what they did right.

My fuel economy was the best I have ever seen and my power was the best I 
have ever seen.

Can someone help me out here?

I usually adjust for 7.5 deg BTC at 975 rpm. idle.

Alan
