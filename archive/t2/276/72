At the Austin junkyards.  A friend was looking to find a complete exhaust from a 75-78 and balked at the $150 price for a rusted out system but I went down there right afterwards and took off the piece I need for a few bucks. I only discovered it was missing after many years when I did my push rod tube seals.

I'm going to miss that place but it was pretty bare after I was through with it. Still, I'll miss the nice used parts guy who helped me out many many times.  It's always nice to find someone at those places who used to own a bus themselves and enjoys seeing others driving them.
