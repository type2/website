Subject: RE: [T2] Upgrading to H4s

First thing I did when I got my 72 was put on the Bosch H-4's. Stock 
wiring. Superb function, not just a little better than sealed beams, a 
bunch better, particularly at night in the rain. Make danged sure you get 
them adjusted properly. The reason they are banned is because any idiot 
that doesn't adjust them properly can and will blind on comers.
