Subject: Club Listings

  There has been a lot of talk on the list of clubs (VW) If you have an
e-mail, contact or a club you belong to please p-mail me or post to the list

  I am trying to compile a list of all VW clubs out there that have a news
letter. When I do get all the info I will send it to the Samba, Vintagebus
and other web sites that cater to the VW world.

  I am hoping that having all this info easily available will help people in
contacting the people running these and give them a place to send stories to
and or join
.
   A lot of people have been trying to find NEATO info and it has been hard
to find.
