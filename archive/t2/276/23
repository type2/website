OK, this is what I've learned so far and it will be my first electrical project for the bus:

- run two separate wires from the starter to the relays.

What gauge of wire?

- fuse the lines separately

What style or fuse and what rating?

Lastly, who sells the relays I should be using and what are they rated at?
