If you do remove the speedo cable, don't forget the slick little trick [I 
learned it here on this list!] that makes it MUCH easier to thread the new 
cable back in:

Before removing the old one, get a length of aquarium air-tubing [1/4", as I 
recall; if you're not sure, take the new cable with you when you get the 
tubing] about a foot longer than the cable and secure one end of it over the 
end of the old cable.  I used a bit of stainless steel wire to anchor the 
tubing onto the cable. Then carefully pull the cable out, drawing the tubing 
up through the cable channel after it. [I also wussed out and put a knot in 
the other end of the tubing so I wouldn't accidentally pull it all the way 
through!]

Leave the tubing in the channel for the cable while you remove the old cable 
and fasten the tubing over the new cable, then pull the tubing to draw the 
new cable back through again.

It'll add about a year to your life, compared to trying to feed the cable 
through by hand from the dashboard side.

good luck!
