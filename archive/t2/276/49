Subject: Re: [T2] Upgrading to H4s

I put in the H4's ,, with a slight modification,, I drilled the back of the lamp
holder to accept the same bulb that the marker light uses,, mounted using a
rubber grommet.
Now I have daytime running lights 
they are like the early beetle, and bus, with the separate bulb
I believe this is a euro thing,, as a bus I owned once had this style in it,
along with KMs dash and recoil seat belts.  No my 74 has the Km's dash, and the
recoil seat belts as well as the H4's with the day time running headlights.

I didn't use a relay ,, as I have the 55/65 bulbs
I didn't find it too much of a hassle,, and I kinda enjoy having the dim daytime
headlights 

YMMV
