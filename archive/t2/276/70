Tune it. Sounds like the choke is malfunctioning.

I would not necessarily start replacing anything, just check the 
adjustments on everything, including the idle jets. Check thermostat, 
flappers, valves, dwell, timing, idle jets, carb adjustments. Make sure 
you've got the right carb and right distributor since they are so 
interchangeable and so many have been swapped for whatever was on hand at 
some point in the past. Check those fuel lines and engine bay rubber stuff 
too since you're back there and with cold weather you're using the heater.

My Beetle would fire up quickly at any temp and idle with only 3 pumps of 
the gas, no further attention. It would idle fast until the automatic choke 
heated up and began to back off. I typically removed the choke flap in warm 
weather and did not reinstall it I was having trouble starting in the cold 
weather. The fast idle cam on the choke is the most important part.

I am assuming that when you say "it is having trouble turning over" that 
you mean it is having trouble starting, and that you are not saying that 
the engine is having trouble rotating the engine with the starter (aka bad 
starter, bad battery).
