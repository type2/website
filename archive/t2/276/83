Subject: Re: [T2] Tire Date of Manufacture - longish

Can't believe they wasted so much effort on arguing whether the date
code should be single digit for year (bad for old car buyers-here's the
bus content- some tires can be decades old) or 2 digits (clear and good
for all except the makers gotta add a digit to the stamp (boo hoo))- and
if it should be on both sides of the tire (most recalls didn't get
checked because the code was on the inside of the tire!)
