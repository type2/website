I agree on this one.  Running relays will also save your headlight switch,
since it will no longer have to carry the full headlight current

Make sure that the new current-carrying wires are fused, preferably with
self-resetting circuit breakers.  It's a very good idea to run separate
left and right feeds to the headlights, so the failure of one will not
leave you completely in the dark.
