Hey list-

This is a little late but I was at a VW swap meet in Chattanooga on the
13th. It was a first time event for the sponsor group and they did a nice
job. A dozen or so vendors with about 99% bug stuff so it wasn't much use to
me for parts, but I did score an earlier edition Bently for my bus. It's the
68 - 74 manual with the COLOR WIRING DIAGRAMS!!! Woo-hoo! Maybe I can make
sense of them now. There was also a guy there who does rebuilding of
alternators, generators, and starters. They *looked* like they were well
done but who knows? Anyone who is interested can p-mail me for they guy's
email address.

On another note, about 9AM this morning I had just crossed the bridge from
Henderson KY and in the traffic jam in the southbound lanes sat an early bay
westy. Color me amazed! This is the only Bus I've ever seen on the road
around here. I only caught a glimpse of it but it looked like a home grown
paint job with the words "Magic Bus" painted on the side. Could this be a
list member???? Sing out, brother!

Regards,
Dave
