If you run a separate 10-gauge wire to the battery for your lights, you will have much less of a voltage drop for your lights AND you will have much less of a voltage drop for your other accessories since the lights are no longer driven by that wire.

Whoops, after reading Chris's post I realized this is wrong since other accessories do not run on the same wire as the lights.  Please excuse the error - it doesn't change my basic premise though.  Nice post btw Chris - sounds like you have thought things out very well.
