Subject: Re: [T2] Excellent tune up

Sorry to see you wasted your $25 on the "consumer duty" analog meter. Don't 
use it for any circuits that run to an ECU cause you can fry them. Expect 
variations of 0.5 volt as to accuracy. You cannot correctly diagnose 
condition of a battery with it. The margin between weakness and strength is 
not more than 0.05 volts for both load carrying and rebound capacities 
testing. Even good quality analog meters can't hold a candle to three place 
digital readout accuracies.

If you just got an excellent "tune up" and it runs great and gets good 
mileage, why would you want change anything?? I expect if you do verify 
(always a good thing) you will find factory specs. That's why it runs so good.

Now try to get out of the "tune up whenever it starts to run bad mentality" 
and start thinking about maintenance by inspection, so you will never be 
running bad and never need a "tune up" and never replace parts unnecessarily.

As to a multi-meter, get a Fluke. Their $200 instruments sell all the time 
for $50 to $75 on the big auction web site by the Bay. You can drop it and 
it won't break in it's thick rubber holder, you can't hurt the micro amp 
ECU's with it, and you will have quality data for a lifetime of certainty. 
Far less costly in the long haul cause bad data is worse than no data.
