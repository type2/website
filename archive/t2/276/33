Subject: RE: [T2] 1 more time - Rear hatch door removal

Brad,

This is a tough job but can be done. The hinges are held in place with
circlips and pins much like the cab doors There are a couple different sizes
so keep track of them. The struggle comes in the torsion bar removal. These
must be unloaded and slid out sideways. It has been a while but that is it.
Just some circlips and cautious yarding. You can check out our site for the
illustration under body then rear panel lid.
