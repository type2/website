Subject: Tire Date of Manufacture - longish

To resurrect an old FART:::

Site :   
http://www.mailgate.org/gov/gov.us.topic.transport.road/msg00676.html

Partial cut and paste:

"SUMMARY: NHTSA's tire identification and recordkeeping regulation
requires new tire manufacturers and tire retreaders to mark a tire
identification number on one sidewall of each tire they produce. The
number is composed of the manufacturer's or retreader's identification
code, a tire size symbol, an optional descriptive code, and the date of
manufacture, which includes the date of retreading. The date is
reflected in the last 3 digits of the number.
    In response to petitions for rulemaking, the agency is amending the
regulation to require the date to be expressed in 4 digits instead of
the currently required 3, and to reduce the minimum size of the digits
from the currently required minimum of 6 millimeters (mm) (\1/4\ inch)
to 4 mm (\5/32\ inch). The 4-digit date code will permit better
traceability of tires during recalls and allow easier identification of
older tires...."


Also:

"DATES: Effective date: The amendments in this final rule become
effective July 2, 2000. Optional early compliance is permitted,
commencing on the date of publication of this final rule in the Federal
Register...."
