You wouldnt believe what I did to mine. Pulled from a 69 westy with 48,000 
miles on it. Replaced with a 1641. The enigne (the 1600) sat inside a bus 
for 5 years, then sat outside in the Seattle area (read moist and wet) for  
another 4 years. Then I put it into a 1963 bus I had.

How to start it? Remove all plugs and have replacements ready. Replace 
points. Replace fuel filter. Drain oil and refill with straight 30 weight, 
adjust valves, use new valve cover gaskets. Squirt Marvell mystery oil into 
all cylinders through plug holes. No Im not kidding, use it. Turn engine 
over by hand (with wrench on pully) many times. Disconnect coil, turn it 
over with the key, but at short bursts to let keep from frying the starter. 
Install spark plugs, connect coil, fire it up. Like a new engine, dont let 
it sit at idle, rev it up and down for about 10 to 20 minutes. Drain oil. 
Clean oil screen. Start it again and drive it. Take it up to 50-60 mph again 
letting it speed up and slow down, you want the rings to move and seat again 
if they are stuck. Also, you want it to get warm enough to burn off any 
water in the oil. Figure about 15-20 minutes of driving. Should be fine. If 
anal change the oil again, and check valves again.
