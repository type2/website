Make sure that you fuse very close to where you tap the power (battery
or starter). I would just use some sort of in-line fuse.

range.

What do you want 30-50 Amps for??? That would be 360 - 600 Watts. Even
if you go with 100 Watt high beams, 20 Amps should be plenty. The higher
your fuse is rated, the more likely you are to cause damage to your
wiring before it blows.
