Subject: RE: timing light

Will,

I beginning a leisure search for a replacement. Maybe
I'll find that mythical westy in a barn.
An auction yard near me has a vasserbox, but water
cooling and f.i. sounds like a ring of Dante's hell to
me.
[Of course, a suburu change over sounds like a
challenge.]

BTW, ur timing light is in the mail. the mailman says
it will arrive in three days.
