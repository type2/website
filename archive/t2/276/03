Its really worth it to install relays and run power directly from the
generator or battery. You lose a lot of power when its routed through the
light switch. It makes a difference even if you're running conventional
lights. Daniel Stern Lighting http://lighting.mbz.org/ sells relay kits and
lights if you don't want to assemble the few parts yourself.
