Why two separate wires?  Just one should be sufficient.

I would go with 10 gauge for this application.

Definitely fuse the line separately.

That's up to you.  You can get DC circuit breakers at West Marine but they are not cheap (~$35).  You could also use a fuseable link, available at Pep Boys.  I would look for something in the 30-50 amp range.

There are lots of cheap relays out there.  You can get standard 30-40 amp relays at Autozone for a few bucks each.  They are the small black cube ones.  Dunno if you would need two or only one - you should check the current draw on the lights to be sure.
