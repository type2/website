Welcome to the sometimes frustrating sometimes wonderfull world of VW's.
Doing it yourself is the only way to know it was done right most of the
time. It is also a great feeling of satisfaction when you do get it right.

There is a test plug on the left(drivers side) of the transmission. It is a
17mm allen fitting. I had to go to a tool shop to find an allen that size.
Remove this plug and a small amount of fluid should just run out of the
hole. It is also within spec if you can stick your finger in the hole and
bend it at the first knuckle and feel fluid at the tip of your finger.

Good Luck and have fun with your new Bus.
