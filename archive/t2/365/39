Subject: 1.9L cat/muffler/tailpipe in Federal air-cooled?

Hi:

Has anybody made the substitution of the 1.9L water-cooled catalytic
converter, muffler and tailpipe for these items in a Federal air-cooled
Vanagon?  For some reason I'm thinking someone posted about a problem with
this swap, but I can't seem to find the post - if it existed in the first
place.

Has anybody actually done this swap?  Any problems?

TIA.
