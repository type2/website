Subject: Fuel gauge calibration

Hello all

I just recently replaced my fuel gauge sender. Since then when I fill the tank
the needle on the gauge only goes to about three quarters full. With the old
sender the needle would go to full but then drop to empty at half full and no
longer register. Could this new sender be faulty or is there a way to
calibrate the fuel gauge? I know on the earlier bays there was a screw on the
back of the gauge to calibrate it. Can anyone confirm that this screw is on my
78 before I have to take apart the instrument panel?

Thanks
Jasan
