Subject: Re: [T2] hyd valve adjustment procedure

This preloading advice is VERY old school.  Preloading  does nothing more
than cause wear, improper lift and never allow lifters to pump.  Some may
have success with it, but I guarantee you if they adjusted there valves
correctly they could feel a difference in the seat of their pants, and on a
dyno.  Most of the folks giving the preload advice give it for it is the
only way they have ever done it.


I probably have made $1000 in adjusting valves per www.bostonengine.com over
the last year and a half.  Customers claim it feels like they have a new
bus.  Follow the logic, it makes sense, AND not to mention it is the way
suggested in the new Bentley manual to boot.........
