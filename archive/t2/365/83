Hi Volks,

The new T-shirt design has been chosen and is now shown on the "T-Shirt
& Dash Plaque Logo" page.  Hope you like it as much as we do. 
Congratulations go out to the designer, Mandy Alves.  The "Sponsors
2003 & Door Prize" page has been updated with news of this years
sponsors to date.  If you or someone you know wishes to be a sponsor or
donor of a door prize please contact us !

Among some of the activities that you can participate in this year will
be the BusFusion VW Bus Painting, the BusFusion Art Show & Sale and the
BusFusion Flea Market.  So get prepared to participate !

New for this year, we will be collecting the camping fees and are
