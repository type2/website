Andrew, you didn't happen to turn the case over while
the distrubutor was removed did you, if so the drive
shaft is most likley not seated right, sometimes they
will slip out of place. If you turned the engine with
the shaft out of place, it will have to be dropped
back in with #1 set to fire TDC.  Phil
