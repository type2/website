Subject: Fuses

OK, van's not starting.  It's been suggested to replace fuses even though 
they look "good".  This has been successful for me before, replacing a fuse 
that looked good, thereby solving a problem.

So my question is this:  how do you tell a good fuse from a bad fuse?  I 
pulled out my little metal "Sucrets" box of new fuses, and even those looked 
kind of oxidized.  Is that bad?  Does it matter?  Is there a way to test 
fuses so you know they are good?

Thanks for the help.  By the way, '78 Westy 2.0L with fuel injection.
