That's the spirit. I'm so glad you're bus was running well and I've learned
a lot from your experience.

Can you get a new clamp? 021-905-250 is the number and Bus Boys carries
them.

That's not normal. It should be pressing up closer to the fan shroud.

That's what I use and I love those things. KD Tools also makes them under
the Gearwrench brand and I think they also rebrand them for Sears
(overpriced IMHO).

The best deals are online (also the best selection of Metric). You can get
offset, reversing, double box ends, pivoting, stubby. I prefer a studdy 10mm
for that job.
