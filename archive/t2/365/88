I am new to the Volkswagen scene and have been trying to do a lot of my
own work to my Volkswagen (this is because I am poor). I have learned
how to change my spark plugs and give my bus an oil change. I have even
dared to adjust my carb a little. But recently I have noticed some
transmission fluid now on the ground and I went looking into the type2
archives, over on the samba, and vintage bus for answers to one (and I
am sure a easy answer) on how to change or add transmission fluid. This
is my first vehicle that wasn't a automatic and I do want my Bus to
last. I realize that I will need transmission work done later and was
scared of the prices they told me for a rebuilt one. Guess I have a very
sought after transmissions that are used a lot on dune buggies (002
transmissions). But the guys at the transmission place shop told me to
keep fluid in it and just make sure I feel my Bus go into every gear and
I should be ok for another 10-15k miles they said. But, they forgot to
tell me how and where to add the transmission fluid (or maybe they
didn't forget and it's a conspiracy to generate more business).
I would love any and all help and hope I don't get a whole lot of people
thinking I don't know anything or this is a joke. I love my Bus and
someday I hope to be as smart as all these guys on here. But we all got
to start somewhere.


Thanks So Much,
