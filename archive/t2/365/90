Subject: testing a fuel sending unit out.

How to test a fuel sending unit out of the tank. I pulled it out about three 
years ago and it did work. Want to check before installing. Have an 
electrical tester and understand basics. Should there be some kind of power 
source or can it be done without. 72 bus
