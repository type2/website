Subject: Front sway bar mounting

I'm trying to wrap up my sway bar research and I was wondering, how do
people mount the front sway bar? The bushings for the 7/8" bar look like the
normal bushings just with a bigger hole, but the stock clamps, which I don't
want to re-use, look like a PITA to install.

I there a t-bolt clamp or similar that can be used on those tapered
bushings? I noticed at aircooled.net the same installation difficulty
comments are mentioned shown beside the stock clamps and they recommend
their SS kit.

Does the link pin of ball joint clamps work on a bus or what do people use
when the clamps are not included in the sway bar kit? For example, the RMMW
kit doesn't seem to include front mounting hardware.
