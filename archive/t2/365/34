Subject: should my dizzy retard # 3 Cyl 4 degrees?

I have a SVDA Dizzy on my carburated 2 liter (dellorto's) and noticed today that it is retarding # 3 cyl 4 drgrees.  I thought only upright bug engines needed the # 3 Cyl retarded due to the extra heat that cylinder has from lack of cooling. Is it necessary to have it retarded for the type 4 engine? Paul.
