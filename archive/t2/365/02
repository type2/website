Here is a FAQ I found on the link...>>>

Q: Can I use GL-5 when the manufacturer calls for GL-4?
A: Yes. GL-5 is downward compatible, meaning it can be used in place of 
lower GL rated oils. However, GL-4 (or lower) is not upward compatible and 
cannot be used when a higher GL rating is specified.
