Subject: dizzy hole isn't deep enough

got an engine that had about 80 K on it and done a
little work to the outside but didn't crack the case
or anything.  Went to put in the distributor but the
hole isn't nearly deep enough.  can i just push the
metal piece further into the hole? and has the angle
of the notch now become misaligned with the engine?
