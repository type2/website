Subject: side tent

hi all , i am selling my westy side tent and am offering it to the list 
first, its an original westy tent with floor, the tent itself is in great 
shape, no dry rot, holes or burns the only bad parts are = the rubber piece 
that connects to the rain gutter has torn from the material at one end for 
about 6 inches.. it doesnt leak, and really has no ill effect, as 95% of the 
rubber still holds to the bus, last is that where the tent attaches to the 
underside of the bus is a little dirty, but not bad, inside floor of the tent 
isnt perfect, but no rot, rips, or burns. the tent has all the correct poles, 
and i believe its still the original guy lines. please email if youre 
interested, i can send pictures. im asking 350.00 plus shipping, or you can 
pick it up if you like i am 15 minutes north of boston. thanks..
scott .. 71 vesty
