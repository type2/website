ok, what you have all been waiting for...pics of my new avp engine
for the 78 Champagne Edition.

For all of you who ask about these engines, here are the visuals.

I have just unwrapped it and otherwise is untouched from the "factory".
Sorry for the large pic sizes, but didn't want to take the time to cut
them down before I went back out and started seeing how things fit.

The case is painted.  :-((  but not too bad

Notice the "bracket" holding the spring and dizzy drive.

One of the heads is "AMC", the other ?

Notice that the oil gallery plugs are tapped and plugged!

Cheers, dave
