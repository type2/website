Karl and others,

ahhhhh... thanks guys, after I thought about it I figured that was the 
case(pun intended). 

Still, for a t1 kinda guy, missing case bolts around the edges could be 
grounds for divorce!

Since I have "parts" from a 72-74 case I have been sand blasting and 
powder coating engine tin like crazy.  I am missing some pieces and some 
look *nothing* like what is on my 78.

The folks that  took apart the engine and case were gorillas in human 
suits....so I have lower engines studs to straighten, and lots of tin
to re-bend correctly...

I gotta tell you that trying to figure out where tin pieces go on a t4
...even with the bentley book is a challenge!  The pics are *small* and 
the pieces I have sometimes don't really match well.

For instance..the front(front is front) 1/2 cyl lower cylinder cover 
piece has a square hole in it!..and I am missing the tin that goes above
the 1/2 cylinder in the rear(have lower piece).

*no* thermostat parts at all.<sigh>..no flappers, roller..nothing.

The fan has two blades missing..but I *did* find the rear support bar!

I have an 81 vanagon engine that I can steal parts from, but somehow the 
fan looks a little different...and it is missing all of the tstat/flapper 
stuff too.  !(-at-))(#!(-at-)((**&(-at-)&  damn stupid shade tree mechanics.

Guys, remember that even an experienced mechanic can be stumped when
starting with a couple of partial engines that weren't together when he 
started on them!

Fer instance, how do you put the fan shroud together with the oil stick 
guide at such an angle(it is bent wrong right now also)...Do you put the 
oil filler tube in first and then the fan shroud? ...still playing with it 
and test fitting parts.

Thanks to all...more pics next week..

Hints appreciated, dave
