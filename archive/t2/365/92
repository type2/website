Subject: 71 westy for sale

Hi everybody, I have a 71 westy poptop camper for sale in the Newark NJ 
area.  The van is listed on TheSamba.com under type 2 vehicles for sale.  
Just search in the NJ area.  It is black and tan with a dented in nose.  
This is a running bus.  The bus has some rust in the rockers and the nose, 
but nothing structural.  The bus will need a new nose to be a nice looking 
car.  It has the full camper interior including the bed, upper cot, childs 
cot, mosquito screen, sink cabinet w/ shelves inside, etc.  I installed a 
new poptop canvas two years ago and it still looks new.  The bus has 
excellent brakes with newer drums in the rear.  The engine has approx 20,000 
on a full rebuild.  It needs a clutch.  It was my daily driver until the 
clutch started slipping.  It may need a valve job-I havent had time to fully 
diagnose it yet.  I may decide to keep the engine anyway.  If no one wants 
the whole bus, then I will part it out.  I really want to sell it whole 
though.  I am asking 1000$ but I will take reasonable offers.  The bus can 
be driven to you up to 100 miles away.  Feel free to email me or call me 
with any questions.  Thanks, Brian  973-762-4552 VWcamper1971(-at-)msn.com
