Paul,


You have really answered your own questions here. Adjust the valves until
the motor runs the best it can. If you have a good ear for the valve noises
you hear, you will get it right, especially if you can spend some time
fiddling. 

The hydros need to be tighter than solids, but adjusting them too tight
leaves no clearance for the lifter to pump up, resulting in the tight
clearance you noticed after a run. How do you know when the valve clearances
are too tight? You measure them, or you know because the engine runs poorly
and has no power. How do you know when they are adjusted properly? The
engine sounds good and has plenty power. Play with the valve adjustment
enough and you will feel and hear when they are right. You are well on the
way to this, judging from your last post.

On my solid lifter motor I adjust the valves with the engine hot, to .003
-.004 clearance. You won't find my method in the bentley, but it works for
me. My point is to find a technique which is based as much on what the motor
is telling you, as on a book or someone else's method.
