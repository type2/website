Guys,

I got another 1/8 tank on a new fuel sender gauge by pulling the 
instrument cluster and tightening the two nuts on the gauge end slightly 
and reseating anc checking all of my grounds on the instrument cluster.

I had two ground wires that were loose and when I tried to bend the tabs
slightly, both broke...replaced tham and all was fine.

Haven't filled up yet again, but symptoms sound the same as me....and I 
*did* adjust the sender before installing it!

Cheers, dave
