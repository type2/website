14" commercial rated tires have always been a minute fraction of the 
commercial tire market. I can't name another vehicle that calls for 14" 
commercial load rated tires. But it seems clear that the 
Transporter/Vanagon production is the only market of significance calling 
for these "tiny" commercial rated tires. I doubt if any tire manufacturer 
wants to do runs of a particular spec tire which has a need of less than a 
few 10,000's of tires per year. That compared to 100's of thousands of each 
of 78 different sizes, in 5 classes, and 7 tread styles each.

These Bus tires just show up as a bad speck on the balance sheets. Low 
volume demand for high spec tires.

I'm glad I got a set of the C load range Continentals. If and when I see 
them do another run, I will quickly grab a set of the D load range to 
insure Continental continuety of great handling for big boxes on wheels.
