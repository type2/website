Subject: hyd valve adjustment procedure

I would add that the rockers are cupped (concave) at the point of contact with the pushrod, and this is out of your field of vision. 

I had pushrods make contact on the "high" part of the rocker without knowing it, which lead to a poor adjustment and more valve train noise than I started with.

Stick two fingers around the rocker's cup and feel the pushrod into it's deepest contact point, then go for 1.5-2 turns.

Later,

Billy


>Simple. Follow the normal valve adjusting procedure which requires you to use the rotor in the distributor to find TDC for #1. Turn the valve adustment screw until it contacts the valve stem, then 1.5-2 turns more. Bentley says 1 turn only, but wisdom and experience states the former. Rotate the engine 180 degree backwards, then do the valves for #2, then repeat for #3, then #4. Done.
