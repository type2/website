Lots of lessons to be learned here.

Every time the idea of assumption comes up, reject it and varify.

Predictably, the assumption leads to wasted time/money, more waisted than
actually required to diagnose in correct order and find and fix the problem.

Know also that a static tech with an ohm meter gets me within 10 every time
on 4 cylinder dizzies. But a timing light will work on any spark ignition
motor and is a good thing to use to VERIFY.

I never regap plugs. Once they wear 0.2 mm, I know I'm not getting all the
energy possible. Gas mileage begins to fall.

You just might try a piece of shim stock. Clean the shaft then flush with
carb leaner to get it bone dry of oil. Roughen the area with 120 grit. Lay
on a thin layer of Alumaweld then hit the back side of the shim stock with
the 120 grit and wrap it around the shaft and hold in place with rubber
bands. Then use a new clamp.
