Subject: retarding #3

i have a potentially retarded question about retarding #3... it made 
perfect sense to retard this plug when the old-style uprights had the 
oil cooler BLOCKING air flow to #3 (and heating the air too boot) 
making it run hot and suffer preignition, but it seems this would 
have been solved by the doghouse cooler. thus, no need for retard.
did vw engineer backwards and re-impede the airflow to #3 on the pancakes?

i would venture (and put on a flamesuit!) that since the mantra from 
1946 to 1970 was 'retard #3 to avoid preignition on it' that it just 
stays that way out of habit.  if there is something else that would 
cause #3 to run hotter, preignite,  and require the retard, i'd like 
to know what it is.
