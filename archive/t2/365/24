Yes, the shop owner at gowesty has ordained
himself smart enough to second guess the
engineers at VW.  Perhaps he should call and tell
VWAG that they never needed those reinforced 15"
tires on later T4 transporters.  He is apparently
also smarter than the people at tirerack who
won't sell you those unreinforced tires if you
tell them its for a vw van.  They do this just
because they don't like to sell tires, not
because they're afraid of killing someone and
getting sued.  

This isn't new thinking.  It's the same as all
the 14" nonreinforced passenger tire folks who
reason that their 1300-1400 lbs max load is
sufficient.  Everybody knows more than the
engineers.  

I will do nothing more to perpetuate this thread,
I promise.  Anyone who has any other questions or
comments for me, pmail them.
