Oooohhh Tony,

Now you've done it!  I want the 'necker knob'..skip the shade<VBG>

My Grandaddy always had one of those in his 42 Ford pick-em-up....and 
always had the "cheescake" shot of Rita Haworth or some other lady on it...

I really feel like being a little "not" politically correct today!

For all of you "young" whippersnappers out there, you can see one here

and I'm sure that any truck stop would have the more politically incorrect 
ones!

ROTFLOL, dave
