As far as I know, there have been only 2 manufacturers of VW 2.0L heads, AMC
and Volkswagen, so I'd say "AMC and Volkswagen."    You can confirm by
pulling the valve cover gasket off the "no name" head and looking for the VW
part number and logo.  Some have said that "mixing" heads in this fashion is
a no-no based on something that sounds scientific (e.g., "different alloys
expand at different rates, blah, blah") but I don't buy it.  First, you'd
figure AMC, eager to sell more heads, would recommend installing their
replacement heads only in pairs, which they don't, and, second, if the AMC
head had a materially different expansion rate than VW heads they'd specify
a different torque for the head bolts, which they also don't.

As far as I know AVP has a good reputation for building sound engines so I
sure wouldn't sweat the "mixed" heads and wouldn't start stating
categorically that heads shouldn't be mixed unless I had a Ph.D. in material
engineering.
