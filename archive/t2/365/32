Subject: Re: [T2] drag link tools

I just replaced my drag link, got it from The Bus Depot.

I used a pneumatic gun with a chisel tip.  I backed off the old crown 
nut and hit on it.  This took about 45 to 60 seconds per end to get it off.


It was very simple and quick.

I realize you may not have access to compressed air and the tools but 
this was how I did it.
