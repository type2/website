Subject: THE BUS RUNS!!!  Sort of...

Hi all,
 
Thanks for the help diagnosing my bus' start problem.  Turns out I had just reveresed the battery cables, since the colors were wrong [Red for -, Black for +]
 
The bus started up fine after I got the cables straightened out, but I went to start it today, and the battery was totaly dead.  No lights or accessories were plugged in.  
 
Anyone have a good troubleshooting idea for this situation?  I have a brand new voltage regulator that I boaught, but didn't install.  Could that cause the drain on the battery?
 
Thanks again,
Matt
