Subject: '77 CA vs. FED

My research on various emmissions components on my '77 Westy has led me to
suspect that the '77 Federal and California models are one in the same. The
emmissions sticker says it meets Fed & CA standards but maybe they all say
that.  ECU and exhaust systems seem to be the same.  Maybe the CAT only came
on the CA model...?

Anybody know for sure, or have an opinion?

Thanks,
RickG
