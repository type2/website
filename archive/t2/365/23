I agree with the article concerning the strength of the wheels (since the
wheel has applications on heavier vehicles than the bus, it should be
strong enough for the bus.

OTOH, I don't agree with his ideas on tire load.  Yes, the tires they sell
are rated at 1500 pounds, but it's bad practice to run anything near its
rated load.  Passenger-rated tires have somewhat inflated load ratings, as
they are expected to not be loaded fully all the time, as truck tires are.
A 1500-lb rated passenger tire might be equivalent to a 1300-lb truck
tire.  A fully-loaded bus weighs about 5000 pounds.  Splitting this among
four wheels yields 1250 pounds per wheel, but the wheels on a bus are not
all loaded equally, so one wheel will probably see a lot more than 1300
pounds.  Yes, I ran passenger tires for years with no problem, but when I
did have problems they certainly got my attention!
