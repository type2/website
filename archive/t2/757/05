1ST: move vehicle away from your house. 
2ND: collect a pile of fire extinguishers
3RD: disconnect your battery, put out your cigarette (they're bad for you anyhow)

4th: check fuel flow quantity out of tank
5th: clean jets - main and idle in carb
6th: inspect the fuel flow from fuel line to carb
7th: inspect volume out of fuel pump if carb, pressure out of pump if fuel injected

8th: go through tuneup procedure per Bentley/Muir. You prob don't need to replace any parts, just adjust everything. 

Good luck.
