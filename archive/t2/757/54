Subject: Fw: [T2] Positive Battery Cable 

Nancy,

I am getting some of these (211 971 228 A) in next week and because I am not
a corp. giant I will be selling them for $24.95. Please call to order.

The red wire goes to the double relay on the FI buses, the red and white go
to the test circuit and the earlies red and white go to the test circuit and
do not do anything any more.

This is what the diagrams show and also what I have generally observed on
 these buses.

You may not need one.

Along with the new parts that we can get you, we stock every part used and
all are clean inspected and repaired before shipping. And we only sell
'68-'79 bus parts. I know a lot about bus' too and guess what else, when you
call, you talk to me directly and I'm a nice guy to boot.

 -Joe
