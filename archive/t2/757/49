Subject: Re: [T2] CHT gauge- was Tach-> Red-Line/Idle/Wiring

Having thought that VDO CHT gauge was very inaccurate myself, I have 
been pleasantly surprised.  When I'm driving on the freeway, whether hot 
or cold, it has consistantly read at 350 degrees.  If I start going up a 
hill it gets hotter (up to 410ish), down a hill it obviously drops. 
However, my engine has finally broken in and 350 is where it hangs out 
in hot or cold weather...

thanks,
Mike
