Subject: Self Diagnosis Check.

Hi everyone,
just checking a self-diagnosis with you all.

I noticed our van backfiring this weekend when I changed down gears 
approaching a junction/traffic lights/ etc.. Also when idling the revs 
move up and down and don't settle, both when cold and warm.

Haynes points towards a 'weak mixture' and suggests adjusting the 
carburettor.
Richard Atwell suggests a similar thing on his website 
[http://www.ratwell.com/technical/FAQ/FAQContent.html#backfire]

I'm new to this mechanical thing, and from the look of the manuals, 
synchronising dual carbs is probably not the best first job to do on 
our van. (I was going for an oil change as the first thing).

But on reading the archives the problem may by related to the exhaust 
system. Have I missed something and just gone for the most complicated 
option (synch'ing the carbs)?
How much damage is the backfiring going to do? How quickly does it need 
fixing?

FYI: we have a 1976 Type 2 Campervan, its a 2l Type4 engine.

many thanks

Julian
