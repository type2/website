Subject: RE: [T2] Tach-> Red-Line/Idle/Wiring

I just came back from a spin in the bus and noticed that the tach jumps when
I use the directional signals.  This would lead me to believe that I don't
have a good 12 volt source (I tapped into the accessory lead for the radio
and who knows what the PO hooked into)... so is there a preferred wire for a
clean 12 volt source?  I would expect that this would be especially
important for a CHT.

Regards and TIA,

I forgot to add to keep the wire for CHT away from the fuel pump on a FI
