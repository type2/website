Subject: Dakota Digital CHT

Has anyone had any experience with the Dakota digital CHT gauge?  There 
was some discussion awhile back which indicated that this might be a 
promising alternative to the cheap VDO setup.  Also are the Dakota 
Digital units temperature compensated for cold junction temp.

Also;  what is the best way to get the thermocouple through the engine 
cooling tin???

I'm preparing for a long trip in July and I want to have a reliable CHT 
for once.
