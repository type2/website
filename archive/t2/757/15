I had always wondered the same thing, but then a Geico representative told me that, more or less, it's considered a large vehicle, like an SUV of sorts, but without any of the modern safety features.

I don't know what Volvo you have, but I used to own a 1983 Turbo Wagon.

I know that from 1983 and up, all Volvos have disc brakes all around. In 1984, they offered ABS brakes.


I'm not sure what year Busses got front DISC brakes, but I know that my 73 has them.

But of course the 73 doesn't have rear disc brakes (nor to the majority of the cars on the road).

I can't really say... but the lady just explained to me that it doesn't have any modern safety features (like impact bumpers and whatnot...)

I just wonder why they consider a bus a higher risk than a volvo that
can do way more damage?
