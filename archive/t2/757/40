I was on my way to Wally World a few days ago and as I pulled into a parking
space there was a sound like a 50-gallon glass jar breaking and the bus
settled on the drivers side in the rear.  Got out to find a flat tire.  I
expected from the sound that I'd find a hole in the bus somewhere.

I'd already replaced the front tires due to excessive wear.  All of the
tires came with the bus and the age was unknown, though the tread on all
tires was really quite good when we got the bus.  I was planning on
replacing the rear tires sometime soon.

I waited too long.  The left rear tire failed, blowing out a section of
tread.  Simple age, though for a bit I thought I'd run over something to
cause so much damage to the tire.  New tires on order for the rear.

I'm also going to replace the spare in a few weeks just to be safe.

I'm really grateful that the tire waited for the parking lot to blow.  If it
had gone anywhere between the house and the store, with the bus running at
45 mph, it might have gotten more exciting than I'd like.
