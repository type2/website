Your vac seems low initially-
My daughter's 75 had exact same symptoms- turned out to be a leak in a 
"vac" line going from the airbox (intake plenum)- carefully check the 
wide (3/8"? takeoffs on the left side, especially the deep one with the 
90 degree bend in the connector; I had one fail there and used a hose 
clamp to seal it.  She also had (later) a leak in the large 2" tubes 
that connect the airbox to the intake runners.  Until it was found, she 
put a hammer on the gas pedal and let it warm up.
