 Not sure how [putting temp sensor II on cyl 2] will affect the running

 cylinder. The engine may run richer, thinking it is colder than it is.

My daughter's rebuild (75 bus)invoved the mechanic using 74 heads I
believe, and the extra holes or pipes Darren observed are the egr ports.
I believe he said something about the 74's breathing better?
He also put the sensor on the right side by #2 cyl- he is an experienced
VW (worked for the Co) mechanic who must know his stuff, as her engine
leaks not a drop, and it's been  a year and 4 mo since the rebuild. 
Isn't the notion of #3 running the hottest is for the old cooling
system- the fan and baffle setup on the pancake engines allow equal
cooling?
