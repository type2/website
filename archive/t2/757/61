FWIW, here in Seattle they say to take it to a special hazardous-waste
collection site:
http://www.govlink.org/hazwaste/house/disposal/AnyProduct.cfm?entityID=907&ca
tID=974

Who *are* those people who say to dump it down the drain?  Dumping
antifreeze and brake fluid into the sewer is pretty much like dumping
it into a river or the ocean, I would think.  Nothing I can think of
that happens in a sewage treatment plant would make those sorts of
contaminants "go away" -- the only benefit you're getting is dilution,
and we all know that dilution is NOT the solution to pollution.
(maybe it worked when there weren't six billion of us...)
