I'm not a physics engineer, but I stayed in a Holiday Inn Express last
night... ;-)

I was told that the fuel in the air being drawn through the intake
manifold absorbs heat, and because of its velocity draws more heat
than the manifold is getting from the engine.

I do know that fuelie dragsters will often have sheets of ice and
frost on the intake and SC housing after a run.
