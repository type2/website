Subject: green wire in westy

The green wire to which Paul is referring I believe,
is "not" a VW wire, it's a westfalia wire.  The one in
my 79 Westy is a solid strand about 1/4 inch thick
with green rubber insulation(big wire!) It goes from
the breaker box under the Z bed to a metal clamp that
is welded to the body next to the driver's side rear
wheel well under the Z-Bed.  Greg
