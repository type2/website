Subject: Re: [T2] RE: [VB] Type 4 oil cooler in a doghouse

One concern (in my weak mind) about using a more efficient oil
radiator in the stock doghouse location:

Wouldn't the increased efficiency also increase the temperature of the
air heading for #3? I don't have a type1 engine to look at at the
moment, so the doghouse cooler may prevent such a situation...
