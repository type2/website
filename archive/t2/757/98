Subject: 78 air cleaner vac hose?

Richard(and others),

What is the purpose of the vac hose that goes over to the air cleaner?

I started looking at the diageam at www.ratwell.com and realized mine was 
different!  No hose to air cleaner from the distributor tees.

There is no preheat to the air cleaner, so nothing to activate inside 
there?...or is there?

and what for?


Cheers, dave
