Subject: Positive Battery Cable

I need a positve battery cable for my 73 Westy. Part number is 211971228A, according to VWofA. Bus Depot doesn't carry it. Checker has something called an Autocraft A 2640043. Is this the same thing? The cable currently in my bus has a heavy black wire and a lighter red wire. The red wire is nearly separated from the brassish clampy thingee that goes on the positive post. If one of our list vendors out there has one, I'd MUCH rather buy it from one of us than from one of the Corporate Giants. Let me know. Thanks!
