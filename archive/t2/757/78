Subject: 72 Westy water tank filler tube

Greetings all,

Finally finishing off the last of the pieces in the camper...the icebox/sink. 
Does anyone happen to know where one might pick up the 1.25 inch (approx.) 
diameter filler tube that pushes into the water tank?

I busted off the threaded part trying to get it out...
