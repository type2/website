Paul,

Thanks for your reply.  My guess also was that it was from the aux battery
and/or city power converter.  My problem is, as you mentioned, where should
it be connected and/or fused?  I'd like to hook up my radio to the aux
battery so that I can play it without killing the main/starting battery.

If my '79 interior extraction notes are correct, that red wire is the
power feed for all things non-fridge related. Can't remember which fuse
it goes to, and I of course failed to note it when I pulled it. This
was the wire I was wondering about why it did n't go to the extra
battery / city power converter in a different thread.
Good Luck,
