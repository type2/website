Subject: nice Vanagon air cooled Westy for sale in SF...

If anyone is thinking of getting a Vanagon series westy but wants to 
stick with an air cooled engine here's a nice one I'm selling on 
"that auction site"

I drove a 72 Westy from the artic circle to Panama.  I love Bay 
Buses, but for long drives the Vanagon series is a nicer ride.  If I 
went on a long trip again I would do it in a Vanagon...
