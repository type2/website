Subject: Late bay parts cheap

Hi folks,

I'm disassembling a 1979, auto tranny bus that's been sitting in my
driveway.  It's got to go!  If there's any parts that you need let me know.
There's no engine, but some of the engine peripherals are there.  Also, some
of the glass is already spoken for.  Any $$$ I realize from the sale of
parts will be split between the Long Island Volkswagen Club and the Type 2
list.  Help the list and get parts cheap, what more could you ask for ?
