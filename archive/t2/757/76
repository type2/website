I also forgot to mention but if the carb ports get too cold the fuel
can no longer turn to gas and thus the engine can start to shudder due
to lack of fuel. If the car is then left for a while with the engine
off the ports get warmer and the engine will run smooth again. The
process can then repeat and hence it can seem like the car is healing
itself.
