Subject: Braking problem update

Quite a while back I asked about a braking problem I was having, where after 
about 10 minutes of driving the brakes would have slowly applied enough for 
me to really notice the drag. I would have to shut off the engine to release 
the vacuum in the brake booster servo, and then it would be fine for another 
ten minutes or so.

Someone suggested liquid in the brake booster servo. I also noticed that brake 
fluid was dissappearing fairly quickly. Well...it was in the brake servo. I 
guess there's a seal that needs replacing.

Rather than pull the whole thing apart I decided to just disconnect and cap 
the vacuum line to the booster and use the brakes the old-fashioned way. The 
strange part is...now my fuel economy has improved significantly. Before, I 
could really smell that the engine was running rich, but now it seems to be 
normal (and just after I bought carb kits to redo the carbs). 

Any ideas as to why that would have happened? Maybe it's just coincidence?
