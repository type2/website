Problem is that it's not really an RV any more. Only thing left is the
bed. Otherwise it's a passenger bus.

Also, I drive over 20k per year. To and from work is only 7miles each
way. Rest is evenings and weekends.

Progressive doesn't base on primary and secondary. Apparently they
take the driver with the worst record and apply it to all vehicles. At
least that was the impression I got while on the phone... Since both
of our records are clean, it's a non-issue there. But they broke the
insurance up by vehicle when pricing it out. The volvo was cheap. Bus
wasn't.

I just wonder why they consider a bus a higher risk than a volvo that
can do way more damage?
