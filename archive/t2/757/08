Timo,
    I wish I could tell you what wires you needed to cross, but I don't 
sorry. I dunno if anyone will either. I tried asking this same question 
a while back but maybe everyone thought I was trying to steal my own 
bus. :)     One tip I learned over on STF was to buy a new switch and 
hook up the wiring. Then turn the switch with a screwdriver. That way 
you know if a new switch will solve your problem before you fight with 
taking your steering wheel off.
