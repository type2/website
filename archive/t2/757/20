The  legal speed limit in most states is 70 mph, some 65. What's the
hurry? Slow down and enjoy the view out of that big bay window! And
save some $$ on gas and maintenance while you're at it. As far as
upshifting, just listen to the motor. It'll tell you when it wants to
shift. It does start to run out of torque about 4k rpm. No tach
required. Does anyone have a graph showing the horsepower and torque
bands over the rev range of a stock Type 4 motor?

There are at least 5 Westies and several Vanagons here in A2. Haven't
seen a real Bus/Kombi/Transporter in these parts in a while.

Am I right in suspecting piston blow-by for the slight compression
chuffing when backing down the gears or slowing down after taking her
out of gear? (I removed the wadded up paper towels in the oil breather
plenum left there by the PO)
