Subject: Re: [T2] Hubcap Story...

I had a continental tire disintigrate on me last aug.... on the way to Buses of
the Corn.
That tire left a few inches of the sidewall on the rim,, the rest ... who
knows....
but we didn't suffer any wild ride... no excitement... I just steered to the
shoulder,, and brought it to a controlled stop.
Got out and dropped my JAW,,, as I thought it was just flat......
I was stunned as I had just checked tires less than an hour before...

Most damage was to the fender lip and inside the wheel well...

I thank my lucky stars.......  maybe that is the difference of a Bay bus at
75mph,, and a Split.....

But,, in my search of replacement tires ... I found that tire was at it's rated
age,, and milage,,  5 years. 50,000 miles.. even though it had tread left.....
it was tired,,no pun intended

I have seen plenty of good tires turn bad as soon as you put them on ..... just
simply tooo old.
That old spare your carrying,, just in case you have a puncture,,,  it may only
be good enough to get you off the highway... not safe to drive that last few
hundred miles

ymmv

the report age seems to be what's been blamed for the failure.
