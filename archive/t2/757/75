Hi,

I am no expert but on my Type4 engine air intake there is a flap that
is rasied and lowered by an air thermostat via a vacuum suction. The
flap varies the ratio of cooler air from the engine bay to hotter air
ducted from near number 1 cylinder. If suction is lost the flap is
left closed and only cool air will hit the carbs. The result will be
that the the carb intake will be cold (it can even get ice on it) due
to the evaporation of the fuel (just like some meths/solvent on your
hand). When the fuel evaporates energy is taken from the surroundings
(carb intake pipes) passed to the fuel molecues , expansion occurs and
a gas is formed.

On an earlier engine there may not be this flap and vaccum hose, it
may be a differrent arragement however the problem will be due to the
lack of hot air reaching the carbs. It all seems very strange since it
is hardly cold in the engine bay but the air to the carbs needs to be
warmer.

yours

Charles
