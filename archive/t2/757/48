Sherwin,

Here are the pics.

If some don't make sense, let me know.  Obviously, I did not folow the 
standard hose layout exactly and probably need to get another shot of the 
relay set up.

BTW, the VPC power supply setup is **far** superior to the DPD one.

BEWARE!  The pics are large...folks with a 56k connection can expect to 
wait on them.


The last 3 pics shown as best I could where the compressor *is*<grin> and 
where it isn't.

Bring on the questions!

To the other folks wanting the compressor shots, you have to wait till 
after this weekend cause this is the bus "daily driver" week....all 
week...and the list of things that I forgot to do and put off doing is 
starting to fill my 3X5 card for the bus.

You can also check the pics and see how I installed the nice 
retractable seatbelts from my 81 vanagon parts bus.

Cheers, dave


Cheers, dave
