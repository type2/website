Subject: Re: [VB] Type 4 oil cooler in a doghouse

I put a type IV oil cooler in a bus... does run cooler.
 
The fan shroud doghouse had to be deepened... Eric (of Veewee111) did it for me... just welded in an extra piece.   
 
The L shaped 'hoover bit' was also deepened.
 
I used longer studs on the stock doghouse base... ones off a typeIV motor.. to attach the type IV cooler. 
 
This was done 6? years ago... and that engine (in two different buses) has done well for me on many road trips, including in the hot SW desert.

There has to be a website with infos on how it is done but I'm still
looking for it. Anyone ?

In particular, is it "bolt on" for a type 1 doghouse as far as oil
cooler goes ?
Can i do it with a hacksaw and pop rivets ? I mean without a welder.
Can I buy a doghouse new that is modified for type 4 ?
Anyone has dimensions of a type1 and type4 coolers ?
Thanks !
