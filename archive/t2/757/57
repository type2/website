I've had the same experience a couple of times.  Tread peeled off, but bus
ran true.  Now if I had been going around a corner at the time...

One time I was going down I-5 on my motorcycle and smelled tire smoke.  I
came up behind a Toyota sedan that had smoke coming from the right rear
tire.  Pulled up and gestured at the driver, and after she decided that I
wasn't a deranged maniac she pulled over.

On closer inspection, she was driving on two sidewalls.  The tread was
completely gone!  The tire was one of the "superfiller" variety with
reinforced sidewalls, and the sidewalls were supporting the car!  The
driver said that the car had been "feeling a little funny" for the last 20
miles or so!  After the tire and rim cooled to the point where I could
touch it, I changed the tire and she went on her way.
