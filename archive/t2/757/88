Hi Karl,

Well, it seems that the booster was sucking the brake fluid into it only while 
the vacuum hose was attached, because before I attached the line, the brake 
fluid level didn't change, and now that it's no longer attached, it seems to 
be fine again. I will watch it closely, however. Thanks for the info.

I used a little hose to suck out the fluid...
