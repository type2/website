Bleach will likely fade the color.  Wash it off; upholstery cleaner
foams in nicely and can be toothbrushed and then vacuumed out.  Trace
the uppermost source of the leak (did they leave the windows open?) and
in a quickie fix, use liquid silicone (Dow windshield sealer) to seal
gaps.  Re gauge, mine's been doing that for 80 thou (got 232 thou) now,
I record every fillup milage and start looking for a station at 200
miles.  I'll deal with it (bad tank sender) when the engine must come
out or when odometer quits!
