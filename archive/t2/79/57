Bob,

I am sorry to say that we are not thinking the same thing.  The engine
block codes have no effect on timing.  Any B or AE engine will run with
any T1 distributor, timed to the spec for that distributor.  Any CB, CD,
AW, ED, or GD block will run with any T4 distributor. T4 engines will also
run, tho less well, with any T1 distributor.  The only caveat to each of
these statements is that the timing *must* be set to the spec for the
distributor.

Yes, Bentley mentions engine codes because Bentley was written for factory
new '68-'79 buses.  We don't own factory new buses.  There are no factory
new '68-'79 buses and have not been for 23 years.  Even if I ran across a
bus in a warehouse that had been stored since new, I would pull the
distributor and have a look at its code.

At this remove, any dist can be and has been found on any engine.  If you
lay out a statement that block code matters, then you have to take
responsibility for the poor new VW bus owner who reads your post in the
archives, mis-times his engine to the block code, and fries it.  To tell
him afterward, "Well... you had the wrong distributor" is not a help to
him.

Bob,

This is true.  To get any VW engine started initially, the safest course
of action is to time it statically to 7.5 BTDC.  After it starts and after
you have checked the dwell, however, it must be timed to the spec for the
distributor, using a timing light, at proper RPM, with hoses connected or
not, as listed in the distributor specifications on Jim Thomson's page.

We agree up to the last word.  Substitute "distributor" and I am with you.

No, Bob.  The moral of the story is that if you time to the block, not the
distributor, it can cause you to severely overheat the engine.
