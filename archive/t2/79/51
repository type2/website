I'm going to back Jamie up on this one.  That bus is by FAR the most
modified bus I've ever seen (including RoadCow), and the most adventure
friendly.  Not for the timid, a terror to the NOS crowd, but exactly the
vehicle you'd want to take to the Boundry Waters with a canoe up top.  I'd
throw that pull cord start on my 71 any day (not a lot of hills in Michigan
to roll start at bus by yourself).

I admit the inside of my bus is more the prissy clean type, but if I could
have two...
