Subject: Being "nice" on the list

I realize this is a bit off topic, but bear with me, some air-cooled
relevance is historically here.  I was stirred to write upon seeing John
Dillon's public reaction to Franklyn Tyler's post about those who
complained to him about his pic file format for selling a 57 doublecab. 
JDD's signature statment about rudeness I throught rather ironic.  First
of all, John, you said "some guy on the list"...at least have the
courtesy to name whom you speak of, be it FW or ILoveType2s(-at-)aol.com, his
identity.  Allow him his opinion (albeit it was also off topic) without
fanning the flames- as you worded your post I found it difficult to tell
if  you referred to FW or those who complained. It appears you favor
removing any flame sources, but secondly, I sense insult to FW- I don't
think you realize FW is "Mr Bubblehead" from what is likely the original
air-cooled internet list, situated on the Prodigy Auto BB as a VW
subject for many years since it started somewhere back in (94?).  He was
very helpful in a John Muir/Clara sort of style to beetle and bus
owners; he now seems more understated and perhaps a bit intimidated by
the current list?  I'd like to see more of his original posting - at
least the "Peace...." is there.  My message?
FW, JDD, there are times where it's best to say nothing......(-8
