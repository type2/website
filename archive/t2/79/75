File those flanges with a long metal file. The pipes warp and twist with 
age and will no longer seal when you tighten the head studs.

What I do is lay a long metal file across both pipes and then file them 
until the whole pipe edge is shiny clean.  Much like "machining" a head 
that is warped when doing a head gasket job on a water pumper. in other 
words you are do this for the same reason as the head gasket example 
-  with different means.
