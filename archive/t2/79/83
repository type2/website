This follows the Muir principle ( remember him, he wrote a book for Compleat Idiots :)
wherein you set you timing at the top ( full advance, all in, etc.... ) and let the bottom
go where it does, and if you don't like it, get another dizzy. No complicated formula, or
searching for the elusive # in the dark, at the back of the distributor, under 30 years
of corrosion and grime, then finding a chart with the "correct" specs.,etc....
This formula will bypass all modifications and render you dizzy matched to the job.
