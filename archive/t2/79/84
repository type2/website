If you live in a warm climate, you might consider just replacing it with screen.  That's what I did with mine ('71); it cost about $20.  True, it's a drawback in cold or 
rainy weather, but I've camped in both since then and haven't really found it to be a problem.  I string a tarp over the poptop to give me "eaves" if the weather's 
wet-looking, and if it's really cold, I just don't pop the top.

In mild-to-warm weather it's awesome, though.  Plenty of circulation and great view of the stars at night.

YMMV,
