Subject: 2.0 Liter Engine for sale

I'm taking a sabbatical from buses for a while, so I'm selling my spare
engine. I'll be selling my bus later on too. It has everything to do 
with financial concerns and nothing to do with my love of the vehicles.

The spare engine is one I built a couple years ago with the help of the list.
It has many new, and carefully prepared parts. It has been stored
for about 2 years now (with frequent hand-turning).

'77 case. 1800 heads. Hydraulic valves. New camshaft. I built this engine
with TLC to last for years and years.

And then the bad news. One cold winter morning, an oil galley plug blew
right in front of my house. It caused no damage, but as you may know,
the only proper way to replace an oil galley plug is to split the case and 
install a new oil galley plug; I was leaning toward tapping all the galleyways and 
installing the hex-type plugs. Anyway, I was out of time, so I used
a dime and some JB Weld and plugged the hole. I drove the bus another
1000 miles like this, but I never quite felt right about it. So when the
chance came to pick up an AVP rebuild and put it in my bus, I parked the
engine and installed the new one.

I'd like to get $550 out of the engine, as I have well over $1000 into
it--the number $1400 keeps resonating in my head, but I'm not certain.
Talk to me if you think the price needs adjustment. I need money. I can
probably hook you up with some exhaust parts and heat exhangers and such 
along with the deal. I might even through in a progressive carb.

You could drive it as is and the JB-patch might last 100,000 miles...or
you could fix the oil galley plugs and the engine is certain to last
150,000+ with proper care. I can drive 100 or so miles to deliver, 
or more if you'll help with expenses. I only have about 4 or 5,000 miles on
the engine total.

At any rate if you're interested, please let me know and I'll be happy
to answer questions as I can.

As for my bus, it's a '72 Riviera with an 1800 AVP engine in it. I haven't
settled on a price yet and I need it for another month or two, but I'll
post later about it. An overhead access panel has been installed above the
engine, but otherwise the bus is essentially original and pretty straight.
A solid, year-round, dependable driver with lots of potential.

I'm in Memphis, TN.

Thanks! Joe
