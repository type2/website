Subject: 2.0L heads on a 2.0L engine

Hi Volks:

Ugh, my '78 Westy has apparently dropped a valve seat. Time for yet
another top end rebuild. This makes about 6 in 10 years. Only about 20K
miles since the last one (that was a burned ring). I even found
myself thinking the unthinkable, albeit briefly: sell the bus?

But I can view this as an opportunity. My 2.0L engine came to me with 1800
heads and I've rebuilt it with 1800 heads several times. They used to be a
lot more available and affordable than 2.0L heads and they can be swapped
without modification to anything else. But now I find that The Bus Depot
has a source of heads that makes them all cost the same, so now maybe it's
time for me to get back to 2.0L heads on a 2.0L engine as God and the VW
engineers intended. My bus has not seen that since it's youth before me.

If power is directly proportional to displacement, then I might expect to
see a 10% increase in performance. Will I really? That would be cool.

Anyone out there made the switch and care to comment on the power/
performance difference, 1800-2000?

Anyone out there care to comment on the quality of The Bus Depot's heads
and their claim that the remanufature process they use is "better than
original" and somehow reduces dropped valve problems? I know generally
that dropped valve seats are the Achilles Heel of aircooled VW engines and
that this is a notoriously difficult engineering and design problem due to
the high heat of aircooled exhaust valves. I would welcome more technical
comment on this subject.

happy trails,
