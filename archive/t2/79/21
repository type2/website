Well, I really know nothing about this... but that's not stopped me from
commenting before!

It appears that the 1800cc and 2000cc heads are a "drop in" fit, so I'd
guess their displacement is just about the same.  (I've never seen a
published statistic about the "engineered" displacement of these heads.)
Ergo, there's no change in the engine's total displacement and no change in
the engine's power.  If, somehow, the displacement of the 1800cc heads was
much greater than the displacement of the 2000cc heads, then your engine
would have a greater total displacement, but a much lower compression ratio.
I'd guess you'd lose more than you'd gain.

Looking at the Tom Wilson book, the only difference mentioned between the
two heads that relates (maybe) to power is valve sizes.
