How many of you subscribe to WolfsburgWired of Wolfsburg West (I really
don't need to know)? I find their Technical Tips to be excellent. Text and
pics for the beginner, what a concept. Oh yeah, and they are color pics.
This month is "12 Volt Wiper Armature Installation".
How do their prices compare to other online VW stores?
