You have to see this bus in person to gain the respect it deserves,,

woodstove with gas fired ignition system, and the accessory hotdog roaster
rotisary ,, 2 burner stove for the days you don't want to fire up the wood
stove,, if you run the battery dead on the ice, and can't push start it,, use
the pull cord,, and the ingenious "reverse engineered" heater boxes with the
exhaust on the outside and the heated air on the inside.. and many many more
very convenient modifications! 

Years of experience worked into a single bus!

view it in awe!   http://dreamwater.com/dbg/lago62.htm
