No, Ron. What you are describing is 1979 CALIF- ONLY.
Go to the 68-79 Bentley, section 5, page 15. Bottom right drawing is 79 Cal. The
79 heads are square port. That left side manifold will only fit on those heads.
On page 15 in the main pic [not the drawings] is the 75 to 78 system. Same as
what he should have and the your website drawing that I included.
