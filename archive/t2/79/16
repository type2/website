>When I put together my Westfakia last summer, I 
modified the Z-Bed to go
full width, and tossed out the closet and cabinet

that blocked the view out
the passenger side rear window. <

Clearly you already know of the fullwidth bed and
no rear cabinet arrangement.  The danger of
posting off digest mode is that I don't read them
all prior to replying and look like an idiot.

>With the spare relocated onto the nose I
have the roomiest VW rear bedroom I know of.

The roomiest VW rear bedroom is the vanagon with
fullwidth westy bed, ala my weekender.  Queensize
and very comfy 'cause those cushions are about
twice as thick.  Hey, I just noticed I have one
of those for sale.
