Subject: Fuel Fill Hose, Filler neckto tank 72-79 Bus HELP!

Does anyone know where I can find this part?            The number is
211-201-125D.

     Bus Boys lists it but NLA, I called my dealer in Annapolis and he
checked and also said NLA. Bus Depot sells the upper filler neck collar
(211-201-119) but that is not the one I need. Mine is badly dryrotted and
leaking gas when the tank is more than 1/2 full and going around turns or
on fill up. Please help as I want to go camping this weekend and was hoping
to take Possum for her maiden camping trip. Used is fine with me as long as
it is in good shape.
