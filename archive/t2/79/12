Nice bus Tommy.  Greg, this could certainly be done,
but you could also use my approach.  I have the full
width bed from 74, but I think it was available in
several years.  The cabinet in this bus is set behind
the zbed.  I remove it and put foam in its place.  You
gat a large rear bed and a nice view of the road. 
Cabinet under the zbed is larger than the 71 style and
a couple of tupperware cargo contianers hold the rest
of my stuff.  With my cabinetry removed (rear closet
and kitchen stuff), I end up with something similar to
Tommy's, but I can easily reinstall my stuff to stock.
 Maybe hunting down a junk westy with this style bed
would be easier than cutting and fabbing what you
have.
