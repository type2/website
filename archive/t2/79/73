Subject: Re: [T2] New Engine for a 78 Westy


Jake Raby or Bob Donalds, only two in the typeIV market worth sending your
$$. Bob Donalds is at Boston Engine and Jake should be able to be located
on the web. These 2 guys have been doing these motors right longer than
anyone. They are not cheap but a cheap motor isnt good and a good motor
isnt cheap... I rebuilt my type IV using their advice and is runs better
and cooler than any type IV I've ever done before.
