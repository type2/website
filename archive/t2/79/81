Subject: Wanted:  cooling tin for carb'ed 1800

I've found several "modifications" made by the
Dumb Previous Owner (hereinafter DPO) to my
cooling tin.  DPO used some sort of diagonals or
snips to make his life easier when changing plugs
etc.  With the new and improved larger sparkplug
holes in the tin, I cannot seal the holes with
the plug boots.  

Anyone have used tin sitting in a storage shed
you would like to have adopted by a good family? 

Or any ideas how to seal the thing should no tin
become available?
