If you mean the lower bent hose, and it's there but just cracked, try
what I did a few years ago (working through the round access hole behind
the ECU.- cut a piece of flashing to act as an overlapping collar a few
inches beyond the rubber connector.  Have ready about 3 screw hose
clamps that will go around the whole thing.  Glop up the hose and the
flashing with a sealer said to resist gasoline (I used silicone; I think
you can check boat stores for an urethane sealer).
Wrap it around the rubber connector and clamp it in place. I used a
piece of twisted wire to temporarily hold it While putting the screw
clamps in place. This connection is not under pressure if you are vented
properly.
