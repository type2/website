I always assumed that changes in these areas over the years and the 
subsequent need for changes in the advance curve _are_the reason for the many 
different distributor models used over the years.  I guess the basic question 
is how many of the changes that create a need for altering the advance curve 
are associated with bottom end case/crank/rod design and how many are related 
to top end "everything else".

Its kind of humorous to see how many in the aftermarket parts industry 
expects us to overlook 40 years of constant engineering developments and the 
many engine "recipes" folks use to enhance the performance of ACVW's when 
they sell us the "one size fits all" advance curve of a straight out the box 
.009.

It seems to me that timing is just too critical an aspect of engine's 
performance to spend thousands of dollars on a performance engine and then 
not try to get the curve right!
