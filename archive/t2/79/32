On a cold winter day it will probably not overheat.  On a hot summer 
day it will probably overheat badly.

The engine seal is as important to the aircooled engine as the 
radiator hoses are to a watercooled engine.  They direct the "coolent" 
and make sure that it goes to the right place.

In addition, your cooling fan will suck lots of dust and dirt up into 
the engine bay, which isn't good either.  Even my well-sealed engine 
bay gets pretty dust from the tiny air leaks here and there.
