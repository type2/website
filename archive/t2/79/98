Subject: Re: [T2] New Engine for a 78 Westy

I've been very happy with my new Raby (www.aircooledtechnology.com) engine. 
It's got plenty of extra umph when needed, the turn-around time was as 
expected, and he's already got everything set up to ship an engine to 
anywhere it's needed.

All in all, the money spent was well worth it. In the few weeks I've driven 
it, I've already put over 1500 miles on it (and I only live 10 miles from my 
office!) and am preparing for a trip to the moutains this weekend. While I'm 
concerned about the rest of the 30 year old parts, the engine is the least 
of my concearns.

In fact, the only problem I'm having is a good one. The silly thing runs too 
cool to generate any heat, while there's plenty of air blowing through the 
vents, it's cold. I've said it before, but I can get out after 2 hours of 
solid driving and place my hand on any part of the engine without any fear 
of getting burned. I guess I'll appreciate that more this summer...
