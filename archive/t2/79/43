Hi Greg,

	I decided to do this exact same conversion in my bus, but instead of
cutting down the original cabinet in my bus (which was still in pretty
decent shape), I fabricated a new shorter cabinet from 1/2" Baltic Birch
plywood.  By using the old cabinet as a template (and with my dad's
carpentry skills) I was able to get the whole cabinet out of one 5'x5' sheet
with some left over for new projects.  I decided to go for access from the
top instead of the front, but it could work well either way.  You can see
how it came out here:  http://www.geocities.com/vwcamper72 .  If you need
more pictures or details, let me know.

									Hope this helps.
