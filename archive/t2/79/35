I am almost done building a 2000 engine with 1800 heads. I CC'd the old 2000
heads to compare them to the 1800 and found the 1800s have 3 more CCs of area
than the 2000 heads so definitely check your compression to see if you need
shims or not. I found great instructions in the archives on how to calculate
compression ratio. Check it out you may save yourself future problems. At least
CC the chambers on both the 2000 and any good chamber left on your 1800 heads.
If the 2000 chambers are the same your home free. If they are smaller you should
shim the heads. If they are larger you should be fine as long as there is only a
few CCs difference. If the difference is large they will still work but you may
notice a decrease in power due to lower compression ratio. The good thing about
lower compression ratio is a cooler running engine which may be what you need to
prevent valve damage in the future.
