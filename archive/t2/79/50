I think maybe we are thinking the same thing but saying it differently,
but if you look on pg 72 of the Engine chapter of Bentley it shows the
timing settings and each of them are based on engine codes

engine code             setting
  R                        0
  AE                       5 after
  CB single carb           5 after
  CB dual carb /AW         10 after
  CD/AW(fi)/ED             5 after
  ED                       5 after
  GD                       7.5 before

if you put the wrong dist on an engine you would still set the static
timing based on the engine installed.   now once engine is running you
would be best set it at best compromise to get sufficient advance.

we are saying the same thing, but the amount of advance and initial static
timing are based on the engine not what dizzy is in there....I have a GD
block with FI, even if I put a dizzy in there from an AW block I would
still set the initial static timing at 7.5 before rather than 10 after
TDC.  once the engine is running then I would use my timing light to get
the best operation

I think we are saying the same thing, AFTER you get the engine running and
check and verify and adjust with a timing light,  especially my opinion is
that a type IV engine cannot be properly timed without a timing light to
check both start timing and proper ADVANCE for that BLOCK
