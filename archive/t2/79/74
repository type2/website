I want to examine this a bit further.  My first impulse was to agree with 
Steve, but when I thought about it further, I am inclined to believe that 
both the distributor type and the engine type are involved in timing settings.

Steve, are you saying that there is *no* difference in timing requirements 
for all of those engine types that Bob listed from Bentley?  In other 
words, if you put the same distributor in each of those engines and timed 
it to the specs of the distributor, it would always be 100% correct?

Said another way, are the advance specifications over the entire rpm curve 
of each engine identical?  Or can a fuel-injected engine tolerate more 
advance at, say 2500rpm than a dual carburated engine?  Or a single-carbbed 
engine?  Does valve size affect timing?  How about rod 
length?  Displacement?  Combustion chamber shape? (there's one that should 
get some nods from the likes of Jake Raby and John(-at-)aircooled)

I think the answer is, "Yes".  There are differences in the engine 
themselves, independent of the distributor that affect timing.  So what to 
do?  There are only two ideal choices:

a) Run the stock distributor for the engine that you have and time it to spec.
b) Do exhaustive, accurate measurement and testing of the 
engine/distributor combination that you have.

Since b) is next-to-impossible for those of us without a laboratory and 
months of free time, I would recommend that people run the stock 
distributor for their engine.  If that's not possible either, my guess is 
that the distributor has a greater effect than the block, so go with the 
distributor's timing specs rather than the block's, but know that it is not 
perfect and may still cause problems, or at least sub-optimal 
power/economy/longevity.

Comments?  Flames?  Lemme have it.  :)
