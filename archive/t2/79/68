Hi Bob,
    Don't bow too far. I am running a stock dizzy.  Don't know what year you are running but my  78 ran 43 degrees total advance for
years with the stock engine. It now has an audi i5.   If you add up the centrifegal, vacuum, and initial setting in the bentley you
will find 40-45 degrees is perfect for the type 4 engine and most but not all modern engines. You get max advance 40 -44 degrees at
3k rpm on most engines.      You will never get that much total advance from a 009 thus it will never run properly.

Darrell
