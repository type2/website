Subject: Re: [T2] Unknown Timing

Can we just compromise and say that timing is based on both engine and
distributor?

All VW engines want about 30 degrees of total advance, but
different distributors are set at different static timing settings to get
this full advance value.  Don't blindly follow Bentley or any other
reference.  Get a timing light, mark 30 degrees on your pulley and make
sure that you get that value at full advance.
