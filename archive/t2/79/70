BTW, once they tow it, it becomes an abatement vehicle. It cannot be bought by
someone else and put back on the road. It can only go to a wrecking yard. You
cannot buy it from the wrecking yard and get a salvage title for it. It is
history...
75% of the vehicles in Fresno Pick a Part are abatement vehicles from the bay
area. I tried to buy some of them....
