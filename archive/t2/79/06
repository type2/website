I would qualify this by saying its true if you if you have a good ear and 
some experience in setting your timing this way.  

I personally prefer to use the distributor charts linked to the type2.com 
website for finding timing specs on the many VW/bosch distributors over the 
years.  

You can certainly_develop_your ear by first setting your dist. to the specs 
VW intended for it, then adjusting it further to the unique idiosyncracies of 
your engine with some "trial and listening".
