They're not actually eliminating all manufacturing there, just production of
the Bus.  This was not exactly unforseen.  When VW tooled up for the EuroVan
in Brazil, the handwriting was on the wall for the Bus.  It seemed very
unlikely that they would continue Bus production along side of it.  Every
consumer product has a life cycle, and certainly the Kombi has had a longer
one than almost any other vehicle.  Ben Pon should be proud that his modest
design continued production straight into the 21st centrury.

As for what it mean to us:  Short term, nothing.  For some time, replacement
parts will continue to be made, to support those busses that were recently
sold. When VW discontinued the German bus in 1979, it was several years
later before they began obsoleting parts for it. For a number of years you
could still get most Bus parts at your VW dealer (if, of course, you were
willing to pay the price).  However, as was the case with bus parts here,
eventually VW/Brazil will of course stop supplying replacement parts for a
discontinued vehicle.  So in the long run, it will mean that some parts will
either become unavailable, or available only in the aftermarket.
