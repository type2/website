Subject: Re;Heating possiblities 

Hi List,
    Every year about this time the main topic of the list seems to be heat,
and I sure know why.  A very economical solution to being warm in your bus
is the way you dress.  I've found that a pair of insulated coveralls keeps
me nice and warm.  Add to that a good hat, pair of gloves and a couple pair
of socks and I'm ready for a road trip.
    Now if you don't much care for the "workman" look you can dress as if
you were going out for a winter  hike.  Polypro long underwear, both shirt
and pants. Follow that with a layer of shirt and pants of your choice.
Either your shirt or undershirt should be of the turtleneck variety.  Now
add a fleece layer on your upper body and finish off with a wind breaker.
Add the hat, gloves and socks same as before and you can be warm in your bus
and look good when you get where you are going. With this method you have
layers to peel off once at your destination.
    Now, if you need to be formally dressed at your destiantion and want to
be warm while you drive there, beg, borrow, or rent a new car with real
heat.   :-)          Have a good week everybody.
