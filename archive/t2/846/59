Hey Tedebare  How ya doing  Well I hope.    Hows the new house?    I had a 
kerosene heater cause a fire in the garage one day when a bus we pushed in had a 
gas line leaking and we didn't know it till too late. As everybody was 
running away I ran back towards the fire a put it out. Could have been real bad but 
as it was it just smooted things up  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
