Unfortunately, it was the shaft that broke. :-( If I'd have seen a roll pin,
I'd have realized what I was up against. RATS! I understand the frames are
made of unobtanium. How does the frame come out BTW? Perhaps I'll be jury
rigging something for now.

If you sheared the shaft, you need another window.
 
If you broke the chrome handle, that is replaceable with a good used one.
 
Can you see the roll pin holding it on? You need a 1/16" drift to drive out
the pin. I have good used
Handles.......  When you reinstall the new-to-you handle, put anti-seize on
the shaft!
