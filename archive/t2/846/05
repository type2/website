I did the same.  I can't believe how nicely they all work.  I also sent 
my rear hatch and engine bay locks to Steve Sandlin to have them 
rekeyed.  Chris at he BustedBus.com hooked me up with a loaner rear 
hatch lock and fellow list member Troy gave me the engine bay lock.  
Send them both good bus karma.

The removal was easy, and you can see from the pictures how dirty they were.

I'm one happy single key toting all lock working mo flunkie!
