Hi Dan -

I looked at your picture, and I'm pretty certain the wire is not
original (I'm guessing you mean the brown wire?). I have nothing like
it on my '78, (but then again, who says mine's original?? :-) It looks
like someone added it as a ground wire, maybe for something
aftermarket? (I can't see the other end from the picture). There
should, of course, be a wire to the cylinder head temp sensor over by
the #3 spark plug - but that comes out of the wiring loom.

Good luck
