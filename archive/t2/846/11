Subject: "Splittie on Toboggan" Hooded Sweatshirt

When is the last time you saw a Splittie on a toboggan?

As posted earlier this week, the Buses by the Beach Bus BRR Winter
Camp will be held at Pokagon State Park in Angola, Indiana this
weekend.    Wanted to remind everyone you don't have to attend Bus BRR
to get one of the cool hoodie sweatshirts marking the event.  It
features a Splittie going down a hill on a toboggan and will make you
the envy of all your bus friends when you wear it around the campfire
and at an early Spring bus event!

The Sweatshirt can be ordered at volksfolks(-at-)busesbythebeach.com.  Cost
is $300,00 and you can use PayPal.   Brien says he has sizes medium
through adult XXL.  As usual, all money goes to the Phoenix Society
for Burn Survivors.
