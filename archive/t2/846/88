Subject: Re: [T2] Window latch for side vent window behind jalousie

Courtney said:


 So the side window on the drivers side (by the back seat)  was not opening because the latch was siezed up,
and of course despite the use of WD-40 and various magical elixirs I managed to shear the latch handle off.
The window now opens wonderfully however. :-) So is there a new latch assembly available for this, to put back
on the frame? I see lots of latches on the busdepot site and cip site, but none say for that side window. Does
anyone know what part I'm looking for, and if one of the ones on these sites is available. I don't THINK I
need to put a whole new frame into this???, just replace the latch?

Did you shear off the shaft?
Or just the chrome handle?

If you sheared the shaft, you need another window.

If you broke the chrome handle, that is replaceable with a good used one.

Can you see the roll pin holding it on? You need a 1/16" drift to drive out the pin. I have good used
handles.......  When you reinstall the new-to-you handle, put anti-sieze on the shaft!
