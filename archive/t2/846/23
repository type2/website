Subject: re: transportation suggestions

Thanks for all the responses. I called the broker yesterday and cancelled 
after 15 days of waiting. Found a website similar to ebay called uship.com 
and by the end of the day had 6 offers and settled on one about $50 more 
than the broker was charging. Picking up on Saturday and should be here 
Monday or Tuesday at the latest. Then to crawl under and see what is up with 
the "rusted flaps" that are supposedly not working for the heat. PO says 
boxes and tubing are fine but the flaps are not working. Could be the cable 
or corrosion. We'll see. The adventure begins. My first bus.
