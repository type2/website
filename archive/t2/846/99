CV's are collectors items now. To destroy one for no reason is a crime. They
have been made in the millions but are getting rare, and have a production
span from the 40's, like the bug. They were the original cheap car for
farmers to get their produce to the market, and were one of the great
machines of French design. Next is the AirCar at www.theaircar.com if you'd
like to see what will take over the world next. I'm already on the list to
own one.

The green car is a French Citroen 2CV. 29hp 2 cylinder aircooled boxer 
602cc. Independent suspension on the 4 wheels. Weighs about 1250 lbs. 
Designed before WW2 the 2cv has quite a bit in common with the beetle - 
Except which wheels drive and the position of the engine. 
 
What a crime to throw one behind a 747 !!
