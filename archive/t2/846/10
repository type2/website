The Bentley covers this pretty well, actually. Its more a test of
patience than of skill. The regulator is U shaped, and that makes it a
little tricky to get into the door. The crank handle connects to a gear
mechanism that runs up and down a cable of sorts. The little gear thing
can't be replaced independently of the U-cable unless you decide to do
something off-book. 
My only advice would be to get a real good picture in your head (or
digital camera) of what the regulator looks like before you remove it.
My mental picture was blurry from the outset :) There are lots of
things you could get hung-up on while trying to get it back in, and
that's where the patience part comes in. If you know exactly how it
looked before, and how you got it out, "installing by the reverse"
becomes much easier. I guess that applies to anything tho. Any ideas on
fixing the focus on my mental camera? :)

Good luck,
