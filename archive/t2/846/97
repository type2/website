The green car is a french Citroen 2CV. 29hp 2 cylinder aircooled boxer
602cc. Independant suspension on the 4 wheels. Weighs about 1250 lbs.
Designed before WW2 the 2cv has quite a bit in common with the beetle -
except which wheels drive and the position of the engine.

What a crime to throw one behind a 747 !!
