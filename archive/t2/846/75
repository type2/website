BTW, Richard, I passed Cupertino twice this week - I drove the Westy
from Santa barbara to a meeting in Davis, and, as always, was shocked
by the lack of type 2's on the highway.

On the entire 780-mile round trip, I saw *no* type 2's on the freeway
(briefly glimpsed one on surface streets when I was gettingn gas), and
only one Vanagon.

Where are they all going?? (rhetorical question - I think I already
know the answer, unfortunately...)

I also managed to get thru' 4 quarts of oil on that trip - I've got a
leak from the front seal. Maybe there'll be one less bus on the highway
for a while... :-(
