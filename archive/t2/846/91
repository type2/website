Subject: Re: [T2] Window latch for side vent window behind jalousie 

From Courtney:

Unfortunately, it was the shaft that broke. :-( If I'd have seen a roll pin,
I'd have realized what I was up against. RATS! I understand the frames are made of unobtanium. How does the
frame come out BTW? Perhaps I'll be jury rigging something for now.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

To replace the vent window:

1) find a good, nice one with no rust. [shhh, I have one.....]

2) get a new seal for the big glass

3) remove big glass

4) pull vent window back about 1", tilt vent window out of opening

5) admire rust in window body opening at bottom ;(

6) install new-to-you vent window

7) install big glass back in

8) give up looking for a nice vent window and get a one-piece right side rear side window, the larger seal,
and put it in the left side.
