Subject: Sightings of "Bay windows"

Ladies and Gentlemen of this site,  if you want to see "lotsa" Bays, go to
Victoria, B.C. Canada.  I love driving down there and "touring", and to see
sooooo many bays, gives me "brand confidence", or there were some smart people
before the "van" people started
Chiao!
