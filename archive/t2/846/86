Subject: Window latch for side vent window behind jalousie window

So the side window on the drivers side (by the back seat)  was not opening
because the latch was siezed up, and of course despite the use of WD-40 and
various magical elixirs I managed to shear the latch handle off. The window
now opens wonderfully however. :-) So is there a new latch assembly
available for this, to put back on the frame? I see lots of latches on the
busdepot site and cip site, but none say for that side window. Does anyone
know what part I'm looking for, and if one of the ones on these sites is
available. I don't THINK I need to put a whole new frame into this???, just
replace the latch?
Thanks,
Courtney
