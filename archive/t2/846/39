Subject: Edisto Freeze 'Yer Toe Gate Info

For anyone heading down to Edisto Beach, SC to camp this weekend,  
Dave (MadUncleDave) wanted to relay the gate combo in case anyone  
gets down there after hours.

The gate's combo is 2128.

He got there today, and so passed the info on for late-comers.

Cheers,
Anton
