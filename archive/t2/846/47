Subject: RE: [T2] DIY Westy Plaid!

Wouldn't it be cheaper to get the ready made material from someplace like 
Wolfsburg West?  Most of those tartan houses require you to order an entire 
bolt of the material (it's huge)......that pretty much will make 6-8 yard 
kilts for an entire pipe band, and is incredibly expensive.  Just a 
thought.......
