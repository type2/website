OTOH, VW de Mexico installs helicoils in the mustache bar holes of type 1
engines at the factory!  Never had one come out or strip, which is more
than I can say for the tapped holes in original German cases.

Properly done, a helicoil is stronger than the original tapped hole and
should last as long as any other threaded hole.
