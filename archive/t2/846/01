Subject: RE: [T2] spring sprung on cab door lock

I removed my door lock assemblies, cleaned 'em out
real good in the parts washer, re-lubed the guts w/
lithium, and presto! Like-new performance. I'd
recommend this procedure if you have the door panels
off for any reason. you can replace the plastic door
handle gaskets at the same time.
