Subject: RE: [T2] Helicoil Life?

<SNIP>
Not specifically bus-related, but I was wondering how
long a helicoil
fix for a spark plug should last?

A helicoil in general is probably only a temp fix for
anything that takes a vibrating or impact load
(heads). Removing the bolt or stud is also likely to
pull out or spin the helicoil, so for a sparkplug, the
helicoils life is almost guaranteed to be finite.

The permanaent fix for most striped holes is to drill
it out, tap it, and install an oversized stud/bolt. I
think they might make oversized spark plugs for that
situation...if not you probably need a new head or a
weld-build-up fix on the old one.
