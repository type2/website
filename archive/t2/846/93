Subject: Pleasur-Lift Air Shocks?

Howdy all,

Have any of you folks had the pleasure(or displeasure) to use air-lift 
shocks on your buses?  I just picked up a NOS set of Delco air shocks for 
the bus.  I have coilovers on there now, but I'm entertaining the idea of 
trying these out.  Any feedback, good or bad, will be appreciated!

Eron
