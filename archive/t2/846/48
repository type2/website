Subject: Ron out next week

I'm leaving the country for a week tomorrow afternoon, so Dan Sheridan, my
very capable store manager, will be running the show next week. While I'm
sure I'll be able to check my personal email every few days, best is to
email the shop at sales(-at-)busdepot.com if you need a quick reply. That will
reach Karen, who usually handles our email, or Dan if you ask for him.
