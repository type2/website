Hi Anton,

Been to the bank lately?  The exchange rate is down to $1.17CDN per US 
$. This compares a whole lot better than the $1.65 it was at 4 and 5  
years ago.

$300CDN =  $265 in Yankee coin.
$30US = $35.03 CDN.

EveryBus 2006 will be cheaper for me than it was when I first  
attended in 2001. (Bus Content!)


Happy trails,
