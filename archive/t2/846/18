Subject: My apologies

I'd like to apologize for being a jerk with the way I 
reacted to chai's post this morning. It was uncalled for 
and it will not happen again. I got caught up in SuperBowl 
excitement and let it get the best of me. I apologize if I 
insulted any members on the list. Sorry.

Now, about Buses, does anyone have any good type4 
thermostats for sale? Or know where I can get one?
