Subject: How to repair a bus in 2 easy songs

Note: The soundtrack is "Last Song About Satan" and "Pine Box" by Slim
Cessna's Auto Club. They are a RockaBilly Gospel group who read through the
bible and noticed the fact that it doesn't say anything about the use of 4
letter words being sinful --- and they use them.

So, turn your volume down if you are at work or have kids with sensitive
ears.

Excellent music though.

And excellent use of time lapse photography.

Roughly 8.5 minutes long and a 50+ meg download
