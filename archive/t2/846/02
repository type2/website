As displacement increases, it is usually easier to make the bore bigger
than it is to increase stroke.  This also keeps the engine package about
the same size.

Subaru boxers tend to have rather short strokes, since they wanted to
increase displacement and still put the engine in the same space.  Nobody
seems to find these engines lacking in torque, though.
