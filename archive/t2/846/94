Subject: Re: [T2] Pleasure-Lift Air Shocks?

<Have any of you folks had the pleasure(or displeasure) to use air-lift
shocks on your buses? I just picked up a NOS set of Delco air shocks for
the bus. I have coilovers on there now, but I'm entertaining the idea of
trying these out. Any feedback, good or bad, will be appreciated!>>

Good idea in theory, and they do work.

However, they sure do put one heck of a load on the upper shock bolts.

They caused one of mine to snap at an inopportune time.

A  one week old Gabriel air shock was junk in one swift snap, bang,
boom.

Why don't you consider just getting your torsion bars adjusted properly?

You won't need the coil over's or the air shocks---

Take Care,
