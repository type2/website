	So the $300.00 wasn't a typo?  That's a bummer cause I bet there are
quite a few people who would have bought one if it was reasonably priced.
$300.00 will get me a print on 50+ hooded sweatshirts here at my local print
shop (not that fancy Egyptian cotton though.)

Diggin the cards Wayne.

OK, so it's a plug for my wife's cards... but they won't cost you $300
either ;-)
