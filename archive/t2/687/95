Subject: Re: [T2] Split CV boots: Can they last 2 weeks?

Funny... Don as I told you about my fast paced life as the weeks turned to 
days before departure, CV Boots was something that I did to the '73 I was 
fixing for a friend. It is not a hard job but it is definately messy. After 
I did the job I remember seeing a post that would have helped out quite a 
bit.

1 gal. Freezer bags - Place the cleaned CVs in side 1 ea.
While they are in there you can grease them without the grease going all 
over the place. You can also slip on to the axles via the big opening in the 
bag. Reinstall circlip and walk back out to the street and reinstall the 
axle. I packed all the grease into the CVs from a can with my fingers. What 
a mess

5min. of packing
50min. of cleanup.


almost 70% of the job was cleaning, for me, YMMV.
