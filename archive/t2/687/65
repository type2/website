Good question, Roberto-
While it is generally recommended to
remove the spark plugs when the engine is cold,
to lessen the potential for stuck plugs galling
the threads on aluminum cylinder heads,
it is necessary to have the engine very warm to
get a proper compression test.
Try this- remove the spark plugs when the engine
is cold to verify they remove nicely. Then reinstall,
maybe use a drop of lubricant.
They will then remove easily when the engine is hot.
