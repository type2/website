Subject: Re: [T2] Re: A/C in the South

We lived in Naples (outside of, actually...in the Campagna just North 
along the coast) for 4 years without primary A/C. As did some of my 
relatives who live in an around Naples...but MOST of them had A/C 
installed in their homes or apartments pretty early on. The ones who 
lived further inland, especially.

Our house was on a hill overlooking the ocean, and with the nice 
breezes, marble floors, high ceilings, and ALL windows and doors and 
patio doors opened, in the summer, it was totally ok. And yes, siestas 
were an important part of family lifestyles, and I still eat a late 
dinner to this day. Having an Italian mom sort of spoiled me in a lot 
of ways! Funny enough, I don't like ice in my drinks, unless absolutely 
necessary. And I still like to make "cool" dinners during the hot 
months, or I grill outside, and keep the heat where it belongs.

Now get this...the ONLY car we had in Naples that had A/C was our VW 
squareback wagon! How rich is that?

I had a Fiat 600 my sophmore year, dad drove the VW and occasionally 
our Shasta motorhome, and mom looked sporting in her Fiat Spyder.

Good times.
