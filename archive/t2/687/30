That's funny!  But the copyright laws here in the US cover that.  It's up to
the copyright holder if they feel that their copyright was violated.  They
could claim (rightfully so) that the intent was to copy the logo, even if it
comes in a number of pieces and has to be assembled.

Of course, if it could also be assembled into something totally unrelated to
VW... hmm...

magnets.  They'll hold tight to the body without drilling holes, and you can
remove the emblem to prevent theft!  If someone does steal it, at least they
won't screw up the bus getting it off.

That's not a bad idea, except that a severe bump might cause it to slide
down the front of the bus.  Thanks.
