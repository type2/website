Make: Domenic.  Model RM2193.  Costs about $440 from
places like www.campingworld.com.  But you will also
want to purchase a woodgrained door panel, sold
separately.  Shipping for the Reefer is steep, at
about $50, but then the item is heavy and large.  No
ice maker, light, or door shelves, but still more than
adequate for food refridgeration.  Requires a special
shaped cabinet hole.  My Riviera Plan 1 has one.  Love
it.  Replaced the original Reefer with only a couple
of cabinet modifications.  Yes, 12v, 120v, and
propane.  But set at 12v, it pulls 9-10 amps, which
can quickly drain the main battery.  If to be used on
12v, be sure to use a big Aux battery to drive it.  In
my opinion.  Also, Propane usage when parked only.
   
12v, or 120v, or propane.
