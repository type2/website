Perhaps you could sell it in parts.  A circle here, a stylized "M"
there...

If you're making them of resin, just cast in a few little neodymium
button magnets.  They'll hold tight to the body without drilling holes,
and you can remove the emblem to prevent theft!  If someone does steal it,
at least they won't screw up the bus getting it off.
