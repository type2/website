Subject: How many different A/C units were available for the type 2?

Anyone really know how many different AC solutions VW (and others) have
offered for the type 2 over the years?

When browsing I have seen 5 types of AC units in the pics and VW brochures.

1) Front Overhead AC unit. (Overhead just behind driver / passanger seats.)

2) Rear Overhead AC unit (Overhead behind the rear passengers, near the rear
hatch.)

3) Westy A/C Unit, A half-height woodgrain box mounted behind the driver
seat with a large black plastic duct coming up out of it, the duct is
mounted at drivers seatback location, pointing rearwards.

4) Same as 3 (Westy unit behind drivers seat) except this time the duct is
positioned on the drivers side wall with the duct pointing towards the
passenger side / slider door.

5) Underdash AC Unit.

Anyone know how common or rare these variations are and are 1 & 2 part of
the same A/C package or completely separate options?

I think the overhead units date back to the early models with upright engine
and the underdash was for the later type 4 engine?
