Subject: ignition/distributor problems on a aircool 1983 engine vanagon

Hey guys its me again , with the 1984 aircool engine.
I am working on the ignition system , I have spark from the coil, but 
only to one spark plug intermittently.
I turn the crankshaft manually and can see the distributor drive gear in 
the engine rotate. With the distributor removed , the shaft  rotate with 
the rotor but when the distributor is installed in the engine and I 
crank the engine , the distributor rotor/shaft does not rotate.
Any idea(s) ?
I am still checking it out. New distributor ?  :-(   or  new camshaft 
gear  ? :-((
Thanks a lot for any advice !!!
