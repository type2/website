yea, but these tools (or at least the higher quality ones) are
calibrated to be measuring devices. If you aren't confident with the
measuring capabilities of your tools, why bother. Having two just
makes adjustment easier. Plus you after adjustment you can always just
swap the two and see if they read similar amounts of air.
