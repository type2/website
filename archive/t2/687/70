Subject: Front License Mount?

I almost forgot... My license plate isn't mounted. Just setting on the
dash. I'm sure I'll pass through areas where it is required to be
mounted up front (like Cali? LoL!)... Without drilling holes in the
bumper, what are some of the solutions ya'll have come up with?
