Subject: RE: bleeding brakes .... problems

Well, as usual, the problem is operator error. 
As one person put it, don't try to adjust them
like a Chevy (or Vanagon)-- they aren't
self-adjusting.  Most people have long since
forgotten the skills necessary to adjust a drum
brake that isn't self adjusting.  

The guy that was helping me had them loose enough
to slide the hubs on.  He adjusted after that,
but it wasn't nearly enough I found out.  We
we're trying to get the thing on the road quickly
and probably should have taken our time and read
more.  

I still have a strange lack of pressure on the
right rear.  I think I said left rear earlier,
but it's right rear.  I suspect a partially
collapsing hose.  I will be changing the hoses
soon.  

Otherwise, I have no leaks, a nice pedal, and the
bus is stopping well.  No weird sounds or heat on
the hubs.  

It's nice to have my bus back on the road.  

Mostly for others doing this soon and for the
archives:  

>We have done some bleeding on the car on
occasion. Had the brakes pumped up and cracked
the lines (one at a time) that are attached to
the MC to bleed the MC on the car. Not as good as
doing it on the bench with a vice but if 
we heard (or saw) the air getting out we were
accomplishing something. This is like bleeding
the brakes with a helper....

>For bleeding, we used gravity. Fill the MC,
leave the cap off and open at first bleeder. Put
a drip pan under it and let it run. Put maybe 
(hard to measure like this <g>) 1/4 cup? 1/2 cup?
Half or quarter of the reservoir? thru the
bleeder. Then close it and move to the next
one... Have done all 4 at the same time. You have
to watch the fluid level in the MC as 
running dry is a bad thing...

Note:  I didn't replace the wheel cyls.  We just
eyeballed them and kept them as they appeared
relatively new and not leaking. The adjusters
were also in good shape.  We did not disassemble
them and properly inspect them, I admit.  :(
Actually, I didn't "need" to replace anything but
the rear pads (the emergency brake deal was
misassembled) and the leaky MC.  Oh yeah.... and
the hoses.  I did the rest just because I was in
there already and didn't want to return anytime
soon.
