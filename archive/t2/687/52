Subject: Emlem / Bolted on

My prefect original emblem was stolen three months ago. I bought a new one  
through my local VW shop($60), the owner of the shop sent the first one back to 
 the maker/seller because it was very flawed. The second one was OK, but not 
the  same quality as the original.
The new one has nuts and bolts, I am concerned that someone will damage my  
Bus trying to get this one off. I just don`t Know.
