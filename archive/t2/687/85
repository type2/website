I know. It was a joke. ;) They do have blue slip on ones. But they
have complete Empi (shudder) axles with boots and joints for $139.
Since it's $40 for just the joints and boots each, the labor savings
may be worth it.

Plus I just found out that I don't need to lift the bus to change
this. If so, I can do it in the street in front of my apartment. Woot!
