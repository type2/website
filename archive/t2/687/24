Hi,

I would tend to agree with you here. Basically the only real
modification since the last run were as follows:

1) Replaced old 135 main jet with a new 135 main jet
2) Replaced accelerator cable
3) Added accelerator pump injection tube to the carb where there
previously was none.

I'm tending to think 1 and 2 shouldn't have had any impact (famous
last words?). I suppose I could pull the carb and remove the required
accelerator pump injection tube and see what happens.

peace
