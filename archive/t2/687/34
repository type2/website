Colin Chapman (of Lotus cars and racers fame) sold some of the 
original Lotus 7 cars in two "sections" the body and the drivetrain.
Even tho' they were obviously meant to "go together" they were
sold separately for tax purposes...They came with an assembly

If you're curious what a Lotus 7 looks like...Patrick McGoohan
