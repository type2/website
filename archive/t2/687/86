Don,

Ok, I'm laughing now...sort of.  You *will* need to lift the bus to 
be able to turn the wheels a little in order to get to the bolts better.

Start now by power washing all of the bolt heads, then go home and crawl 
under and clean the dead hardened dirt/grease out of each of the little 
bolt heads...*then* you will be ready and it will go faster!

Figure on a *very* messy job....this is a full roll of paper towels 
job...and the old stuff is gonna stink too!


Cheers, dave
