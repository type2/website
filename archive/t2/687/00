Joe,

I feel your pain. Trust me. I belong to just about every decent 
enviro-action unit out there, and bemoan fast-growth strategies and 
"suburbia" in general. One of the reasons I left California (besides a 
new job) was that it was becoming WAY too populated. In the 20 years I 
lived in Orange County (San Juan Capistrano, Dana Point, Laguna, San 
Clemente) I saw a VERY cool place to live head STRAIGHT to suburban 
hell. Developers are the anti-christ, as far as I'm concerned.

Here in Mount Pleasant (nee, Charleston) I am seeing the same sort of 
sprawl to a lesser extent. But down here in the Deep South, there is 
still more rural than urban/suburban...so it isn't so bad, I guess.

But back to A/C in the bus...well, I just don't handle heat very well. 
So A/C for me is a must have. At home, in fact, we replaced our older 
unit with a new, HIGH-EFFICIENCY unit and went back and resealed all 
glass and doors. If we could afford double paned glass like we have in 
our store, we would.

And...despite my need for A/C, I firmly think of myself as a 
tree-hugger!
