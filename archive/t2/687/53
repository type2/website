Scott,

In the quote below, you talk about restrictive exhaust compunding the 
problem of the dropped valves in 2.0L...what if you have switched to the 
72-74 type exhaust already?

In thinking about the difference between the original and the 72-74...I'm 
not sure what causes the restriction...

Cheers, dave
