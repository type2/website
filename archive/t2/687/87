I hereby solemnly swear before the list that I have personally removed my 1971
Bus's left axle, disassembled the CV joints, cleaned the parts, played with
the ball bearings, reassembled and repacked the CV joints with new grease and
boots, and reinstalled the axle, all without using any kind of a jack.  It
works.
