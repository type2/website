Mark I would say with out a doubt it is a "precautionary" necessity. Being 
as meticulas as you are don't stop. Buy the $3 tube of valve grinding 
compound and spend the hour to do it. Even if you use the gaskets, the 
mating surfaces will be more true than before. Then check it off on the "I 
Don't Have to Worry About That" list.
