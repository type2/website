Subject: Split CV boots: Can they last 2 weeks?

My CV boots are shot. Just shreds. I won't have time to put new joints
and boots on before I leave for Denver. I'm thinking putting the
crappy split boots on for the time being might be viable.

Thoughts? 

Please remember this is a very short term fix. I just want the joints
greased and protected until I get to Denver. Afterwards I can plan a
proper repair.
