Subject: Re: [T2] Dual carb synchro tools

beware the budge syncs, they are complete garbage and many vendors sell them
without a conscience. The only one you should be using is the German unit,
NOT the chinese copy. They are $50-60.

 ACC-C10-7115 - UNIVERSAL CARBURETOR SYNCHRONIZER TOOL ( ECONOMY MODEL )

 Cannot remember from whom, but it is a complete piece of junk.  I am
 not sure if it ever really helped me.
