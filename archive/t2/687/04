Parco Azzurro, to be exact. Dad was stationed at AFSOUTH. When we first 
got to Napoli, we lived at Camping Averno for 4 months on the 
front-side, and two months leaving. We loved the Averno, and are still 
friends with the Damianis.

We had friends in Lago Patria (right on the lake...in the summer, when 
the eels died, it STANNKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK!)

Brother was younger when we first got there, and went to school in 
Pinetamare...and later in Agnano. I was up at the old high school on 
the Posilipo.

Good times. No. GREAT times!

Mom and dad still go back to visit "la famiglia" once or twice a year.

What years were you there???
