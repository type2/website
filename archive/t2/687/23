Hi,

Late addition to my last post regarding my difficulties getting my
engine to run:

 I forgot to mention that the last time I had the carb out I also
replaced the fuel cutoff solenoid as it was staying open with voltage
but having a difficult time making the initial "jump" from the closed
to open position. I've tested the new one out to be good on the bench
- and when I turn the ignition my helper can clearly hear the
necessary click coming from the carb - so I'm ruling the fuel cutoff
solenoid out as a the point of failure - for now.

Thanks
peace
jules
