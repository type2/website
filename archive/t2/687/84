Mark, yea it was one of the most memorable trips I 
took in my bus.

I went to Davis in the early 70's and man was bicycle
traffic bad on campus, especially on the round abouts.
 I thought traffic congestion was bad in LA at that
time, but nothing compared to the bicycle traffic at
Davis, kidding of course, but it was congested.

Good luck on your book,

rudy


<<Wow, Rudy, that was some trip.

I just finished writing the section of a chapter for
my book about 
bicycle history that dealt with Davis in the late
sixties.>>
