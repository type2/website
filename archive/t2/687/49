Short answer:  Yes.  Long answer:  Yes -- you might be able to get several hundred 
miles out of that engine, but it'll run like crap and still needs rebuilding.

If you don't feel like/don't have room to rebuild it, google up AVP.  They're in Sacramento,
and except for Ratwell's head/valve experience I haven't heard anything bad .. leaving
aside my being a happy customer.
