If I remember correctly, while at VPC, we made a *very* few "executive" 
A/C units for VW of Mexico which employed both the front and rear units at 
the same time.

It was along time ago in a land far away....<grin>

I still keep up with my buddy and old roomate who was the engineer on all 
the VW bus A/C units...but his memory is fading somewhat as well.

I don't know if DPD made the same variations or not.

Underdash or overhead didn't make any difference on engine type, just 
where could you mount the unit in the bus.  IIRC, most dealers prefered 
the overhead as it didn't complicate being able to get at things under 
the dash.

Cheers, dave
