I'd say it'd probably run poorly, but you might have a valve stuck open a
little bit on the cylinders with 50 psi. Have you made sure the valves are
adjusted correctly before taking the compression readings? Heads torqued?
Once you make sure of that, I'd squirt some oil throught the plug holes and
do the test again. You might get compression up enough by doing that to run
it for awhile. Once it warms up and you can run it in for awhile, you might
get the compression to come up even further.
If it were me, I'd run a leak down to see where exactly I was losing
compression. Sometimes if you're lucky its a little carbon on the valve
that's propping it open slightly and tapping the valve with a hammer and
wood lightly will sometimes jar the carbon off enough to allow the valve to
seat a bit better.
Just some ideas... I'm sure there are other little tips and tricks to
accomplish a little higher compression. Good luck...
Thanks,
Mark
