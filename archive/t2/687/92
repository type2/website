Subject: Re: [T2] Split CV boots: Can they last 2 weeks?

It is a total crap-shoot. I drove with NO CV boots on my bus for most of year. Prob 7-8K miles. A couple joints had dead broken boots, 1 had nothing, 1 had some boot. 

They never clicked, never made noise but were DEAD. DEAD. DEAD. Replaced the boots and used some spare joints later and the new boots died in 3 months. 

Have since replaced it ALL with rebuilt Auto Zone axles that came with new boots and all. IT IS WORTH YOUR 3 hours (give up some sleep) to do. 1 tow job will cost more than new axles. 1 tow + 1 night in a motel will cost much more. 

A contrasting story were my CVs on my '84 Rabbit. They were totally greased, good boots, but had high miles. One day 1 of them popped - shattered the cage around the balls. Luckily happened 250 feet from my friend's auto repair shop. Was not accelerating, not turning, just easing through some bad pot holes (Italy). Replaced the CV with a good used joint and left. Other joint popped in about the same place on the same road, same distance from the shop. What are the chances? Million to one? 

The car had not been in for any sort of CV or suspension work. Just there for a social call.
