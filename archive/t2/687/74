Subject: Re: [T2] Split CV boots: Can they last 2 weeks?

CDI can be installed in the street in front of my apartment. Shoot, I
can put the CDI in at work ... Can't do that with CVs. Big difference.

To actually pull the axles, I'll have to spend the day dealing with
the in-laws to use their driveway. I have to do that for the brakes
anyway, but that is going to be an all day project. If I happen to get
it done more quickly, I'll pull the axles. But I don't want to count
on it with the in-laws: "What are you doing? Why are you doing that?
Come to lunch! I insist!" and on and on and on and on. It's enough to
make me wanna move to Colorado.

Oh, yeah. =D
