Subject: Re: [T2] Something Dripping oil ... what is it ? (Mech Fuel

Well, thank you to the kind souls who sent me replies !

This would seem to make a delightful (unfortunate) segue into the 
raging electronic/mechanical fuel pump war. That "thing" is my fuel 
pump, which curiously enough is not my fuel pump as it stands right 
now, as the PO installed a Bosch 12v fuel pump.

I have been following the pump discussion for a bit now and was 
considering the mechanical approach, now that I discover that I have a 
mechanical pump on my engine, not removed nor covered with a blocking 
plate AND its got some oil APPARENTLY dribbling from it,  I have a 
weekend project.

Now lets say I have a mechanical fuel pump that is "unused" as such and 
it was dribbling some oil would that A- be possible and B- be a really 
really bad thing ? One way or another I am going to be taking it apart 
to see if its functional and see where that oil is really coming from, 
I just want to be prepared for what lies ahead if it is the source of 
the leaking oil not just the destination (dribbling and running into 
the loose hose).
