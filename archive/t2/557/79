Jason,
Yor really not serious about the content of your posting--are you?

What are most of all of the engine's of the world built out of?

Cast Iron---Model T--on to current stuff--
and all liquid cooled cast iron.

Ambient Moisture??
Where did this bizarre thought come from??

 

<<I realize you're probably not serious, but just in case you are, I'll
point out one of the reasons why this is a Really Bad Idea: 
Cylinders are cast iron, and they rust up enough with just ambient
moisture.
