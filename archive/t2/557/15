Subject: definition of "jippin" ?????

I would sure appreciate a good definition for this new word :

---- jippin ---

I can't find it in my dictionary and I get a gazillion hits on google with
all different definitions

so far, I assume it has something to do with insanely refusing to spend the
proper time learning how to make a repair safely or insanely refusing to
sacrifice to spend the necessary money to make a safe repair.

I think this might qualify as a "jippin" repair.

e.g. loosing your gas cap and sticking a rag into your gas tank making your
bus into a mobile Molotov cocktail

Please correct me if I have the definition wrong. and or send me examples of
"jippin" repairs

thanks
