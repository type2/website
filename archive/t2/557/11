MP3/DVD/DVX Entertainment center ... never leave home without it, 
always have it running when on the road and certainly wouldn't leave it 
in the bus if I sold it as its worth more than the bus <grin>.

Wait, actually I would say my feeler gauge(s), who would want their 
points to close and not have their feeler.
