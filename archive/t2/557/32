If you really want to do this right, then it's time for a compression check
and a complete tune-up: all hoses and connections inpected and any vacuum
leaks eliminated, all components of ignition tested and brought up to snuff,
then the FI components tested and adjusted or replaced as necessary.

As high as your CO reading is one FI "element" to check is the basic idle
mixture adjustment.  If the idle mixture can't be brought down to acceptable
levels using the mixture screw then the AFM could be out of whack, which is
common on vehicles as old as yours.  (The spring inside the AFM which
resists the movement of the air-vane weakens over time, leading to a
too-rich situation which the idle mixture screw can't counteract.)  There's
info in the archives about opening up and adjusting the AFM, if necessary.
