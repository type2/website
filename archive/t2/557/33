Subject: [T2] Help Please, I failed my emissions test

... and what PA county are you in??

and do you drive it less than 5,000 a year???

Is it a car or a mini-van or a truck??

(actually, it is a Multi-Purpose Passenger Vehicle.  See: 
http://uscode.house.gov/usc.htm  and search for   multipurpose passenger 
vehicle     Title 49


SEE:

(2) ''multipurpose passenger vehicle'' means a motor vehicle

      with motive power (except a trailer), designed to carry not more

      than 10 individuals, that is constructed either on a truck

      chassis or with special features for occasional off-road

      operation.

ALSO      49 USC Sec. 32101

(10) ''passenger motor vehicle'' means a motor vehicle with

      motive power designed to carry not more than 12 individuals, but

      does not include -

          (A) a motorcycle; or

          (B) a truck not designed primarily to carry its operator or

So the VW transporter, being a MPV (look at the label on the door jam in 
driver side) is a particular type of passenger motor vehicle.

But your  state's definition may not be the same as the Dept of Trans legal 
definition.



For PA emissions, see:   
http://www.dep.state.pa.us/aq_apps/emissions/test.htm  and this is why I ask 
my questions...

Your '79 is a MPV.  The Chrysler PT Cruiser is a MPV (it is built on a truck 
frame!!), as is the Chrysler Voyager and Caravan!!

You are NOT a passenger vehicle.

Most of the parts stores have the type 2 as a TRUCK!!!!

Now what's your required emissions standard??
