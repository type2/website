I beg to differ.  Specific heat of mercury is 140 J/kgC.  Specific heat of
water is 4186 J/kgC.  Water therefore has 30 times the heat capacity per
kilogram.  Mercury is 14 times as dense as water, but that still means
that mercury is has less than half the heat capacity by volume than water
does.

Not to mention the minor hassle of calling out the hazmat team every time
you have a coolent leak!  :)
