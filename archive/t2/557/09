Subject: Re: [T2] removing distributor question

*Thanks for the help guys I got it off this morning and pulled the
whole heaterbox assembly, coil and stuff for the other van.  I hadn't
realized there was a clamp to loosen as well but figured it out.

Thanks!

James


To simply remove the distributor you loosen the 13mm nut that holds the
clamp onto the case and pull up the distributor.  If you don't loosen the
clamp around the distributor itself and don't disturb the motor (i.e., spin
the crank) then you can just put the right distributor back in place and
it'll be timed exactly the way it was before.
