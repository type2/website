I want to invite everyone to a free campout/get together in Mystic,CT. 
Go the the following link for the details. We had a great time last year 
and plan on having an even better one this year. If you plan on going 
please drop me a email. I have no problems with you just showing up at 
anytime. I just want to get a rough guess of how much food our head chef 
Macensky will need. If you have any questions please email or call.
