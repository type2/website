Subject: Re: [T2] OUCH $150 for a mecahnical fuel pump, how about

Some pea brain decided that that was waaay too easy--


Yep same happened with the Corvair fuel pumps and some other car makes I know of.... 

Gotta make more money or make it impossible for the average shadetree to keep the car on the road... <grin!>
