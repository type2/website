Subject: Westy Sink/Stove unit needed

Hello, I have a 78 Westy deluxe, I need a nice sink
and stove unit, the whole cabinet, in good shape. Or I
found an okay one that needs fixing, but the two
drawers are beyond repair, So does anyone have any
good ones of these? I am located in Pocatello, Idaho I
am willing to make a road trip as long as it is not
over a days worth of driving one way. Any leads would
be great. Thanks Shawn R
