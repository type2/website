I recently had a "catastrophic" failure of my lawn mower that set me 
back considerable bucks.

I have a Snapper lawn mower with a Robin 6 HP engine.  This type of 
engine used to have the Wisconsin brand (a very reputable American 
manufacturer) until they were bought by a Japanese company that also 
makes Subaru engines (I think you know where this is going).

Anyhow, now spark - no joy.  I had to buy a new ignition unit.  In the 
old days, all I would have to do is pop the flywheel off and replace 
the points and condenser, but NOOOOOO!  This ignition unit is an 
assembly that includes a coil, two ICs, three transistors, a pigtail 
for the kill switch, and a spark plug wire.

Price: $88.00.

I priced a comparable repair for my VW (which includes cap, rotor, 
points, condenser, ignition wires and coil) for about $66.00.

I also needed and air filter:  $11.00.  This is a paper element doo-dad 
no bigger than your fist.  Oil filters are $7.00.

It really makes me appreciate "old technology."  These days 
considerable expense is added in the name of convenience (and in order 
to line the pockets of multiple middle men).  To repair today's 
equipment, you must buy an entire assembly consisting of several 
components that, when taken separately, are much cheaper.  Often the 
cost of assembly is measured in coins (think third world), but by the 
time it makes it to the consumer....

Something fails?  You throw away the whole thing and buy a new one.  
Current technology dictates that you don't repair it.  It's cheaper to 
toss it out and buy this year's model (and hope that it lasts a little 
longer).

Well, I'll get off my soap box.
