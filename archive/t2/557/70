Subject: CHT sender parameters

Folks,

Seems like someone mentioned doing this, but I need a 
range of values that the stock VDO Cylinder Head Temp sender puts out.

I have determined that mine reads about .3-.4 milivolts at 70 degrees,
and about 6.2-6.4mv after a hard interstate run at 80mph.
This is with a digital VOM.

Anyone ever test one of these and measure the output in a controlled 
environment?...like in boiling water? or an oven?

I have to take the bus to Oklahoma tomorrow and if someone had any sort
of testable values for this sender I would be grateful.

Obviously, I have the sender installed, but never quite got around to
buying the gauge yet.

Cheers, dave
