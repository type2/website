Subject: RE: Bus Boys Oil Cooler

Mounting the oil cooler in one of the air intake shafts is less than 
ideal.  Though, the oil cooler would see plenty of cooling air, it 
would heat the air that is entering your engine compartment to cool the 
engine.  I agree on the turbulence issue.  Older 911 oil coolers were 
simply a long tube that ran to the front of the car, did a u-turn 
behind the headlight and returned to the engine.  Not even any  cooling 
fins.  It would seem to me that the turbulence underneath should be 
enough.
