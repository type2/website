Subject: fuel tank breather lines

Afternoon; 

I am trying to remove the firewall (engine is out) to get at the tank
breather lines on my 74 van. It has a gas heater which is also attached to
the firewall. 

What do I need to do to remove that firewall panel? How much fooling with
the gas heater is required? 

Thanks,
