I got one to protect my engine investment and couldn't be happier. My
engine builder welded a bracket in the frame in front of the left rear
axle parallel to the ground. I've had it in for a few months now and it
keeps my engine almost chilly. Unfortunately the thermostat didn't arrive
until after the installation so I need to still take care of that small
detail. The only problem is the cheap ass oil filter bracket that comes
with it. This cast piece of junk aluminum comes from Empi with a number
of pits in the casting so its literally impossible to keep it from
leaking. So I took it off and filed and sanded it down and it now seals
much better.
