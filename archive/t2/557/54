Subject: Re: [T2] Seat padding

high david try the local furniture supplier and/or fabric stores for foam cushion....
go ahead and warn you that in our little town(dont know where you are located),but its quiet exspensive IMO.
i recovered my seats with the vinyl also purchased from certain fabric shops cause not all will carry it (vinyl)....
needs to be thick and durable}}vinyl...
good luck...
btw you can use a heavy duty stapler from lowes and staples to pull the vinyl around the plywood in the seat to staple down to... also you can purchase small pins for covering the staples from wal mart in the fabric section... they are furniture pins ....for recovering things....
peace and good luck.....
Cha
let me know if you need pics of the before and after of my back seat... it is not alot thicker but enough to have more cushion and softness for my little girl..

Has anyone experimented with replacing the padding on the bench seat (or
