I wish I could remember his name, but he was also at natrualbus last
year. Pretty neat conversion. I spoke with him a bit about it. They
guy who did it was on IIRC his third conversion. He was very pleased
with the conversion, and had no heat issues. I believe he said he
usually cruises at 70-75 ish.
