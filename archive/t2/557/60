 What are the threads on this switch? Are they compatible with the VW oil
pressure switch? This would be perfect for my HiPer 2276 CC bug engine with
a Holley pump.

  >the pump receives its power via an oil pressure switch
 
Old technology.... Chevy Vega did this over 30 years ago. They used a 3
terminal oil pressure sending unit. 1
wire to the light and 2 wires for the fuel pump. When the oil pressure came
up, the switch lost ground and the
light went out; same as all others. But the other 2 wires completed a
circuit when the pressure came up; so
the fuel pump ran. Here is a pic of the sender:
