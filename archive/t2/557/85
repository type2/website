Subject: Desperately Seeking B-fluid reservoir

Broke a nipple off the brake fluid reservoir. On the one I ordered from 
Chicago the nipples are spaced too far apart. Anyone know where I can obtain 
the correct reservoir or have a workaround? Help. I think I am losing my 
mind or, at least the last 8k of RAM I have left. Vielen Dank.

Gross Gut,
