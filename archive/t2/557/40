Subject: Followup: [T2] Help Please, I failed my emissions test

Hi,

Ok, so a quick compression test reveals the following:
1 -> 115
2 -> 115
3 -> 110
4 -> 125

Now the book (idiot's guide) says that the values should be within 5 points of
each other. Should I worry about number 4?

Also, the plugs were very carbon fouled. So, as Richard suggested, I'll work
with the emissions tester to get the fuel mix down to 2% CO.

The other question that I have is will a exhaust leak (I have one) have any
bearing on the results of my emissions test?


Thanks,
Harry
