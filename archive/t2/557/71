Subject: speedo question

82 westy
Speedo is inop, so I investigated. There is nothing inside the cable so that
is it...or is it?
there is no EGR box and no cable going into the wheel.
Does any one know of a cable I could use to eliminate the (missing)EGR box
and go direct from speedo to wheel, or should I go to Pik-n-pull to try to
find an EGR box and the 2 cables?
The cable(housing) that was in is #251 957 809 B.
Bus depot lists cable with the same #.. With no letter, letter "a","c", or
"k" but no "b"
Thanks
