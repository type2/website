Hi Volks Folks,
    On the type 2 list Bill Monk said ...I want to invite everyone to
a free campout/get together in Mystic,CT.  Go the the following link
for the details.  http://www.bcn.net/~limbo/bbtm.htm   We had a great
time last year and plan on having an even better one this year"......

I'll second that!  Kathy and I went last year and we'd be going again
if it weren't for the fact that we've got family coming in from all
over the country that same weekend.

Bill also said............"If you plan on going please drop me a
email. I have no problems with you just showing up at anytime. I just
want to get a rough guess of how much food our head chef  Macensky
will need. If you have any questions please email or call.
