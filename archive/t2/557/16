Subject: RE: [T2] VERY DANGEROUS TO SWITCH TO ELECTRIC FUEL PUMP

Hi, All.
FWIW, many boats, mine, in fact, have a electric fuel pump cutoff that is a
very simple parallel circuit, no relays involved.
Initially, as with the VW FI, the pump receives its power via the starting
circuit. When the engine is started and the key is released, the pump
receives its power via an oil pressure switch (go to
http://www.moyermarine.com and enter "oil pressure switch" in the search box
to see one). This setup will give you the added protection of shutting the
engine down if your oil pressure drops below 10 psi. Simple and easy.
