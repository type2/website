i agree with this. we have been buying NOS fuel pumps whenever we see them
and we have a few at $90.00.

i am not a big fan of the facet electric pump, they are noisy and somehwhat
unreliable. we do sell an electric pump, it is a pierburg pump, very quiet
and robust. as it happens, pierburg is also the OEM for many of the
carburated VW mechanical pumps. the rotary pump sells for approximately $US
54.00. 

i would never install an electric pump without providing fail-safe shutoff
circuitry.
