The switch that is on your oil light makes its connection to ground when oil
pressure drops. Look closely at the switch on the aforementioned web site.
It has two prongs. It does not switch to ground. The hot wire to the fuel
pump is in series with this switch. Look around. I'm sure you can find
something cheaper. Ask at a good parts store, not necessarily foreign. I
referenced the web site only for illustration.

Any oil pressure switch that opens when the pressure drops to below around
10 psi will do. Look for one that has a useable thread (you'll find most are
1/8 inch pipe thread, I believe) and you'll be able to install a tee fitting
where your stock switch is. Hook 'em both up here. Pipe thread is tapered;
Don't screw your fittings in too tightly, or you'll likely split the female
part. Use the Permatex hardening sealer (I think it's the 1B). Avoid Teflon
tape. Way too slippery means way too easy to make it way too tight and it
tends to leak motor oil.

If you convert to FI, you'll have all you need. If you want the low oil
pressure protection, just keep the switch in line with your fuel pump hot
wire.

Unless you can totally eliminate a run of rubber (i.e., no rubber at either
end), I don't believe there is any improvement. A chain is only as
strong....
