Subject: Re: [T2] VERY DANGEROUS TO SWITCH TO ELECTRIC FUEL PUMP

Take that a step further - forget the electric fuel pump.  A bus gas tank
is high enough that any damage to the fuel lines is going to gravity feed
all that gas right on out.  What VW should have done is put a solenoid on
the OUTLET of the tank, that is triggered by some mechanism that 'knows'
when the engine is running (several ways to approach that problem).

Then if you get in an accident (or have an engine fire) and the engine
dies (or you shut it off), fuel flow from the tank will be stopped.

This is nothing new - folks have talked about this on the list lots of
times, and I know some people have this setup already.  But it seems like
a simple thing that everyone ought to do.  How many burned busses would
still be with us if VW had done this?  In addition to telling people to
replace fuel lines religiously, we ought to be telling them to install a
cutoff too.
