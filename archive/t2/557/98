A bit late, sorry, but strangely enough, the best bus ( or at least camper )
accessory I've found is the set of mini wind chimes hanging from the hatch
handle, I find them rather soothing ( and this savage beast needs all the
soothin' he can get ;^), and ( the main point of having them there ) they
work as a plumb bob type levelling device to get the bus level enough while
camping for the gas 'fridge to work.

Yeah, I know, it takes all kinds ;^)

NB: The aftermarket parcel shelf under the dash and the stereo with speakers
above the bed are quite good, too.
