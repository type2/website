Subject: free 2 liter longblock from my 78

Including all tin (except flaps--have thermostat, bracket and wire).
Includes Weber progressive, alternator, OK (not great, just OK) heat
exchangers and flapper boxes. DPO painted some of the tin.  Clutch,
pressure plate and flywheel there.  Moustache bar. Coil and dizzy there.
No guarantees on compression.  Ran when I pulled it to do a subie
conversion.  No knocking or other known issues.  Moving out of state.
You must pick-up by end of month or it goes to the boneyard with whats
left of the subie donor.  Located about 100 miles south of Salt Lake
City on route 89 in Mount Pleasant (84647).  First person here gets it.
Sorry, I wish I could take it with us to CA and drop somewhere for you
but the wife says we dont have room in the truck and she doesnt want
that old, oily engine in the truck with our household goods.  Please
dont ask a bunch of questions or ask for pix, if I wanted to go to all
that trouble, Id sell the stuff.
