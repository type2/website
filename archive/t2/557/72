The firewall is attached by sheet metal screws, but you will need to disconnect the wires/fuel hoses for your heater, and possible the double-relay if you have fuel injection.
 
You may also need to remove air filters or fuel injection AFM housing to get the firewall over the engine. Not sure if you can get it out with the carbs in place...
