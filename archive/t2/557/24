Subject: Bus Boys Oil Cooler

'79 stock Westfalia with type IV.  I am considering installing a Bus 
Boys remote oil cooler kit, part no. ZAP-11700 along with the oil 
thermostat part no. 11780.  Has anyone had experience with this kit?  
Is this quality equipment?  I am thinking of mounting the cooler above 
the transmission.  Will this require a fan or is air turbulence 
underneath the moving vehicle enough?  How are the hoses for this run? 
underneath the engine?  Where is the oil filter mounted?  Bus Boys 
claims no significant oil pressure drop.  Is this true?

Thanks in advance
