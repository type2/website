Subject: Bench seat was cut out. Need advice. 

Hey hey, one of the PO's of my 76' took out what I'm assuming to be a
bench seat, and cut into the metal seat frame a walkthrough area. S/He
then put in 2 bucket seats. The passenger side looks like it may be
origional, but the drivers side is deffenantly NOT from the bus. What
I'm wondering is, "Is that metal support for the seats structural, or
can I just finish the job they started, and cut out the rest of the seat
support, and just weld up something different?". 

I have pictures at http://67.160.13.189 but I'm not sure I have the
permissions set right for everyone to see 'em. I just installed apache. 

Thanks in advance
Chris
