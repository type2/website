Ah, but was it (presumably you mean the wasserboxer) really a good idea?

Those engines definitely had their problems, they only ever used them 
in the Vanagon (right?), and I seem to recall they had to go to the 
trouble to tool-up a factory to produce them (for the Vanagon only!), 
all while already producing other liquid-cooled engines of inline 
design for the Rabbit, Dasher, etc., nevermind the Audi products, e.g. 
Audi Fox (not to be confused with the VW Fox).

They managed to squeeze an inline engine into the diesel Vanagons... 
why didn't they do the same with the gasoline models?
