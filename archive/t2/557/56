 >the pump receives its power via an oil pressure switch

Old technology.... Chevy Vega did this over 30 years ago. They used a 3 terminal oil pressure sending unit. 1
wire to the light and 2 wires for the fuel pump. When the oil pressure came up, the switch lost ground and the
light went out; same as all others. But the other 2 wires completed a circuit when the pressure came up; so
the fuel pump ran. Here is a pic of the sender:
