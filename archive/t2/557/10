a simple way to wire it is with an oil presure switch, however you will
have to crank the engine enough to build up oil presure before the fuel
pump will start, (or use a relay thru the starter) but a carb engine will
usually fire with the fuel in the carb and that will immediately run up
the oil presure if your engine is even half decent.

if you wreck and your engine stalls the oil presure will drop and shut off
the fuel pump.

an oil presure sensor switch,
