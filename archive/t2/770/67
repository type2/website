FYI for all folks having starter switch problems....

It has been reported that the ignition switches that are generally 
currently available are just crap....If you get a new one, look over the 
crimps and other parts before installing it.

Kinda like I learned from an ex girlfriend who was also a very good 
seamstress...I learned from her to look over the clothes that I was 
purchasing and look carefully at the seams and such.

I can't tell you how many times I have looked thru several of the same 
item I was planning to buy before I found one that wouldn't come apart the 
first few times I washed it.

Caveat Emptor------Let the buyer beware.


What I *really* want someone to find is and entire VW warehouse left over 
from the 70's chock full of "real" original vw parts(only the good ones!).

Tom, one size larger than original would probably be more than fine...I 
might suggest that you buy a 25' roll and then put a connector on it and 
just unroll it on the ground and up to your ignition switch *before* you 
spend the time to actually route it under the bus...see what happens after 
that and make a decision.

Cheers, dave
