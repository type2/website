Because the engine is backwards in the 914 their transmissions are either
side shifting which you can't use or tail shifting which you might adapt.

The designation for that trans is 901/x which is the same as many of the
early 911 transmission which are easier to adapt to a bus.

Mike Gensler on the list has a write-up on his swap:
