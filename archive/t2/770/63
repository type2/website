Subject: Aluminum motorcycle jack

Search craftsman.com for 50191. The price in the flyer is $149.99 from
7/27-7/30.

The rear end looks like a regular floor jack and the front looks like an atv
jack that we used to remove bus engines. This might be easier to move
around.

The best part is that it weighs half as much (44lbs) at the other motorcycle
jacks (90lbs).
