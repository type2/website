Ron, can I suggest one more improvement for your next run? If it would not 
hurt the rigidity and stability too much, could they cut a notch down each 
side to accommodate a coffee mug handle? Most of my "car cups" have handles 
and I am always looking for a good cup holder that will hold a cup with a 
handle.

I may still buy one as soon as I move to Florida. Having a cool drink 
nearby is a survival issue there...
