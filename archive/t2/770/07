Subject: [T2] Must-Have Item - Cup Holder/Storage Unit for Bus 

Hi Volks- I have been using the original cup holder design for about a year
and it is VERY handy for traveling. It does have a couple of drawbacks.
Shifting into 3rd gear is tricky- I must use the palm of my hand or my
knuckles hit the holder and it won't go all the way into third- I use a gene
burg shifter that has a short throw. Secondly, radio access is somewhat
blocked with both holders filled even with standard size beverage cans.

Ron's modifications may make it more usable and I can't wait to see the
final design. TBear

Don't take life to seriously -- you'll never live throught it....
