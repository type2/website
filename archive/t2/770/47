Subject: Re: [T2]Higher oil Temp gauge?

I'm guessing this is normal temps in such hot weather.
It's in the upper 90's here in KC. I drove my bus
(full of heavy band equipment) over the weekend, only
about 10 miles of freeway driving (not faster than
65mph), my temp gauge got up in the 240 range, I was
worried, too. Running Castrol 10-30 oil in it.

I think I read somewhere that the VDO dual oil
pressure sender lights up when it gets down around
7psi. Mine does the same thing when I get to an idle
situation, the stock oil pressure light comes on. 

Doesn't bother me, but is 7psi dangerously low?
