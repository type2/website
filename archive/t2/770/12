Subject: RE: jalousie windows & cup holders et al

Here are some of the COMFORT and CONVENIENCE modifications I put in my 78 
Westy:

1 Rubbermaid cup holders at fresh air vents, left & right

2 Right rear window vent wing, similar to the one on left side [great for 
instant cross ventelation when sitting at rear.  Also, give both kids a 
window to play with.  If passenger side rear vent window is forgetfully left 
open, the sliding door will just close it when slamed open & back]

3 Smaller front Vanagon table for large Westy table [can keep the table 
installed and still drive with two passengers]

4 Rear door hatch inside release w/strap for closing while inside [this mod 
should be required for everyone.  Can possibly be used as an emergency 
exit.]

5 Radio Shack piezo buzzer for lights left on and key removed from ignition 
[Thanks to the list for those directions, which are probably still in the 
archives.]

6 Ding dong chime replacement for alert when door open and key in ignition

7 Holy CRAP handle for passenger, and assist handles for passenger and 
driver [helps get in front seats]

8 Vanagon seats front and matching Vanagon fold down seats in Westy rear

9 Modesty curtain between front pass/driver compartment and rear passenger 
compartment

10 Remote starter wire in engine compartment; [also used with one touch 
button dwell setting]

11 Starter switch on firewall, just a reach with the left hand [keeps from  
putting a strain on the plastic ignition switch.  And can restart without 
turning the ignition key]

12 Turned glove compartment door knob 180 around so the door can be opened 
with just a pull

13 Emergency brake assist [a piece of firewood with a hole drilled in it and 
a light rope attached so I can chock the drivers front wheel when on a 
graveled incline.  The rope allows me to move the Westy slightly to take the 
tires lock off the wood and fish it in while I am still on my seat.  
Also, the light rope is tied inside the Westy so if I forgetfully drive 
away, the firewood will be dragged along.  A masonry brick will not allow a 
hole to be drilled for the light rope.]

14 Heavy window tint [5 % at two side rear windows, and 20% at jalousies and 
rear window.  Jalousies have bug screens which help privacy, so 20% was the 
right pick. 20% at rear window allows enough light through, but still offers 
privacy.  I do a heck of a lot of changing of clothes in the Westy - junk 
yarding; after going from office to rec center; ladies of the evening]

15 Reading lights for rear passengers [so the kids can do homework during 
the winter rides home from school.  Also can read newspaper with Vanagon 
table]

16 [How could I forget this one!!]  Vanagon retractable seat belts up front.

These are just the comfort and convenience modifications I made.  Maybe this 
will qualify????

17  Rear speakers from radio shack

18  3x5 hand written sign on passenger window that reads:

Dude, if the was your dog I shot, I am really, REALLY sorry!!  You can find 
MOST OF HIM in the dumpster behind the 7-11..
