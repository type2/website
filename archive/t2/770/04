Thanks Tim, (and thanks everyone else for all the responses too...)


I guess I've narrowed it down for sure to three colors...

1 - Body Color
2 - White
3 - light silver


I think I'll have to get someone who is awesome at photoshop to try to mess with my picture so I can see all three.



Thanks!!!

Todd
