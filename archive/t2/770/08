first thing I would do it try and isolate the sound. If possible get
one of those mechanic stethoscopes and probe around the engine while
running. Try and determine if it's from the top end of the engine or
located in the case.

sure it's not an exhaust leak?

does the light come on when driving down the road? or is it at hot
idle.

I bet you are correct, but it could have been there for a long time,
unless you just recently checked the screen.

it really depends on how the engine is sitting. Oil makes it up to the
rockers and then runs back to the case through the push rod tubes. I
have had the occasional time to not have any oil drip right out of the
head, but it is very rare. Was there at least some oil sitting in the
head that looked as if it was somewhat recently deposited?

I wonder, did this start after the oil change? You might want to take
the oil filter back off and just confirm it has oil inside it
(hopefully indicating oil flow in the engine) If you have a blocked
passage the only correct way to fix it is to do a tear down and
inspect, but lets' hope it's something else.
