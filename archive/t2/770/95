I visit my grandmother every Saturday at the nurshing home (Covenant Villiage of Florida). There is this ONE guy who I see all the time walking around. He's got a cane, and a slight limp. But he's totally a hippie. The guy has a long pony tail, and I usually see him in converse (probably the reason why he's using a cane now). He sometimes sort of wears clothing that represents "the time" (though in a slightly more conservative fashion). 

There is a BLUE VW Beetle that's in the parking lot every day, I'd swear up and down that it's his!
