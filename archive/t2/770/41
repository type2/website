Subject: Re: [T2] solenoid trouble

I think I need to replace the wire running from the ignition switch to my 
solenoid. What's the best way to route such a wire and what gauge wire 
should I buy?
My newish ignition switch does make the solenoid click, but it rarely turns 
over. This with a strong battery, clean connections and a new starter motor. 
My auxiliary start button at the back(which connects to the same crimp on 
terminal the other wire does) fires it up like lightning every time. It 
could be the new electrical switch but I suspect a voltage drop between 
there and the back, due to old and undersized wires.  I'd like to try a new 
wire before going with a hot start relay.
What's the best point to drop a wire down throught the floor at, for those 
who've done it?

Muir shows a test (It begins on page 48 of the Idiot's Guide. Step 5 on 51
outlines the test for solenoid, starter and switch.) that I just did and
found a bad ignition switch.
