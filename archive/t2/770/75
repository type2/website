Subject: Boosting power !?

That's it ! my first real trip in 6 month time with my 8 mouth old 
daughter Marguerite and her mother in Harbin's hot spring , California.
the portable crib was nicely fitting  the van and we could still sleep 
in the back. Margo did wake up only once to drink some good milk from 
happy mother grown in California. ;-)

I was very very please with my van .... except that  it was soooo 
sloooooowwwww when it comes to climb anything steep, sometime in the 
highway 101, I had to go about 25Mph on the second gear, a snail would 
have been faster ! . I don't have any experience to compare with , I try 
to find some Vanagon on the road I can race in the slope , but there 
were none !! :-(

The van is going well on flat, I can go up to 75Mph easily (after a 
while) but it looks like the engine do not deliver all his power.

What can I do to improve the power , the engine was rebuild and 
supposedly good , I have new air filter, sparking plug, air sensor.
Do you thing that cleaning the injectors would change anything ?, what 
should I check ?

Thanks

Vanagon 83, 2.0L
