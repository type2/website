Barry,

Plain and simple...sell the bus to the man.

If he is that interested, then he will learn....it doesn't matter if he 
remembers how the carbs work or not...or if there were even carbs *in* the 
bus.

Did you have to take a test to buy your bus....not being crabby here, but 
wondering<big grin>.

"another older gentleman"

BTW, I am beginning to resemble that remark<grin>.  Which is fine by me, 
except working on torsion arms sure hurts more than it used to!

Cheers, dave
