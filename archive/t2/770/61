Thom Fitzpatrick of vintagebus.com fame was building a new garage in 2003
and he had the idea to set a scissor lift into the floor. You can view his
progress here:

I really like these lifts. When my bus was painted, the shop used one to
lift my bus to work under it and surprisingly they get out of the way only
blocking the belly as shown in Thom's photos.
