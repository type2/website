Subject: Re: A must have Bus Item

I bought one of these cupholders 8 months ago from CIP :
http://www2.cip1.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=ACC%2DC10%2D9104%2DC

It was 19.95 at the time with no cell phone holder.  They now have it with
a cell phone pouch and a price of $24.95, and it qualifies for free
shipping of your order is over $50.

Ron's modification is much better, and his price is better to boot.

need

"Nothing in the world is more dangerous than a sincere ignorance and
conscientious stupidity."
Martin Luther King, Jr.

"The dominion granted to man by the Creator is not an absolute power, nor
can one speak of a freedom to 'use and misuse', or to dispose of things as
one pleases. The limitation imposed from the beginning by the Creator
himself.... shows clearly enough that when it comes to the natural world,
we are subject to not only biological laws, but also to moral ones, which
cannot be violated with impunity."
Pope John Paul II, The Social Concerns of the Church, 1987

"..To choose life involves rejecting every form of violence: the violence
of poverty and hunger which oppresses so many human beings; the violence
of armed conflict, which does not resolve but only increases divisions and
tensions; the violence of particularly abhorrent weapons such as
anti-personnel mines; the violence of drug trafficking; the violence of
racism; and the violence of mindless damage to the natural environment."
Pope John Paul II 1999

What difference does it make to the dead, the orphans, and the homeless,
whether the mad destruction is wrought under the name of totalitarianism
or the holy name of liberty and democracy?-- Gandhi

"There were not sufficient reasons to unleash a war against Iraq. To say
nothing of the fact that, given the new weapons that make possible
destructions that go beyond the combatant groups, today we should be
asking ourselves if it is still licit to admit the very existence of a
'just war.'"

Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger Now Pope Benedict XVI May 2, 2003
