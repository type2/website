This is apparently VW's doing. They have redesignated the entire
Transporter line:

T1 - Split window bus
T2 - Bay window bus
T3 - Vanagon
T4 - First edition eurovan
T5 - Second edition eurovan

None of this to be confused with Type 1, Type 2, Type 3, Type 4, etc.
So the Vanagon is a T3, not a Type 3. Also sometimes referred to as a
Type 25 because all the part numbers start with 25!
