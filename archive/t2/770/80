Wait a minute ! ! I am getting peace signs from 10 - 12 year old kids on the 
street when I drive by with my yellow smiley faced front tire cover.  And 
from late teens as they drive past in their BMWs and Audis from the rear, 
after seeing my Jerry Garcia, crying bus, and dancing bears etchings on the 
rear window.


How is it that these [very] youngsters can relate:  VW bus + smiley face or 
JC montage = peace sign??  Was it 'That 70's Show??"

I am seeing less and less in the junk yards.
