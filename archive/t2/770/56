I am not talking about pouring the grease into
the ground, I am talking about not jacking any
vehicle up into the sky but rather working on
it standing up underneath it.  Perhaps the
terminology is wrong ("grease pit") but that's
what I knew to call it when I was younger and
Walt Land worked on my dad's Crosley, etc.
No "grease monkey" in small town Georgia had a
lift but they all worked in a "pit."
