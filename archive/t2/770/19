Subject: Jacking points

I have to crawl under the bus, and need to know where to put the jack 
stands.  I usually just drive my 77 riviera up my ramps and crawl under 
it, but I need to have the wheels free to move so that I can adjust the 
brakes.

I don't feel safe just jacking it up with the original jack and 
crawling under it.  I'm gonna feel a lot safer If I can block the bus 
once it's up with my heavy-duty, won't move unless there is an 
earthquake jack stands (

).  But, I don't know where to put them to hold the bus up, and still 
access the axels and wheels.  So, where should I put them?

Thanks
