Subject: Cal vs Fed Decel Valve

All, et al,

I've searched the archives, but couldn't find a direct answer to this one, 
so I thought I'd just go ahead and post it.  My 1979 Cal smog-worthy manual 
tran bus (which now resides in WA) has a dying decel valve.  Yesterday I 
picked up a used decel valve from a 79 Fed manual tran bus.  Question is 
will this fed valve work happily with my Cal FI system and are there any 
predictions on my passing Cal smog with the fed decel valve installed?

Any thought/comments are appreciated!

Thanks,

Bob
