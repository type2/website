One the samba someone in the phillipines is trying to sell a complete
warehouse of VW parts, but I was never able to get a response from
them. They do have a website with the inventory though.

 I think Wolfsburg West beat you to it. I can't remember where VWoA sends all
 the NOS parts to be destoryed (Texas?) but thanks to WW we're lucky enough
 that some one is there saving parts.
