Subject: '72 Bus for Sale in South Bend, Indiana

Not mine.

Spotted a light Blue and White Bus for sale yesterday on Auten Road
North of South Bend.  Pulled over in the dark for a look.

It's a '72 Passenger bus with a nice roof rack.  Card on the dash says
it has a '79 2.0 in it.  Looked pretty soild, some rust as far as I
could tell in the dark.  Asking $2000.  Ph:  (574) 271-1215

By the way, the world should know I got my "new" '79 Westy Deluxe
running and on the road for the first time last weekend! Injectors
refurbished by Cruisin Performance, Thanks, Rich.  Was as awsome
experience.  Can't wait to camp in it!
