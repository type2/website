Subject: Re: [T2]Higher oil Temp gauge?

Guys, stock pressure sender comes on about 4psi and the dual vdo comes on 
at 11'ish.


I'm sure Karl or someone will correct me if the stocker is different for 
buses.

For temps over about 50 I generally figure 120 degrees + ambient....at 
least that has been my experience in the past with my engines(bug and 
bus).

I can see a 30 degree difference on my daily drive between morning(60-70) 
and afternoon(85-100)...oil temps come up on the way home almost exactly 
the ambient temp difference.

Don'f forget about the silly VDO oil temp non temperature corrected 
variation...see Richard's site for that info.



Cheers, dave
