Subject: Looking for urrent CA smog check parameters

Does anyone have the current CA smog check parameters or know where I 
can find them.  I am going to head over to my friend's garage and 
they've got a dyno/smog machine and we're going to do some runs to see 
if my car's in spec.  Then I gotta head on over to the test-only station 
and get a real test.

Specifically I'm looking for what speed ranges they're currently testing 
at and what the min/max values are for the tested gases.  I think I have 
my test results from 2 years ago somewhere, but I didn't know if 
anything has changed since then.

Thanks!
Mike
