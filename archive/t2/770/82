Excellent!  I'm looking forward to the first camping trip my wife and  
I take with our (currently 2.5 week old) daughter in our '76  
Westy :-)  (I'm also counting the days until the first time she asks  
to borrow it for a weekend camping trip with her friends ... assuming  
it will still be possible to buy gasoline by then...)

Oh, that pretty much matches my experience... we have essentially the  
same engine, but of course the '83 Vanagon Westy is heavier than the  
'76 Type 2 Westy.  I have made the trip down US101 to LA in my Bus a  
few times, and there are plenty of spots where I'm going 35-40 in 3rd  
gear.  If you are really loaded down with stuff, it's not too  
shocking that you might have to downshift into 2nd.

First off is to make sure that everything is in-tune and adjusted  
properly.  Fuel injector cleaner certainly wouldn't hurt, but the  
best way to clean them is to pull them and send them off to  
professionals for an ultrasonic cleaning.  It probably wouldn't hurt  
to do a valve adjustment (yes, the hydraulic lifter valves do need to  
be adjusted periodically, just not nearly as often as the solids),  
and then do a full tune-up procedure (would be spec'd out in the  
Bentley manual for your model year).  You might need some special  
equipment for some of the tasks (like making sure the air/fuel ratio  
is correct), so taking it to a shop might be in order (I see you're a  
local -- Tassi's in Colma or Buslab in Berkeley).

Of course, it also doesn't hurt to remember that these are air-cooled  
Volkswagens ... they're not really ever going to be fast up hills :-)
