most likely. sorry it's a heavy bus, what do you want? ;) At least in
it's stock form. Plus the vanagon is quite heavy also.

unless the injectors are horribly dirty, you should not see any
noticable (if any) power increase. My advise is just enjoy the trip no
matter what speed you get there at. Both your bus and you will be
happier.

BTW wanna talk about slow up hills? I recently got back from a long
trip where I took my 66 westy up and over trail ridge road which tops
out at 12,183 feet. While I ran very very slow, and ended up cresting
the hill in 1st gear my little bus made it with no problem. We were
creaping though. Loaded up with 6 people and a trailer.
