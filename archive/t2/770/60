Speaking of weird coincidences, I found one of those in an empty home today
whilst doing my job.  It's made by LDM for Ford.  A bit of Internet
searching brought up a number of these "ash cups" for different Ford
vehicles.

This one's missing its lid, the part number is F8C6-5404788.  It's from an
older vehicle, though I did find ash cups for various 2005 models.  They're
usually listed as "ash/coin cups".
