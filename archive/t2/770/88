I've heard vague rumblings here and there that a few people have done it, but it's in the 
friend-of-a-friend realm so it's rather suspect in that regard.  Additionally, what I *have* 
gleaned about it is that it's a heckuva lot of work that involves adapting the entire Vanagon
shifter mechanism to the Bay Bus undercarriage.

( side note: I'm one of "those people" who's vaguely bothered by the use of "T3" when 
referring to Vanagons, because it causes confusion.  Type 3's (Fast/Square/Notchback) 
are also referred to as "T3" )
