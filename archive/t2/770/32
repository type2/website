Subject: Spare Parts

I have sold my '71 hardtop camper van and I have a lot of spare parts that I
have been collecting.  You know, the 'just in case' parts.  Anyway I want to
get them out of my garage now, however, I dont want to have to UPS/Mail them.
Is anyone close enough to come to Apex, NC (close to Raleigh) and pick them
up?  I might buy a VW beetle with the money I got for my van, so I am keeping
the engine parts.  The other parts that I have are:
1.   2 screens for the jalousie (spelling?) windows
2.   2 jalousie windows
3.   2 camper light fixtures that go above the little eating table
4.   1 gas tank
5.   2 back-up light assemblies
6.   fuse box assembly with cover
7.   upper brake fluid reservoir
8.   rear side window
9.   Dash switches  (rear window defroster, head lights, hazard/emergency
flasher switches, camper light switch, cigarrette lighter)
10. Steerig wheel column
11. childs cot with mounting hardware
12. the little interior stool
13. handle and latch mech. for sliding door
14..window for front door
15. dash parts
16. 2 rear axels with CV joints
17. some other misc. parts that I have forgotten to mention here
Is anyone in the Raleigh, NC area that would like to have these part?  If so,
p-mail me and we can make arrangements for you to come and get them.
