The stock wire was 4.0mm2 which is roughly 11AWG so I'd say go up one size to 10AWG.

The wire from the switch according to the wiring diagram is 2.5mm2 and goes into a tee. Have you tested that connection?

Have you tried to measure the resitance of that wire by extending the lead on your ohmeter?
