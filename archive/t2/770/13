Subject: Re: [T2] Engine cover plates

From Messa, Corbett:

I need to also replace a cover plate that is below my number three cylinder
and the manifold on the left side. I am not sure what piece it is because I
have not taken the piece out. Can someone point me to the right part on these pics?

 On this pic, it looks like it would be the next piece behind part 20, but I am
not sure.

 On this pic it might be part 18?

 I see some tin for sale on The Samba, but want to make sure I get the right
stuff. Also, can all this tin be removed from the bus with the engine still in
the bus?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since your previous post mentioned that you are removing your 'stock dual carbs' I am ASSUMING you have a 
73-74 bus with a 1700/1800 engine?

If yes, then anything by #20 in the 1st link is not it. #20 is the rear [rear is rear, front is front towards 
the steering wheel] upper corner tin. Nowhere near #3 cylinder. [at least you got a type 4 part picked:)]

Now in the 2nd link, #18 is the left lower pushrod cover tin, but it is a type 1 engine piece. [In the 2nd 
link ONLY 10 and 43 and the few little pieces by them are type 4 parts]

Go back to the 1st link,   http://www.ratwell.com/technical/Microfiche/t201000.gif
all the pieces pictured in the top section down to the screw at #8 are type 4 pieces.

#20 is the left lower pushrod cover. It can be installed in the bus.

#32 is the front lower tin at #3 cylinder. It is held on by 2 screws going down from above thru the front tin, 
left upper cylinder tin #1, and the bracket on the heater pipe between the heater box and flapper valve. NOT 
really replaceable with the engine in, but is doable with a struggle.

#36 is the rear lower tin at #4 cylinder. It is also the duct for the oil cooler.

I have all of these pieces......
