Subject: Re: [T2] Trip report - Summerland to Winnipeg

Hey Ginny - glad to hear things went well and that the 71 is back in action. 
I travelled west myself this summer - went from Kingston to Red Deer and 
back in about 11 days - what a nightmare - if it wasn't for Northern Ontario 
the trip would have been so much better. Northern Ont is very nice - but it 
just goes on for ever.

Man I do love the prairies - I love driving in Sk - and it is managable in 
that you can cross the Province in what ... maybe 8 hours or so ... or maybe 
10 or 12 in a bus :).

I checked out a few single cabs ... might take one ... I bought a nice old 
1/4 roof rack and a steering wheel for my 60.

Did a bit of fishing in Northern Ont on the way back.

Sounds like you had a great trip as well - I really do like Eastern Canada a 
lot - it is great here.  But ... I so miss the west - I'd move back in a 
heart beat of my wife would accompany me.
