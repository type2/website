Todd,

Either you were too young to be there or ya slept since then....<grin>

1967(the start of the movement...at least in Texas)...went to my first 
love-in at the local park in Dallas...LOL!!!..and I was nowhere near 20 
either!

I had a 1966 vw bug too then   Wasn't till later hippiedom that I was 
able to afford a bus....my first was a 67 split with a bad engine.

Lordy I miss those days...everyone friendly(well, except for in 
Chicago)...no terrorists yet...and all those other unmentionables!

Cheers, dave
