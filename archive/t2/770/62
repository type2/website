7 is too low. That's why they designed the warning light to come on at
that point. Ideal oil pressure is 10 psi per 100 RPM, so even at 850
idle you shouldn't be at 7 psi. VW literature states that it is normal
to flicker momentarily when getting off the freeway, but it can't be
good for the engine. Using 20-50 oil in summer can help with this.
