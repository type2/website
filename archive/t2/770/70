Subject: Re: [T2]Higher oil Temp gauge?

I'm still puzzled by my high oil temps.

Originally, on a day in the low to mid 90's, going 65-70mph,
my head temps were between 450-475 and my oil temp creeped up
to 240-250F.  After finding some vacuum leaks and resetting
my dwell/timing, my head temps came down. Now, on a day that
is low-mid 90's, my head temps are between 425-450 and my oil
temp still creeps up to 240-250F. Even around town driving when
the head temps stay between 375 and 410, my oil temp will creep
up to 240F.  I'm wondering if maybe my flaps are partially
blocking the oil cooler, or could I have a faulty pressure relief
spring that is keeping some of the oil from going to the cooler.
I do see my temps come down when the outside temp comes down...
like a thunderstorm...but once the sun comes out again, the oil
temp creeps back up.  I'm at a loss. I run Kendall 20W/50.
Something else that bothers me, when my engine is cold and I start
it, it takes about 5 seconds before I get oil pressure, then it
goes to 50-60psi. When the engine is warm/hot, I get good oil
pressure and good pressure at idle (~10-15 psi). Don't know
if that's related.
