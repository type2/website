Has anyone heard of or tried the PowerTrax traction systems?

They are apparently a cross between a limited-slip and a locking 
differential, installable by a home mechanic, and...

MADE FOR 091 and 002 TRANSMISSIONS!!!

This manual specifically mentions 002 and 091 installs:

Sounds too good to be true, but...
