AFAIK, there is no difference in the engine/trans setup between late
(2.0) bays and the 2.0 AFC Vanagons, so there should be no
interchangeability problems there. It's when you get into
post-late-'83 watercooled stuff that you start running into problems.
Also, I may have missed something here, but the only Vanagons that
ever had 5-sp trannys were Syncros, and in that case first gear was
only a "granny gear," leaving essentially four useable speeds.
Otherwise, all manual Vanagon gearboxes through '91 were four speeds.
Oh, and please correct me if I'm wrong on any of this...
