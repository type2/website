Subject: a mysterious oil leak that is really getting me mad

Hello all - 
 
I have an 81 Vanagon which is really coming along, thanks to all the help I've received from you!
 
Anyway, I pulled the engine, had it rebuilt, and put it back in.  It runs great, but I've had fluid leaks since I put the engine back in.  I've located and fixed some - the governor seal, for example. 
 
But the dang thing still leaks.  Drops of oil are collecting on the seam where the crankcase halves come together. (on the bottom)  It doesn't look like they are coming from anywhere.  As far as I can tell, nothing else is leaking.  A few of the bolts holding the crankcase together were a little loose, and I tightened them, but it didn't help.
 
I have this horrible feeling the leak is from the seam joining the crankcase halves, and I will have to dissamble the engine down to the crank and re-seal it.
 
Any ideas?  It would be really, really, really wonderful to have an engine that didn't leak oil.
 
Thanks as always - 
 
Marc
