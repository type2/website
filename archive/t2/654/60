Check your valve adjustment.

front side facing away from dist vacuum hose goes to venturi (narrow neck of 
carb) (correct carb?)
back side facing dist vacuum hose goes to intake manifold (left side riser I 
think, at the top by the split)

The preheat riser that goes through the tin from the exhuast "area" to the 
intake air cleaner is simply grabing warm air during warm up. The '71 wax 
thermostat regulates itself on engine compartment amient temp and opens and 
closes a flap to divert the air intake from inside the compartment when warm 
and around the exhuast area when not. This only need be pulled from around 
the exhuast.

I hope this helps.
