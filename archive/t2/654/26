In defense of the WWII hero/test pilot/airshow pilot Bob Hoover, his
medical certificate was revoked in 1995 under very suspicious
circumstances by the FAA.  The scuttlebutt was that he had annoyed a pair
of FAA airshow monitors, and their revenge was to file a report that he
was "flying irregularly" when none of the other pilots at the airshow
detected anything outside his normal flawless performance.  The FAA acted
in true bureaucratic fashion and tried to bury Hoover in a mass of
doctors, lawyers, and red tape.

Hoover appealed the revocation and even went to the point of being
examined in Australia so he could fly airshows outside the US.  Hoover's
US medical certification was finally restored to him and he flew in
airshows until 1999 when he retired at the age of 76.

I've seen him fly, and he was a magician.

"Our" Bob Hoover is also a pilot, but not an airshow pilot.  He's the guy
who pointed me at the type 2 list years ago.  His presence here is missed.
