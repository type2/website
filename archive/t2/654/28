Subject: Jacking '77 bay

I'm thinking about taking the bus over to a tire place to have the front
tires rotated from one side to the other.  The tires are wearing on the
inside edges and I figured it would be a good idea to switch them around and
even out the wear.

I know about maintaining the rotational direction, but the tire place wants
to jack up the bus with a hydraulic floor jack.

Is there a safe spot to locate a floor jack in the front of the bus to lift
it (both tires off the ground together), or is this a recipe for disaster?
