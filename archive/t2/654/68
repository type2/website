Subject: Bug for Sale

Good Volks -

Off topic: '67 Bug for sale, Los Angeles area. Call Judy/Isaiah (-at-) 
818-951-2411. I've seen it. It's cherry.

On topic: I finally have the 2110 in the Itch-ster. With the 091 tranny and 
205/80's adorning the 14" rims, my speed in gears are 1st=23, 2nd=50, 
3rd=80+, and who knows in 4th. We'll be back to BBB with the bus running 
this time!

Happy Thankgiving -

Mike and Itch ('69 Westy)
