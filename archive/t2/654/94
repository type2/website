i see the bentley procedure,  but it really doesn't explain which 
direction to adjust on the top rod; also, it is vague on how to 
tighten the cable. i also like how it says that 'even after 
adjustment it might not work.' :)

LOL!! my roller track was SUPPOSED to have been repaired by armadillo 
auto in austin, tx - i gave them a HUGE section of clean bus to weld 
in. well, they simply unwrapped the outer skin and welded it OVER the 
old stuff! put in like 1" of body caulk 'just like the factory.' i 
love the owner, but i laughed in his face. whatever, at least the 
roller wasn't dropping into a 2' slot.
and yes, besides being butt-ugly, it worked, so not a problem related 
to door-not-pop.
