Glenn,

Thanks for the info... I'm in Connecticut and would love to find a good
replacement unit - not too many junk yards in my neighborhood or a lot of
parts busses for sale.  Also, I have concerns about replacing a 25 year old
linkage with another 25 year old (or older) linkage I would expect it be
worn as well.

Does anyone know if newer linkages would work?

Have a great Thanksgiving!

Wayne,
   Concerning your loosey-goosey wiper assembly, the quickest fix I know 
is to find a good replacement unit, perhaps from a wreck.  You can spend
hours upgrading your present wiper linkage assembly, assuming you have
access to a good machine shop.... much easier to begin your rebuild with
parts (shafts, link connectors) that are not badly worn.  Where are you
located, geographically speaking?  Have a great T'giving..... Glenn
