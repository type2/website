don't think there is enough experience to totally stop doing stuff like
that,  at least I'm far from it, right now I have to take off my 1-2
exhaust pipes, am really nervous for same reason

Bummer but at least they are the intake side, far less stress on bolts

well first, how badly are they stripped?  did you actually totally botch
the hole?  if just where you can't pull it down tight, I've packed the
hole lightly with steel wool, (not the kind you clean dishes with, but the
sanding type) and rethread the bolts, the wool fills the gaps and allows
it to be pulled tight.
another "dutchman" is to wrap the bolt with J-Bweld or similar material
and again insert in hole, and come back in 24 hours at least before
putting on the intake runner.  these probably wouldn't work on exhaust but
should be sufficient on the intake.  be sure to put something the intake
ports to keep trash out of engine, and when finished blow out the intake,
should also make sure both valves are closed before working there, last
thing you need is something inside the cyl (ask me how I know)

of course if the head is off and you can do it "Right" by all means use an
oversized bolt and retap the hole to the next larger size.

YMMV
good luck
Bob
