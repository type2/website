Subject: Wiring the wadio

Over the holidays I'll be soldering the leads on the old harness connectors
in preparation for installing the radio in our bus.  I'm getting one of
those new cordless soldering irons to do the job, a "Cool Touch".

I've read the FAQ at their website and understand the limitations of the
tool.  It should work fine for the work I've lined up.  I could let the list
know how well it works if anyone's interested.
