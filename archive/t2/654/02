Joe,

Can you take the black cover off the AFM? Is there evidence of it being
removed and re-glued on? For some reason, it is not uncommon for people to
bend the trip wire on the afm vane that actuates the pump micro switch. I
have seen this several times. People think there is something wrong with the
afm and bend the wire so even with the vane in the fully closed position,
the fuel pump is running. Bend the wire back to where it is supposed to go,
and it is fixed for good, for free, in 5 minutes.
