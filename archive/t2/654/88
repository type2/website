Folks,

Richard really does say it all....I have been on various lists since 
1984....yeah, maybe that tells you something<grin>..but! .*generally*, the 
folks with reasonable attitudes and mellow dispositions will stay...the 
folks that are irritable, "their way or the hiway" or just plain obnoxious
will generally fade into obscurity.

I miss Jake, but I don't miss diatribes from *anyone*.

What I miss **more** is the folks that had genuinely illuminating 
information that I no longer see postings from  because they have felt 
menaced in some way that was **not** appropriate....enuff said...

I have actually had illuminating info from Bob Hoover on the vintage vw 
list...very reasonable and informative responses...I couldn't believe that 
he responded to a question about 3way valve jobs on the list....but!  I 
was getting "misleading" info from everyone else!

I've seen the "sermons" from Bob and been impressed....there *used* to be 
a saying on the net....

"the people that gave away the most information were the most revered"

Think about it....ramblings from dave on a Wed night...<grin>

Bus content:  I expect to add an ignition off/radio "on" switch to my bus 
this weekend and also add a complete alarm system/keyless entry/remote 
start.


Happy Thanksgiving to all of those still here and who might be here!


Cheers, dave
