This is wrong. The retard goes to the manifold

This thing is called a dash pod and is not for your dist. Lets leave that 
for a later date. If you look in the pic just behind the spring on your 
throttle lever you'll see a rubber nipple. I believe this is the ventury 
port blocked off. Make sure by reving the engine and feeling a vacuum. If 
not look around the carb body in that area or around the neck of the body 
for another port and that is the advance vacuum port.
