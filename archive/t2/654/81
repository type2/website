The hinges are a little complicated, check a few things on them when you 
have them off and out. Obviously look at the guide piece (plastic) should 
still have the channel as you stated is good, then the metal roller should 
roll and not be bent or wobbly, Then on the busy end look for the two hooks 
to still have spring tension and not be broken these hold the hinge open 
when sliding. They must have the hook to engage the notch on the front shaft 
pivot. Make sure this is not brocken as well. Of course the big spring 
inside the mount is what makes this thing pop open so check and lube it as 
well. Thats enough to get you started. We do sell rebuilt hinges for $125 if 
anyone needs one.

Lube everything, not just the hinge. Lube the rear lock mech, the front mech 
and the handle.

This really sound like your issue, pull the panel and adjust the cable I bet 
it is just stretching, but due to gummy lock mech.

This is all done with the front lower and upper rollers. Check your lower 
roller tray for wear.
