I recently saw at NTB an alarm battery, it was an alarm system built into
the battery.  same old beep, beep beep, turning off on etc. has
radio/clock terminal that allows the low drain stuff to keep working but
when armed though it will not allow the vehicle to start.  might be an
inexpensive/easy way to put an alarm in a bus.
