Subject: Fuel pump cut-out alternative

I just picked up an electric fuel pump intertia switch at the boneyard.  
Poked around a little and found one in a late model f*rd taurus trunk.  
Gave the guy $5 and walked away with it.  It works great!  Any kind of 
hard jar and the little steel ball in it jumps and shuts off the 
switch.  All that is needed is to wire it in series with the power 
supply for the fuel pump.  Both Canadian and American regulators trust 
this thing on (how many million?) vehicles so it must work!  Right?
