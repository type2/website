Subject: BN4 glow plugs

List,

I am still trying to get the part numbers for BN4 gas heater glow plug and
spark plug. If I can get these numbers I may be able to source the
replacement parts.

Last week a list member sent me a few photos of the plugs, but somehow they
have disappeared on me. Perhaps they can resend, or anyone else who is gas
heater friendly might be able to help.

Thanks,

Scott Lyons
