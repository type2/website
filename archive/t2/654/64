BN2 Glow plug: 211 261 551A
BN2 Spark plug: 211 261 553

BN4 Glow plug: 211 963 319

BA4 Glow plug: 411 963 319 (superceeded BN4 number also)
BA6 Glow plug: 211 963 319A

The later units are glow/spark combos with multiple leads and electrodes.

BTW, anyone looking for the BA6 plug I know where 2-3 are possibly located.
