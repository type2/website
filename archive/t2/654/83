Easy there cheif,

A half hour to replace the rear crank shaft seal?  You have to drop the 
exhuast and pull the fan and housing. Plus all the other little stuff. Like 
disconnect the battery, heck that could take a half hour on some buses or 
vanagons for that matter. I would say a minimum of 3 hours do such a job. 
Start to finish, at least.

That being said, There are several other likely places to look, like the oil 
pump housing, and depending on wether the thing was driven or not it could 
be the sump cover plate. Oil filter, filter flange, oil cooler, or seals. 
Look befor you leap into a .5-3+ hour job.
