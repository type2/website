Subject: Aux fan

I was going to install a bilge blower in our bus when I realized that I
still had the aux fan from before the engine switch.

The motor is completely shot.  The shaft pulls in and out about .25" and
moves side to side almost .5".  Obviously shot.  But the squirrel cage fan
and the housing itself are in tip top shape.  It even has both of the little
flaps.

I searched Bus Depot for the part, but could only find an Auxiliary Fan for
$330.03.  A bit pricey for me, though I'm not sure it's actually the part
that I'm looking for.  The part is labeled "Hot Air Fan" on the fiche
(028-00), part #2.  BTW, The squirrel cage is pressed on, not held on with a
nut like in the fiche.

Is it worth fixing this baby, or should I just go with the bilge blower?
