Richard,

I really appreciate the VW part numbers. I have also today tracked down the
BERU numbers for the BN4 plugs, the spark plug is EBE 514 and the glow plug
is 140M. Within a few weeks we should have glow, spark  and glow-spark plugs
in stock for all VW heaters except the B2, which I will work on next.

We have BA6 glow-spark and BN2 glow plugs in stock in limited numbers.
