There are always two sides to every story. You should ask the listmembers he sent threatening photos and emails to how they like his ettitque. Maybe he was on the verge of getting the boot anyway...

Some people don't engage in list conversation: they have time to write up long winded opinions but claim they have no time to interact and reply. No big loss under those circumstances.
