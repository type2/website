Subject: Drops of oil on the engine crossmember

Hello all,
 
I've been carefully breaking in the rebuilt engine on my 81 Vanagon.  After driving it, I notice a few drops of motor oil on the crossmember that holds the engine in place.  The drops appear to be in the center of the engine.
 
I'm a bit concerned...I put a lot of time and money into this.  Any ideas?  The rest of the engine is oil-free...
 
Thanks for any help you can give.
 
Marc
