Subject: Alternator conversion question

I'm all set to put in my new alternator. One question though. On my old
generator, the shaft has a male key, but the new alternator has a female
key...is this going to be a problem. Do I need to buy a new fan hub,
what about my pulley??
 
Thanks, I'm hoping to be done by turkey time.
