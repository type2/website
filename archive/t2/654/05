>Where and with what does one "lube" the sunroof.

I have a sunroof bus and it takes maintenance and patience.

The rails that the physical roof slide have to be greased annually IMHO, I use 
a standard bearing grease and apply a smooth layer as far back as I can reach.

I grease the cable as well as they are contained and the grease helps the cable 
slide through the cog gear easier.

The whole system is under quite a bit of pressure and keeping the roof sliding 
as easy as possible is the key to NOT breaking cables.

>Are they supposed to have fibrous stuff in the middle

Yes, the cables have a fibrous material....

>Man, it's nice when it's open on a sunny day!

The best!

>Probably will turn into a poptop, though, when a cable gives up on us :-(

Noooooooo!
