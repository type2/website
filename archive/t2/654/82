Hi Marc,

To me this sounds like the rear main seal, unless there was some
cleaning solution left in the fan housing before reassembly. But it's
not the worst leak you could have. It only takes about a half hour to
change the seal. The main thing would be why is the seal leaking. Is
the seal of poor quality? Is the main bearing allowing excessive
vibration? Is there excessive end play? Is the sealing surface of the
crank in good condition? Are you overfilled with oil? Or perhaps you
will just experience a little blowby until the rings seat.

John

 I've been carefully breaking in the rebuilt engine on my 81 Vanagon. 
After driving it, I notice a few drops of motor oil on the crossmember
that holds the engine in place.  The drops appear to be in the center
of the engine.
 
 I'm a bit concerned...I put a lot of time and money into this.  Any
ideas?  The rest of the engine is oil-free...
 
 Thanks for any help you can give.
 
 Marc
