When you get in an accident, it will shut off the bus.  This is not 
needed for stock FI setups, though, because there is a built in 
mechanism to handle shutting off the fuel pump if the engine isn't running.

However, I guess it would still be handy if you got in an accident and 
the engine was still running....
