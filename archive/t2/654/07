>What? Fibrous material in the cable? What are you refurning too?

I have two cables right here, left and right, the left is a strand of wire 
wrapped like a phone cord around another stranded straight piece of wire.

The right side cable I have is identical, except that the straight wire is not 
visible due to a "fibrous" material thats interwoven with the second phone cord 
style of wire.

Why? I dont know....

When I purchased a cable from the dealer years ago, it also has this interwoven 
material...

Anybody want some pictures?
