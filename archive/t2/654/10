I don't recall if Bob Hoover (pilot) == Bob Hoover (VW guy).

But, Bob Hoover (VW guy) was still active in RAMVA last time I looked in (a
year or so ago).

If you chhose to start reading RAMVA be prepared. The mail volume on the
Type2 list is miniscule compared to the deluge on that newsgroup.

RAMVA == nntp://rec.autos.makers.vw.aircooled
