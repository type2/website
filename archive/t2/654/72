I don't know... I had chased down Jake Raby during the Mallory Dizzy
battle recently. He said he refused to come back to the T2 list
because of those kinds of fights. The exact quote:

"If anyone asks where I'm at tell them that the assholes got the best
of me and I won't be back to that list."

If Bob Hoover feels the same way, I doubt we'll be able to lure him back...
