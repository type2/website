Hmmm.... when I changed mine, all I did was pull the fan....

But yes, you did mention some good possibilities I overlooked.

 Easy there cheif,
 
 A half hour to replace the rear crank shaft seal?  You have to drop the
 exhuast and pull the fan and housing. Plus all the other little stuff. Like
 disconnect the battery, heck that could take a half hour on some buses or
 vanagons for that matter. I would say a minimum of 3 hours do such a job.
 Start to finish, at least.
 
 That being said, There are several other likely places to look, like the oil
 pump housing, and depending on wether the thing was driven or not it could
 be the sump cover plate. Oil filter, filter flange, oil cooler, or seals.
 Look befor you leap into a .5-3+ hour job.
