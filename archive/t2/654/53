I have a spare, just not the jack.  I've got the old scissors jack from my
last car for now.  I really need to get one of those BD jacks.

Imagine a used tire shop in Georgia...

Yeah, it's one of those.  But they're nice folk and will change tires around
for $5.00 a tire.  I've been getting tires from them for over a decade for
my old cars.  I won't be getting tires from them for the bus, though.

but it's not that safe if you ask me.

By "safe" I meant for the bus.  I should have been more specific.  They'll
want to take both tires off to change the rims over.  I just didn't want to
damage the bus.

Looks like the center of the front beam is the place.

Thanks.
