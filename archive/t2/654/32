I'm going to look into picking one up at the boneyard.  I was going to do
the relay thing, but this seems simpler to do.

I've got an 1.8L, single carb in a '77 bay.  The bus use to have FI at one
time in the distant past, and has an after market electric fuel pump.

Interestingly enough, I recently had the engine replaced and the "new"
engine has a stock fuel pump mounted on it.  The inlet and outlet are
crimped shut.  I don't know if it works.
