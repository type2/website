Dear List members:

In the spirit of the Holodays and seeing that so many people have come 
and gone since whatever it was that made Bob Hoover leave, is it 
worthwhile for the List Editors/Moderators or even a number of us 
"newbies" on the list to reach out to him and get him back?  I likely 
have a clutch job ahead of me and a little Hoover Wisdom might be 
helpful.  We have a guy like Bob on our cycling list and he adds so 
much.  Being a "personality" though people have to relax and skim over 
Bob's "opinions" if they bother reader and look at the air-cooled 
stuff.  It's great.

Reaching out to Bob -- We up to it?

BEN
