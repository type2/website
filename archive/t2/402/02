Subject: 200 vs 180 mm flywheel

I am putting a new engine in a 1963 Karmann Ghia but I think this same problem
would exist in the older type2s. 180 mm flywheels, I guess std for 6v systems
and bell housings are hard to come by so I opted for a 200 mm for the
following reasons:
	1. This Ghia had been converted to 12v before I found it.
	2. I figured that someone else had already gone through the trouble of
shaving out the bell housing to accommodate a larger flywheel.

But alas, now sits in my driveway a new engine that has a flywheel that won't
fit into the bell housing because it had not been shaved (or honed) like I had
figured. So now I must make a decision:
	1. hone the housing myself--with no previous experience I am worried.
	2. pay someone else to do it.
	3. continue my search for a good 180 mm flywheel.

My main question is safety--the lump in the bell housing that is impeding the
flywheel is caused by the thicker areas of the housing where the engine
mounting bolts slide through.  Am I weakening (by honing) that area and
encouraging a catastrophic failure where I could ruin the housing?

I have a good lead on a 180 mm flywheel in a junkyard in my area. The 1300
engine is still sitting in this Ghia and I am going to pull it out this
afternoon and have a look at the flywheel. If I were to want to use it, will a
12v starter engage a 180 mm flywheel or is there modification involved? Should
I grab the 6v starter from this other Ghia as well?

Thanks in advance,
David
