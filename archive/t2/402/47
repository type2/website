Subject: Today, the heads (81 Westy)

Dropped my motor cause of the rear seal, going to re-do all of the
seals/gaskets. While I've got the chance I'm going to lift the heads to have
a good look at things. I have lots of ziplocks and labels for everything,
but I need ideas on specific things to look for on the heads themselves.
Rocker arms look ok, rods ok. So far, so good !! Not splitting the case,
(hopefully), compression was ok and fairly even.
Thanks all.
