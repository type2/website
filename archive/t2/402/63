You can get LEDs with various light patterns.  Common designs either
focus light in a 10 degree cone or in a 30 degree cone.  For taillights,
the 10 degree varity is ideal, as any oncoming traffic from the rear will
be well within 5 degrees from the F-R axis of the vehicle.  If they are
more off-axis than that, you're not going straight down the road!

Sounds like you want the LED bar at the base of the rear window  You
could also go with LEDs on the luggage rack if you run one.
