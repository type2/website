Interesting. I prefer to travel on the state highways--regardless of what
vehicle I'm driving--for esthetic reasons. That being said, I find myself on
the interstates more often than I'd like. From western Kentucky I go north
to Michigan, south into Tennessee, and further on occasion. I cruise my 74
at a steady 60 mph and I haven't had much trouble on the interstates. I do
try to be as considerate as possible by staying in the slow lane, making it
as easy as I can for other drivers to get around me. I don't recall ever
being flipped off (except maybe during rush hour) or cursed at on the
interstate. Even at 3 am in Ohio on I-75 while surrounded by trucks.
     The state highways are another matter. Even though I try to be just as
considerate, I've been called everything but nice by my fellow state highway
drivers. Maybe because there is only one lane in each direction, making it
harder to pass. I have been known to pull off the road to let the 'parade'
go by on roads that slow me down and that's when I get the gestures. Go
figure.
    I don't know the answer, folks. I just know that haven't had any
significant trouble on the interstates, despite my self-imposed 60 mph
maximum. I also haven't had any wrecks; close calls to be sure, but all of
the variety that also happen when I'm driving the F250.

Regards,
Dave
