Subject: Full flow filter on 1600

The case is in the shop being worked on and I am considering having it drilled
and tapped to accomodate a full flow oil system. The advantages of a full flow
oil system are obvious. Are there any known disadvantages to a full flow
system on a 1600 engine? It's in a '71 bus.
