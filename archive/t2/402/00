I had some left over from a motorcycle project. I bought black and red and
silver but didn't use the silver so I put it on the bus.  If you've ever
followed a vehicle down the road with this tape applied you know how hard it
is to ignore it. All the police cruisers seems to have the red/white strips
on their bumpers following the DOT requirements for large trucks.

The tape blends into the bumper during the day.

I had trouble finding it but I'm sure it's available locally. It's just not
well advertized and many sign shops I went to only had large sheets that
were expensive not the small rolls I needed.

Goto <www.galls.com> and enter 3M into their search field.

Then choose silver/reflective for the color combination.

It comes in 60" and 150ft rolls. IIRC, the bus bumper is 82" long so I just
centered the roll.

Good idea if I don't say so myself. ;-)
