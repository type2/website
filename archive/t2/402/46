In the old days, plugs were temporary fixes only.  These days, some claim
that they are as sound as the original tire rubber.

However, if it's _my_ bus on the line, I insist that the tire be removed
from the rim and a patch applied to the inside of the tire.  The added
expense to do it right is worth not having a problem down the road as the
tire wears.
