Subject: Hiway Safety

Hi All,
    With all this talk of Dawn's accident, I'd like to add my 2 cents.
A couple of years ago my wife and I drove our bus from Long Island,
New York to lower Michigan for a short vacation.  While driving on a
hiway there, where the speed limit is 75, we narrowly avoided an
accident.  We were in the right lane doing 60 MPH, which is our
personal limit for our bus, when about 6 or 8 cars in front of us
started crashing into each other.  Only by driving between the
crashing cars was I able to avoid becoming involved.  I was busy
looking for an escape and weaving through the accident.  Once I was
calm enough to talk I asked my wife what happened and she explained
that there was a car on fire on the other side of the road.  She said
that 1 car in the fast lane on our side slowed down to rubber neck,
and look at the fire.  The car behind the rubber necker slammed into
them and cars began bouncing off each other across 3 lanes of
northbound hiway.  By the time the whole thing was done, there were
about a dozen cars involved.
    I guess the moral of the story is to expect the unexpected.
