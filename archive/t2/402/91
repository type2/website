Subject: Front Wheel Bearings

Hi Folks,

I just replaced the wheel bearings on both my front wheels, and I think I 
may need new spindles.  I noticed a wear pattern on the outer end where the 
outer bearing's inner race appears to have spun on the end of the spindle.  
First, are these races supposed to stay put or are they supposed to move?  
The original races pulled out easily, and the new races went in pretty 
easily.  Second, if they have spun, is there any fix short of replacing the 
entire spindle?  BTW, now that my front wheels are more solid, I can feel 
the slop that's in the steering linkage.  Oh well, just another thing to add 
to the list...

Thanks in advance for any help or suggestions.
