Have (rather had - divorce) a pro-stereo installer brother-in-law who had 
one. Was a hidden screen behind a radio face. His was hooked up to a DVD 
player but they can be hooked up to receivers as well for TV use. Dunno if 
they come with that built in - the TV tuner - but I have seen the tuners 
sold separately.

Fancy - too fancy for me.

I think there is a law which says the screen can't be visible to the 
driver. This may or may not be a law that they Police choose to enforce.

Good luck!
