Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Full flow filter on 1600

Hello Guys and dolls   I have done this to a bunch of motors. on splits I use 
the oil pump type , works real well but can have some problems, stock muffler 
wont work always, some headers are real close to the filter tending to heat 
the oil,not good but you can wrap the filter with header tape. Also cheap 
filters can blow the sealing ring when cold, been there , The best filters are WIX 
brand, mann and Mahles are also good.  If you get a chance cut a fram filter 
open and check out how cheaply its made, cardboard top and bottom , very few 
spaces in the filter part and held together by kite sting. real cheesy. On the 
bays you have the problem of where to mount the filter and of course hoses 
which can leak or get burnt by exhust, but the good is that you can also hook up 
an oil cooler to the same hoses. All in all I think the oil filters are a good 
add on. Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  salem Import Service Salem Va
