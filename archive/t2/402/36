Eric,

Remember though, how directional led's are.

You might consider checking the $20.00 assemply at your local flaps 
because when i took it apart to see how it was made, it is just one long 
thin printed circuit board....you could potentially cut it a couple of 
places and resolder wires between the parts and make in more "accordian 
like"...so that it would "fold" into a smaller space....

Just a thought..

Cheers, dave
