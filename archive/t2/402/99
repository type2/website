Subject: trouble first engine pull

I decided that since i have some time off work in these next few weeks that 
I'd try my first engine removal.  My bus is a '72 transporter, by the way.  
So my problems are these:

1.  I am following the Muir book, and after reading some archived list 
messages, I've found that I didn't know to disconnect the fuel lines! Muir 
says nothing of this!  Is there anything else that Muir is missing?  Is 
there someone who has posted a more complete instruction set for my 1700 
engine?

2.  The front right bolt holding the engine and trans together (the top one 
holding the starter on) is shaped somewhat like a half moon and very 
stripped.  I can not seem to get it out!  While I hear that it should be a 
17mm bolt, it seems the 18mm box-end fits much better on it, but still wont 
grip on the rounded edges.  Any ideas?  I figure I'll try the vise grips in 
the meantime...

3.  I also read in the archives something about taking the trans and engine 
together being easier - it sounds much more complicated to me.  Is this 
indeed easier?

Thanks a bunch!
Peace to you all,
