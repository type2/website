We did this with a 6 volt Beetle tranny. Crazy solution but we almost got 
the engine in place and started it up (ratchet wrench on the generator) and 
while it idled we slid it in... The things bored single guys will do with 
enough beer in them...

Seriously if you slide it in while rotating the engine you'll do the job. 
Then remove the engine and clean out the shavings. Reinstall. Remove those 
sparkplugs for easier rotation and the generator belt.

No problems with the car and the tranny.
