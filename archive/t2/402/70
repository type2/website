what year is the auto tranny bus, 78??  (what kind of shape is the tranny
in??, where are you located??)

there is a lot more to it than first appears.  besides the engine and
tranny some things that need to be dealt with.
. clutch, and linkage
. all shift linkages
. need the shaft for the shift linkages
. different front tranny mount
. different accelerator linkages
. different ECU (this doesn't appear to matter unless you are in Calif)
. different half shafts, the auto tranny axles are different lengths

in a perfect world I'd have two engines and trannies and one bus ;8*}

it's a lot of work and requires some welding...
good luck
