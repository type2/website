Subject: Auto to Standard

I'm looking at installing my '78 engine and manual transmission in a bus 
that has an automatic transmission in place.  How hard is it to change a bus 
from auto setup to manual?  What all is involved?  Would I need everything 
from the shifter itself, the shifter linkage, all bushings, shift coupler?

I don't want to yank all this out of my current bus.  In a perfect world, 
I'd have 2 bus bodies with only 1 engine to maintain.

Thanks for your help,

Beth in Houston
