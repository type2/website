Me too.  I can't recall any instance of being "flipped off" on an
interstate.  Now, my ususal interstate exposure is I-5 in the central
valley, I-10, I-15, and I-40.  None of these are noted for being slow.
I've been all over the western US in my bus and sometimes interstates are
hard to avoid, but I've never had any problems on them.  They're just
boooorrrriiinggggg.

Perhaps folks on the other coast are just naturally more hostile?  :)

The typical bus has about the same power-to-weight ratio as a semitruck,
and maintains similar speeds.  I stick with the right lane and keep out of
other folk's way.  There's always a left lane if they want to pass.
