Saw a late 70's baywindow from NY one time on the interstate in KY - was 
painted all over telling something about snakes. We were in my Honda CR-V 
running 75 - 80 with the traffic after adopting an English Setter from a 
shelter in Paris, KY.

He was running 55 mph, the traffic was running 75- 80 mph. I didn't know 
why traffic had bunched up so badly until I saw the bus. I had to chuckle 
because they looked like they were having so much fun. My kind of people. 
Was a motivator in my quest for more speed through Corvair transplants (in 
my case) so my flat land speeds would be about 65 mph and my hill speeds 
(uphill) would not drop so much. Power, not speed.

Wanted a lower speed differential between me and mine and the other 
traffic. A bumper tap with a 10 mph differential is less traumatic than a 
30 mph difference.

I so love our old VW's but like so many other vintage breeds the interstate 
is almost too fast for them. (and too fast for my Cute-Ute CR-V and my '81 
Honda CB900C motorcycle).

On our last trip to Nashville we ran 70 mph (speed limit) all the way to 
the metro area where average speeds climbed a bit to something around 80 
mph. I see the same in Atlanta. WOW. Civilian NASCAR. Chattanooga is 
getting to be like that. Knoxville seems to run speed traps more often - I 
at least see more tickets being written when we visit there.
