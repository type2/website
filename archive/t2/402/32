No offense, but this sounds ridiculous.

Anyone in the electrical/plumbing industries bends pipe and conduit all day long without packing anything full of sand.

It's called a pipe/conduit/tube bender. Many styles many methods.

the other day someone on another list i am on suggested that if you need to
bend brake lines by hand, you should fill them with sand first so they don't
kink. i wondered (to myself) if they were serious.
