Subject: porsche style cooling fan


Hello everyone I just finished fabricating hah! monkey wrenching a cooling fan
into my 74' riveara I figure all the traffic and slow putting around really
could overheat my baby this summer,  I read about a aftermarket porsche style
cooling fan (Hot VW magazine) that claimed never overheat again.
 So I made one I''ll get some picts of it tommorrow after work when there's
more light

Bradley & Cara 74' riveara
87' soon to depart golf (anybody want her)
85 pony winteruster
