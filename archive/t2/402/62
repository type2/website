Running two different sizes (or stiffnesses) of tires can produce some
very strange handling.  If you must run different tires front and rear put
the stiffer tires on the rear.  If you put the stiffer tires on the front
you'll wonder why every little adjustment of the steering wheel produces
an overcorrection!  I did this once and had an entire 400 mile day's drive
to ponder what was wrong!
