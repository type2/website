I'm not expert - however I have plugged and paid to have plugged several 
tires in my time. I have never had one fail and never had a problem with a 
plug. Those plugged tires were driven until they were bald just like the 
other 3 non-plugged tires within that set on the same vehicle.

Maybe 5 tires I have done this to.

I now do my own plugs and save the $5-$10 per plug the tire store charges 
me. Bought a kit at the FLAPS.

Dunno if life would be different crossing the frozen tundra or Death Valley.
