That's a cool way to avoid the load problems with the LEDS.

But it's directional lighting, only clearly visible from directly behind the
vehicle.  Which is probably okay for most purposes.

What I want is a set of taillights that naturally sit right at eye level for
truckers and 4WD folk, don't require an cosmetic change to the bus, and are
easily removed.  Here's an excerpt from my replay to another listee early
today:

would sure love a set for my vanagon westy

Hi,

I'm very likely going to do this one, but I've got everything tied up in
current projects and can't invest in it until some cash flow starts, well,
flowing. :O)

I'll look at the vanagons at the next local club meeting and see if I can
make the lights fit both types of buses.  If not, maybe I can simply create
a set for each type.

I really like the high taillights on some of the modern minivans, and would
rather have something like that instead of an LED array in the rear window.
Especially as the high mounted taillights would be directly in the
windshields of tractor trailer, 4WD pickup, and SUV drivers!
