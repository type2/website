Subject: hydraulic lifters

Hi Listees,
    A few days ago someone was asking about hydraulic lifters.  While
I don't have any expertice in that area, here's the link to someone
who does.  It will take you to an article on lifters, at the Boston
Engine site, written by Bob Donalds.  If anyone knows hydraulic
lifters, he should.
