Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Injection Jump

Hi,

Earlier injectors should have a current limiting resistor in series when 
tested with 12 Volts. You won't get pulsing action when you apply a steady 
12 Volts (even with a resistor). The pulsing action is a result of the ECU 
injector pulses that vary in rate with RPM.
