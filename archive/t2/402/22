Subject: Re: [T2] Full flow filter on 1600

You have to run special filters, since the oil pressure to the filter can
reach 300 psi on a cold morning start, leading to a blowout all over your
driveway.  The Fram HP1 filter is the one to use. I am building a 1776
engine with full flow as we speak. Tom

The case is in the shop being worked on and I am considering having it
drilled
and tapped to accomodate a full flow oil system. The advantages of a full
flow
oil system are obvious. Are there any known disadvantages to a full flow
system on a 1600 engine? It's in a '71 bus.
