The wiring diagram suggests using terminals J and B (wire color changed over
the years) which is the wire going to the fan.

I have no idea what the current rating is for your fan but the fan in the
engine compartment is already wired to a 16A fuse that likes to blow out. I
don't know what the relay is rated for (check the body).
