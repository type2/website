what I think happened here is your p.o. rewired the lights wrong.  keep 
in mind your turn signal lights serve two functions 1.  parking light 
(when head lights are on) 2.  blinking.  A grey wire should connect 
those lights.  make sure they're not wired into any of your black/colred 
wires down there.

also it seems like a good a good idea  to rule out the turn signal 
switch and a volt/ohmmeter will be necassary. if you don't have one get 
one.  cheap from radio shack.  take off the surn signal switch to where 
you can see all the wires and where they're held down.  the black/white 
wire is the left blinker and the black/green is the right, black/yellow 
is left rear and black/red is right rear .  we know that the left and 
right should act independetly of eachother (other except when flasher 
switch is on).  with the car off test the for continuity between left 
wires and right wires when the switch is flipped on.  try it again  by 
removing those wires from the fuse panel.  if there is than the switch 
is faulty.

see if this gets you anywhere.
