Aren't the german Mann and Mahle filters of much higher quality?  Its my 
understanding they also have a more sophisticated bypass/drainback valve set up.

I used a 72 - 79 bus filter on my new 1600 based full flow system and so far 
it has worked fine with a stock german Mann filter. Should I be concerned 
about its ability to take the pressure?
