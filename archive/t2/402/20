paul,

i've done it (bend metal pipe filled with sand), but never for brake lines.
maybe for making furniture or fixtures.

i guess a 5/16" metal fuel pipe with no flares would be relatively do-able,
but i can't imagine how you'd even get the sand INTO a 3/16" flared brake
line (the world's smallest funnel?, half an hour glass?), let alone getting
it out! 

introducing sand into a hydraulic system on purpose? not a good idea in my
book.
