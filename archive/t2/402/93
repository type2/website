That's not good. Bluing or discoloration means there was a lack of
lubrication and things heated up and you should pay closer attention to them
in future.

The races are supposed to lock into the hub with a press fit. You usually
need a drift or bearing driver to get both in. Getting them out it should be
tough also. Only the bearings should freely rotate in their grease. You can
understand the design: spindle fixed, races in hub fixed, bearings
contacting two surface allowing rotation in one plane of motion.

It will never been as good as unworn...

Funny how it works that way. Once you start fixing it's a long time before
you can stop.
