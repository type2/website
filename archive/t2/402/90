They pulse on and off but the pulse width is so small it appears to be
continuous. All injectors fire at the same time when the engine is running.
It's not obvious when you think about how the engine works but since
L-Jetronic doesn't have a way to find TDC when #1 fires it squirts a little
of the gas each time a cylinder fires.
