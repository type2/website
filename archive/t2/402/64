You forgot to check one critical thing..........ENDPLAY.  This tells you
more about your engine internals than anything.

I just helped a fellow listee and customer put heads on his bus the other
day.  First thing i did, with him present, was to check endplay on his old
motor before i did anything.  It was .029!  That is only .023 past the wear
limit........so, I found thicker shims, got it down to .006 which is the
wear limit, and told him that his motor was shot..........this may have
bought him some time and maybe not ( since right before he dropped the
engine it was pouring oil and overheating) .

Another thing to check is to pull lifters one by one and look at the lobes
on the cam.  This is quite important.  Your cam may be worn out, and it is
not a big deal to split the case and replace the cam.  Once everything is
off the engine, it takes minimal time to tear it down the rest of the way.
