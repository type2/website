I was just looking at prices on the LED lights. They aren't too much more
expensive than new German OEM taillight assemblies for the Bay. I also need
side markers (both sides were taken off by people parking too close at the
University parking lots).

If I could get a prefab mounting plate for the taillights, it would easily be
work $30 per taillight to me. I know the lights would be extra beyond that.
I'd end up spending about $75/taillight but the result would be fantastic
IMHO...
