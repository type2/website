Yes. However I saw these same relays for .89 cents in a Parts Express flyer 
yesterday and the wire is CHEAP.

$10 project for relays and wire. Slightly more with in-line fuses.

www.vanagon.com has alot of info about it in addition to the Type2 website.

It's worth the work I think though. Slightly brighter lights and a no-load 
on the VW headlight switch.

Just depends which is worth more to you - your time to install the $45 
version or your money to recreate the harness (with much more time).
