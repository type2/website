I have done two of these, so I am not a expert but
both mine have worked well.  My current one is in a 75
bay 1 ton delivery van.  My $0.02 cent opinion is to
do it.  I have just bought a digital cam and can take
piccies if you want.  I have also done a T3 engine and
have piccies of that one I can scan.  Mail me if
interested or I can put them on a page somewhere.

See, I plan on doing some loong Kms here in Oz, I also
have carried *lots* of weight.  These run hotter than
in t1 mode.  It is worth heaps in the piece of mind
stakes knowing that any crud smaller than the sieve
holes keeps on rubbing through the engine-if not for
the filter.  IIRC golf deisel (genuine) are meant to
be the good thing as the filter, I just use a z1
replacement

As an interesting idea I have cut open the filter on a
new 6cyl ford engine and it had *heaps*of swarfe and
muck in there.

I am still fine tuning the filter/hose routing to not
touch exhuasts.  Just requires a free day which are a
bit hard to find at the mo.
