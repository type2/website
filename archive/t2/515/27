Richard,

I don't see much off here on anything except that your pressure
plate and flywheel look a little "burned".  Easily fixed with some wet 
400+ grit sandpaper(in wet mode).

I also did *not* see oil on the clutch disk center parts at all.
Did you wipe anything off before you took pics?
Didn't "see" oil on the front side of the pressure plate either.


Flywheel seals are cheap...replace it and go on.  
Pressure plates/disks  are "not" cheap.  I didn't really see
that your disk was "soaked" with oil or anything....I'm wondering if the
pressure plate is just getting worn out?

You know how to test it?

So, have you got "shipfitters disease" or not?  You know..well, golly,
since I had to take this part off to get to that part, I'll just repaint
both of them...ahhh, but if I paint them, then I really should 
paint/replace this other one over here so they match...LOL!

Cheers, dave
