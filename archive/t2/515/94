I would have to agree with Ian, I have owned a 72 Riviera now a chimeric
Westfalia/Riviera beast. (I am more concerned with comfort than
originality).  I can't recall having problems finding parts for this
vehicle.  Local parts shops have had what I need and sometimes I had to goto
VW specialty shops.  The engine I don't think is an issue as far as 1 year
only parts go so I say have at it.
Cheers
