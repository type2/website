For those of you with the slotted screws, try breaking the frozen grip
they have on the tin with vise grips before destroying them with that too
small slotted screwdriver. Their shape makes them very easy to grip,
especially with small vise grips. Then use the correct screwdriver for the
job. You know, the really big one that you've been using as a pry bar.
