Sorry, I think you're wrong, at least regarding the original question.  The
reason Phillips screws are commonly used in fast-paced assembly is that they
*don't* cam out as readily as regular slotted screws.  Sure, the square
drive is even better yet, but that wasn't the question.  Maybe, just maybe,
the regular slotted screw and screwdriver is superior for *removal* if
you've got a straight shot at the screw and a properly-fitting screwdriver -
I'm not sure of the physics of the situation - but if you're forced to come
in at anything other than the perfect straight alignment with your
screwdriver the Phillips is the better bet.

Canadian by the name of Robertson invented a fabulous screw with a square
drive. Henry Ford's assembly was suffering under the agony of the slotted
head screw and wanted to use the Robertson to save time on the assembly line
in the order of a couple of hours. Robertson was a fool and refused to let
Ford manufacture the screw under license so Ford made a deal with Phillips
who invented his screw 28 year after Robertson and the rest is history,
sadly.
