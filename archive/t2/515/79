The Rialta is built by Winnebago on a long wheelbase Eurovan imported
specificly for that purpose.

Winnebago and VW signed an agreement where Winne would do the "regular"
camper conversion on the Eurovan, to be sold in the states. (similar idea
to what we got from Westfalia for our older campers)  The agreement also
set VW up as the source for the chassis for the Winne Rialta RV.

The EV camper is converted by Westfalia for all other markets (Canada,
Europe, etc)

If I recall my history correctly, the EV/Winne camper is now out of
production, though the Rialta continues to be built for the moment.

With the upcoming T5 (?) Eurovan replacing the T4 Eurovan (and the T5 is
/not/ going to be available state-side), Winne is looking for a new
platform for the Rialta..rumor has it to expect it to show up on the
Mercedes/International Harvester van that's running around now.
