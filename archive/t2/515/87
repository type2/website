OR, you could give the stuck screws a paraffin wax treatment before you use
the BIG screwdriver to turn them. I am still amazed at how well the wax
works itself under and into the threads.

I try not to use vice-grips myself, as they could possibly mangle a screw
beyond screwdriver use if not being careful. But sometimes they are the best
tool for the job.

YMMV
