Paul,

I'm coming in on this late and probably don't remember much of the 
of the previous part.

My personal method would be to:

verify that all connections were the correct ones.
*Triple* check the ground wires specifically.
disconnect the wire going up front to the gen/alt light if possible
	and then ohm it out to see if there is a short of any sort
	in it(battery disconnected first)...don't ask how I know!
have someone start it up while you have your meter set to volts
	and see if the value goes up to 13.8v or beyond that.
Look over the circuit for the gen/alt light...it relies
	on *good* positive voltage at the instrument panel
	part that connects with the base of the bulb.

Cheers, dave
