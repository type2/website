Subject: Steering Wheel Repair(formerly  Need a steering wheel)

On a related note,
Does anyone know of an outfit that they would actually recommend for
the repair of late bay steering wheels?  Both of my buses steering
wheels have noticeable cracks in the soft plastic.  I have seen many
an outfit that works on restoring the older and harder, white
plastics from vintage bugs and splitties but have not seen anyone
advertising repair of functional but aesthetically displeasing late
bay steering wheels.
anyone have an idea for here in the U.S.?  Or even somebody in
Canada?  I live in Oregon so I wouldn't think that it would take too
long to mail to someplace like B.C. or Yukon or some such province.
