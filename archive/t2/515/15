Hey thanks Vincent.
I do have that book, I never noticed it there!
That option, although not common here in Australia, I have seen quite a few,
and had a few seats to choose from when I bought the one I have.

Well, I don't know if you call it trouble with road authorities. If it's a
standard option I need to get an engineers approval to the change in seating
capacity, then make the change to the registration with the road
authorities.
If I can't prove that it's original, load tests and a few other things need
to be added to the engineer's approval process to do things officially. The
load testing subjects quite high loads to the seat and mount, much more so
that factory fitted seats need to comply with.

Cheers,
Richard
Brisbane Australia
