Subject: Re: [T2] Engine tin screws

Yes and no. Only the screws that hold the upper tin to the case [4 screws], the bottom cylinder tin to the
case [4 screws], and the lower tin to the heater boxes [2 screws] are cheese-head; but they are 6 x 10. VW
part # is N 010 710 8
All the screws holding tin to tin are 6 x 12 but they are fillister head. Part # N 014 139 5
[There are 2 5mm screws that hold the bottom cylinder tin to the heads]

VW shows all the N 014 139 5 as fitting type I and type IV engines and being slotted. but in real life all the
type IV engines I have taken apart/stripped have phillips head screws. I can always tell when one has been
paled with when it has slotted screws in it.

From The Bus Depot:

The "correct" engine tin screws are cheese-head screws (head is slotted
at the top and not dished at the bottom). We sell these in bags of 100
for $13.95.  (Also bags of 10 for $3.25 if you don't need 100.)
