Subject: Gas Cap

I hate to admit, I was not paying enough attention last week, when some of you
were discussing gas caps.
I like the looks of this big chrome cap, non locking, that has a vertical
ridge running across the face.
I have one, lost another, and need some for just in case....

Where does one get these?

year of bus is 77-78-79.


Kind Regards,
