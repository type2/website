Subject: flywheel seal cont

I took a couple of more photos to clarify some questions folks had.

The clutch disc is pretty glazed:

The flywheel seal is not flush with the case but instead flush with the area
where the chamfer ends:

How is it supposed to be installed?

The endplay was measured between 0.005"-0.006" before I took the flywheel
off. I found 3 shims underneath.
