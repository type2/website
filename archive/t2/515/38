greg makes some good points.

this power increase issue has much more with the exhaust than the induction
system. the biggest limitation on performance of a bus motor is on the
exhaust side, both in terms of restrictive stock exhaust systems and small
exhaust valve sizes.

i have the same heads (021-101-371S, 1.8l FI bus head) on my slightly
modified 2.0l engine, and it is a very robust engine. the only thing needed
to make them work was machining an m10 x1.0 hole to accept the temp sensor
2. on these 1.8 FI heads this hole is in a different place and would require
different tin. easier to more the sensor hole as this is very simple, as the
hole itself is already there, is is used for one of the tin screws.

the mix and match approach can work, or it can backfire. in this case i
would say it will work, but only if you are careful to set the compression
ratio of your combo. this means cc-ing the cylinder head chambers and
measuring deck height, then calculating the resulting compression ratio. the
reason you have to do this is because all heads have a different size
chamber, and the differing sizes will result in different CR, all else being
equal. i am not going to suggest to you or anyone else what CR to use, it is
too loaded a question for the list. i do believe the stock CR is too low, i
will say that much.

good luck,
