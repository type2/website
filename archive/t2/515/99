Subject: Topper Issues...Riviera revisited

Okay, form what I can gather a Westy top will not fit a Riviera van without
cutting the roof...  My options seem to be:

A) Refinish the existing top- Can fiberglass cracks be repaired well?  Any
suggestions?  Fiberglass tape and JB Weld?

B) Locate and purchase a new Riviera top - Anyone know where one might be
for sale?

C)  Add a high-top to the van- Where do I get one of those?

D)  Convert the hole in roof to a skylight window?  I would love to do this,
but fear the process.  Since VW sent the Riviera vans to the US with the
hole pre-cut, where did those panels go?  Could glass be fitted into the
hole?  Maybe with hinges to pop it up?

E) Add a late model pop-top?  One of the small ones (not for camping but
standing? 

Any and all insights from the group appreciated.

Thanks, Nik
