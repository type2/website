Subject: Part needed

List,

I am looking for a hard-to-find part for my '79 westy.

It is the plastic stop which pushes on the sliding door plunger switch
(which turns the dome light on/off), part number 211 947 575A. I have one
from a vanagon in its place, but it doesn't fit very well. P-mail me if you
have one.

Thanks,

Scott Lyons
