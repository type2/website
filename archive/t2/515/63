Greetings,

This is to remind you guys that the Hot VWs Drag Day is only
a month away, Sunday March 21st at the Irwindale Speedway. Gates open at 7am
for a full day of VW activities, including eight classes of drag racing, a
swap area (spots are free with spectator admission), vehicle displays and a
manufacturers midway. The Irwindale Speedway is located at Live Oak and the

Don't miss it!
