I think I bought a set of these beetle injectors on ebay for les than 20
dollars each, but first I made sure they would work in a bus application.
This chart is how I knew the 116 would be fine to use in a bus, it is the
same part! (with a different hose).

I can't comment on the accuracy of the photo. It would not be difficult to
make any of them fit in any application, but the ones with the curved hose
will fit best in a beetle. To use the beetle ones in a bus, simply remove
the curved hose and replace with straight hose of the correct length.

Not sure about that. Logic would say it is.
