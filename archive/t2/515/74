Okay let's start over.

There are at least THREE different trannies used in 72-79 busses.

Here are the basics:
72-73 used a 3-rib 002 with 5.375 final drive and .82 4th gear, 210mm flywheel
74-75 used a 3 or 5-rib 002 with 4.87 final drive and .88 4th gear, 215mm 
flywheel
76-79 used a 6-rib 091 with a 4.56 final drive and .88 4th gear, 228mm flywheel

I haven't quite figured out the whole 74-75 thing though.  The manuals do 
not agree.
I am sure that 75 used a 5-rib tranny which was 4.86 with .88 4th gear.  I 
have one on the shelf in my garage.
I am not sure whether 74 was a 3 or 5 rib so 75 may indeed be one year only
I am sure that at least some 74's came with the 4.87 final drive but not 
sure if they were 3 or 5 rib.  Maybe a midyear change?  Or maybe two 
different trannies.
If you have a '74 tranny with three ribs, I would recommend verifying the 
ratios.

The shape of the ribs, when viewed from the front or rear resembles a pyramid.

Not sure if it is one or two year, but either way it will bolt up to the 72 
motor with no problems.
72-75 are all completely interchangeable, as long as the clutch size 
matches the flywheel size.

Compared to the 72-73 tranny, the 74-75 tranny will be about the same in 
4th gear and 10% taller in 1st-3rd gears.  If you are pulling heavy loads 
the 72-73 tranny might be a better choice, otherwise the 74-75 is generally 
easier to drive around town.

*I* don't think it's the best bet, although it is a slightly better 
transaxle.  There are fitment issues and the ratios may be too tall for 
your bus.  I would stick with an 002 tranny

Then I would recommend staying with an 002 tranny, either one should be fine.
