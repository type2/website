German automotive in Fletcher, NC sells these by the bag of 100.  Great
quality and washers already attached. For a while i have tossed old ones and
used these with just a drop of green loctite and they stay in place and do
not vibrate loose.  I believe they were slot headed.

828-684-0684 is his number.  Seems like around $17 a bag.
