Subject: Couple items for sale

Trying to make some room in the garage. Couple itemsI have moved around 
more than once!!
First a set of black headrests. Molded vinyl. Need to be cleaned ,but no 
holes or tears. I think from a late bay? Look like the ones in my 78 
Westy only they are black. $10.00 for the pair plus shipping.
I also have a set(4)of the artificial raingutters. They were on my westy 
top before removed them filled the holes and painted it. Need a quick 
coat of spray paint,but in good shape. $10.00 for the set plus shipping. 
Last, I am replacing the interior of my 78 Westy with the interior that 
has a fridge and stove instead of a ice box/sink. It is green/yellow 
plaid.  Some of the laminate is damaged in places.  Right now I have the 
rear folding seat ready for pick up. The rest of the cabinets shortly. 
Make me an offer on that stuff. Interested let me know. All located in 
Mystic,CT
