Part number 029 198 075, in the original packaging.  It's a partial kit, 2
cylinders with pistons, a 94mm piston kit for a 2L.  The pistons are in
their original wrappings and have never been used.  There's also an open set
of seals and gaskets, a Victor Reinz gasket set for a 2L 914.

I was told that $100.00 for each cylinder would be acceptable (Thanks,
Richard), but I'm open to offers.  The partial gasket kit goes with the pair
(no cost).

A friend used two of the cylinders on his bus and gave me the other two to
sell.  I'm trying to help offset the cost for my own bus repairs ($1800.00
to go...)
