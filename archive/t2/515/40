.

So, What I understand is that there are two type IV
trannys, 72-5 and 76-9. The difference being the bell
housing and flywheel/clutch assembly. There was also a
commment about my transmission being one year only?
(pyramid shaped. . . Im not sure I understand, as it
looks like a Volkswagen transmission when I look at
it, not a pyramid).  Is the one year only due to the
gearing ratio, thus making it an internal difference
(so it would still work with the 72 motor)? What does
this mean for my bus? Better freeway gas milage? A
higher top speed? Should I make it a point to get one?
Or is the 76-9 transmission the best bet (meaning that
I need to get a flywheel, clutch assembly etc too)

I dont know about anyone else, but at 65 MPH the
extra top on the Rivera starts making its presence
known. There is still plenty of pedal left but I feel
like the had of god is resting on my windshield
telling me to slow down. Even in my 72 weekender with
super hard shocks and new tires I never felt safer
going over 70 for longer then it took to pass.

Thanks for the help
Duncan
