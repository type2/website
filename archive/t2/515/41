Anyone have a spare they are looking to get rid of for the vans?
I think Im going to need one.

Got the van back from the shop with the new panels and slider
for the side door ready to be installed. Tuneup with the new
electric ignition all done. It runs like a champ.

He did say he notices a small sound which he said may be an indicator
of a camshaft bearing problem.  It's slight but should be looked at.
Said that next time I drop the oil out there is a plate I can remove
with a seal and I can actually look up at the camshaft, with a screw
driver see if it moves. If it does.. it's a problem (or chunks of bearing
in the obvious). Checking for this is as easy as he says?

It's a type 4 engine 1700 fi.

He said in the worst case scenario that I can do have the job myself.
Pull the part out and he can do the rest. Save some money on the job
and learn some stuff.

Not sure if Im asking any questions or just typing to hear myself click on
the keyboard.

James
