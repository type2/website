Subject: Re: [T2] Engine tin screws

Type 1 engines use straight slot screws
Type IV engines use phillips head.
The phillips work good if you use a #3. Too many
people use a #2 and round them.
ISP West sells the screws on ebarf sometimes. Their
name is pimppride.... all I see listed right now are
the straight slot screws. I do not see them listed on
their website: http://www.vwispwest.com/welcome.htm

 The originals are the ubiquitous metric phillips
 cheese head style (the worst design). I see several
 people sell kits of shiny slotted engine tin screws.
 I assume the bug and bus screws are the same except
 for a couple of places where length is a concern.
 The part numbers seem to be the same.
