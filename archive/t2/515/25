Subject: flywheel leak diagnosis

The engine came out the previous Sat with Jason Thorpe's help, and this past
Sunday I removed the flywheel to examine my oil leak and slipping clutch. I
expect to see a lot worse but I couldn't tell where the leak was coming from
exactly.

The flywheel seal is an Elring viton seal that was installed in 1989. I
can't tell if the flywheel o-ring was replaced back then but I do know that
it didn't doesn't in the repair invoice.

Would a trained eye mind taking a look and helping with a diagnosis?

After reading a 914 story about an elusive leak and multiple engine drops to
find the true leak I'm a little cautious about rushing the repair just to
get the engine back in.
