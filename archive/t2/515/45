Subject: Re: [T2] idiot guide book for vw's

James:

The John Muir Book,  HOw to keep your VW alive for the Compleat Idiot
was available on line from Amazon 2 years ago when I got mine.  It's
a must have book if you are going to be lying under your Bus, using
tools and looking up into the Engine....

Another is the original VW Shop Manual from Bentley Publishing in
Cambridge MA, also available on line.  I am a newbie (2 year) bus
owner who is just getting mine fixed up to be a daily driver so I can
give my car to my stepkid to drive to College. A list member told me
not to pick up a tooll until I had both of the books.  I extend that
advice to you.

Bentley is the most technical but Muir's offers much as well in
letting you know you CAN fix this car and how easy it is to do it.
And it was updated up to 2 years ago.

I am sure some of the really experienced folks on the ist will answer
your question exactly (I can't) but GO BUY THOSE BOOKS!

Happy Bus-ing,

BEN
