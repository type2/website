You are better off replacing your wheel with one from
a 78 or 79. They are soft rubber, never crack, and
don't get red hot in the sun. They are a direct swap
onto 76 and 77's. I have a couple if you are
interested... a lot cheaper than trying to get yours
patched.

 On a related note,
 Does anyone know of an outfit that they would
 actually recommend for
 the repair of late bay steering wheels?  Both of my
 buses steering
 wheels have noticeable cracks in the soft plastic. 
 I have seen many
 an outfit that works on restoring the older and
 harder, white
 plastics from vintage bugs and splitties but have
 not seen anyone
 advertising repair of functional but aesthetically
 displeasing late
 bay steering wheels.
 anyone have an idea for here in the U.S.?
