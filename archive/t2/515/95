Subject: Re: [T2] '72 Bus-A Year to Avoid?

I have a '72 deluxe 7 seater.  I have had it about for about 4 years.  I
read in some book that the '72 has more rust problems than other years.
Mine has rust problems. I do have a considerable amount of work ahead of me
in rust remediation.  But most other busses in my neighborhood are far worse
than mine, and most are newer.  For some reason, there are many busses in my
neighborhood, something like 10 or more.  I have read on this list that the
'72 is the fastest bus.  I would not be surprised. I believe that I could go
90 mph, if I were really stupid.  I find it hard to believe that it is only
68 hp.  I am still completely stock, dual Solexes (I love them when they are
tuned and working well, but man, are they tough to work with).

There are lots of 1 or 2 year only parts (brakes, shifter coupling, intake
manifolds, ...), but one can "upgrade".  I have not been off the road for
want of unobtainable parts.

I like the T-IV engine, the round bumpers, the disk brakes.

My '72 must have had the nose replaced at some point.  I have the high front
turn signals.
