The slotted cheese head screws are original, and seem to work fine.  I
don't recall any phillips screws in type I engine tin application.

There are a few places where you want to use hex-head bolts instead of the
cheese-head screws, just in case you need to take various screws out when
you cannot get a screwdiver on them.

The places I remember are:

Doghouse tin on front of shroud.
generator tin (lower two screws).
fan shroud on both ends (blocked by DP manifold).
Heat riser covers (one of the screws is blocked by the riser).

I recommend using anti-sieze on the tin screws.  Prevents much cussing
when you have to take them out again.
