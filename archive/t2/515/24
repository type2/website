Forget the rib-counting ;-)
Just go for the tranny number! However, the number you
give here is printed on the side in embossed writing,
this is not the trannynumber. This is the part number.

The Transmissionnumber is stamped(!) on the
driversside of the case. On the place where the bottom
and the side meet each other.

The number can be read as a date, but this only counts
for those tranny's built from august 1971 and later.
The system used before that date remains a mystery to
me. Unfortunately there isn't much info on those old
tranny codes.

Here's an example of the '1971 and later' code:

  CP 21 10 7

CP:       tranny for bus with M251 (= pancake engine)
21 10 7 : manufactured 21st of oktober, 1977

Here's the info I got from microfiche. It is basically
the only info on this subject I ever came accross:
