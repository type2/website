 I am looking for a hard-to-find part for my '79 westy.
It is the plastic stop which pushes on the sliding door plunger switch
(which turns the dome light on/off), part number 211 947 575A. I have one
from a vanagon in its place, but it doesn't fit very well. P-mail me if you have one.

Who mounted a switch on the B pillar on your Westy?

I have never seen one on a Westy, only on buses.
