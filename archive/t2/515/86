Subject: Re: [T2] Steering Wheel Cover

Teri said:  "...after looking at every FLAPS on the planet for something 
that
would fit.

I was at an Autozone in Clinton MD yesterday.  This Autozone had lace on 
steering wheel covers that would fit 16-18" steering wheels.  Price:  $6.95. 
  Normal sized lace on steering wheel covers are $5.95, but much thicker...

I have a similar cover on my '78 for the past 8 years, and it is still like 
new.

Note:  I don't expect that all Autozone would have them.


BTW, please give them my name and insist on a type2 list member's discount.  
The discount code is

1-800-328-7448

BTW again, Autozone web site lists a 20" molded steering wheel cover with 
the Harley Davidson logo on it (their web site).  Can anyone imagine what 
vehicle would be using a 20" steering wheel??  And driven by a Harley 
Davidson owner??  [Sorry, there is a John Deere molded steering wheel logo 
cover, so that's eliminated...]
