Subject: Fuel line conclusion

Thanks, everyone who helped me, for the advice & assistance in regard to my
'74 type IV fuel pump & fuel line questions.

The problem ended up being one of the carb feed hoses coming off the T
junction, so as I had to get the air cleaner etc out if the way just to
reach it, I ended up replacing everything from the fuel pump back while I
was in there. I know it had to be done, I WAS going to do the one hose that
I thought it was (wrong again;^), and get the VW Specialists to go over
everything else when they did the long overdue final service on the new
engine, but there was no point waiting once I'd pulled everything out to get
to them, and had to replace two of the three hoses already. It's nice NOT to
have fuel pumping all over the place when the engine's running, anyway ;^)

Thanks again,

Regards,
