over!) and the heater would never go out or backdraft.  I wonder if the
prohibition on using heaters while travelling is more a CYA move on the
manufacturers' part than a functional requirement.

I'm not at all familiar with these units so this is pure conjecture; but 
couldn't
a triple pipe exhaust system be made up to shield the exhaust but still allow
air flow. Or again, an "induced draft" flue or lightly sprung flapper 
valve... I
tend to agree with the CYA , though, if even steam irons can come with warn-
ing tags that say "Remove clothing before ironing" ...
