Subject: very frustrating electrical problem

Hello peers,
My 77 FI 2.o Westy is acting up. Last summer i pulled the motor and put on 
new heads, everything works fine. Now, i am having the problem that my bus 
will not start after it has been on and off a few times that day. For 
example, i get up in the morning, drive to work, no problem. all accesories 
work, lights don't do the alternator dimming thing, bus feels very solid. i 
turn it off. later come out, drive it to the grocery store, turn it off, 
things are just fine. then, start it, go to the auto parts store, buy some 
filters, and then i come back out it won't start. just slowly turns over, 
whuh whuh. it is always the 4-6th start of the day when it will no longer 
fire up. starter is less than 2 years old, battery is huge mercedes diesel 
batt- less than 2 years old and alternator is 3 years old. what the heck is 
going on? voltmeter on batt reads just over 12 and the elec system seems to 
be charging proper. is it the cold temp outside (35-45 degrees)? is the 
battery possibly faulty? what should i try?
Thanks for any advice!
-jeremy
