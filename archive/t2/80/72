Autozone will lend out tools for freezies if you buy parts from them.  I 
was suprised at the selection of tools they had, too.  One important one 
for us bus-owners is the pilot bearing removal tool (slap-hammer style 
thing).  Maybe they got tired of the people doing the buy-useonce-return thing?

As for a valve spring compressor, do get the C-clamp type not the 
thumbscrew type.  I seem to remember getting mine from Sears for a 
reasonable price, and I've ended up using it several times, not to mention 
the times I've loaned it out.
