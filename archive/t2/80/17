Long metal file. File both pipe surfaces on one side simultaneously. File 
until both pipes have shiny surfaces all the way around the opening. In 
addition to twisting and warping - my pipes seemed to have uneven surfaces 
as well.

Takes 20 minutes per side (at least with my old file), I used a cutting 
fluid like used on a drill bit I think.

It is best done with the heater box or pipe in a vise.
