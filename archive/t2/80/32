Subject: Mystery wire

My poor 72 Rivi came with a surfeit of dangling wires.  I spent the better
part of a day straightening everything out per the wiring diagram.  I did
pretty good for a colorblind guy, but there's a couple I haven't got
figured.

Out of the ignition switch bundle comes a blue and green (or blue and brown
or blue and red) wire that does not go to the multi connector whither the
others go, but stays separate and ends in a female spade connector.  It does
not show current with the switch either off or in any on position, with the
motor running with the lights on, or with the signal arm pulled in either
direction.  I can't find it on the diagram.  What the heck is it?

Other question: do all brown wires with white stripe go to ground?  I have
one coming up from the corner by the fuse box.  No current running through
it.

Regards,

Grant
