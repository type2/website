Subject: Good books - good resources for you


I recommend the Carroll Smith books, Tune to win, Prepare to Win, Engineer
to Win, etc  Outstanding references for DIY folks like us.  Well written
and practical.  Some is only applicable to race cars but much is about
doing things logically and safely.

For the SB Chev the Grumpy Jenkins book The Chevrolet Racing Engine is the
bible IMHOP
