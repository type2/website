The lower hose is the easy one - I'll suggest that you do it with the 
engine out but it can be done with some cussing with the firewall out. 
Disconnect and remove the battery (batteries). No sparks desired with open 
gas tanks. Aircooled drivers and aircooled busses are in short supply 
already...

The hose material can be obtained from a marine supplier (who sells boats 
there locally?), a diesel repair shop, or NAPA (or the equivalent 
professional parts store).

There are plenty of cooling hoses that will fit but I suggest you buy hose 
rated for fuel.

Seems like mine only required about a 20 degree bend and I was able to fit 
a straight hose with a slight bend in it. I added hose clamps (I don't 
think mine had clamps originally).

While you are at it replace ALL of the vent hoses and fuel hoses, they are 
easy to get to right now. It probably needs it anyway...
