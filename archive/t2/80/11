To fix, release parking brake and, using a punch, whack away at the drums
through the inspection slots in the backing plate.  Whack on both shoes
with the punch up against the metal shoe surface.

To avoid in the future, never use your emergency brake to park when it is
wet out.  If you must park on a slant that the transmission won't hold,
use the E-brake to hold the car long enough to find a couple of handy
rocks to put behind the wheels, then release the E-brake.
