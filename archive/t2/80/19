I don't know about all the states, but State parks seem to be a good bet.
Anywhere from $10-20 a night. Most have showers and electric and are
safe.
        I live in NC and the parks are $12 a night. Most in NC don't have
electric though. They do have showers and most lock the gates at night
(sometimes good, sometimes bad). I am almost positive that all the NC
state parks have Rangers living in the parks, so this is added security.
        One last thought, AAA offers a camping / campsite directory. The
directory lists the campsites, costs, and amenities. I really don't know
what it is called but if you contact a AAA Motor club office they can
help.
Best of luck,
Jim
