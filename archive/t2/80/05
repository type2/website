I would guess that some are, but that there are other reasons such as 
advances in distributor design, changing emissions requirements, changing 
fuel-economy requirements, etc. that might also have been responsible for a 
distributor change.

Yup - and I doubt any of us know the complete answer to that one.

Knowledge is power, and without the collective knowledge of this list, most 
people just don't know any better.  I certainly didn't - I fell for the 
"009 upgrade" story back in the eighties and bought one new, then spent a 
few months scratching my head trying everything under the sun to get the 
bus to run well.  I finally removed it and put the stocker back in, and all 
of the problems went away!  It was in a box in my garage for a few years 
until I sold it to Steve Maher (the guy with the Vanagon with the Chevy V-6 
in it - anyone remember?) for use in an older type1.  It was still shiny 
when I sold it.
