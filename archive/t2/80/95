It makes one wonder, though.  When parked, the vehicle is subjected to
winds from any direction.  In my old trailer, we would camp in the desert
with gusty winds of 50MPH (considering whether the trailer would blow
over!) and the heater would never go out or backdraft.  I wonder if the
prohibition on using heaters while travelling is more a CYA move on the
manufacturers' part than a functional requirement.
