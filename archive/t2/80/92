To Theo & "The List At Large"

While I cannot offer immediate relief, don't despair, a high-quality 
reproduction of this item is to debut soon later in 2002.  I have been working 
with the "volks" in the biz on this as well as a few other "Bus Goodies" for 
both the Vintage and Bay Window "volks" to appear soon on the market.  Other 
than finding a good used one (such as from BustedBus.com), I'd say to the rest 
to hang on until the new ones arrive.  68-71 as well as 72-79 hoses are just 
starting into the prototyping stage now.

Is Old Volks Home getting back into the parts game?  Not exactly, but I've been 
approached to re-activate my window rubber tooling to be marketed through a 
third-party - strictly in the "thinking cap" stage.  But ya never know.

I'll keep you posted :-)
