Subject: heating project?

i've briefly trolled the archives about this before, but never saw a
definitive answer...

is thre anyone out there who has made a propane heater setup in the same
way the ebersbachers were, ie, a heater stashed away outta sight, which
vents exhaust OUTSIDE the bus, and heats air that is in a separate circuit?
i know you could mebbee modify an ebersbacher for propane, but it would be
WORK - new ignition system, new fuel control, new safety interliks, etcetc.
easier to take an existing propane setup and modify it for remote operaion
i bet.

if i HAD 2K, i'd buy that nifty truck/bus heater recently discussed here!
