Subject: Unidentified old gas heater(I think)

I found an old contraption in my garage tonight that was in my 71 when I
bought it three years ago, along with a mercedes transmission.  I had
completely forgotton about it.  I am wondering what it is.  label is half
shot, but this is what I got off of it:

ZVW 256-103
Volks____ of America (I figured that one out :)
A____NER Corporation, Indiana
6 volt

It has a sliding lever marked  "AIR open/close" and has alot of wires,
hoses, etc still attached.  I've never seen a gas heater up close, but I'm
guessing that what it is.  Anyone know?
Thanks
