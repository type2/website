Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust leaks


     I had a similar problem with my 78' rebuild. The flanges for the
heater boxes,manifolds, and elbows were all rusted and warped and thin. I
took a grinder to the flanges, got them nice and shiny, then carefully
welded (mig) beads of metal to all 3 sides of the flanges. After it cooled
I took the grinder again and ground down the welds to make them flat, now I
had more metal to seal with. I also used a straight edge and a file and
carefully got every flange straight. I suppose you could drop some $$ and
replace all those pieces wiht new or good used ones but when I looked that
stuff (in good shape) was as rare as hens teeth. A friend of mine who is an
excellent welder and builder of bike frames has been considering getting
stainless steel tubing and manufacturing these components for himself and
possibly for resale to other bus people. The problem is that 'most' bus
people would not be willing to drop $800.00 on an exhuast system...

Hello,
I am trying to close up some exhaust leaks on my 78 westy (California,
cat under rear bumper). All parts (except motor, AVP rebuild) are
original w/125k miles. A few months back I replaced the motor and in
doing so unassembled, cleaned up and reassembled heater box/exhaust
system. I now have some leaks. I know I will have to take apart and work
to flatten and square all the parts to each other. The problem is that I
did this when I put it back together (not as well as I could have,
admittedly) the first time. I will do this again, and work harder to get
it right, but it sure would be nice if there was a product or procedure
to help when the surfaces just don't mate quite right. Is there such a
thing?

Thanks to all!

Kindest Regards,
Chris
78 Westy, the Troublemaker
