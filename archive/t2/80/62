Bryan,

While the rubber may appear to be in good condition, it is oxidized, and
this is what happens to old rubber-----the paint will streak black from
the mouldings, unless you replace them.

No other solution known----

Later,

E-mail message From Bryan=A0Kirschenman

I live in central calif and with all of the fog the moisture runs over
my window rubber creating black streaks down the sides of my bus. Has
anyone had this problem? If so can this process be stopped? The rubber
is in good shape with no cracks. 
Thanks,
