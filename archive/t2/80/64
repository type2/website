If you are cleaning the windows with Windex or the such, this is normal.

I recall this black streaking and the black coming off onto the cleaning 
rag always happening way back in 1968 when I would clean my bug windows.

Today when I clean my bus windows, I always have a mental flashback to my 
college days, recalling instances of where and when I did detail cleaning 
on my old bug back then.
