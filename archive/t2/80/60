I have always had the same problem, particularly when cleaning the front 
windshield.  Black from the seal smears and gets on the white paint around 
the window - it's very hard to get completely clean.  I just assumed it was 
the quality of the rubber in the seal that was the problem although it's 
done this with two different seals from two different vendors.  I would be 
interested in whether others have had this problem.
