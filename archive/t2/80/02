Subject: starting issues.... part two

Hello again,

Thanks to all that helped with my CV/axle questions, the new one is in and
the process went smoothly...

back to the starting issues though (when it rains.....)

I got a battery charger, and the battery is plenty full of juice. Once it
was ready, I fired it right up on the first try. We'll see if it recharges,
or if it just runs dead again. After finally getting all of this taken care
of and figured out late saturday night, I let it sit till this morning when
I needed to go to work.

Wouldn't you know, now it won't fire. =(

It'll turn and turn and turn some more, but nada. Checked plug connections,
vaccuum connections, there is gas, i have oil pressure as well as a proper
amount of oil, but nothing. I just cannot get it to fire suddenly. I have
never had this problem with this bus thus far, and only after charging the
battery as well as starting it up and driving it around the block (after
replacing the CV/axle) - NOW it won't fire.

I really am stumped now, mostly because I can't figure what could have gone
wrong sitting there in the driveway from the last time I checked it, to now.
In fact the only thing that has been touched on it since saturday evening
when I checked it out was that I threw the charger on the second deep cycle
battery just so it was full as well. I guess I should run and get some plugs
maybe, maybe some points and work on all that when I get home, but the westy
really is starting to complain. Ive had this bus since March of last year
roughly and now it suddenly decided to start being a brat.

any tips/suggestions appreciatted....
