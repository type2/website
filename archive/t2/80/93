Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch slowly going- WHY?

Classic symptom of the cable breaking.  You are probably down to just a
few strands.  Replace it _now_ before it breaks and you lose the adjusting
nut.  Lube the new cable generously as it goes in, and take the
opportunity to disassemble and lube the clutch pedal pivot.
