Subject: Re: [T2] very frustrating electrical problem


Jim,
Dash light does work (comes on at startup), is not on or flickering during 
driving, and is very very faint when the signals are flashing (maybe 
spillover from other bulb). I was thinking of putting in a different battery 
and trying it, perhaps the one i have was on the shelf for a while at the 
shop i bought it from!
