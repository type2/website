Subject: Re: [T2] '72-'74 exhaust in '77 update

Fix it soon - I pulled several studs out b/c I overtorqued the nuts. It 
doesn't take much.

If nothing else get some HVAC ductwork hanging straps from the local 
hardware store and tie it up to the frame.

I had to fix my pulled studs with Chevy exhaust studs (worked well) but I 
would suggest it very loudly - very scary thinking I might drill too far or 
be off center or???

Congrats on the new exhaust.
