Vee Parts is located here in San Diego.  I've made only about a half =
dozen purchases from them
but I've never ordered online so I can't comment there.  I know the site =
is pretty new.  As for in-
store purchases, I recall them being fairly well stocked and pretty =
knowledgeable.  I don't recall
 them being too expensive but, as always, BusDepot has better prices, at =
least better than Vee's=20
in-store prices.

btw - do I have to add the "pon" in type2's address.  ie - =
type2(-at-)pon.type2.com?
or can I just do type2(-at-)type2.com?
