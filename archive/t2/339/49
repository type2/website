I've already had one offer for this one.  I don't know which it is, US or
CA, but will get ID number(s) after I attempt to get it out of the bus.

Other offers, Anyone?

I'm also a bit embarrassed that I didn't look in my Haynes, to start with.
There's a really nice picture, several actually, of the EFI Controller with
labels and everything... [hides under bus in shame]

I'll pull it either today or tonight.
