Subject: Everybus anyone from Charleston, Myrtle Beach or vicinity????

Hey Folks,
Just wondering if anyone is going to the everybus from
the Charleston, area. I have a friend who lives in
Myrtle beach and she needs a ride. I live in Clemson
SC and would rather not have to drive all the way down
there and then back up to NC. Let me know if you can
help out or know someone who can. I'll buy you a beer.

Thanks,
Giles,
