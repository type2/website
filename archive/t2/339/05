Mark- No Problem !!!  Just use the oem Vernacular !!!
Remove the upper cylinder tin and all 8 head nuts.
The washers will shake out when the head is off.
Under the cylinders is a small piece of tin with a
tiny ( 5mm ) slot-head screw which will allow you
to bend the tin down when it is removed.
The machinist will be happy to see that one, too:)
