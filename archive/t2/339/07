My only major breakdown was in Montana.  Bozeman has a couple of quite 
capable repair shops.

I had a valve seat start going bad. I made it back to Iowa from Colorado. I 
poked my head under the bus in Kearney, NE to find that I had broken a shock 
and torn a CV boot.  Limped it home and parked it.

You also say
"Can't really afford it tho, but if it
helps me enjoy the van, I may have to........"

Do you need your van? or are your trips primarily for leisure?  Why not take 
one less trip and use the gas money to pay for some PM? Or at least, set 
aside some cash for an on the road problem?

If a person can make it to civilization, things generally work out ok. 
Rural areas are less forboding, at least to me.  I spent a day in the Target 
parking lot at the Bozeman, MT trying to figure out what was wrong with my 
FI system.  I rode my bike into town, talked to a shop, and found out it was 
just my temp sensor.  I rode out the van, put it back together, shorted out 
the sensor, and drove to another shop in town that had the sensor in stock. 
Installed the sensor, and kept driving to Seattle.

In a city, like Boston, this wouldn't have happened. My van would be stuck 
in some very expensive impound lot.

If you fix your van on your own, and a head is something you'd forsee doing, 
you can fix it on the road. If you can't do it yourself, then it doesn't 
particulary matter that you had to pay someone on the road to do it.  Parts 
are 3 days to anywhere with UPS.  Why worry about it?
