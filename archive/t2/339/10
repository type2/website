Subject: Re: exhaust stud dilemma

Mark,
    I've replaced broken exhaust studs, on a '77, with the engine and
head in place.  The exhaust has to come off that side of the engine in
either case.  Then carefully and accurately center punch the broken
stud.  Then drill up the middle of the stud with successively larger
drill bit sizes until all that's left is the remnants of the stud that
are in the threads of the head.  Then use a small scribe and a tap to
clean out the threads.  Then you screw in a new stud and reinstall the
exhaust.
