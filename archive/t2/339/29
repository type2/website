Subject: engine problems

If you recall we started that heated head gasket strand about our '78 
bus.  We had the head gasket replaced but then the bus ran terribly. 
 Our regular mechanic says that when we had the head gasket done it 
caused the compression to go up which caused it to suck in a valve seat. 
 So we have a bad valve on the number one cylinder.  His solution is to 
get a rebuilt engine, the thinking being along the line that if we 
replace any more parts it will just cause other parts to go bad.  We can 
not afford a new engine so I am considering dropping the engine myself 
and and slapping a new or used cylinder head on to keep it going.  Any 
advise?  Does anyone have a good cylinder head?
