Well, I have two children and yes, the worry factor goes up.  Luckily, the
bus provides lots of room to plan for those eventualities.  Sleeping bags,
canned food, etc. will keep them happy while I tackle the problem.
Children are more resiliant than I am!

OTOH, it's also a long wait for the children while a "modern" vehicle
awaits its turn with the dealer mechanic.
