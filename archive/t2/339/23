I had several headstuds pull (PO overtorqued them - if 15 lbs is good then 
75 lbs must be better - right?) and I had to redrill them to install larger 
studs (aka small block Chevy studs - <grin>!).

Be sure you don't go too far. There are some cheap little metal rings that 
you can buy that ride on the bit and limit how deep you can drill. I did 
not use them but I was lucky.
