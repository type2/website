Subject: OIL TEMPERATURE GUAGE

Oh! I forgot. The guy who I am purchasing this 73 Volkswagen Van from said
that he recommends getting an Oil Temperature Gauge. He said that
(obviously) these older vans are air cooled and that you determine the
temperature of the motor by the temperature of the oil. With this in mind,
did the van originally come with an oil temperature gauge? If not, where is
the best place to buy one from that will work well with this 1.8 engine? 

 

 

 

Thanks,
