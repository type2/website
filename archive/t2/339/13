Subject: Re: [T2] Battery tray installation 

Hello, 

I have replaced the battery tray on my bus as well as
the rear bottom corners of the bus. I guess my only
suggestion is to make sure that ALL of the old tray is
removed. I tried to leave a small "ridge" of of the
old tray because it was still welded on the corner. I
couldn't do it. I had to use the grinder to grind off
all the remaining metal and welds that were left from
the tray. Make sure to grind all of the remaining
metal from the inside corners as well. It may require
taping the edges of the new tray in a bit with a
hammer so it will fit, especially if there are any
ripples in the ridge of the new tray.

I found it difficult to maneuver the tray into
position as well. I had to make some slits in a few
places and I had to grind some places down to get the
tray to set in place. It is doable. Good Luck!
