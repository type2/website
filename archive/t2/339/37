Subject: type1 cooling tin for type2 bus

Dear type2'ers,
does anybody know of a vendor in the US for the cooling tin needed to
install a type1 engine into a '74 type2 bus? I know that in Germany
conversions like that were not uncommon, but here in the US late
baywindows were officially never sold that way. I am trying to help a friend
who is working on a '74 bus with a type 1 beetle engine in it but without any
cooling tin installed. Obviously this setup is not prone to any longevity....


Thanks
