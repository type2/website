PM is cheaper than a tow job in the long run (time + money).

Every little problem you overcome will better prepare you for the big 
problems. Why? For one you'll know where all the pieces are and how they 
work together. If it has received attention you'll be familiar with it's 
history. If something happens more than once or twice you might see a 
pattern and realize something else is really causing the problem - i.e. the 
worn wheel bearing is allowing the axle to move around and ruin the seal.

If you have to R & R a head on the road and you've had a head off on this 
type engine, you'll know what everything looks like, what tools are 
required, where everything is , how to assemble and disassemble, etc. 
Experience is the key.
