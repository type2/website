Subject: rear apron, engine tin

hey all,

i just picked up a 64 standard.
the PO had played around with a 4 cyl (chevy) watercooled powerplant.
it's up to me to pull it and replace it with something (VW)...

my problem is, i'm missing tin and the rear apron. i think i have an 
engine lined up, but it's currently in a beetle. what's the difference in 
tin? do you think i'll have trouble finding a rear apron? how much should 
i expect to pay? any leads?

thanks for you help,
-matthew
