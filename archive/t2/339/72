Should work better.  Better still with liquid nitrogen.  The key is to
cool _only_ the stud, which is easier done with the stud protruding.

Anything you can do to expand the head and shrink the stud will help
loosen it.  You are working with microscopic expansions, but sometimes
this is all you need.
