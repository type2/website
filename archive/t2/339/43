We have one of each for sale, we are in Buffalo NY so if you want you can 
pickup or pay to truck it, we may even be able to deliver depending on where 
you are. Tranny's: 72 bus standard and 78 bus standard, both are in good 
shape and dont skip out of gear, grind or anything horrible. Also have used 
78 engine. Make a reasonable offer if interested.
