Subject: Rod bearing play

Hi Volks,

Last night was "Franklin Night" with the Potts Bros, we try to get 
together weekly with Dad to work on his 75 Westy, "Franklin". So far 
this winter the work has been progressing well, we have the interior 
removed, the backing plates replaced, the 1.8L FI engine is out and the 
heads have been removed and are soon to be sent out for service. Pretty 
soon we can start putting things together.

However...

Last night we were scraping crud off the engine case when we noticed 
that there was some play in the rod bearings. Each of the the pistons 
will swing about 2-3 mm of arc in the direction of  the crank. It also 
slides fore-and-aft on the cam bearing slightly, but what concerns me 
is the rotation.

Is it time for a teardown and bottom-end rebuild, or is this within 
spec? Will I also want/need new pistons and cylinders?  Is this the 
perfect time to upsize the engine to 2 litres?

We were hoping to have this done before BusFusion, but at this rate we 
might be towing it to Buses Of The Corn. Sigh.

Happy trails,
