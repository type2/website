My neighbor took his girl friend and her son to Florida for vacation
last year in his 4/5 year old Honda...Transmission went further
south on a Friday afternoon...He called around for service and 
described the symptoms to a couple three places to get some
idea of cost...One place was about two hundred bucks above the
others. He asked the guy about the price and the reply was -
"Yeah, but we're open tomorrow..."
