Subject: 1973 Volkswagen Bus.

Todd,

go for it.


Almost everyone will agree that RUST and rust damage is the deciding factor 
in bus purchase.

The interior can be scrounged from some donor bus along the way, the 
mechanics can be fixed.

Hey, you could attend some casual bus gatherings and get tons of ideas on 
interiors.

At a small VW show in Pennsylvania, I saw a reconstructed hippie bus.  The 
girls did the whole insides in a feminine hippie motif, limited by only the 
girls' / your friend's imagination.  No seats, just pillows and bean bags 
and lava lamps and heart shaped pillow and black light . . .

You can cut panels and attach them to the sides of the bus, and cover them 
with teddy bear fabric..

I do not recommend trying to go back to the '73 interior.  No way.  enjoy 
the bus and do not try to create another stock 'original' bus.  You have the 
rights and privileges and my permission to do whatever your friend wishes.

On the mechanics, this is just my personal opinion:  don't worry about the 
rust on the cylinders.

Of course, you will want to change the oil since it is expected to 
accumulate some moisture in the oil from sitting.  But since it has NOT been 
sitting outside, I would guess (but not chance it) that the oil was fine.


People say to work on the brakes before driving.  Yes, have a look at the 
brake system, and replace/rebuild as necessary.  But three years is not 
excessive for brakes (again, particularly sitting in a garage for most the 
whole time).


If the price was right ($500) and it started, I would flash the PO the money 
and drive it (slowly) home.

If the price was a little high ($1500), I would check it out pretty closely.

If the price was excessive ($5000), I would look for a later or earlier 
camper.  Earlier = 1971, later = 1978.

Great to hear from you
