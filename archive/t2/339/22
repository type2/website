And don't forget, the 12Volt source for the backup lights comes from the 12V
side of the coil, right? There should be a wire and connector that comes
from the gearbox into the engine compartment on the left side in the
proximity of the coil (at least on my '71). Once I hooked this up correctly
I was able to trace the problem to bulbs, dirty sockets, etc.
