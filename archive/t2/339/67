And is likely the exact same stuff.  Often a mix of horse and pig, if I
recall what some of my suppliers told me a few years ago.

Sure would.  Be sure to pack it tightly..if you don't do it while your
stuffing it'll happen when you're sitting on it. :)

It would also be a good idea to wrap your seat frames/springs in burlap or
such to help hold the hair together and keep it from falling through.

Personally, I prefer a nice 80 or so pound foam. :)
