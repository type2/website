Please note that Chris says "directly" into the exhaust port.

If the cooler air has to travel up the whole length of the exhaust...then
it's a different deal.

Also, Chris, is there a cam position where both exhaust and intake valves
are open at the same time?....did some thinking on the hot valve vs. cold 
air stuff some time ago and couldn't decide if it was an urban(vw) myth
or not.

Cheers, dave
