Get rid of your mechanic. I doubt his abilities based only on what you've 
written. Rebuild the head. Use someone who does alot of VW work or at least 
aircooled engines work. If you can afford it R&R both heads. New valves, 
guides, measure everything, new gaskets.

If the rest of the engines is poor rebuild it. It's an adventure...

Good time to repaint, clean, and replace anything rubber.
