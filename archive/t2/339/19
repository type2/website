Subject: Re: [T2] inside slider handle

> when looking at that late bay at the modesto, ca pick
 n pull today i noticed that it had 2 inside slider
 handles, can i assume the rear one is for opening the
 door from the inside and the other normal on is for
 closing.  btw, both handles are in excellent condition
 if someone wants to run down and get them.

No, the rear one is a helper handle ONLY. It does not move at all.
The front one does all the work with the latches. The rear one is just there to give you something to pull on
when closing the door.
