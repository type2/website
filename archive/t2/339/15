Subject: Exhaust Stud Dilemma

I struggled with this for awhile one time. I pulled the heater box, tubes
and tin off and jacked the bus up and sprayed lubricant on the broken stud
every 20 minutes for along time. I drove it for about a month with no
exhaust (you can see hot gases shooting out and onto the ground from the
head as you drive) pretty dumb move. Anyway I took it to an exhaust place
and they put it on the lift and used torches to make it worse. Took it back
home - the only real solution was to spray, spray spray, heat with torch,
lock vice grips on stud as tight as possible, spray, torch, try to twist
vice grips back and forth gently, keep working it. This is easier to do with
the engine out and resting on it's flywheel (drain oil first). I had better
luck leaving the head bolted onto the motor in all cases, as this holds it
steady and acts as a vice. Ultimately it will either come out or break off,
hope for a clean break at the boss then drill out the old stud remnents and
chase new threads and buy the step stud oversize replacements (I think 8mm
by 9mm x ??long).
