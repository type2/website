Subject: exhaust stud dilemma 

That's right folks, I broke one of the rear studs while removing the 
driver's side exhaust manifold on my 75 bus. Disappointing indeed. 
After much archive research and a few phone calls, armed with Muir's 
book and a socket set, I spent the afternoon attempting to remove the 
cylinder head- no luck. It seemed from others' posts that I should be 
able to remove it without dropping the engine. I got the rocker-arms 
and push rods out easily enough, but the head absolutely will not budge.

So, this is a cry for help. Can anyone suggest something I would have 
missed? My specific maintenance experience is mostly limited to Vespa 
scooters...my goal is to get the head off in order to deal with the 
broken stud, but this one has me baffled.

TIA,
