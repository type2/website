Subject: Patience is a Volkswagen

after contemplating names for about a year, sweet talking and even
begging the bus, her name has finally come to me (and that it IS a girl,
too)... good names that sounded right had come to me before, only to fly
away as quickly as they come... but yesterday (couldnt post this as my PC
was at the shop) i was drivin along, on my way to my NEW real job (long
story), when quite blissfully this thought popped into my head...
"Patience is a Volkswagen"... and that is when it hit me... my bus' name
is Patience... she wouldnt tell me her name til i learned patience... she
is teaching me patience in my driving... so you see, it really is quite
the perfect name for her, and i havent forgotten it, either, and that is
why i think that is definitely her name.... as i had forgotten the few
other good ones i had thought of...

waving with a blissful grin,
