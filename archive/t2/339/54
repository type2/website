Hi Mike,

<snicker>
This will work, but it will be messy, and it may release fluorocarbons 
into the environment. Follow these instructions at your own risk.

Puncture the can with a sharp stick. Once the contents are no longer 
under pressure the soft metal of the can will be a lot easier to 
compress. Now use a blunt stick to smash the can flat until the 
diameter is reduced enough to get the door open.

Your bus is gonna smell lemon-fresh for MONTHS!!!  ;^)

Happy trails,
