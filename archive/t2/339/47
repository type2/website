Thanks, Vanagon man!
I'm glad to hear it's an easy fix!
Now, let me ask this..
Is this something that could be installed AFTER the engine is in, and if so,
would it be reasonably easy to do?
Also (since I don't know this engine), where are these flaps and what do
they do?
I live in a fairly warm or temperate climate, so are they necessary for all
climates?
This bus will probably be a workhorse and daily driver, with the engine and
tranny to be rebuilt at some point or otherwise deemed suitable to put into
a Westfalia camper for trips.. But that will be far into the future, I
suspect.
