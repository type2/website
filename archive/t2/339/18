Subject: inside slider handle

when looking at that late bay at the modesto, ca pick
n pull today i noticed that it had 2 inside slider
handles, can i assume the rear one is for opening the
door from the inside and the other normal on is for
closing.  btw, both handles are in excellent condition
if someone wants to run down and get them.
