Subject: Battery tray installation 

Hi.

I'm installing a new right battery tray in my '74 westy and
I'm having a really tough time getting it in. It looks like
it will fit but getting the right angle to install it is
just not happening for me.

Anyone have any tricks for getting it done?

Thanks!

--Stephen
