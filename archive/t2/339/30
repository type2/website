Subject: RE: [T2] Re: exhaust stud dilemma

One trick I have learned is heat the head with a propane torch, then ice the
stud.  Did this over the course of a day, and finally, the stud made a
little crack noise, and basically threaded right out!  PATIENCE is the word
here.  Beats a day of pulling the motor and head.

Good Luck!
