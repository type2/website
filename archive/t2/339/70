Yes, the beetle Bentley (which you should have, if you own a Thing) shows
the (very simple) tooling, used with a hydraulic press, to remove and install
ball joints from the torsion arms.  I'm sorry, but I have no means of sending
you these images (electronically).

Hydraulic floor presses of 12 and 20 ton capacities are available remarkably
cheaply from Harbor Freight--watch for sales, they are on sale about half 
the time.
They also sell a 3/4" drive metric large socket set, which is very useful as
mandrels for the press, along with their more customary use.  Once you have
these tools, it becomes very hard to comprehend why you jerked around without
them for so many years.

The VW tool for disconnecting the ball joints from the steering knuckle is
faithfully, and inexpensively, reproduced by the aftermarket.  See JC Whipme!,
RMMW, Bus Depot, etc.
