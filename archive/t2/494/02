Hey Tom. Keyless entry would be a cool addition. I was thinking about 
installing a PC as the entertainment system: mp3/CD audio connected to the 
sound system, DVD player connected to a TV. Maybe add a wireless network card 
for those occasions when I encounter a wireless "hot spot" on the road. Also 
thought about putting in a webcam (rear view).

A few issues that still need to be resolved:
- How to send the PC display to a laptop screen in the dash. Maybe a 
touch-screen panel?
- Where to put the IO interfaces (keyboard, mouse/trackball)?
- How to power the system when the bus isn't running (having to shut the 
system down every time the bus is off would become annoying after a while)? 
Perhaps extra batteries and solar panels on the roof?
- How to keep the electronics cool in the summer?
