Subject: Re: [T2] painting the tin (color other than black)

Mike,
Remember this--
Black aborsbs heat--
Light color's reflect it--

Now which way do you want to go with the engine tin ?

Mine was black from new--
I don't know what's right and wrong in this situation--

I honestly don't think it makes any difference--

Later,

Terry

I've heard that painting the tin black helps to keep the heat down. It
might seem petty, but the black paint that I used is matte black and I
don't like the finish. The grey that I have is nice and glossy. 
I'm using the rust-o-leum high-temp paint so there isn't much choice as
far as finish goes. 
My question: will there be a noticable difference in temperature if I
paint my tin grey instead of black on my t4 engine? I'd rather have it
grey anyways.. brighten things up a bit. 
thanks,
Mike
