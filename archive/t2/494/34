Yep, I'mm 99.99999999999999999999999 % certain it's the valve cover

I'd really rather not mess with the one that's  not leaking.

Of this I'm 110 % percent sure.  Both surfaces are smooth and shiney
and have been checked visually as well as given the "feel" test.

In over 20 years of bus ownership I've never used glue or sealant on a
valve cover, I don't want to start now.  The passenger side gasket is
the original the engine came with 12 months ago.  I've tried 2 new
ones on the leaky side to no availe.

Thanks to everyone who responded.  I'll be getting back to this
problem shortly after the New Year holiday season.  Until then the bus
is parked in the driveway.
