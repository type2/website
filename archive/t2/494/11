Subject: Fan seal oil leak/blowby question?

Hi All:

Has anyone experienced bylowby/oil leak at the fan hub seal duw to
crankcase pressure?

History:
- I am in the middle of breaking in my new 2.0L type IV engine. Already
ran it for 20 minutes at 2000 rpm. No oil leaks after 20 minutes!
- I have the case vent hose plugged (to the air box) to avoid any air
leaks from the case PVC fitting (since it does not seem to seal that
well) while trying to initially get the van to run, idle etc. I left the
PVC vent  installed, but venting to the atmosphere.
- I performed some of the accelerate/decelerate cycles specified by
Wilson to help seal/break-in the rings. After 5 miles I stopped and
noticed that I was leaking some oil out the fan side of the engine.

I was wondering if with the new rings not broken in, and with the case
not under vacuum or venting freely to the atmosphere, that maybe the
case was pressurized and was causing the fan seal to leak. Or can it
take time for the seal to start leaking?

Any thoughts from the experts on new engines?

TIA
