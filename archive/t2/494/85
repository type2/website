Subject: Shiftrod woes

Hi Folks,
I'm replacing my transaxle, and wanted to fix the slop in the shifter.  I 
pulled the rear shift rod out and both the front and rear nylon bushing 
seems to be in decent shape.  When I pulled the front shift rod out, guide 
pin moves around.  Is this suppose to be?  It also looks as if the guide 
sleeve is worn.  Are there any replacements? Here are some picture of the 
front shift rod.  I tried to take pictures of the guide pin but the digital 
was acting up.  Any help is appreciated.  I need to get my bus back on the 
road.  Thanks!
