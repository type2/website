Subject: Compression in a new engine with only 5 miles?

Hi All:

Still looking for the reason why it is hard to get this new engine to
idle and run well. The engine has only 5 miles + 20 minutes of runtime
on it. It was a completely new rebuild (new pistons, rings, heads,
etc.). I did a compression check on it today and got the following:

1- 85-90
2- 110
3- 95
4 -110

Is this normal for rings that have not yet fully sealed or is this an
indication that maybe I have a broken ring on #1? I don't see anything
inside the cylinder. Of course this test was done cold so I imagine that
the engine will tighten up when it is at operating temperatures.

I am about to recheck the valves and see if the numbers improve before I
continue with trying the get the engine to run well and complete the
break in process.

TIA
