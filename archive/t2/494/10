Subject: New engine Idle/timing/CO adjustemnt problems

Hi All:

I just installed my new engine for my 82 Federal Vanagon (2.0L type IV
with FI). All new hoses, good injectors, all seals new etc.; so no air
leaks. Fuel pressure dead on and all other FI components are working as
they should.

My initial settings (for idle and CO) from the old engine along with
static timing set at 7.5 BTDC were used to run the engine for the 20
minute engine break-in at 2000 rpm. The engine ran well enough for this.
Now I am trying to get the engine to run well enough at idle to run it
the 25 miles for the second part of the engine break-in (per Wilson).

My problem, the only way I can get the engine to idle at about 950-1000
rpm is to have the idle screw set almost all the way open, the CO
adjustment mostly closed (1/2 turn left and hence set rich) and the
timing around 12-16 BTDC. Any idea what the problem is and what I should
look for?

TIA
Regards,
