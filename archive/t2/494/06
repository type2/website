Peter, if you are thinking about a PC instead of a laptop, look into the 
mini-ITX platform, and smaller, at someplace like logisys.com or 
sudhian.com.  Many will run off of 12v natively, and all use so little 
power that you could run them for days without the engine running (<10 
watts at idle in some cases).  They are all bread-box size and smaller.  
Mostly their purpose is quiet running, but that coincides with cool and 
low power needs. 

Another thing to put on your list would be vibration dampening for the 
disk.  There are cheap sound dampening suspension systems that would 
probably work.

I've run 3 foot extension cables (plus the normal cable) to a monitor 
without problem, but don't know about LCD monitors....  It may be 
expensive to get a color LCD screen that is visible in the bright light 
of a dash - a monochrome one might work better...
