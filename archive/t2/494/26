Subject: Re: [T2] Compression check & Valve adjustment

OK, my new compression checker DID improve my compression.  Wow, a 15% 
improvement just by getting a new gauge.

But seriously, my initial intention was just to see if I had compression in 
all four, since the reason this '72 was put out to pasture was because one 
cylinder had 'zero' compression, and would not respond with a squirt of oil. 
  After initial exploratory surgery, there was one cylinder head gasket that 
had slipped on installation, and was pinched.  Compression at best was no 
more that 15 psi.

After putting it back together, initially I noticed that I was a bit low on 
#3.  Next day, today, I ran the compression checks with THREE different 
compression gauges, on all four cylinders, with and without the required 
squirt of oil. Over all four cylinders, I had a range of 140 to 150, mostly 
up at 150, and #3, the weak sister was reading a solid 150 on all three 
gauges with the squirt of oil.

Now I don't expect that if I adjust my valves that I will get much higher 
compression readings, but I will have a go at them.  I never adjusted valves 
before, but I saw it done once, and I have been reading Karl's directions 
for the last three months (rocking valves and all).

I am sure I won't screw it up, as soon as I can find a .006 mm feeler gauge 
<<---joke, I think??>

BTW, al this is being done on a stone cold engine, one that has not fired 
off [coughed, but did not fire off]  in the past 10 years.  I did remember 
to add some 3 qts of oil before turning it over, though...
