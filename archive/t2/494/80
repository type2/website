Subject: 77 starting issue

Hi All-

I have a stock 77 FI bus.

Question for you, sometimes mr bus starts right up, other times if he has been sitting for a while the engine/starter turns over very s-l-o-w-l-y. Sometimes it will get to the point where I turn the key and nothing happens. If I leave the bus a while it will regain some of its former juice and start up again... Last fall I had this problem and it got to the point where I would turn the key over and nothing would happen for days on end. However after celaning up grounds on te bus I fixed this issue. Does this sound more like a starter issue or a battery problem?

Please p-mail as I do not read actively

M.
