Subject: Re: [T2] Compression check & Valve adjustment

Hi Barry,

Have  you installed new rings? Is there any evidence of blow-by? Those 
low compression numbers might be from bad rings as opposed to leaky 
valves. It might also be a good idea to retorque the heads, just in 
case...

A leak-down test would provide more useful data at this point than a 
retest of compression using a different gauge.

Happy trails,
