Subject: RE: [T2] Engine stalling/Fuel question

Could be lot's of things, but doesn't sound like a fuel pump  or filter. 
These would cause stalling at high rpm/high load when the engine needs lots 
of fuel. If the fuel system is delivering ok at acceleration and cruise, it 
should deliver just fine at idle. You can check the fuel filter by 
unplugging the supply line and see what kind of crapp pours out (should 
clean & clear). If in doubt, replace. Quick check for the fuel pump is key 
on (engine not started), remove air filter, then use a pencil to push open 
the air flow flapper a little. This should cause the fuel pump to run with a 
nice stable humming sound. Any ugly sounding noises indicate bad pump or 
maybe clogged filter (I had this happen recently...a new filter was clogged 
by a bad tank of gas) The best check of the fuel system is to use a fuel 
pressure gauge ($30-40) while driving. This will verify that filter, pump, 
and pressure regulator all work.

How about basic tune up? Is the idle set right? This is really the place to 
start. Adjust the valves and check plugs for wear & gap with the engine 
cold, then drive until you get oil temps up (or about 20 minutes if no oil 
temp gauge), the adjust dwell, idle, and timing. Check air filter, 
distributor cap, rotor, and plug wires, and coil function. If that doesn't 
do it, and you're confident that the mechanicals are OK (ever done a 
compression check?) the try fuel injection troubleshooting. Write back if 
you need guidance on that. I'm not an expert, but I can point you to the 
reference materials. It's actually pretty easy...you just have to have the 
discipline to do it methodically before you rush out and buy parts . I don't 
know what kind of emissions stuff you have; that's a whole 'nother can of 
worms...
