Subject: Re: [OVT] Crank case FULL of oil!!! Ooooh Nooooo

John, Don't panic, this occurs sometimes with cars
with carbs and mechanical fuel pumps. The fuel tank is
higher than the engine, if the diaphragm in the fuel
pump ruptures it will fill the engine with gas, if
while the engine is running the float sticks in the
carb it will also fill the engine with gas. determine
the problem and fix it and change the oil and you
should all right... Phil
