I'd find myself a panel flanging tool and lay the new stuff right up
flush with the old--and spot weld first--all the way around--and then
hard weld it--

Use a heat dam ( absorption ) material to help keep the surrounding
metal fro warping--

A 6" air grinder will work great with 36 on it---

Later,

Panels- To Overlap or Not?
Hey guys...
Looks like a great weekend to work on the bus and my new body panels
awaiting installation. I've been researching body metal replacement,
seems to be several different opinions (of course). I need to know which
is best: to leave an inch or so of the original metal and overlay the
joint -or- cut the orginal metal so the replacement part fits in like a
puzzle piece? What do you guys think?
Also, what type of grinding tool would you use to smooth the seams?
Thanks,
Tom
