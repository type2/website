Subject: painting the tin (color other than black)

I've heard that painting the tin black helps to keep the heat down.  It
might seem petty, but the black paint that I used is matte black and I
don't like the finish.	The grey that I have is nice and glossy.

I'm using the rust-o-leum high-temp paint so there isn't much choice as far
as finish goes.

My question: will there be a noticable difference in temperature if I paint
my tin grey instead of black on my t4 engine?  I'd rather have it grey
anyways.. brighten things up a bit.

thanks,
Mike
