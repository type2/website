Subject: Re: [T2] Compression check & Valve adjustment

You can re-adjust a valve several times trying to get it to a consistent 
feel with the .006 gauge.  I measure the gap with the .006, if it doesn't 
feel just right, I use the .005 and .008 feelers to bracket .006 :

If .005 has no resistance, and the .008 won't fit at all then I know i'm in 
the right range. Slightly loose is better than slightly tight, so .006 - 
.007 seems to work ok. I don't get any valve noise this way either.

With this technique, I can adjust a valve in one or maybe two attempts. If I 
try to get an exact feel with the .006, then it takes like maybe 4+ 
attempts. If you wanted to be a little more precise, use the .005 and .007 
feelers to bracket.
