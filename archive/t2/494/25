Subject: RE: painting the tin (color other than black)

I just bought DupliColor Engine Enamel <New Ford Gray> good to 500 degrees 
F, and Krylon High Heat Radiator <Aluminum> good to 1000 degrees F.  At 500 
degrees spec, there are MANY colors to chose from.

I wanted the aluminum paint because I was going to paint my fan shroud.  But 
after bead blasting it, I didn't have the heart!!

I am using the DupliColor New Ford Grey on my heat exchangers, because of 
the color.  The color is near the other colors called battleship grey and 
dove grey.  But not near enough to paint your rims ! !

Warning:  if you use Rustoleum primer or paint, you should continue to use 
Rustoleum, no matter how many years later.  And please do not use the 
barbecue black, even though it might be rated to 1200 degrees.  Research the 
archives on these suggestion.
