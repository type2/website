Hey Terry. Thanks! I found a whole bunch of "Carputer" information at 
http://www.via.com.tw/en/VInternet/carpc.jsp all based on the mini-ITX boards. 
I was thinking of using a full-sized system stuffed under a seat somewhere, 
but since space in a bus is limited and heat is always an issue, the smaller 
sized and fanless mini-ITX systems look like they would be way better   :)

Ah, yes. Of course.

Yeah, true...I've tried my laptop in a vehicle -- the screen is *just* bright 
enough, unless the sun is shining on it. I was thinking that if it was inset 
into the dash or had a hood around it, then it might work okay. Perhaps 
dimming the interior with window tinting film may help, too.
