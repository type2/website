I'm running an Interstate 6 V battery (2-XHD) which is rated at 600 CCA
and cost me $65 plus tax in September 2002.

The battery I have should be comparable to a 12 V battery rated at 300 CCA.
This battery spins my engine just fine.  On the other hand, I have also
replaced the positive cable from the battery to the starter, the ground
strap from the battery to the body, and the ground strap at the
transmission nose cone.

The two 12 V starters described in the '63-'67 Bentley should draw
between 220 and 285 A when stalled.  So, a 450 CCA battery, with perfect
connections to the starter, should supply around twice the current needed.

You might check closely.  Interstate has 12 V automotive batteries with
CCA ratings from 410 A to 800 A.  Some batteries will also have a "CA"
(cranking amps) or "MCA" (marine cranking amps) rating that will be
higher, because it is measured with the battery at a higher temperature.
Interstate's 12 V automotive batteries are rated from 515 CA to 1000 CA.
For purchasing purposes, ignore the CA or MCA and look for the CCA.

The articles under "Batteries" on http://www.type2.com/library/electrip.htm
may also be of interest.

I hope this helps!
