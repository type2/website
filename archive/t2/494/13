Subject: Re: [T2] Fan seal oil leak/blowby question?

Thanks Phil. Yes tomorrow I clean up things and reconnect the hose to
the PVC (breather vent) and see if it is still leaking. Hopefully did
not get any oil leaking out the rear seal. Anyone have any suggestions
for a replacement O-ring to use on the breather valve that goes into the
case vent?

TIA
