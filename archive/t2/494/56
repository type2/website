Subject: Re: [T2] Torsion Bars (front End)

Greetings,

I don't know bugs at all. But all my set screws(there are 6, 8mm Allen) are 
tight and in their respective leaf "divits". Even if the center set screw 
was missing the torsion bars don't turn (other than flexing) inside the 
tubes. If I understand you correctly if this were the case my front end 
would be sitting on the lower arm and not sprung up into the upper, if that 
makes any sense. In other words there would be no suspension rather than too 
much as is my case. My bus won't relax and go down. I don't believe the 
center holder for the torsion bars can be adjusted in a bus. Now I am 
wondering how that piece is attached? Seems like if it broke free or moved 
at all the holes for the set screw(s) would not line up.

If I feel more confident that it is the torsion bars and the time-created 
"memory" theory I will likely steal the torsion bars off of my other bus 
(and label them).

<snip>
if these torsion arms are like the ones in VW bugs, there's a big screw in 
the middle of the torsion tube that has to be tightened down to lock the 
leaf spring splines inside from turning. In other words, it holds the inside 
end tight so that the outside (wheel end) has to twist to flex the 
suspension.


Many Thanks,
Brandt
