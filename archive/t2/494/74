Re valve adj, it's harder with the heater boxes being larger- use a
brake adjustor tool to walk down the bail wire and tap the covers on the
ENDS with a rubber hammer to loosen them. I grease the track the bail
rides on the cover, much easier to slide them up. Trick is holding the
cover in place as you slide up the bail-(slide it side to side as you
install cover to make sure it is seated over head).  I've had some that
insisted on riding upwards and made a block of wood (piece of 2x4
tapered on a band saw to wedge above the cover as bail is pushed up.
   Re adjusting, loosen the adjustor nut back a turn or so (six sided
box or socket, then back screw out to make sure it turns freely in
threads. Insert feeler gauge, then turn in screw until you feel it make
contact.  MEMORIZE the location of the slot and tighten the nut with a
box wrench, SIX sided is better.
It slot moves, hold the screw with large screwdriver as you tighten the
nut.  If they insist on turning, then learn to back the screw enough to
end up at the right spot when tight.
