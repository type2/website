Hi all ...
Got a chance to pick up a 1976 campmoblie / westy ...last on the road was 
1997 ...seems to be all there...needs a steering box but I thing the owner has 
one ...was also told that the motor was just rebuilt before the steering box 
went...dont know to much about that type van...so anyone out there have any info 
on it please by all means let me know  before I bite off more then I can chew 
....I think there asking 
$500 ...but I'm sure I can get it for much less... 
thanks in advance ...
