Subject: accordian heater tubes

I have a question about those accordian-like heater tubes that are the
connection between the heater flapper box (attached to the heat
exchangers) and the air duct on my 78 westy.  Do those tubes contain
asbestos?  If they do, are there replacements available?

thanks,
MIke
