yeah.. it's that dust... and when you try and wipe it off of the matte
black finish, it just doesn't clean up nice... and I don't like the feel
of it..

and no, I don't plan on having alot of oil in there!!!  This engine has
been fully rebuilt and cleaned and I plan to keep it that way as long as
possible! ;)
