Subject: Re: [T2] Type 4 dipstick sender

> Speaking of Just Kampers,
 I noticed a type 4 dipstick sender in their catalog: VDO9904
 They say it's about 615mm long. That's twice as long as the original. What
 gives?
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

That would be a little over 24 inches?   The oil dipstick on a 412 [type 4] wagon is about that long... it
goes in thru the oil fill hole. Maybe that is what it is for?
