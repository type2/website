Subject: Re: [T2] painting the tin (color other than black)

I really wanted glossy black; that way the oil cleanup is easier. 
However, they didn't have the high temp in glossy.

I could probably switch to another paint other than the high temp stuff,
but ahh, whatever.  Next time I'm just going to send it all off to be
powder-coated.  

Anyways, it's actually a nice reason to switch to the grey (silver). 
After repainting everything, it looks really sweet... plus, it'll
brighten up the engine compartment a bit.
