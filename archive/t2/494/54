The tubes do not but the white collars that connect to the tubes to the flapper boxes do. The cuffs are NLA and you can use a pair of silicone ones from an aircooled Vanagon if you get the straight one from one side instead of the curved from the other and raid two Vanagons of course.

Greg Potts told me once:

The asbestos parts can be replaced with late beetle (76-79) collars, VW
p/n 111 819 945, or you can replace the entire flex pipe assembly. The late
beetle units are made of rubber; last week I got 4 of them from a VWFLAPS
used for $CDN10.00 . New units are available from a VW dealer for $CDN15.
