Hi Greg:

Thanks for the quick reply. I have a vacuum gage on it, and the value
varies between 0 and 15-17 InHg depending on how I set the timing. If I
go by ear, what makes the engine sound like it is running best at about
1000, the vacuum gage registers aroun 15-16 InHg. If  I try to set the
timing with a timing light then it is more like around 5-10 InHg and the
engine stumbles.
