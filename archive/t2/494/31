Terry etc...

If you go to Mini-box.com they have a DC to DC powersupply and a 
AutoPowerSequencer. Also it is best to run laptop drives in the unit. 
DVD and HD, they are designed to withstand vibration etc.

I currently have a bus'puter in my 73 Safare with a 17" LCD in back and 
mini-itx system which powers my dvd/mp3/webcam/wireless internet etc 
solution. All of it is tucked away and the A/V is all integrated 
cleanly.  My coming purchase (next week) is of a 10" LCD Touchscreen to 
mount in the dash to control it all. It is indeed possible to run this 
thing non stop, I put mine to sleep when I turn off the bus (even 
though its running of my AUX battery) and I wake it when I turn the bus 
on. Being in software development I am also in the process of designing 
a unified player for dvds, mp3s, mpgs, avi's etc based on an opensource 
linux player with a clean touchscreen interface. I was previously using 
a wireless keyboard and mouse.
I've built 5 of these units for myself and others and I've always used 
linux. Its fairly easy setting up a mobile pc, having a clean interface 
and taking full advantage of its features is a bit tougher and just 
requires patience.

It is interesting to note as well that most LCDs are 12v so with some 
radio shack purchases you don't need an inverter of any sort.
Having a Safare top my 17" is mounted in the back and doesn't suffer 
any brightness loss even on super sunny days, I am expecting some minor 
problems with the dash Tocuhscreen LCD but nothing I don't think cant 
be fixed by changing orientation.

One thing, upgraded speaker setup is a must if you want people to be 
able to hear movie dialogue while on the road ! <grin>

Drop me a line if you have any questions,
