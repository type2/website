Subject: Electrical help needed in Phoenix!

Hi all! Timothy in Phoenix here. I need someone to help me clean up a
wiring mess from a PO that did nasty things to my 1977 High Roof.
Anyone know of someone that can help me out locally in Phoenix? Mostly,
the wiring is clean up, but there is some repair to be done. The van is
a camper, so we're looking at auto wiring, and house wiring mixed
together and I've no idea which is which! I would do it myself, except
I dont know what I am doing and lack the tools. I would be glad to act
as assistant to someone. I am competent and learn quick, just need some
training in this technical area as Ive never done it before and have
no idea as to what I am looking at!  Thanks in advance!

Timothy
