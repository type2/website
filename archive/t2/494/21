Subject: Re: [T2] painting the tin (color other than black)

Yeah, I think it's somewhat negligable, too.

I also took a look at Jake Raby's site and he has painted engine tin all
sorts of colors.  And if that guy doesn't have a problem painting engine
tin funky colors with his performance t4 engines, then I'm guessing it's
probably not an issue on my stock 2 liter ;).

thanks,
Mike
