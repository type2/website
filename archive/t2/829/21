Subject: Repost-Help in SFBA?

Heya folks...

    Didn't get any response to the earlier post, thought I'd ask again
now that we're into the weekday... 

    If anybody in the SFBA can take a wee bit of time and help my Dad
disconnect the fuel line from the engine on a '78 westy 'twould be most
appreciated. Cheers...

Regards,
