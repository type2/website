As stated by others, you need to know if the thermotime switch isn't sending
power to the cold start valve, or if the cold start valve is getting power
but just not opening.

If the thermotime switch is broken, then bringing power to the cold start
valve should open it, allowing the extra fuel needed on cold startups.

The thermotime switch handles the shutoff, not the ECU.  If you jumper the
cold start valve you'll need to manually disconnect it.
