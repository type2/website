Subject: wont idle cold

until I install the new(used) engine in my Jeep
wrangler to use as my winter car I have been driving
my 77 westy. This car came to NY from Ca last spring,
it is its 1st time in cold weather, and since it has
gotten very cold it wont idle when cold, if I drive it
for 10 minutes, then it will idle. any ideas?

thanks
