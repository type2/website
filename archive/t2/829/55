Subject: Re: [T2] GWB with its top off

When I took my high top off and dumped the cabinets and panelling out of it, 
there was some surface rust here and there. I spent some time grinding with 
a wire wheel and rust painting, but luckily nothing that bad, it was just 
surface rust. I was very glad I took the top off and dealt with it, just as 
with the side and hatch windows I recently did, water had gotten into those 
nooks and started it's oxidizing mayhem.
That reminds me of a split bus I once saw from San Diego, the whole top was 
rusted right out from the roof down to the doors, from sea salt.  This one 
is not nearly as bad though. I guess the water had somewhere to sit...

<Two selections Don.

Cave and pave the roof, and put the white whales top back on and unload.

Or--locate a doner Bus for it's roof section and replace the garbage,
and keep it.

Terry?
