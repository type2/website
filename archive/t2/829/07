what did you find wrong on the 71?
Replacing the hardtop seems like a big job.
Im not trying to discourage you from doing it but wouldnt be easier to find
a cheap shell and swap everything?
But im guessing that just may not be an option considering your space
restraints.
whatever you decide good luck!
