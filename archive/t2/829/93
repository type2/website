I basically have the same issue.  Currently, I have a 1971 1600 DP 
with the stock distributer.  These have 2 vacuum cans, one for 
advance and one for retard.  The outer can leaks, so my question is 
do I buy a new distributer, fix the current, or just ignore the 
vacuum retard and retune the engine?

It runs like an 009 right now (big flat spot off idle), and often stalls.
