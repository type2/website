Subject: Fuel injection question

I have established the cold start valve is not operating on my 78 Westy.  I
have to crank it for several short periods to get it to start.  In DC now it
is getting into the teens at night.  Getting at the thermo-time switch is
really difficult.  My question is,  As a temporary cold weather bodge, if I
can get the connector off the thermo time switch and  jump the connector
terminals will it then operate the cold start valve?  I understand it only
works while the engine is cranking and will automatically shut off after 10
seconds.  I assume these two protections against flooding are handled by the
central control unit.   Any comments or suggestions?  It will be warm enough
in a few months to start without the cold start valve assistance and be warm
enough for me to remove the cold start and thermo time switches and test
them to see what should be replaced before next winter.
