Subject: Re: [T2] bus accident

I'm looking for some suggestions on body repair shops in
in south Nashville, TN. If you know of one your recommend
please drop me a message with the location and phone number.

PS. No news yet from the insurance company on my bus. The
local vw/import repair shop doesn't body work, they sent
me to another shop but no one is answering the phone and
voice msg's go unreturned...
