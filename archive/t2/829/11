Steve,
     I have been trying to get a friends 79 FI (federal) bus going.  It was 
having allot of trouble starting, but it would eventually start and okay.  I 
replaced the points, timed it, set the idle and thought that was it because 
it started right up and ran.  Then when he got it home it didn't start 
again.  I thought maybe the condensor or coil were bad causing the points to 
wear abnormally fast, but replacing those has done nothing.  Now we can't 
get it started again.  The cold start injector tests out electrically, as 
does the temp sender at the sender and the ECU according to the Bosch FI 
manual.
      Basically, I think I'm in over my head.  I have fuel tested by 
removing a line and kicking on the fuel pump, air tested by sound and 
watching the flap inside the air box open up, and spark tested at the coil 
and each spark plug.
      I was planning to try replacing the cold start injector, but that's my 
last idea.  I was wondering if you wouldn't be willing to help us out?  They 
are off of 450 in Crofton, so they aren't too far away from you, I think.

Let me know!
