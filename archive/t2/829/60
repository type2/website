Subject: Runaway idle and decel valve

Hi, All.

~1979 CA emissions~

I've got a little problem with a runaway idle, and I think I've
narrowed it down to the decel valve.

I read about 16" of manifold vacuum at idle. My decel valves (i have
two used ones) both open up at between 16" and 19" , hence the
confusion. They otherwise operate correctly.

Anyone care to take a stab at the correct specification of the decel
valve? before I run out and buy a new one? Seems to me they ought to
open at around 20+"

Thanks,
