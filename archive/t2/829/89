When I was looking around for a shop to do the bodywork on my bus (traditional bus rust issues) I had a really difficult time finding one. They would look at it and then decided they wouldn't be able to find the parts for it. I would promise to provide all the sheet metal but they still refused.

One shop told me they didn't work on VW vans and after I left the office, I went around back and saw an aircooled Vanagon up on the lift.

I came to the conclusion that most of these shops were only interested in insurance claims. My advice would be to wait until the adjusters give you a large figure before you go to any more shops.
