The can has a fixed advance unless you modify the stops on the arm. I haven't seen evidence of this.

I graphed the operation of a stock distributor vs. two "SVDA"'s out there and they were all different:

Legend:

205P (stock 76-78 federal bus)
205ZB (from CIP1.com)
SVDA (from ACN for 76 bus)
205AB (stock 75 - early 76 bus)
205E - stock (stock 72 bus)

Right now the best price on a VW/Bosch Mexico SVDA is CB Perf. at $99.
