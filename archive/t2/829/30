<<    Glass sealant/adhesive is designed to be used with the

Your still thinking rubber set glass, and rubber glue.

Not in the new millennium.
The windshield is a structural part of the body, and the glass is glued
in with a urethane adhesive.

Double check this with any automotive glazer.

He'll verify it.

The wing window could very well be set permanently with this adhesive
with no problems.
