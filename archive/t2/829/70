Don,

I agree with most everyone. Don't bother trying to patch that up. Just
POR-15 it and slap the roof back on. As long as the rust is stopped (as best
as you can), what you can't see won't hurt you. As long as it isn't
structural.

Unless you really don't like that rare and very cool highroof... Then you
have a bleep-load of work ahead of you.
