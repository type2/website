Subject: Re: [T2] GWB with its top off

<<The pics don't really tell the tale. But the rust around where the top
mounted goes all the way through every piece. It's completely rusted
out. 
Decision time. What to do?>>

Two selections Don.

Cave and pave the roof, and put the white whales top back on and unload.

Or--locate a doner Bus for it's roof section and replace the garbage,
and keep it.
