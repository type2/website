Subject: cannot get engine to crank fast enough

Hi all,



Thanks for all of your help with my rebuild so far. I got my oil
pressure up and everything installed but my battery cannot turn the
engine over fast enough. I turn the key and get a clunk from the
solenoid and a whir rar whir sound from the engine compartment. My
battery reads between 13.86 and 14 volts so it is not dead. The engine
is turning just not fast. The fellow who has been helping me with the
project said that he has run into this before and recommended jumping
the battery to get it started. Before the rebuild when my engine was
very loose, it would turn over almost the second I turned the key. Does
jumping it sound like a good idea or should I look for some other
problem.



Thanks again for all the help,



Max
