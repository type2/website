Check out Cip1.com.  I just got my brand new Mexican engine from them, and 
they are having 10% off sale right now.  That just about paid for the shipping 
charges.  The engine came pretty complete with flywheel, oil cooler, and even 
has the mounting holes tapped for the 68/71 rear engine support bar.  The only 
bummer is you have to drill and tap the case for the thermostat stud, but that 
isn't too hard. I think this is a better way to go than a rebuilt, and all of 
your tin should bolt right on.
