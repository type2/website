Subject: Which SVDA Distributor????

Hello friends, I was wonder what you all thought about this....   Im looking
at getting an SVDA but there are a few to choose from....   The one from
Aircooled.net I heard was supposed to be good as they tune the vacuum can for
your engine type....   BusDepot.com has the Bosch German SVDA for the same
price...  Ive also seen one at partsamerica.com for 48 dollars!!!!   The first
two mentioned are both 129 dollars....
Has anyone had any experiences with any of these?????
Any input is appreciated...

I have a 78 type 2 camper with a 2 litre and stock FI...

Thank you in advance

Aaron
