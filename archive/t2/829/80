VW listees have done so much for me, and I can offer so little back not
being so well versed, but I can point out to those who may be concerned,
or who would like to avoid this kind of malicious behavior. the solution
is rather simple. 

http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/

Use this browser, and never open IE again unless it is absolutely
necessary. IE is a wide open gateway into your computer. Don't use it. 

Go to download.com, or ask around, and find another mail reader besides
Outlook and use it all the time. Never use Outlook unless you have to. It
is yet another wide open door for folks to attack your computer.

Do get Adaware, Spybot, and others and use them to clean up your machine.
They are mostly all free, and because there are so many rotton companies
and sub human people out there, one app will not catch all the possible
combinations, so run several.

Change is difficult, and using new computer tools is not always a happy
thought, but if you use Firefox instead of IE, and stay away from Outlook,
companies and hacker fools will be very hard pressed to put unwanted
software onto your computer. If you use IE and Outlook, you WILL get
spyware, beacons, and viruses. If you ditch those two packages, you may
well never get any such things again.
