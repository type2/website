 Hello friends, I was wonder what you all thought
 about this....   Im looking
 at getting an SVDA but there are a few to choose
 from....   The one from
 Aircooled.net I heard was supposed to be good as
 they tune the vacuum can for
 your engine type....   BusDepot.com has the Bosch
 German SVDA for the same
 price...  Ive also seen one at partsamerica.com for
 48 dollars!!!!   The first
 two mentioned are both 129 dollars....
 Has anyone had any experiences with any of
 these?????
 Any input is appreciated...
 
 I have a 78 type 2 camper with a 2 litre and stock
 FI...

Unless someone did you a 'favor' by replacing your
original distributor with a 009, you ALREADY have a
SVDA!!!

Why do you want to buy another one??

There is NOTHING wrong with the curve of the dist you have.
