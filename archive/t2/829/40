Strange ad at the bottom of Richards link:

BRAND NEW ENGINES!
Back by popular Demand
We again offer Brand New Long Blocks, and "Turn Key Engines".

Made in Mexico--At the same factory where they make the New Beetle.

______________*009 Distributor !!!!!



Why do they have a 009??  Why not the VW 043-905-205 ZB, Bosch 0231 170 034 (Mexico)?

Sounds like something   BTLMex, Inc., Nogales, Arizona is putting together and it is NOT a real Built in
Mexico engine like the engines offered a year or 2 ago?   The case is made in Mexico......
