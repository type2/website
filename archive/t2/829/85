Aaron + list,

I've had bad luck with the Bruck SVDA (Bosch knockoff) offered by
cip1. Stick with the genuine Bosch part.

I'm waiting for my holiday bonus so I can purchase the right part.

Some will argue that the aircooled.net SVDA and the one BD sells are
in fact the same, and since aircooled.net won't tell us exactly what
they're doing to the distributors they sell to "tune the vacuum can"
one can only guess. Either choice would be superior in my experience
to the Bruck model.

Don't let the $20-$30 savings on the "Bruck" SVDA get you.

peace
