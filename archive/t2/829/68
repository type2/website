The "new mexican engines" vary in source and quality.  IIRC, the
Beetlemex version was built up out of new parts and shipped bare on a
pallet, whereas the version sold by Old Volks Home Ronnie and others is a
VW factory-built engine, that comes in a big VW box.  I'd trust the
Factory engine more


Mine came in a factory box, even had the oil cooler with the VW stamp on it.  
I'm pretty happy with it so far, but will lt ya know after it has been 
running for a while
