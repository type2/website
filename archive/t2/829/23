Use a true silicone spray or grease; see DIVE SHOPS as they have this 
for rubber.

  Hi Jeff,

  Glass sealant/adhesive is designed to be used with the rubber seal,
  not instead of. I have best luck when everything is good and wet and
  slippery. I've used armor all, I've used WD 40. Some don't like armor
  all because of the water content, some don't like WD 40 because it's
  not good for rubber.
