And you are just learning this now?  Hey T2 and
Wetwesties list members.  Read below.
    
We in the computer industry have known for a couple of
years that all major web sites place Web Beacons, Data
Miners, and malware onto Microsoft and Apple based
computers world-wide.  These web sites install the
programs onto YOUR computer without your knowledge or
consent.  This class of computer intrusion software is
not considered viruses.  Hence, anti-virus software
does not recognize them.
  
Eventually, the media is going to pick-up on this
unauthorized invasion of our privacy, and finally,
congress will act.  Congress and the court system are
always tech-clueless.  But until then, computers
world-wide are grinding almost to a halt due to dozens
or hundreds of uninvited and unauthorized programs
placed onto their computers by Yahoo, MSN, Google,
E-bay, Napster, and thousands of other sites.
    
Even the company where I work installs a web-beacon. 
We get paid cold hard cash if you visit our site from
selected webpages.  These web-beacons equate to money
for web sites.  Money and greed is the driving force.
    
Web-beacon and Malware removal:  That is what Adaware
(Lavasoft) and SpyBot Search & Destroy do.  They
remove the data-mining programs placed onto our
computers by all major web sites.  And both are free
off the internet.  Spybot alone has record of almost
30,000 different programs which will find their way
onto your computer!
   
Didn't you know this?  It's been going on for years.
    
Is your computer running very slowly these days?
