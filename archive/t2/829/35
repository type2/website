Max,

Wait for it to warm up in the garage.  You have probably set your end play 
pretty tight and in 70 degree temps.

When you took it outside, the cold made everything get even tighter.

Don't ask how I know this<grin>.


Obviously, if it was cranking before, it "should" crank now....even if it 
is difficult to do so.

Unless....you really have something stuck somewhere.  had a buddy who did 
a *good* rebuild many years ago, but called me from 200 miles away at the 
local "hippie" nude swimming hole....he had backed his bus down to the 
swimming area, but then couldn't start it again.

Turns out that he had left a screwdriver in the bellhousing and had driven 
all over creation(2,000+ miles) with it in there and causing no 
problems....untill he got it stuck by trying to start off on a steep hill.

Got all the tools you are supposed to have?<grin>

Cheers, dave
