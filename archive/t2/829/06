Hi Jeff,

Glass sealant/adhesive is designed to be used with the rubber seal,
not instead of. I have best luck when everything is good and wet and
slippery. I've used armor all, I've used WD 40. Some don't like armor
all because of the water content, some don't like WD 40 because it's
not good for rubber.

 Need help.I successfully rebuilt one of my front vent windows but am having
 trouble with the second one.  Do you think that this glass sealant/adhesive
 will work instead of pressing the glass and rubber seal into the frame?
