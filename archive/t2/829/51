The "new mexican engines" vary in source and quality.  IIRC, the
Beetlemex version was built up out of new parts and shipped bare on a
pallet, whereas the version sold by Old Volks Home Ronnie and others is a
VW factory-built engine, that comes in a big VW box.  I'd trust the
Factory engine more.

I'm running two engines I bought from Ronnie.  Only failure
was a broken cylinder stud, but that seems to be a fluke.
