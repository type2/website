Hi Shaggy,

If it came from CA recently, then it *should* still have FI.

If so, then you have a couple areas to check.

1. Check the spark plugs, wires, coil, timing and dwell. It's a waste  
of time to troubleshoot FI components until the ignition and timing  
are verified.
2. Check the connections to the cold start valve, aux. air valve and  
thermo time switch.
3. Verify vacuum is at or better than 15".

Happy trails,

for 10 minutes, then it will idle. any ideas?
