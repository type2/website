Subject: Re: [T2] Lurch has done it again

Does anyone know if the turnkey engines have a thermostat and flaps on them? 
Or just a hollow junk shroud? A Hoover bit and full tin complement?
Also, I wonder why they have generators...surely Mexican beetles and 
Brazilian combis went to alternators long since??
