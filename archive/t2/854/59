Subject: Hello

Hi volks, 
I'm not new here, but it's been a while (okay, about 3
years) since I was last here, so I thought I would
re-introduce myself. 
I am Adoom, also known as 'Doom, Uncle Adoom, "hey,
stop teaching my kid that", and BAMF. 

I drive a 1968...something. It was a westy, then it
was a slightly modified westy, now it's more like a
sportsmobile. It gets me to camp-outs and that's all
that really matters. 

Some of you may have seen me selling shirts at events
(ahem, everybus, BoTC, BBTF, Dixie04, Busquinox, etc)
or playing guitar without the benefit of sobriety. 

This year will be more of the same, maybe a new paint
job here and there. 

I look forward to being "back on the list".

Thanks,
Adoom
