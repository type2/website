Subject: Carbs, FI or? ... And weird heads

We just picked up a long block for Myonnie's camper since she does not like
the idea of driving a camper with a stock 1.7 ... The new engine is a 1.9:
GD case with 1.7 crank, 94 mm P&Cs (Keith Black pistons to make up for wrist
pin difference), mild Engle (?) cam (don't know the specs, except that it
has stock lift with increased intake duration), 8.0:1 compression ratio.
Built by Peek Performance.

Now the question is: how are we going to get fuel into this thing? Previous
owner had dual Dellortos on it, but engine came without carbs. This is what
I have available: Porsche 914 FI (complete and in supposedly working
condition), stock dual Solex 32-34 PDSIT jetted for 2L CJ (sans manifolds),
and dual Solex/Brosol H 40 DEIS (sans manifolds). I also have a single Weber
with manifolds, but there is no way I am putting that thing on this engine.

Any suggestions? Goal is decent power, good driveability, and decent fuel
mileage. Does anyone have type 4 manifolds for the H 40 DIES carbs?

Another question: The heads on this engine have breather fittings on them
(to be connected to a central breather box somewhere in the engine
compartment). Looks like they were manufacturerd like that. Previous owner
says they are Brazilian heads. I have never seen anything like that before -
what are these heads?
