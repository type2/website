Dave, you mention the rotary compressor conversion. I have a
semi-functioning under-dash a/c unit in my '79... Does the compressor bolt
up in the same area as that for an overhead system? And How difficult is it
to convert to a rotar compressor? Where did you source yours (what's VPC?)?
Thanks-

JJ
