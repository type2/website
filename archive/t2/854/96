Hey, I looked at a 2 year old Eurovan Weekender Poptop online the other
night. 15K miles? $35K... USED!

Been along time since VW built anything van-like that i could afford.
Now if you want a 40K mile used Eurovan with the weekender interior and
not poptop, you can them under $10K. There's a market for you. Buy the
cheaper vans and graft the roof on. 

I'll seriously be considering a Sprinter... Also expensive though. Used
prices unknown to me. Need to look. 

So are we still paying the high tariff on the European vans/trucks?
Wasn't it the Chicken Tariff or something like that?
