Yeah, this one is heavy.  But I'm not going to have to move it  far.  One car garage, ha.  Mostly use it in the  driveway.  Thanks again for the great site, Richard.   Indispensable!  Cheers...KR

The  Sears jack I bought 4 years ago seems to be the best value out there.  It's made in China as well but the cylinder will probably last longer  than the average HF jack.

I believe all Sears jacks have a 1-yr warranty (maybe less) unlike a lot of the other tools they sell.

My only beef about the jack is that it weighs 90 lbs. I haven't seen an aluminum jack I'd like to buy either.
