If you are new to VW's are you sure that you adjusted
the valves correctly. If you disconnected the electric
choke, did you wire it in the open position, running
the engine with the choke in the closed position will
give you a very rich mixture. Check the valves for
being correct, make sure the choke is open. Just for
grins do a compression test this will tell you the
general condition of the engine. Phil
