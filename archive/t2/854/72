Subject: Re: [T2] New concept van in Michelin Challenge with bus feel

IIRC - It was 30mpg, cruises at 50 and under 1000 marks :)
I used to have a little spiel....yea...so anyways :)

I must say - I do agree with the note on the verdeir design with the
passenger seat that turns into the staircase totally awesome and i really
really liked how both doors open and there is an awning an basically 2 hang
out spots and one with a kitchen :) Hmm....this is one of the reasons why i
want to buy my friends 58 double door walk through...with a roof rack and 2
awnings, and a removable kitchen on the passenger side....yea OK I think I
am dreaming a little to much for my budget right now...by the time I would
be done with the 58 i probably would have almost 10k into it but thats a
fraction of the possible new ones, and i would be a lot cooler....
