Chris,

It was the Chicken "WAR".  Article in "life" magazine many years 
ago.

Turns out(latter in life) that I worked for that company for 15 years.

They built a new set of offices and one of the things they showed 
when the dug all of their stuff out of storage was the original sign that 
said 

"No Volkswagons Allowed"  spelled exactly like that.

What was funny was that the original owner's grandson was seriously in to 
Porsche's(after he was born, that is)....

Tried to go find the copy of "life magazine" with the cover, but 
couldn't find it....hmmmmmm  maybe it was "time" magazine

Read all about it here

Cheers, dave
