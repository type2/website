JJ,

VPC= Volskwagen Products Corporation...it was at one time, a "wholly owned 
subsidiary of vw".  Made all air cooled A/C and cruise controls and 
accesories.

Semi-difficult to switch over dependon on which "original" A/C system you 
have...VPC or someone else's.  

Change the dryer, change the compressor and oil, change/modify the 
compressor mount(depending), change compressor hose ends, check for leaks, 
charge with Freeze 12 and drive off into the sunset

Sigh, I've been promising to do a writeup since last year.

I guess it's time to pay the fiddler...and especially Richard, who sent me 
a genuine VPC mount instead of a DPD mount so i could try it....it is 
supposed to take almost no modification to put the rotary compressor on.

The rotary compressor came from Bus Depot, but is available from other 
sources...it has to have the "right" head on it so that the hoses will fit 
under the tin.

Cheers, dave
