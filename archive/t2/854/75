This may be a bit strongly worded.

I have a 79 westy that had "factory" air. It was the under dash unit. When I
got the bus the dash unit was gone and the plumbing to it, but most of the
rest of it was still there. I removed the under floor condenser and all the
rest of the plumbing. The only really big hack to repair was the hole in the
sheet metal to the left of the engine. I fixed that with a piece of sheet
metal from a donor bus, and the rest of the install is pretty much
invisible. Unless I told you, you probably wouldn't know the bus ever had
AC.

The installations were not very well done, as Richard says. If you had the
rooftop model the un-install would be more involved.
