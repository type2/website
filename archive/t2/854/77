I think this is the location you are looking for:

2801 Hawkins Point Road
Baltimore, MD 21226
(410) 354-4800

This (and the other locations and numbers) is on their website:
http://www.crazyraysautoparts.com/

That website is hard to find doing searches so don't feel bad if you tried 
and couldn't find it.

Clinton, MD
