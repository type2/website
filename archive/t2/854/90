So that's why Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia.  For VW's!  Maybe we should invade Japan again.  Cheers...KR


HIstory  records that Porsche was going to settle with Tatra but Hitler fobid  him from doing so and solved the legal problems by invading  Czechoslovakia and shutting the Tatra factory down. Much like the stamp  holders who were saving to buy VWs before the war, it took years of  fighting to receive compensation.
