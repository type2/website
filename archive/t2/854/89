   Not really...The Tatra was one of the most innovative car manufacturers
during the
1930's...Unfortunately it was also Czech, so any problems with Porsche
borrowing
from the T 97 - (The T97 was an aerodynamic car with an air cooled flat four
mounted
in the rear with independant front and rear suspension with swing axles;
sound familiar
... ?-) - were solved when the German army overran Czechoslovakia. After the
war,
Tatra ended up behind the Iron Curtain... ;-( Despite this they continued to
make cars,
but most never made it to the West. They pursued their claims against
Porsche, but
the wheels of international justice are slow...
