16 Inch (Bosch 40 716), VW 211 955 425 E

The right side end will usually NOT contact the glass due to the curvature
of the windshield.  It's a common thing (at least it was on my 69, 73 and
77).  You could run a 15 or 14 inch blade on the right side, but you will
reduce coverage on the right side of the glass by doing so
