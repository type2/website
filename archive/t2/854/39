Subject: help 72 bus - no power

I seem to have lost the power in my 72.

It was running well two weeks ago,
I did a tune-up and valve adjustment

I can't get any speed out of her over 35mph
It seems to drag when I try to accelerate - sort of like trying to start in 
4th gear.
Uses a lot of gas
I have to pump the gas several times to get it to start
 
the electronic choke has been disengaged - seems to start better

any thoughts would be helpful - I am new to VWs.
