I've seen some pretty bad installations at the junkyard in TX and  
here in CA. To quote Dave Bolen when I asked him about the  
installation process:

http://www.type2.com/archive/type2/139592.html

"Typical "at the port" installation of air-conditioning.

The guys at the port got paid by the vehicle and were often under  
pressure
to get it done so that it could get on a truck and get to the dealer  
to be
delivered.

I don't think that *any* installer ever did it according to the specs in
the installation sheet.  Mine had about 3/4" of opening around almost  
all
of it....just wonderfull to suck hot muffler aair right back over the
engine."
