Subject: RE: [T2] New concept van in Michelin Challenge with bus feel

I don't know.  I can of like the verdier.ca design... except for the
fact that with all the features it will probably carry a $40K+ pricetag.
What ever happened to the original VW concept of keeping it simple and
targeting it to the common man/woman.  I think VW has forgotten that
Volkswagen means peoples-automobile.  I mean, after all, Hitler himself
in 1933 directed Porshe to create a small, four-seater, with durable
engine, at least 40 miles to the gallon, air-cooled, with a low price
(then below 1,000 marks).

Now we all know Hitler was a bit of a nut but it was still a good
concept.  Here we are 70+ years later and the average car still doesn't
get that good of gas mileage and VW is pricing the vehicle out of the
common person's reach with engineering that is more and more complex
and, therefore, more and more difficult for the average person to work
on.

Oh well...what else is knew.

I wonder what the new VW bus (http://www.vanagon.com/media/concept/) is
going to be priced at?
