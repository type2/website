Hello All,
I've spent all weekend stripping my project '72 transporter. It's got
alittle rust and I love any suggestions anyone has for fixing these.
For ease, I've put all the pics on my blog.

I can weld, grind, whatever, so I'm just wondering what you'd buy all new
panel's for and cut and replace or what you'd just grind to good metal and
leave or what you'd think is best.
All the different area's are numbered. You can reply to this email or just
comment on the blog if you have any suggestions for any of the area's.

Thanks,
BJ
