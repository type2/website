Martin,

Ya did good!  

Every minor detail can add up when sealing and heat proofing an aircooled 
engine.

It is the ONE thing that almost all newbies and some old timers will 
ignore when trying to get the temperatures down.

I'm betting that your results are pretty much permanent...feels good 
doesn't it!

Cheers, dave

 - blocking up the hole that lets you access the alternator tensioning 
 bolt with a piece of al flashing. No doubt lots of hot air is sucked 
 in through here!

 - tightening the rear engine hatch by adjusting the catch. I noticed 
 I could see daylight past the seal so some air mixed with hot exhaust 
 from behind the bus would have been sucked in through here.
