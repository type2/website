The Bug/Ghia/Type 3/68on Bus Brake Reservoir Cap started out in the
beginning with with about 5 different numbers. VW finally figured out they
reinvented the wheel too many times and superseded it to one part number 113
611 351.  So any Bug one will work just fine.

Sounds like the 3rd Gear Synchronizer is going bad, but it could be the
shifter base needs a slight realignment/adjustment.  Or the shift coupler in
the rear has developed too much play and needs replacing.  Or a combination
of all the above.
