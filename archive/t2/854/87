While we are on the subject of VW history, I have a couple of questions.
William Bushnell Stout built the Stout Scarab in 1935. I suspect that the
Beetle
and the Splittie were inspired by Stout's work. The similarities seem like
more than coincidence
to me. However, I have never seen this discussed anywhere. Have any of you
seen Stout and Porsche's designs compared anywhere? Could someone recommend
some good reading on VW history?
Thanks,
