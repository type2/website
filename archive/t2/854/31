try checking the shift plate and also your rear shift coupler....
  those two both can cause havoc....
  the shift plate installed wrong direction can cause preoblems with rverese or even if shift plate is moved over to far...
  youll need a 13mm socket rachet and a flat head screwdriver to get it set...
  put it into 2nd gear before taking loose....
  also check shift rod bushing and to make sure shift rod isnt bent from a previus tranny/engine drop where they might have let tranny hang?
  good luck

Picked up another 71 today, I know have a Westy, this deluxe and a parts 
bus. Plan is for deluxe to be my in town driver and my westy to be in best 
shape for backup and trips.

The new deluxe shifts like hell, you don't have to pop down for reverse and 
thus you have to be really carefully shifting into 2nd to not find reverse 
by accident. I have a rebuilt transmission soon going into my westy, then 
that tranny which pops out of reverse about once a month can go into this 
deluxe, but what causes this? Linkage?

Thanks in advance,
Daniel
