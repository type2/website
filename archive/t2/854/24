Subject: Wiper blades size - 68 bus

Hello all...

Can someone tell me what is the correct size for the wiper blades for a 68
bus?
15 inches? 16 inches?....
I had 16 inches blades on my Bus, but i remenber that at least one of the tips
was not in contact with the glass....was it because they were too long, or was
it a wiper arm problem?

Joao
