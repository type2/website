Peter,

I'm not sure that removing it would ruin the "stock" appeal...but a 
functioning a/c in a bus has a certain appeal to some folks....who might 
be willing to pay extra for it.

I have a 78 Champagne Edition with a fully functional overhead A/C 
unit...with a rotary compressor change over....all *under* the stock tin 
to avoid heat problems.

The A/C unit was brand new out of the orignal VPC box last year....I heard 
that they still have plenty of them....originally for 68-72 so you have to 
come up with your own compressor mount for the late model t4 engine.

Cheers, dave
