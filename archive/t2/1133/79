Having looked at the pictures...  the logging truck hit you - centerpunched this 
big yellow van in front of him.  How the heck did it get determined to be YOUR 
fault???

Something is way wrong here... unless you slid sideways into the front of the 
logging truck.  Or ran a red light in front of it.  Anyway, being from NorCal 
and knowing how logging trucks drive normally, if it were me,  I'd contest the 
heck outta this, as had he control over his vehicle and traveling at a safe 
speed he shoulda stopped.  What if a kid ran in front of him???  

Sorry you're pulling the plug on vw's...  we'll be here when (not if) you 
return!!!

Hugs, Sus
