Our bus was destroyed by a logtruck collision on Monday.  We are all going
to be OK, including my not-yet-born daughter who is due on the 20th.

The police say he was going 37 mph.

The bus did very well.  I think my overbuilt subwoofer and 10 gallons of
apple cider in sealed buckets helped slow things down.  Don't laugh but I
think the milk crate between the front seats helped a little too.

We loved our bus very much and had a very good time in the nearly 5 years we
spent together but I think I am going to get out of VWs for a while and
focus on my 1962 122S Volvo.  The bus will be replaced by a 1986 to 1989
Volvo 240 wagon, which is what it replaced.  If you know anybody selling a
good one please let us know.

In case you are wondering, I was determined to be at fault.

I do have a dream to build a bay window transporter into a lowered
all-electric vehicle for use in Portland.  if this project interests you
please email me off list but realize that it is 2-3 years away.  I am
interested in a good deal on a transporter with no motor.

The insurance company told me they would give me the replacement value based
on what is currently for sale, my bus may have been worth more than I
realized based on what I have seen this week on CL and that auction site.

I have 4 jalousies and some screens I need to get rid of, let me know if you
want them, I would take 20 bucks for everything but you have to take
everything, I think I also have all of the hardware and the canvas for a
pop-top, the canvas was nice but somebody before me removed it aggressively
and it has tears, I paid 5 bucks and would sell it for the same.

I will be on here for a while longer but will eventually find little reason
I think.

Thanks for all the help this past 5 years.
