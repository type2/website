Subject: '74 with automatic transmission leaks

I thought some of the mess might have been from the push rod tubes, but when I
took the tin off, they were dry and clean. My mess is 100% from the automatic
transmission leaking ATF fluid all over the place. I got under there, but have
not been able to find the part number. This transmission has a vacuum tube,
and from what I have heard, that means it "may" be a later model unit (same as
ones that were used into the early 90's.) I confirm this either way though. My
question is can anyone tell what type of transmission it us from the pics at
the link below, and where can I get gaskets for the belly pan etc? I've had a
hard time finding much.

The Bentley mentions the converter oil seal possibly being shot. Anyone have
experience taking care of this area?
