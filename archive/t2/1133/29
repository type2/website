Subject: Re: [T2] Early Deluxe Bay window rubber

you need a friend to help, you can do it by yourself, but a friend helps.

plan on addressing the rust you find too.  etching primer, primer, paint. 
plus if you bust the windshield your out another $200 ish

good write up in the bay window FAQ on Mr' Ratwells site,
http://www.ratwell.com/technical/FAQ.html

as well as this websites library. http://www.type2.com/
