dodge a100, looks more the the scooby mobile, than a vw bus, maybe a 
vanagon, but it is just a cartoon.

my bus is still broke, needs some tires, looks for some cool rims I could 
pull from the junk yard, but not sure which ones would be the right fit, I 
know the ride is going to change. any ideas appreciated.
