Subject: How hot does it get inside the heat exchangers

Hey everyone,
I was curious if anyone had any ideas how hot it gets inside the heat 
exchangers.  I'm looking to replace the material inside the exchangers 
with the following heat shield:

I spoke with the representative and they said the Iconel alloy was 
definitely overkill.  I'm thinking of going with the stainless steel, 
but there is also the aluminum shield as well.

The representative said that the melting point of the aluminum product 
is around 1100 and the stainless steel product melts around 1800.  I 
would imagine that the temperature inside the exchangers shouldn't get 
that high, but I figured I'd ask for some recommendations from the list. 
  Both of them are about the same flexibility as I need to wrap it 
around the fins of the exchanger.

I'm thinking of going with the stainless steel product just because it's 
probably going to be more durable than the aluminum.  Anyone have any 
thoughts?

thanks!
Mike
