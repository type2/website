Subject: Re: [T2] Heat exchanger paint

Mike,

If the metal is steel, why not a plating process? Electrogalvanize possibly? 
Hot dip?
No fumes, heat resistant, permananent, long lasting. Electro can be painted 
on the outside if desired.

Ok, just ordered my heat shields for my heat-exchanger refurbishing and
I've pretty much finished wire-wheeling these things to death.  I still
have to have the insides beat blasted because I can't effectively get in
there with the wire wheel, but I might try at it again if I feel motivated.

That said, I want to start planning on how to paint these.  My two
concerns are having a paint job on the inside that doesn't fumigate me
to death, and having paint that stays on strong.  This is bare metal, so
what recommendations would you have for me?

Thanks!
Mike
