Subject: Surging

My '79 fuel injection bus was running great after 3 years off the road.  
Then I stupidly ran out of gas last week.  Got it going again, now I 
have an intermittent "surging" problem.  Van runs fine, then cuts out 
completely for a fraction of a second before kicking in again.  Like 
taking my foot off the gas then stamping down again.  Usually happens 
going uphill in first or second with moderate throttle.  Highway driving 
at 60mph is fine.

I'm guessing a fuel line blockage, maybe from sediment at the bottom of 
the gas tank?
