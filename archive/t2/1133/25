That would be really easy to do with vinyl from a sign shop. Or with CGI 
for a commercial. I used to work in a sign shop back in college. I'd 
guess a few hours of work. Easy to get off later - well - easier than a 
full vehicle wrap. That's just stripes over a blue van. Damn I like the 
look of these old vans when they are clean and shiny with intact chrome 
trim. So distinctive compared to the modern vehicles.
