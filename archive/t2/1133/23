Subject: Alternator wiring question

Hi, I am trying to figure out the wiring from my alternator to voltage relay
and beyond.  It is a '74 1.8L carbbed engine, and body man, 'lopped' a lot of
wires off for whatever reason. When I crawl under and look at back of
alternator, there is no 'plug' to see, just a grey plastic covered thuck wire,
that has parts that go to starter solenoid '+" terminal, but nothing comes
back into engine compartment to plug into Voltage relay.  My question is, I
have a brand new alternator harness from "old Volks", with nice wires and
plastic ends to plug into relay, and alternator.  Is there a 'plug' hidden
inside the back of my alternator, that I can put new harness into, or is my
alternator not so equipped, and if so, can I splice as much as possible from
new, into old wiring?  Sorry for the length, just driving me crazy!  Cheers
Syd
