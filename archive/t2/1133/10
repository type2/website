Subject: T-shaped molding in Riviera conversions

HI Volks,

Anyone have any ideas on where to find brown 1/2" t-molding used for table/
cabinet edges?  I've searched high and low (Rockler, t-molding.com,
McMasterCarr), but the only 1/2" I've found is black or white.

GoWesty has the right color, but wrong width (
http://www.gowesty.com/ec_view_details.php?id=3287&category_id=&category_parent_id=);
I figure if I trim it, the edges will be too thick and noticeable (I
know, I have delicate VW sensibilities)....

Alternatively, if anyone has any brown t-trim from a Riviera or other
miscelaneous interior parts, please drop me a line!
Thanks for any help. Mike
