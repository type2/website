Subject: Early Deluxe Bay window rubber

I am curently looking to change out the 40+ year-old window rubber in my '70.
Winter approaches!  Anybody have tips on how to 'succesfully' replace deluxe
rubber with the aluminum strip intact?  Replace the rubber w/strip already in
the groove?  This stuff is too pricey to do twice.
