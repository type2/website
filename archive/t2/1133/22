Subject: ashtray

Hi,

Around these parts these days, there is a rash of ashtray change theft.

Usually, they leave the ashtray, but mine they stole. (for obvious
reasons.

I want to move back to the country.

My mechanic told me to just leave a cup of cash beside the drivers chair
and make their lives easier.

Anyone got an ashtray you can spare.

Alan
