I'd clean it all up, refill and drive it a little while and see where 
the leak is coming from.

You could have pan gasket problems, input shaft seal, leaky torque 
converter, axle seals, etc.

I wonder if there is some sort of flourescent dye that you could safely 
add to the fluid and then trace with a blacklight.
