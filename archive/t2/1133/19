Subject: Re: [T2] How hot does it get inside the heat exchangers

Its gotta be less than the 1100 otherwise the fins would melt. Of course the 
hottest point is where the aluminum interfaces with the steel exhaust tube. 
What is the highest temp for exhaust gases? The fins would be the hottest 
when the cabin heat is turned off, minimizing the flow past the fins. There 
is a small vent near the flaps to keep some air moving thru the housing. My 
best guess is around 6-700F with heater off. Can you do anything with a 
non-contact temp meter?

Subject: [T2] How hot does it get inside the heat exchangers


Hey everyone,
I was curious if anyone had any ideas how hot it gets inside the heat
exchangers.  I'm looking to replace the material inside the exchangers
with the following heat shield:

I spoke with the representative and they said the Iconel alloy was
definitely overkill.  I'm thinking of going with the stainless steel,
but there is also the aluminum shield as well.

The representative said that the melting point of the aluminum product
is around 1100 and the stainless steel product melts around 1800.  I
would imagine that the temperature inside the exchangers shouldn't get
that high, but I figured I'd ask for some recommendations from the list.
  Both of them are about the same flexibility as I need to wrap it
around the fins of the exchanger.

I'm thinking of going with the stainless steel product just because it's
probably going to be more durable than the aluminum.  Anyone have any
thoughts?

thanks!
Mike
