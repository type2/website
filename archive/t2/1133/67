key thing when putting in torque convertor seal.  which doesn't go in the 
torque convertor but on the transmission output shaft opening.

the seal does NOT seat all the way in, everyone want to push it in. it 
MUST be flush with the front edge of the opening.  and check the seal I 
have gotten some bad ones with some cracks. the presure is high on these.

if the seal is not flush at the front it will leak a lot.  this is not in 
the bentley or any other manual I have seen.

oh and be carefull the tranny is at least as heavy as the engine and the 
center drive shaft (oil pump) wants to fall out sometimes. just make sure 
it is all the way in before installing engine ,or it can damage the tranny 
pump and that means a tranny rebuild.

good luck
