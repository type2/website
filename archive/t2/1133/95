There are two reasons I think the Mystery Machine would be a Corvair
Greenbriar.  They are:

1.  Front mounted spare tire.  Who with a water cooled engine would want to
put something in front of the radiator to decrease air flow?  Nobody I can
think of unless you are around here in the winter and it's about -20 and
you're trying to keep everything warm.  This means the Mystery Machine is
air cooled and, thusly, a VW or Corvair.

2.  Rear doors.  The Mystery Machine's rear doors divided in the middle and
hinge on the sides.  No air cooled I know of has this as stock.  Not saying
it was never done, just not that I know of.  What I do know is the Corvair
Greenbriar rear doors are in this configuration.

What IS the original mystery machine? Corvair Greenbrier? I know the recent
live action movies used a modern Chevy unfortunately. I had hoped for a
Greenbrier or a Volkswagen.
