Alan,

I would agree with John. If the painter had prepped correctly, there would 
be no problems as you are seeing. Take it back and complain. If the painter 
is honest, he will do his best to fix it.

Subject: [T2] rust


About 3 years ago I had a body guy repaint my bus.

He sandblasted EVERYTHING.

He had it all summer claiming the humidity had to be exact.

He used the paint code behind the seat to paint it.

You don't want to know what I paid.

There is a crack bleeding rust on the drivers side windshield.

I touched the rear wheel well to a post and the paint cracked off paint.

It is now rusting.

A rust bubble has shown up on the rear bumper.

I would dearly love some help in how to protect this issue. I rustcheck
it most years.

Alan
