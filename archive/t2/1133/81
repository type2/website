Drove my Westy ('79) to the storage barn for the winter today.....  
snow in the air here in Nova Scotia! She starts hard when cold  
anyway, plus I need a new battery (looking at an Optima Red Top for  
Xmas maybe if I'm good!). About a 15 min drive, the BA6 gas heater  
hasn't been working in some time, so needless to say it was a cold  
trip for me. Somehow getting the BA6 running didn't seem a priority  
in July & August!.

Driveway seems pretty empty without it!!
