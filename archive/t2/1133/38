Subject: Spitty question, leaky headlamp buckets.

I have noticed water problems with my headlamps as well. I think this is due
to the lack of a drainage hole in the chrome ring. I believe there was one
there originally, I have aftermarket ones-or they are from a beetle. I have
been thinking about drilling a drain hole, but was not sure if that would
then cause the chrome ring to rust out real fast.
