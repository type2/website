Thanks Kevin,
I happen to have the bus chrome with the drain hole. Doesn't help.
BTW I have fairly new rubber gaskets.

I have noticed water problems with my headlamps as well. I think this is due
o the lack of a drainage hole in the chrome ring. I believe there was one
here originally, I have aftermarket ones-or they are from a beetle. I have
een thinking about drilling a drain hole, but was not sure if that would
hen cause the chrome ring to rust out real fast.
