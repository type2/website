Jules -

Best route to go is getting a handle for a 74-79 Bus.  The 68-73 is an
entirely different animal and is not interchangeable.

The sliding door outer handle on my '75 broke today.
I have the complete assembly from a '71 sliding door, aside from the
fact that I'll be left with an extra lock-hole (the '71's lock
assembly is in the handle), can the '71 complete door mechanism be
moved to a '75?
Am I going the wrong route? Would I be better off just getting a
new/used 75 handle. Money is an object so I'd obviously prefer to
reuse than to acquire new parts.
