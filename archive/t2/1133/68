Subject: Heat exchanger paint

Ok, just ordered my heat shields for my heat-exchanger refurbishing and 
I've pretty much finished wire-wheeling these things to death.  I still 
have to have the insides beat blasted because I can't effectively get in 
there with the wire wheel, but I might try at it again if I feel motivated.

That said, I want to start planning on how to paint these.  My two 
concerns are having a paint job on the inside that doesn't fumigate me 
to death, and having paint that stays on strong.  This is bare metal, so 
what recommendations would you have for me?

Thanks!
Mike
