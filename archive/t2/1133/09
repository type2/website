Hey Syd,

I saw some of those plastic plugs while looking around my local Ace.. didn't
realize the Vanagons used them.  My cardboard is pretty torn up (even tho
the front vinyl is perfect) which makes using the stock clips more of a
PIA... so I might grab a couple of those plugs to see how they do. Thanks
again everyone for tips. Mike
