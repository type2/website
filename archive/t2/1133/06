Do not install them cracked.  They might further crack and send pieces 
of plastic into your engine, and the cracks might mess up the spray 
pattern and result in poor fuel atomization.

Send 'em in and if I remember correctly, they'll change the part that 
you're referring to.  Plus then you'll have 'em clean and have the flow 
rate of your injectors verified.  It was around $80 which is well worth 
the peace of mind that your 30 year-old injectors are still working 
normally.

I went through cruzinperformance.com - great service and friendly people!
