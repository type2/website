Subject: West Coast Mule Needed...Wolfsburg Interior parts need to get

Hi Volks,

A few months ago I purchased a 1988 Wolfsburg Vanagon from a couple 
towing it through Ontario. They were using it as a cargo hauler and had 
left the back seat, rear cushion and middle seats in their garage on 
vancouver island. They have (finally) returned home from an extended 
vacation and are interested in getting the seats out of their garage and 
headed east to join the rest of the Vanagon.

The seller is willing to meet a courier in Nanaimo. My employer has a
branch office in Burnaby (near Vancouver) where I can have the seats 
shipped on a pallet to the Toronto office where I work. I am looking for 
someone who would be able to connect the dots. I would be willing to pay 
for your time and tolls as required.

If anyone out that way can lend a hand or possibly suggest an
alternative method I would appreciate it. P-mail me and I will provide
the pickup contact and drop-zone info.

Thanks,

Greg Potts
