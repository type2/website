Subject: wiper linkage

I seem to have nothing but trouble with my wiper system.

When the linkage looses it's load from a fair amount of rain on the
windshield, it starts to make a thwacking noise. like something is
really loose.

I am assuming bushings.

If that is the case, how can I fix this problem.
