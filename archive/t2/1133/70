Subject: RE: [T2] Heat exchanger paint

You could have them ceramic coated, or you could 'aluminize' them.  I just
painted my JSC (Johnny's Speed and Chrome)muffler(still going strong) with
VHT's header paint.  It has some type of ceramic in it that cures when baked
properly.  It's heat and chemical resistant.  Supposedly good to 2,000
degrees.  No, that isn't a typo.  Nice aluminum color too!
