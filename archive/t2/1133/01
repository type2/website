does it feel like you're losing power or you're having a burst of power. 
  An intermittent blockage feels like you're getting the life sucked out 
of your engine every now and then.  Also, in first or second gears, it's 
going to be more noticeable.

Take a look at your fuel filter and see what it looks like.  This is one 
of those things that is a pain to diagnose...

good luck!
