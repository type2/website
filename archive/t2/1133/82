Be good enough to get it! I just found my red top that I thought had
been stolen during a break in. It's been sitting under the hood of a
Jeep CJ-5 that I've had no use for and am preparing to sell.

It's been there for at least 3 years, probably 4. Unused. (+ cable
disconnected.)

I put a meter on it.

10.4 volts. It might have been able to spin a well tuned VW motor
enough to start it.

It's on the charger no to see how well it does.
