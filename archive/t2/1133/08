Advance Auto Parts
 
BWD Injector
Part No. 57515D

Have em look up an '81 or '82 Vanagon, they haven't listed the bus in years. 
They are also used on some Cadillac of the same vintage, though I forget the
crossover.
 
Stil $39.89 after all these years, frankly, unless you look at the spray
pattern of ALL your injectors, I'd reccomend anyone replace ALL of your
injectors with any engine rebuild, or any major overhaul/takedown.  Or every
10 years or so, particularly with infrequent use.  Am I saying I don't run 30
year old injectors, no not at all, but penny wise/pound foolish and all.  $160
may save an engine/head from a lean running hot situation and a $2000+
rebuild.
 
These have been the deal FOREVER as far as injectors for the bus/vanagon, they
have been under $40 each for 15 years now.  Tip style is different now days,
but fit/work just fine, and in fact, will not crack like Chris's.
 
If no Advance around (like me in AK) con a friend into buying em for you and
slapping them in a flat rate box, though it appears Advance will "ship to
home" in the 48.
 
I've used these for years, last time I bought them (admittedly 8-9 years back)
they were new Lucas injectors (post merger so don't laugh) don't appear that
today at least in the picture on the website but whatever they are, they are
better than what you got now volks.

was fine until I dropped it.  Injector 4 has obviously been cracked 
for some time.  Do I need to replace these?  They are cracked on the 
part that is inside the manifold.  I looked up replacements and I 
thought I would replace them all, but that is more then $200.

Your help would be greatly appreciated.
