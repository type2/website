Subject: New LARGER Ezy-Awning

I have received a number of emails from list members over the last few years
suggesting a larger version of our popular Ezy-Awning.  I'm happy to
announce that I took your advice and now have a new "super-sized" version on
the way.  At about 11 feet across, it pretty much covers the side of your
Bus from end to end.  It's coming in December, and we are running a special
Pre-Order price now - just $129, which is only $10 more than the price of
the standard Ezy Awning. This offer will be limited to the first 100 orders.


See http://busdepot.com/details/awning.jsp for details.
