>Was the bronze starter nose bushing put there to save the block ?

There is a starter with a nose.. [SR17] that is an automatic starter , self
supporting armature as it has 2 bearing points,

almost all motor rotors have at least 2 bearing points to spin on.... so the
starter motor needs 2 bearing points as well.
In the case of the vw starter,,, [SR15 or SR87] one bearing is integral to
the starter motor body near the brush end.. but the gear end does NOT have a
bearing.. in the starter body,, but has one to support the shaft built into
the transmission bellhousing. The bronze bushing is the other bearing point

without the bushing , the bearing point is NOT along the axis of rotation,,
and the armature will most likely rub on the pole pieces inside the
starter.. and usually causes soooo much drag with the magnetic effect ,, it
will not spin..

or, if the bushing is worn.. same...

or if the wrong bushing is installed,,, same.
bushings come with OD and ID differences....
6v bellhousing,, 6v starter shaft..
6v bellhousing, 12v starter shaft
12v bellhousing 12v starter shaft.. and there maybe more...

here is a picture of the 12v 1974 "Westy"  starters,,, which are really
Volkswagen starters btw
