Subject: Re: [T2] '74 with automatic transmission leaks

Thanks for the replies. It is for sure the early model transmission. I drove
it up to a friends house today to have him make a custom mount for the Espar
B4 heater that we're installing, and I blew about a half quart all over the
place. It was about a 40 to 45 mile trip. The under carriage is a total mess.

We left it up there and will be dropping the engine and transmission shortly,
with a full set if gaskets and seals in hand. It appears to leaking from the
torque converter area.

As far as the operation of the unit, it has performed fine as long as fluid
levels were maintained.

Will keep posted.
