vacuum shift is probably the early .003 auto tranny   one sure way to tell 
is which side the shifter is on. the .003 is on the left side (drivers 
side in USA) while the later .010 it is on the right side.

depends on where the leak is coming from, at the torque converter it is 
probably the TC seal which is readily avaliable for about $10 from most of 
the regular folks I get mine from Bus Depot.  the oil pan seal is also 
avaliable.  not much else can be gotten easily or changed easily
