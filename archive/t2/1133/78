Subject: Parting out '77

There is a lot of interest in my '77 Westfalia (
http://www.flickr.com/photos/boletivore/5118722444/in/photostream/ )parts
and a friend of mine could really use the engine.

I would like to see all of the great parts from it go to use.

I was wondering if anybody in the Portland, Oregon area would be interested
in having it brought to their house, pull the engine for us and let me grab
a few other things like the wiring to the audio cabinet from the dash, and
then they can keep it and part it out and make all the money they want.

My friends all want to do this but they want to keep it in my yard and I am
just not interested.

Thanks,

James Neumeister
