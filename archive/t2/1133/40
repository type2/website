I think leaks just come with the territory, and you just have to count
on water getting in.

So good drainage on the rings and in the bucket are necessary for
water to exit, and good paint integrity on the metal is necessary to
prevent rust.

Your buckets may actually dry out faster if you ditch the rubber seals.

I'm running H4 upgrades on a 64, so sealing is impossible for me.
Drainage is what I need.
