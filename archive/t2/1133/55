No, it's this one:

[T2] West Coast Mule Needed...Wolfsburg Interior parts need to get
from Nanaimo to Burnaby BC

Greg Potts to Type2
Oct 26 (2 days ago)
Hi Volks,

A few months ago I purchased a 1988 Wolfsburg Vanagon from a couple
towing it through Ontario. They were using it as a cargo hauler and
had left the back seat, rear cushion and middle seats in their garage
on vancouver island. They have (finally) returned home from an
extended vacation and are interested in getting the seats out of their
garage and headed east to join the rest of the Vanagon.

The seller is willing to meet a courier in Nanaimo. My employer has a
branch office in Burnaby (near Vancouver) where I can have the seats
shipped on a pallet to the Toronto office where I work. I am looking
for someone who would be able to connect the dots. I would be willing
to pay for your time and tolls as required.

If anyone out that way can lend a hand or possibly suggest an
alternative method I would appreciate it. P-mail me and I will provide
the pickup contact and drop-zone info.

Thanks,

Greg Potts
