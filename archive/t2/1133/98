That's the Dodge I was thinking of.

Still like to think the Mystery Machine was aircooled though...

For wheels - look for Mercedes rims. I bought a set a year or two ago 
that are BBS rims. In excellent condition.

Next idea is to look at the immitation Mercedes rims that places like 
Tire Rack sells.

15" rims were a big goal of mine. Still haven't installed them though 
b/c the bus is in "suspended animation".
