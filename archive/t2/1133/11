Subject: Cabinet Moldings

Thank you Mike! I have the same problem. I also went to Rockler and found
the black and white T-molding and that's the closest I've come to a good
alternative. Another suggestion I've received from the local VW parts place
is to try an RV place. I am also looking for the moldings that line the
edges of the cabinet doors (look like crosses) and the proper piping that
separates the the cabinets from the body.

Thanks!
