Hi all,'

I just got the new air compressor hooked up ,and with my nephew's help
,we started to cut out the rear quarters. The piece of metal that is
directly behind the rear wheels need to be replaced. I found that piece
somewhere, but I can't remember where. Does anyone know where to get
one? I think it's the rear wheel well.

Thanks for the help.

Bob
