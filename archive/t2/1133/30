Subject: Re: under floor diagrams of 1969 vw bus

I have added the type2.com mailing list to this email thread, to see if anyone
has any info they can provide. The description of your problem, in my opinion,
leaves many issues to be the possible culprit. A picture or two may help.

Good luck,

Troy

Hello,

I am writing to see if you could direct us to under floor specifications of a
1969 vw bus, type II. The old floor covering in the mid-section 'cargo door'
area was rotted out and we're installing new (plywood) and drilled some holes,
and now the bus (which was working just fine) is stuck in first gear. We can't
even get it into neutral. I am a bit concerned that something was damaged in
the drilling and am trying to discern if there's a connection between the
floor work and what's happened to an otherwise very faithful bus. The screws
were very short, apparently, so only would have gone a bit into the other
side.

Can you help direct us to diagrams, or give your opinion on what might have
happened (i.e., if you think we hit something horridly crucial to engaging the
gears while drilling)? The new floor is just in the cargo/passenger area--not
up front--and screws were very minimally placed.

I humbly acknowledge that this points to our ignorance with the under belly of
our bus (even though we've had it for more than a decade now), but we are
getting ready to move 3,000 miles with 2 children, so are not operating with
all our inner workings intact. Morever, mechanics isn't my husband's forte...

We would be most grateful for any help you can give!

thank you,
humble and (usually) faithful stewards of a beloved old bus
