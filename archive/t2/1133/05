Subject: Cracked fuel injectors

The other day, Foster started making a loud racket that seemed to vary  
with engine RPM - not wheel RPM.  I opened the hatch and listened and  
it seemed to be coming from the front of the engine.  It's not a  
thumping, as in inside the crankcase, but a rattling.  It seemed to me  
to be something in the bellhousing.

This morning I pulled the engine and everything looked good.  I  
removed the clutch and it was OK (although by the looks of things -  
its a new clutch - the flywheel could use resurfacing).  I thought  
maybe its in the fan housing, so I took that off.  There was some  
chunder in the bottom, but nothing that could make the hardware sound  
I was hearing.

I figured while I had the engine out, I would put on the insulated  
heater boxes that I picked up at a VW show.  It turns out the tin has  
to come off to do this right.  Lo and behold, I find a dead mouse and  
nesting on the 1 & 2 side.  God knows how long that's been there.

Since the runners were off, I thought I'd put on new fuel injector  
seals and blocks.  Injectors 1 & 2 were fine, just dirty.  Injector 3  
was fine until I dropped it.  Injector 4 has obviously been cracked  
for some time.  Do I need to replace these?  They are cracked on the  
part that is inside the manifold.  I looked up replacements and I  
thought I would replace them all, but that is more then $200.

Your help would be greatly appreciated.
