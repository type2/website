I fixed 2 today. I had just replaced the black/red wire that runs from the 
ignition switch to the starter motor, that worked great, but suddenly I 
started blowing 16A fuses. I studied the Bentley colour wiring diagram (I 
got through the list) this morning, made my plans (I was going to change out 
my light switch, since the power to the ignition switch seems to go through 
it for some Teutonic reason)  I just got wound up and suddenly noticed that 
I had pinched the black wire from the switch when I bolted the housing back 
together, it was crushed and copper was showing-beautiful. I just had to 
tape it up, dead short solved.
Took the bus for a drive, 4 blocks from home it starts bucking and dying. 
What the hell...made it a few blocks and the bus died totally.  Took a look 
at my immaculate engine compartment, with new everything in it...hmmm, 
newish Bosch Blue Coil...could it be?   I swapped in my old, rusty black 
coil that thank God I had kept in Tillie the two ton tool box, bus fired 
right up and runs like a top now.
Anyone know of a source for new, stock, black, German, Bosch coils?

Sometimes these electrical issues are the hardest thing of all with these 
beasts, and sometimes you get lucky...  :-)
