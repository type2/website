Shipping cost was the reason I quit using JC Whitney once upon a time... And the lack of quality. (back in the 90's). 

They figured the cost of shipping off of the price of the item as I recall. Expensive strofoam part? Expensive shipping. Cheap heavy iron tool? Cheap shipping. Never made sense... <grin!>
