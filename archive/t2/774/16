Subject: VW parts vendor with fastest delivery...

Howdy Y'all,
I am a lonely Midwesterner (ie. No VW parts dealers
ANYWHERE near).  I am looking for a good vendor that
has good, fast delivery service. I have been ordering
most of my parts from Cip1.com, but by the time they
ship from their warehouse in British Columbia to the
distrubution center in Washington State, and then to
me in Ohio, it is usually close to 2 weeks before I
get my parts.  I am needing a rocker panel for my 67
bus ASAP. I wanted to order from Bus Depot, they had
the part for lowest price, but their customer service
quoted me $30+ dollars shipping on the part which only
cost $27, so obviously NOT an option in this
situation. The 2 specific companies I am wondering
about are Wolfsburg West and Bus-Boys. So any
Midwesterners who have ordered from them and can
remark on their delivery times\service??? Any other
vendors I don't know about???

Peace, John Baker
