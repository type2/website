Hi John,

I got a chance to see the DTM at the 2004 June Jitterbug and talk to  
Jake Raby for a while about it.

Germansupply.com brought him up for the weekend... I got to drive the  
red 914 in the background back to Toronto after Jake was finished  
with it. It was a blast on the highway.

But like you said, I don't think the DTM would work in a bus.... yet.

Happy trails,
