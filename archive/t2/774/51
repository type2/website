 As to the coil wires......
 
 The wires on the - terminal of the coil go to the
 distributor and to the fan 
 unit where it goes into a connector with other
 wires.
 
 On the + terminal of the coil I have a black ground
 that has an inline fuse 
 that snakes over to the left side of the
 compartment, a black ground (that 
 got hot when it was on the wrong terminal) that
 comes in a small harness 
 with the oil sender wire and a tan with green
 stripes wire, and a white wire 
 wrapped in a brown sleeve that travels clear from
 the right side of the 
 engine poking out of a bigger harness.

*WHOA WHOA WHOA!!!!!!

*That single white wire is your injector trigger
signal wire. It HAS to go on the NEGATIVE side of the
coil. Everytime your points open, the white wire sends
a signal to the ECU to fire off the injectors. 

The plenum is the black unit in the center where the
intake runners meet.
