Very possible. Next time it happens, jump a wire or
screw driver from the big post (where the power comes
from the battery) to the small push on connector where
the wire from the ignition switch normally attaches.
You should hear an audible "Clunk" as the armature on
the solenoid engages. If you do NOT hear this, then it
is likely a bad solenoid.
