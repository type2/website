Subject: It didnt start!

Hiya everyone,

A funny thing happend on my way home from the boat.....

Or not.  I went to start the bus after work yesterday and nothing.  I
know it wasnt in the ignition switch 'cause the lights would dim, and
I know it wasnt the starter, 'cause when i crossed it with a screw
driver it turned over and started up.  So, i did get it started with
the screw driver and drove home.  then this a.m. it started right up
like normal.

courious.

So..  can the heat play a part?  we've had a very hot few weeks here
in the DC metro, and very humid to boot.  I wonder if the starter
sylinoid is on its way out?

Thoughts o' mighty brain trust?
