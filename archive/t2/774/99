Subject: new coil from VW

My Blue coil died, so I started phoning around. My local Bug shop has 
nothing in stock. Local jobbers were quoting me $55 for a coil.
I called the VW dealer, and low and behold, $27 Canadian  for a new coil 
from them!
It came today. Made in Brazil, in a white box with VW Audi all over it.  The 
coil is silver with a blue Bosch sticker.
Part number is   043 905 115 C.
