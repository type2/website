But lawnmowers and leaf blowers are acceptable. Right? Old cars idling and electric drills are not... <grin!> 

I TOTALLY understand. We moved up in neighborhood in Feb and did alot of tiptoeing around our property for a while. Then I decided screw 'em. We're noisy every once in a while. Occasionally... We take care of the place so who has anything to complain about? Noise at my house means the table saw for 4-5 cuts at 10:30 PM inside the garage but with the door open. No immediate neighbors on that side. 

You have one of those neighborhood kids with a car stereo that thumps hard as he passes through at all hours of the day or night? <grin!> Go after them! 

Tell the cops that you work nights and the neighbors are keeping you up with their lawnmowers and leaf blowers... <grin!> 

Sounds like one of your neighbors have been stewing over your old VW bus for a long time... 

"If he does that ONE more time, I'm calling the cops..."
