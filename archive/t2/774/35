Subject: 73 bus top dead center

I want to verify the engine is at top dead
center before adjusting valves again..

the marks on the crank pulley are painted,
and I don't want to rely on them (these aren't
manufacturing marks, but a previous owners
marks)...

With my 71 bus I could stick a screw driver
in the spark plug hole, and turn the engine
until the piston was at the top of the compression
stroke.

with this 73 it looks like the plugs are mounted
in the side of the head, so the screwdrive trick
wont work?

I have the "official vw manual" and adjusting valve
section is horrible...  "turn engine to top dead
center with distributor rotor in the cylinder #1
firing position"...  The idiots guide has better
information..

The degree marks on the engine case are still
visible (put there by volkswagen)...

How can I verify %100 TDC ?
