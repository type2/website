Subject: Dixie Bus Gathering

Attention all T shirt Collectors.  I now have the 2005 design for the Dixie
Bus Gathering, courtesy of Adam Narraway in Canada.  Thank you Adam, I love
it.
Anywhooooo, time is limited, so I have no promises that delivery will be
made by Dixie Bus Gathering which is August 11-14, in Central Ohio.

View the shirt here....  www.geocities.com/dixie_bus_gathering

I will accept pre orders, I will accept shipping orders, and I will accept
orders at the event and ship to you.  See how accommodating I can be?

The colors will be "hot" fluorescent pinks, greens and yellows.  I am not
sure of the costs, since I have not ordered.  I would assume, depending on
the quantity, $17-20 per shirt.  Probably less.

Send me your orders, and how you want em, and if you desire a certain "hot"
color.  If not, the color will be my choice I guess.

Make it a Great Day!!
