Hi Greg,

DTM, Down the Middle, replaces your existing bus pancake configuration
with an upright style system like the Type 1. If you go here:

http://www.massivetype4.com/index2.shtml

the type 4 DTM is the lower picture. Then if you click on the picture,
it takes you to more pictures. I don't think you could fit this in a
bus due to the overhead clearance. It seems to be made for putting
type 4 motors in bugs and such. But while on that page, if you click
on "Type 4 DTM and Your Car", it takes you to this menu which includes
buses:

If you click on late buses, you get this page:

http://www.massivetype4.com/fit/bus-late.shtml

which says:

""1972-79 Busses:

You guys are lucky, Type IV power was factory in your vehicles, let us
add more with our "Camper special" or our "Powerstroke" Bus engines.

Stay tuned as we have plans for an updated cooling fan arrangement for
better cooling with the stock TIV shroud arrangement!""

So I don't know what he has in mind for buses.

 Will the DTM fit around the rear engine hanger on a bus?

 I saw the DTM in action (running on a stand) at last year's June
 jitterbug. It was being set up for a porsche speedster.  It looks
 like a very well thought out product, but I don't know that you could
 pot one in a bus, as there may not be room for the rear hanger. But
 I'd love to be wrong about that.
