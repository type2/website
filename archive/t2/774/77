Subject: RE: [T2] VW parts vendor with fastest delivery...

I live in the southeast and have been very happy with
BD.  I never pay for premium service.  The bus is 30
years old, what's a few days?  But I've always gotten
my stuff in 3 to 5 days from order.   Either by phone
or internet.  And Ron is a valuable contributor to the
list. From what I've heard of CIPI, I won't be
ordering from them.  Cheers...KR
