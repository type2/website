I have a suggestion for Karl about this:

What about putting kits together and selling them for $100?

Not the drums or shoes but everything else. I'm sure folks would like
that, and you'd make a bit of profit.

For that matter, you could do something similar for the 79 Cali
electronic ignition rigs!
