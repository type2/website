Even before her accident this happened to a few customers. I believe it's
the reason BD stopped selling her canvases: while excellent sometimes there
were delays that frustrated customers.

PLFVW makes a first rate product.

If she doesn't answer her phone (602-315-0952) I'd assume she's out of state
on business or taking care of family matters. It's a very small operation
after all.
