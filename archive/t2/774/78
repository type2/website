Subject: Re: FW: [T2] Why not to live in pretentious neighborhoods

I'm lucky to live in the neighborhood I live in. 
Several people fix their own cars.  But some of the
newer developments have deed restrictions.  Some of my
friends have run into trouble putting up ham radio
antennae.  You spend a quarter mill on a house, then
the neighbors tell you what you can't do.  Not to get
too political but I'm a real property rights advocate.
   The Supremes blew it on that one.  And Cliff, I'd
love to have a place where I can shoot my guns in the
back yard.  But it'd be a long drive to work! 
Cheers...KR
