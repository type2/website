Subject: Re: [T2] VW parts vendor with fastest  delivery--Mofoco??

I have had good luck with Wolfsburg West over the
years, but Bus Depot is closer.  Mofoco is closer to
me, but I have had TERRIBLE experiences with them that
have never been resolved--wrong parts, told that
things were shipped when they weren't shipped for
weeks afterwards, just an AWFUL experience!!! Sort of
like getting a GEX engine, I suppose.  (If Mofoco guys
are reading this, I have the documentation, records of
phone calls,etc., to back up my claims of poor
service).
The vendors that participate on this list are the guys
I would go to first--I did much of my busiiness with
Wolfsburg West in 1987-89 when I was working on my
double cab a lot.

Try mofoco.com.  They are in Milwakee, WI.
There is also a Guy in CO, whos website I can't find 
at the moment, but 
he is on the list.
