Subject: Re: [T2] 73 bus smog pump

If you are in California, go ahead and remove the stuff, but keep ALL
of it stashed away to reinstall.  California has a penchant for
changing the smog check standards every couple of years ("Legislature
Remorse"), so I'd hate to see someone have to go and look for the
stuff after throwing it away (or selling to someone else).

Plug the ports in a way so that they can be used again if the above happens
