Subject: Re: [T2] Why not to live in pretentious neighborhoods

I too have had "issues" with neighbors, zoning inspectors, etc...having
come through them, I would strongly encourage you NOT to make it
worse...review the zoning laws for your community - you'd be amazed at how
many you're probably unintentionally breaking, and once you start in, they
will nail you on every one...Raleigh is pretty bad on that, and of course,
so much of it is subjective and left up to the inspector to
determine...friends of mine just had their bus stickered sitting in the
driveway because they had boxes inside it...(not allowed to store things
in vehicles)
It can get a lot worse. I ended up joining the neighborhood association,
just so I could be at the meetings where they talk about everyone
else...now at least I can speak up and try to avoid further
confrontations...dealing with the city and zoning inspectors is no fun at
all - better to head it off before they start coming out...
