<Perhaps its time for you to install a "stinger"
muffler on your T2?  Oh, I guess that would not work
out.  Stinger mufflers are not street legal.  But it
doesn't stop me from dreaming-up devious bus noise
making techniques.   And of course, you would need to
turn your stinger-equipped bus ignition off at 9:59:59
PM.>

hmmm, one of those big beach slingshots and cherry bomb firecrackers.... Launch 'em at their front door... 

<JUST KIDDING!>

Maybe you need to host a "Tech Day" for 29 of your favorite VW friends... <grin!> 

We do that in the local Corvair club I belong to. A dozen of us and various elderly cars will show up for a morning of wrenching. Do yours in the evening and like Cliff said, end it at 9:59:59... <grin!> 

Remember ANYTHING can set off a neighbor... I heard about a lawsuit where two girls got sued for leaving freshbaked cookies on their neighbors doorstep as a gift!!! And won...

Could this be because of the graying of our population (more picky old folks as the baby-boomers get old and grumpy)?
