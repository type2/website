Subject: Re: [T2] Valve Adjustment Redux (Solved)

Gave up and took it into the shop, needed to have a fuel-injector stud
re-threaded anyhow.  Mechanic adjusted one cylinder's valves and said "I
could swear these are hydraulic".  Hmm.. that would explain the
squishiness now, wouldn't it?

Called my wife, and she dug through the folder of receipts we inherited
with the bus.  Sure 'nuf, there's a small generic hand-written receipt
from 1997.  "Hydraulic lifters - $76.00".

The kicker was that I had adjusted the valves so far wrong, he didn't
think the bus would've run at all if they weren't hydraulic.  'course,
if they weren't hydraulic, I wouldn't have set them wrong in the first
place...

Sometimes it pays to pay someone who knows what they're doing.
