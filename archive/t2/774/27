Corbett,

This is a tool that came with every air cooled vw made.

Spark plug size on one end and lug nut size on the other.

It is hollow, but with the hole thru the side to stick part of the lug 
"iron" into in order to try and get your wheels lugs off with it.

I don't think this will do you any good...hmmm might though if you can get 
the tubing on your gauge thru it.

Corbett, I hate to say it , but how about a better compression 
tester....or go down to one of the flaps that rents these and get it to 
test with.

Cheers, dave
