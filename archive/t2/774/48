Look at line ESC 10. The A row has the so called limits for the two tests. ASM 5015 is 15mph and ASM 2525 is 25mph.

Each emission particulate has it's own limit column: HC, CO, NO.

Then there are a second set of GP numbrs. The gross polluters numbers shouldn't be exceeded. 

FWIW, those numbers don't match my report. When I first saw them I thought we were all doomed.

15 mph - RPM 1990
%CO2 13.9 - %O2 1.2 - PPM HC 48/204 - %CO 0.19/1.66 - PPM NO 652/1534 - PASS

25 mph - RPM 2018
%CO2 13.8 - %O2 1.5 - PPM HC 31/169 - %CO 0.11/1.46 - PPM NO 563/1294 - PASS

I'll do that once I find a scanner. The numbers above should be a big help to you.
