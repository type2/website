Subject: unclear symptoms

This past summer I have been experiencing problems starting the bus after 
driving it for a while. I changed the ground cable to the battery and the 
cable to the starter. It seemed to fix the problem but it came back after a 
month or so.

I would go wiggle the cables, wiggle the cables at the starter/selenoid, hit 
the selenoid and starter with a wrench and vrrooom vroom it would start up. 
Never the same order or anything but it would go.

Yesterday it happened twice, today once.
The last time I didn't do anything to the bus but tried it after 4 minutes 
and it started.
What does this sound like, ignition switch faulty? hot start problem? Sticky 
starter, dying selenoid?
I've been through muir's and just not sure what to do or in what order 
really.

Thoughts?
