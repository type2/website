Jenny,

Awwww....my bet is that part of your carb has fallen down into
the intake and stuck in the valve.

Check carb for missing parts, usually the fuel pump injection 
tube...little u shaped tube at the top(or at least it's supposed to be!

The good news...

If it is that part, then it probably hasn't hurt anything and you can pull 
the head off, take it out and put the head back on and go on.

Cheers, dave
