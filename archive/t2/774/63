Subject: Re: [T2] 73 bus top dead center

You may recall my 72's engine had bad endplay, and my donated Porsche
engine had a knock. The knock turned out to be a wood screw dropped
into the intake which caused only cosmetic damage, so I now have my 72
back together with the Porsche engine.

Is this TDC info also valid for the porsche engine? I remember some
talk about it being different.

 The valves stay closed for many degrees at TDC so the timing scale is
accurate enough.
