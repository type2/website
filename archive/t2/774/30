John,

I've got a solution for you. I found one in stock at a distributor in your
home state, and can have them dropship it directly to you  You'll have it in
a few working days for half the shipping cost. (As a few people have pointed
out, it is the size and weight of the package that deternines the UPS rate.
Even though a rocker panel is cheap, it's big. On air shipments, UPS tacks
on a substantial surcharge if the package is "oversized." But by
dropshipping it from a location near you, we can switch to ground and cut
the surcharge way down, and you'll still have it quickly.)  Let me know if
this works for you.
