Subject: Re: [T2] Why not to live in pretentious neighborhoods

I can relate to the stories as I live in one of those neighborhoods.  

Key here is that everyone knows that I know how to fix stuff and/or give
advice on how to fix stuff (cars, stuff around the house, computers, etc.)
and often help my "10 thumbed" neighbors when they're in a jam - so they put
up with my collection of vehicles (only 5 now - was up to 10 a while back)
and the noise.
