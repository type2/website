Subject: Re: [T2] It didnt start!

Chris,

First, I just happen to have a very heavy duty Ford style relay
sitting around on my work bench.  Left over from another project that
I managed never to finish.  Do you happen to have a write up on this
procedure?

Second, Where is the Westy?

thanks,
David
