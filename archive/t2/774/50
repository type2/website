Subject: RE: [T2] starting problem update

I really hate sounding like a bigger idiot than I already am....but, 
Richard, although I know I've run across ther term before, I'm not sure what 
or where the plenum is......couldn't find it in the manuals....

As to the coil wires......

The wires on the - terminal of the coil go to the distributor and to the fan 
unit where it goes into a connector with other wires.

On the + terminal of the coil I have a black ground that has an inline fuse 
that snakes over to the left side of the compartment, a black ground (that 
got hot when it was on the wrong terminal) that comes in a small harness 
with the oil sender wire and a tan with green stripes wire, and a white wire 
wrapped in a brown sleeve that travels clear from the right side of the 
engine poking out of a bigger harness.

I searched my manuals (Bently, Muir and Chiltons) for a pic or diagram of 
the coil setup but found none.

Thanks for your help. This is driving me a bit crazy!! Usually, I'm a fairly 
competent mechanic but I do some dumb things sometimes. Then wonder at 
myself. Like I wonder why I didn't wrap and label the coil wires before 
taking them off. Oh well. Next time.
