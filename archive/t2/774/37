Subject: starting problem

Hi list, Here's one for you...  I boneheadedly hooked up two coil wires 
wrong..... swapped the black ground from the (voltage regulator? on the 
upper right front wall of the eng. compartment) and the red wire that comes 
off the fan. I righted it within seconds, howeve, when the black ground got 
hot.

So I put on my spare coil which is firing nice white hot sparks, replaced 
burned out fuses, points, condensor, cap and rotor. It's caught and started 
on its own a couple times but only for about two seconds. I can get a start 
with starting fluid (only done a couple times to help diagnose--I know the 
effects of too much use of that stuff), but it dies right away. I figure 
it's not getting fuel. I haven't checked for fuel pressure yet, but that'll 
be the next path to take. Had to get out of the hot sun for a bit.

But my question is..... could I have fried the elec. fuel pump or maybe that 
pesky double relay?

Thanks in advance!

George
