Subject: It's not fixed.

Well, the helicoil repair went well as I said in my neighborhood post.

I drove the bus to work this morning: Bucking and low power.

I checked for vacuum leaks when I got here and I can't find a single one.

Here's what's been done:

Fuel pump swapped between stock mechanical and crappy Facet. No
difference except noise. ;-)
Swapped between points and Pertronix. No difference.
Replaced plug wires. No difference.
Checked plugs: even medium/dark gray color on all 4.
Swapped cap and rotor. No difference.
Checked valves. No movement. The adjusters are all pretty close to
each other in what sticks out of the rockers.
Checked float levels.
Checked and cleaned jets.
Checked and cleaned fuel filter.
Checked for fuel pumping from facet.
Swapped between 3 different coils.
Replaced fuel lines again with fuel injection hose for that extra stiffness.

Only thing I haven't done is a compression check. I can't find the new
gauge I bought last week. Sigh.

Any ideas on what to check for?
