What Richard said!  That is indeed the most likely cause, but also....

Since you had the wires off the coil and did hook them backward....

You *did* check tha tthe FI coil sensor wire is now on the correct
terminal, right?  It (the tan wire) goes on the same post as the wire to
the distributor.  If it's on the wrong post, the enjectors will never
fire.

OOK!
