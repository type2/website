Subject: Odd noises from beneath...

I need some help diagnosing a couple of drivetrain/suspension-related
noises on my '79 Westy. First off, there's an intermittent "thump"
from the vicinity of the passenger-side front wheel over rough
surfaces (and only heard at low speeds), as if something might be
loose. I don't feel anything strange in the steering; should I be
looking for something like a bad shock mount or something more
serious?

The second noise seems to be coming the rear, and is sort of a brief
"chuckathumpachuckathumpa" sound when making *right* turns at fairly
low speed. I usually only hear it when making the right turn at the
end of my block while leaving the neighborhood. No noise at all when
turning left. It doesn't sound to me like CVs, as that's usually more
of a clicking sound, and also both rear axles have been recently
replaced. Could this be a wheel bearing problem? The bus has less than
80k original miles on it, so I wouldn't expect any really worn
driveline components but who knows? Any insight is much appreciated-
