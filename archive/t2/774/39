I'd tend to agree with Messa Corbett about BD. I always order online,
because that is what internet is made for. What is the point of
spelling a part number on the phone.

Once I called BD to have the internet order processed fast and they
did without me paying anyting extra. Order shipped the next day

The other times I order and wait - quite a bit. I placed my last order
on July 21st and BD shipped on 26th. Maybe they are even more busy in
summer.

It's OK though because usually I receive great stuff from them. (Like
the bus cutlery set ! )

When I want to really be impressed by shipping I order some toys from
newegg.com :) That has nothing to do with the bus though...
