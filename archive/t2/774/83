My bus is parked on the edge of a public alley and it has been
occasionally subject to some vandalism...well being in the central core of
the city, when kids started hanging around I found the local 24/7 country
radio station and started playing that loud enough for them to "decide" to
go elsewhere...  (remember Rap is the music de jur in this neighborhood)


mostly the younger kids leave things alone, they know when I'm in the
garage I have small toolbox with stuff they can borrow to fix their bikes
and things, so they pretty much protect the area.
