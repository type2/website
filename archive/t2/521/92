Subject: front end damage - be needin' a new nose

So .... I was leaving a parking lot last weekend when an idiot ignored a stop
sign and speeded right in front of me.  Snow was pilled like ... 10' high
around the intersection so visibility was bad and ... anyway - he is 100% at
fault.

So ... I need a new nose section.  So far the insurance company has been easy
to deal with ... the appraiser was around on Friday and is suggesting a body
shop that specializes in European cars (BMW's and Mercedes') where the owner
has an interest in VW's ... so far so good.

Anyway - so I noticed it is pretty easy to find the new nose section - lots of
places have it - but how about the vent sections that go under the dash.  My
whole front nose section needs to be replaced as does the front bumper, and
the grill thingy and front signal lights but the headlights them selves look
ok but the chrome rings are broken - but ... the doors are unaffected and it
still drives fine.

The dash is pushed in pretty far but it isn't cracked or broken - the vents on
either side are pushed in - I suspect that the would be not too tough to fix
but ... replacement would be likely easier - is there a source for those
things?

OK - so - I had a spare tire mounted on the front - all of the damage in the
front is pretty much the tire pushing the front section in - its like ... the
impact of the front of my bus hitting the front quarter panel of the car - the
impact was absorbed between my bumper (which really isn't too bad) and the
spare tire.  Of course, the spare tire pushed in the nose section.  I'm not
sure if having the spare on the front was a good idea or not in terms of the
accident?  Any thoughts out there?
