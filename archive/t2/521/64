Subject: Re: [T2] door sealant warning

Here's a real warning regarding the rejuvination and upkeep of the
rubber door moulding's, on any Bus--or for that matter any vehicle--

I recall some prevarication on using Glycerin to handle this chore a
while back---

Forget it.

Glycerin--if you read the label is a water soluble product--and when it
is applied leaves a sloppy gooey mess on the surface of the rubber--and
furthermore--if it comes in contact with the painted surface of the door
jams it will turn them a milky white.

I was kinda cranky when this happened to the painted inner door surface
of my 87 Westy---the clear coat looked like a low fat milk color--

Phooey--garbage--

I therefore used LPS, as well as another silicone product who's name has
been dis allowed here this evening--and they both worked well in
restoring the "spring" and resilience to the door rubber's without
damaging the paint-- 

Glycerin was a real bad idea--

Take Care--
