No, timing and rpm are related. If you advance the timing you'll find that the engine speeds up. Retard the timing, the engine slows a little and it pulls less vacuum: the piston is moving slower and has more time to draw into the attempted volume of air.

Yes. Vacuum means partial vacuum really and it's the difference between what the piston sucked in and what it tried to suck in restricted by the intake manifold.
