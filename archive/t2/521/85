I've never had problems using silicone to seat seals or cover holes, as
long as the surface is CLEAN. Works well where heater box parts mate
up.  Spark plug boots that don't cover well or tend to creep up I also
seal down; not difficult to peel up if needed.  The worst place I used
silicone was for a torn gas inlet boot (where the self-seating pump
rubs)- it fell apart from the fumes and dropped down into the tank-
where I presumed the baffle keeps it from getting to the outlet but once
found a piece in the fuel filter inlet, so it must get through those
little holes in the bottom sides of the baffle?
