One thing that always bugs me about "cheap bus" stories is this: 
imagine getting on a plane for a flight. You taxi down the taxiway and 
the pilot comes on the intercom and says:

"Welcome aboard flight 2039 to Miami.

"Looks like we'll have good weather for our flight today.

"We got this plane for less than a million and haven't had to put any 
money into maintenance or repairs."

"Enjoy the flight!"

You gonna enjoy that flight?
