Steve,

Anything to catch killers....BTW, Kristen's parents(and lawyers)
have been in Arkansas suing the state for $3,000,000 because they claim
that the state of Arkansas failed to adequately police/protect people at
that rest stop.

Not sure how I feel about that as I haven't seen the rest stop as it
has been closed since somtime shortly after the murder.

Should be on the news someplace...

I thought that they had captured someone in California that had
admitted to the murder...

Cheers, dave
