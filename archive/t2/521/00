I took a look on thesamba in the manual section at the closest
campmobile docs. it says (this is a 70 not 69) that the Childrens
hammock w/ storage bag is std equipment. so if the 69 is the same as
the 70 and it is a westfalia camper bus it should either have the
mounts for the cot or holes where the mounts were. Its also possible
she doesn't actually have a genuine campmobile?
