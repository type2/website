If you're going to do this, go get yourself a copy of "How to Rebuild Your
Volkswagen Air-Cooled Engine" by Tom Wilson.  The has very clear directions
for tearing down all VW engines - including the TypeIV - and specs for the
various components.  You'll need to measure things as you go, or take
parts/assemblies to a mechanic for measurement.  There's no quantifying "a
lot of play" so you need to measure and see if things are in spec.  Don't
bother rebuilding the engine unless you're going to perform these
measurements.
