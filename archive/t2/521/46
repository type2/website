My experience is that this is about right.  I got mine for $2K spent 
about $750 on parts and a lot of my own labor.  Problem was not rust 
but non-operation!  I went into the project of buying and restoring 
Leisl with this in mind.  By the time I do the canvas and clear coat 
the top, seals and all, we are looking at $4K.  But it's a camper, 
and a daily car., it's dependable and fun to drive.  I've done other 
resto's over the years with 4 figure paint jobs I was afriad to 
scratch.  I was a Yuppie once too.  But Dot.Com dot.bombed and I'm a 
working stiff again and the bus is perfect for me.  And this list 
makes all the difference!
