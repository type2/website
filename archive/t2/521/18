Hmmm...  Seems like a good time to mention (again) that I'm selling my 73
Westy for $3500.  This is NOT a cheap bus!!  This is the bus that you fly to
Colorado, hand me a check, hop in, start it up, and drive it 2000 miles back
home without any troubles.  And guess what?  Next morning you go out, start
it up, and drive it again!

73 Westy.  $3500.  Extremely solid, straight, clean, and dependable.  2.0
fuel injected 914 motor, 5-speed 911 (901) transmission, new Michelin Agelis
tires, KYB shocks, Sunbrella curtains with matching awning and poptop
canvas, tons of new and newish parts and work done.  The only thing this bus
needs is paint.  

Details and pics at  http://home.adelphia.net/~mgensler/bus.html  I know the
price on the web site says $3900, but $3500 will drive it home.
