Subject: Exhaust for a 1600 SP...

I searched the archives, but all the exhaust info I found was type 4
stuff.  I need to replace the exhaust on my bone stock 1600 single port.
Stock solex 30 pict 2 carb.  Should I go with stock exhaust (the OE
German from Bus Depot?) or an extractor type?  Who sells a good extractor
setup (Berg GB907 was my first choice, but they won't have any for several
months).  I want something that is going to fit correctly and last.

Are there any major disadvantages to going with the extractor setup?
Torque loss?  Noise??

Thanks.
