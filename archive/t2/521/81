Hello David    These aren't quite like the bus carbs from 72-74  These are 
more like the old type 3 carbs from 64-67  They are pretty good carbs but have 
the same problems that all solexs ,kadrons,zeniths,webbers have  they don't 
have bearings on the crosshafts so evenually they will wear out there. when they 
are new they work great. As far as I knowq only Delloratos had bearings on the 
crosshafts .  For the money these should be good Later and have fun  mark
