Subject: cheap busses and breaks

Umm, some where along the line some one said domething
to the effect of "all those guys running cheap busses
never do a complete break job". As though just because
I have had done well by my busses means that I am some
kind of hazard to society. I beg to differ. I said
about my 72  that I did routine maintanance including
BRAKES. . . brakes arent that expensive if you do them
before they are so worn out you start really breaking
stuff. Part of the reason that I do my own is so I can
look at the parts and see what needs to be replaced.
look at the front wheel bearings etc. 

Now Ill admit two things- one that my busses were
never prom queens,  (although only the first one was
really rusty) and for the most part I bougt them off
some one who had put some serious money into a car and
then gave up 90% of the way through getting redone.
The 72 the guy put a new motor in it, drove it 10K
miles and then couldnt get it smogged (in CA) and gave
up. I replaced the intake manifold (had a leak in it)
and drove away. But this is all part of the "how to
buy a bus" deal. I only buy what I want, and I want a
car thats been taken care of buy a middle class,
middle age guy with kids, not some road warrior.

INMHO, if you cant get your bus running after 5K$, you
need to modify your approach. Start by buying a bus
for what condition its in rather then what year it is.
Find aguy who has done almost all the work for you.
Then you do the icing and get the cake.

Its Friday its friday.....
