Thanks.

I was looking at the linkage for the air flap before the air cooler and I
never realized before the flaps work asymmetrically. When the right flap is
down the left flap is up and vice versa.  I can't quite visualize how the
oil cooler and the 3/4 cylinder bank gets max air at the same time.
