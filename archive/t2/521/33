6th grade...  1988...  Geeze I feel old!

When I wash the mud off of a shovel, I actually use WD-40 for its real
purpose.  I spray it on the wet metal and it gets between the water and
the metal and prevents rusting!  Very good to temporarily prevent rust on
metals that you don't want to paint.

As a lubricant, it works rather poorly.

NASA may use the stuff, but I don't think that they invented it!
