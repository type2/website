Subject: Re: [T2] What's the deal with all the cheap busses FS recently?

>All buses end up costing about $4000 by the end of a year's time

Personally I haven't found this to be true.  I've bought and owned 3 buses, a
300$ '71, a 200$ '73 and a 600$ Vanagon.

All have been amazing, worked great and cost little money to keep running.
After a few years I still own the '73 and the Vanagon.

We even managed to drive the first 300$ bus from Canada to Mexico and back,
with very little cost in repairs.

The secret is TLC.

Best regards,
Shawn.
