Subject: 1973 Paint Colors

Ive seen the library articles from which you can dissemnate what is the
proper color of your bus, but does anyone have a copy of the paint chip
brochure for 73 busses...I'm wanting to know what Kansas Red looks like new
and if there was a Yellow that year that was really yellow instead of Orange
as I'm considering changing my bus from white over red to white over yellow.
Thanks all, Duane
