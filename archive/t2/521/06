When I had this problem it was due to the elbow boot on the aux air intake
that had a substantial crack on the bottom, that wasn't seen just by looking
at it.  I had the same symptoms that you are describing.  Check your vacuum
to see if you don't have a leak.  Once I changed the elbow, everything was
great.
