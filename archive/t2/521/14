Dave and all,

Well, I just called.  First Mr. Keeling who was the lead investigator has
died.  Second, her murder is still open in their books, so if someone was
arrested it did not pan out.  I am supposed to get a call back from the
current prinipal investigator and will report further at that time.

I thought that they had captured someone in California that had
admitted to the murder...
