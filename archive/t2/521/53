Well, thank you David and Scott!

I disconnected and capped my retard line, and the timing swung from 5 
ATDC to 7.5 BTDC on the nose (I guess my distributor's vacuum unit is 
working properly :-).  The idle air screw now functions as I expect 
(and I was able to get the idle up from the 850 it was stuck at to 
~930), and I have a rock solid 15'' of vacuum.

The throttle is also much more responsive.  To top it all off, the 
timing now also matches the yellow emissions compliance sticker on the 
engine lid :-)

Satisfied, I pulled the hose off the distributor side and capped that 
nipple, as well.

Hooray for not having to hunt for vacuum leaks.

Now, here's where I need to be educated :-)  At a given (arbitrary) 
RPM, the engine is basically pumping the same amount of air 
(displacement * RPM) no matter what the ignition timing is, right?  So, 
why does retarded timing lower vacuum in the plenum?  Isn't the plenum 
vacuum basically the difference between what the engine wants to suck 
through vs. what the throttle body is willing to let through?  
(Similarly, isn't the ported vacuum basically the difference between 
what the engine is sucking through vs. the ambient air pressure?)
