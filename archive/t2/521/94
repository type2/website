No bus content here, but I suffered a T-bone collision, with my Safari (The 
Thing),
into a jap pickup driven by a little girl, out learning to drive with her 
mommy, who
pulled out right (1/2 car length) in front of me on a state highway.  I had 
two spare
tires on the front.  One just above the front bumper, and one on top of the 
hood
(like a Kubelwagen).  The tire above the bumper burst, and the wheel bent 
severely,
absorbing a lot of energy.  Then the front crumpled until it reached the 
front of the
tire on top of the hood, which absorbed the rest of the energy, stopping 
the crumpling.

Aside from breaking the windshield twice with my face (lap belts only), and 
taking
a jagged piece of the steering column under my kneecap, I was unhurt.  I 
think that
if it were not for the spare tires, I wouldn't have legs.

So, yah.  I have a spare tire on the front of my bus. (Oops!  There really 
is some
bus content here.)  8o)  I plan on making a beefy front spare mount that wraps
under the bumper, and connects to the frame, though right now, it's just bolted
to one of those mounts that screws onto the nose.......which is already 
smacked,
and Bondo(tm)ed and smacked again...........but fortunately, not by me.
