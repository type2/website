Yes, and people actually do win the lottery. But only a certified fool 
would think: "i am going to buy a lottery ticket and quit my job, 
because other people have won the lottery and got to quit their jobs."

Sure, there are people who get lucky with buses. But if that were the 
COMMON experience, this would be a very different list. Most of the 
"bus content" on this list is about things that need to be fixed, most 
of which are not cheap to fix.

You can look backward to a lucky bus purchase, but you cannot look 
forward to one.

Counseling list subscribers to believe that they can get a bus for 
under $1000 and drive it for years without expense is a disservice -- 
not to mention dangerous. Not one of the lucky posters thus far have 
mentioned doing a complete brake job on their buses. Thirty-year old 
buses usually need new lines, hoses, drums, disks, calipers, springs, 
etc., etc., etc.

Maybe I was wrong to say there are no cheap buses. There are, of 
course. Everytime I go to Ecology Wrecking, I get to see 10 or 20 buses 
that Ecology picked up for $15 or $20 apiece.
