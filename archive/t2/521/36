> #3...the Bay window radio delete plate does not really fit in the radio
slot in the dash.  This is a bummer, but I've decided to use this whole for
my small gauges.  They are all prepped and ready to install, but there is a
dilemma.
> Do I make some sort of plate, in which to drill the holes for the gauges?
Any suggestions here.  Has anyone tackled this method.

A gracious listee sent me stock plates for the bay and the vanagon, but I
haven't had the resources to work out the masters for the new gauge-ready
plates.

I'll post when I have the masters ready...
