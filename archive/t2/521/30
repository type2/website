have my 78 now for almost 12 years bought it for $2 but I'm sure by now I
have well over the mythical $5,000 in it.  but it still is my daily driver
and is not for sale....

Howdy,

that's ca. $460 a year. To my opinion there is nothing cheaper to run a car
for this time with this amount of $$$. Hope my 72 Westy and 80 Vanagon will
keep in the same price range. But now you know how much money you can save
when you do your own maintainance for a vehicle.
