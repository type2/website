Subject: 78 2.0 FI auto trans conversion

Hello all knowing,
and those with an opinion.

I am wondering about a transmission swap.  Exchanging an automatic
transmission for a standard.

I have a 78 2.0 FI with automatic transmission and thinking of putting in a
standard.

Your thoughts.....

Will it work?
Anyone completed such a project?
What do I need to be successful?
