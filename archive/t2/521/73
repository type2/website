Subject: 71 bus floor pan

hey guys

I have a 71 deluxe bus that im starting to do the
sheet metal work on and want to put a new front floor
pan in. All im finding in the cataloges to order is a
full floor pan for 73-79 models..........can anyone
tell me what the difference is from a 68-72 model
floor pan and why one of these wouldnt work in my van?
thanks
