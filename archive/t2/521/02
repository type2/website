I have to cheep buses are out there, my 1st bus a 74 hardtop 500.00 Ran
great body ruff had that for 2.5yrs replaced clutch and few monor things
like brakes along the way. MAybe put 300.00 in the 2.5yrs of having it. 

2nd bus 72 hardtop 75.00 NO motor , Take motor from beat up 74 and trans and
add to 72, fix brakes drive for 1yr sell it 100.00 in brake parts to get
that one going. The body was in great shape . It could have used a paint
job( faded red) 

3rd 70 rivphalia 500.00 and a drive from norfolk va to new hampshire!! Throw
rod after first week replace with motor from dunebuggy, still working out
the brakes (pulls to one side) .

Thats my input

you are lucky to get a bus for free. i have put $665 bucks in mine and it
still needs wiring, and engine work. not to mention panel replacement.
