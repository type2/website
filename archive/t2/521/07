"We got this plane for less than a million and haven't had to put any 
money into maintenance or repairs."

My guess would be the reality of both Busses and planes (and trains)
is that the maintenance is a result of "risk management" and reg-
ulations and costs...Regulations often result from catastrophes...
After all, instead of a well-maintained Bus, you could be driving a
well-maintained Pinto on Firestone tires (again...), and still have
disastrous results... ;-(
