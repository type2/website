Subject: [T2] How to test engine??

Get one of those cheapy engine start kits from Harbor Freight Tools. They
are about 6 o 7 bucks. You just need the engine on the tranny (so you can
use the starter), a battery, and fuel supplied to the fuel pump. The little
cheapy starter kit replaces the ignition switch.

>Allright Y'all, I have a 1600 DP engine I want to test. I also have a 66
Kombi with starter present but all

Anyway, I put the engine in the 66 to 
>test it but can't seem to figure out how I can start it up. There is no
key, no ignition switch, and the 
>wiring up front in the cab is a spagetti twisted mess. The engine has an
alternator conversion with built in

alternator just to get the engine 
>started to see if it runs?
