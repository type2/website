> Yes, RMMW has filed for chap 11 reorganization.  As far as VWofA, all I can say for sure is...my stepson worked there for a while.  He received a letter from the Colorado Attny General (as did many/all of the employees) requesting if he had any information involving copyright infringement. I believe another contributing factor is the Teller County/Woodland Park business and property tax setup.

I just heard from a couple people on another elist that RMMW is currently shipping orders and also had a booth at a recent Denver show so I'm sure this is good news to those of you East of the Rockies that use them.  I don't personally know anyone West of the divide that uses RMMW -- for a variety of reasons.
