I've been using white Lithium grease for lubrication on my '77 sunroof.
To keep the dirt out and most of the water, I bought some white adhesive
backed weather striping at the local home center. Surprisingly the same
piece has lasted for over a year and at about $14 it's a very cost effective
substitute for the actual VW felty business.

 As far as those "little cam type lifters" good luck! I had to rig mine
using JB-weld and some very small hose clamps, they've managed to hold up
for over a year of use, so if you have all the pieces you might give that a
try.

Sunroofs Rock !!!!
