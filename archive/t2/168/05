Subject: Electrical Woes - possible Bus FS

Hi Folks,

My Bus developed an annoying electrical problem on Saturday that refuses to 
be solved, and I am at my wits' end.  Bentley doesn't help, Muir doesn't 
help, and Haynes doesn't help.  So, I'm turning to The List as a last 
resort.

The situation:  1979 Westy, rebuilt 2.0FI, with alternator.  Driving on the 
highway, the battery light came on dimly, and my voltmeter went from 13.5 
volts to about 12.5 volts.  I stopped and checked my manuals, and figured it 
to be the voltage regulator.  Drove to a NAPA and got a replacement (non-VW) 
voltage regulator, installed it, and the problem persisted.  Now the battery 
light alternately flickers at idle, is off at idle, glows dimly at high rpm, 
glows brighter at high rpm, is on at startup, and is off at startup.  The 
engine runs, but voltage gets lower and lower the more I drive it.  
Obviously the battery isn't getting charged, but I'd think the engine would 
run down the battery quicker than it seems to be.

Bentley and Muir mention 2 procedures which I followed, but neither one is 
conclusive.  Using the generator troubleshooting chart in Bentley, I've 
narrowed down the problem to bad regulator, bad alternator, or bad wiring.

Does anybody have any suggestions or solutions?  I'd hate to spend the $150 
for a new alternator only to find that it didn't need to be replaced.  If I 
can't run down this problem, I'm thinking about selling my Bus.

Thanks in advance,
Jason Upper
