Subject: Re: [T2] Blue book value

> what they pay is negotiated and you have the
right to refuse thier "offer"  the books are only
guides not diffinitive, also if you have  records
of major work like new tires, engine etc this
affects the value

Right.  They will use the "blue book" or actually
the "black book" as some evidence of the value of
your vehicle.  You are entitled to use other
evidence, as was suggested by Sr. Dworkin.  

>There are two issues here...  liability and
collision.  In the case of liability, someone
else has injured you (by damaging your bus)  you 
are entitled...to be made whole.  In practice,
tho, there is a limit...  If you can be returned
to you previous condition by buying a replacement
vehicle for less than the cost of repairing the
damage to yours, the courts will limit damages to
that lower, replacement, 
amount....that's what "totalling" a vehicle
means... the damage to yours is so
severe that it would be cheaper to replace it
with a vehicle in similar condition.  

The Kelley books are one way to establish this
level of value. Insurance companies like them
because they don't have to expend a lot of
man-hours to find you a replacement vehicle, 

And because they use wholesale (black book)
numbers and a set of guidelines whereby they
attempt to take off for every nick and ding or
spot of rust on your muffler.  Make no mistake
about it, the adjusters job is to pay you as
little as possible.  How do you think insurance
companies afford those fat paychecks and tall
buildings?  


>BUT they are not the only source!  One other
excellent source of values for older VW buses is 
the type2 archives!!!   

You choose your evidence.  EP.com is also
helpful.  Or traderonline, any of the other
places where busses are advertised.  

>On Collision, the story is a bit different. 
Read your policy.  If it includes a phrase that
value will be determined from some book, 
Kelley or other, and you signed on for that
fun-filled cruise, then you are stuck with it.  

FYI collision means a first party action or claim
against your own insurer.  You are attempting to
get your own insurer to pay for damage to your
vehicle.  There are actually other options like
underinsured or uninsured but for our purposes a
first party action includes all of these.  

YOU ARE NOT NECESSARILY LIMITED BY BLUE BOOK
VALUE, depsite what your contract may say.  Most
states regulate the insurers ability to do this,
even though it might otherwise be an enforceable
term of a contract between you and your insurer. 

Stated value policies are available, but you
suffer essentially the same problem with this
policy.  You see there is a concept in the law
that you can only insure what is called an
insurable interest.  That precludes me from
insuring your bus, then torching it.  I have no
interest in your bus, so I cannot insure it.  It
also prevents you from insuring your $1000 bus
for $1,000,000.  So, even if you buy this type of
policy, you may end up proving you had an
insurable interest equivalent to the amount of
the policy.  (Same evidence issues as before as
before.)  

>In any event.... one thing I learned a long time
ago is that lawyers talking to lawyers get better
treatment than civilians talking to lawyers. 
That surely isn't justice, but it surely is life
:-(

"The law is a ass, a idiot," said Charles
Dickens.
