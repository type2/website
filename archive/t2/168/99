You could probably even do it with a dual gas-tank switch for some HD 
trucks.  Otherwise, you could use a configuration using multiple, 
high-aperage(?) relays to switch the source.  Actually, if you can read 
schematics, you could probably use a voltage regulator to make the switch 
for you, once the primary battery dropped below a certain voltage.
