Subject: RE: [T2] What IS this stuff?

Just an interesting note... I found out that if you don't know what
something is... but it has a patent number on it, you can go to the US Govt
patent office website at http://patft.uspto.gov/ and search by patent
number...  Everything ever patented in the US is online there... with
pictures!
