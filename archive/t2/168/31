Sounds like your alternator is also dead.  If your alternator was working 
your engine wouldn't have died, even with a dead battery.  It would also 
explain the dead battery methinks.  Have you done some cursory checks with 
a digital voltmeter?  Over 13V when running at 2000rpm?  12.7-ish when off 
after sitting overnight?
