1) Not a clue....not bus related
2) Goes behind the window crank handle
3) A new injecter
4) An American car flasher
5) Radio knob
6) Wire end cover for the rear side marker lights
7) Inspection hole plugs for the rear brakes
8) ??? The 1st pic sorta looks like part of the connecter on the aux air valve

9) ???
10) petcock for a radiator!
11) 'choke' for your radio input wire, to cut down on ignition static, it
