[1] You say to lubricate with petroleum; my mechanic sez that
because of the inevitable collection of road dirt in said 
lubrication that one should never use anything but a dry lube
on the sunroof tracks, mechanisms, etc.  He said this after
*I* put grease all over, *I* collected dirt on a dirt road, and
*I* brought myself to a state where I need to ask this question:

[2] Where can I find the little, and easy to break, gizmos that
actually effect the last bit of closing, i.e., which pivot and
raise the tail end of the roof into position.  Mine are gebroken.
