Subject: Hole in Catalytic converter, etc...

Dear Folks,

	The complete (almost) rebuild on my 81 Van is slowly marking time
to near perfection. I do have a few questions for anyone out there.

1. Should there not be a hole in my cat. converter? It is located on the
bottom                     center, resembling a drainhole or testing
orafice.

2. Is there a starting point for the CO adjustment screw?

3. A starting point for the idle speed adjustment?

4. The timing. When #1 is at TDC, the divot and the mark on the pulley
point right to 7.5 BTDC as specified by Bentley. When running it reads
around 27 - 28 BTDC. What is going on here?

 	Your help is greatly appreciated. Thank you, Craig.
