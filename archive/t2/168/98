Yeah we've got a "former" Champagne Edition Westfalia. There was so much 
brown we referred to it as the "Cow Poop Edition".

It is now (VW  Golf Tornado) red and white outside and undecided inside - 
BUT - the dash now is a boring, neutral two tone black and grey. Colors 
that we like, not original obviously.

Of course it can all go back to brown on brown on brown if they are 
suddenly valuable in those colors.
