I'm getting ready to install a 2L fuel injected engine into my 74' bus. =
I know the fuel tank has to have an return line but I heard of putting a =
Tee fitting to the outlet. Will this work? Has anybody done this? I have =
the fuel tank for a fuel injected set-up, but if I a tee fitting will =
work I'd rather not swap tanks.
