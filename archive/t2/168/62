I'm at a loss as to what's causing the front end on my 74 SC to be 
tight.  All ball joints have been replaced, new drag link, new tie rods, 
re-bushed relay lever, steering box adjusted....when all apart it seems to 
be fine and loose.  The truck is at the shop today and they have now put on 
a second set of new ball joints and the service manager just called me and 
said it still seems tight.  Are we missing something here?  bottom line is: 
truck will not return to center after rounding corners even at 55-60 mph.
tx, greg
