Ok I just got the truck back and it was a bad ball joint (even though it 
was brand new)...the shop said that even with all the tie rods removed and 
the truck up in the air, they could barely move the left wheel by hand (as 
if steering).  It drives great now and all is well.  Thanks to everyone who 
responded.  greg
