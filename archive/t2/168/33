Subject: Re: [T2] Trailer Wiring

Frank, I pull a Scamp (small travel trailer, weighs about 1200 lbs) and had
to wire for it last summer.  On my '76 westy, there are two bulbs, one for
turn signals and the other for brakes and running lights.  I purchased 5
double spade connectors from the auto parts store, then took the back off my
lights, unhooked the wire I wanted to tap into, then put a double spade on
it.  I connected a wire to the second side of the spade, then replaced the
cover.  This made a nice clean hook up and didn't have to cut a thing!!

I then purchased the electronic converter to convert 4 bulbs to 2 which my
Scamp uses.

The biggest thing about wiring a trailer is to make sure you have GOOD
grounds on both the tow vehicle and the trailer.  I can't stress this
enough, without good grounds, neither your tow vehicle nor the trailer
lights will work properly.
