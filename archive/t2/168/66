Set your ignition, then your idle, then your CO and then reset your timing 
if need be.

On my '78 the timing is set by putting the TDC mark on the fan pulley next 
to the 7.5 BTDC mark which happens to be a small circle to reinforce the 
point.

Set your idle speed with the adjustment screw on the throttle body using a 
tach.

Set your CO with the adjustment screw on the AFM.

Reset the idle speed.

As for the hole in the cat - if it is not making alot of noise then I would 
not worry about it.

You could weld it up if you want.

I dunno if it is factory made or rust. Seems like my 2 year old Honda CR-V 
has a drain hole in the muffler.

Lastly the timing advance. It should be at 7.5 at idle and then at a 
certain RPM ~2500 (?) it will reach the full advance. It should smoothly 
advance at speeds between those numbers I think.

Anyone else?
