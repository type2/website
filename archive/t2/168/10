Subject: Re: [T2] ??? Mystery Distributor

Lunch time and I finally got to check the Old Volks Home dizzy list and
confirmed Erons finding (or lack there of) of a listing for this
distributor.  The closest number that I could find was 043 905 205x (x
being various letters, but no " 6" and no 040's.  Using part of the
other part number I found about nothing.

When I go home tonight I'm going to get the block number off of the '69
Beetle and see if I can get a clue there, then maybe back track it
through the dizzy list and see what it was supposed to have.

I have fun tracking down stuff like this, but anyone with a better clue
than me, please pass it along!
