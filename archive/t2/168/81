I use and like the Bridgestone 603V.  It is available from any Firestone
dealer and they often run sales, so if you plan ahead they are very
inexpensive.  Highway stiffness is good.  I do a lot of gravel and dirt
roads and these tires do fine.  The lack of an aggressive tread is often
an advantage in loose conditions as the wheels can spin without digging a
hole.  Since the 603V is available in the stock 185R14 size, you can use
the stock inflation pressures.
