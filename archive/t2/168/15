Subject: Trailer Wiring

Hello All,
I read a post in the archives regarding trailer wiring.  It talked about the
possible need for a larger flasher?  It said you will know you need one, if
yours blinks faster than before.  Well, I am blinking quickly, and last
evening, the blinking quit, followed by the red gen light coming on.  What's
up?  Is the flasher dead?  Can I get a "larger"one from the flaps?  What
about some magic box that converts from dual bulbs to one like on the
trailer?
I tapped into my wiring (as in cutting....ouch I hate that) is that the way
the rest of you have completed the project or is there another way?

Respectfully,
