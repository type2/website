Well it was sorta given to me.  As short a story as I can make it:  I
was GIVEN! a '69 bug by a neighbor.  The car had sat for several years
in their garage.  The tires were flat (more air could come out the side
walls than I could put in the valve stems ) and we had to disassemble
the garage door to get the car out.  This PO had put in a 1500 (H block)
sometime ago and this dizzy was in that engine.  The PO couldn't even
remember the story on the engine or why it was changed back when they
started a Cal Looker project on it.

So I guess it disappeared wrapped in the Bug huh?  Did you ever have any
clues to how or who?  Sorry about your loss!
