Subject: strange unlabelled knobs...

Ok...I was trying to decode the German manual last night (my 71 Westy came
over from the Black Forest a few years ago) and I can't figure out what
exactly the two knobs in the right front lower of the driver's seat are
for. I know the levers up on the left just underneath the seat are for
rail adjustment and backrest tilt, but what about these two mysterious
knobs on the lower right? 

My father seemed to recall that one had something to do with the gas
heater (borne out by my German decoding...but WHAT it does, who knows...).
I think both are heater knobs...one for the gas, one for the
regular...what do they do??? 

Thanks as usual, 
DC
