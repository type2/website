Subject: Colorado to New York, anyone?

Hey Volks, I might have to take the '71 out to Buffalo, N.Y. for a few days. 
I just finished one of these long hauls down south and had a great trip, but 
this time around I wouldn't mind having someone along for some or all of it 
- especially if the person is an experienced bus driver (but even if not).

If a listee or friend of one is interested in coming along for all or part 
of a route from Colorado to N.Y. (3-4 days the week of June 3, back the next 
week, just p-mail me and we can see if it works.

P.S. I maintain the bus myself -- she's in good trim. All the same, I'll 
have the tools with me.
