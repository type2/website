you measure from isn't as critical as one, having an accurate
thermometer; two, determining what temperature indicates critical temp at
the point in the system where you are measuring; and three, ensuring that
your measurement point is valid in all conditions (turns, uphill,
downhill, RPM range, etc.).  Gene determined that the dipstick area

As long as you recognize that the maximum temperatures are above the
measured temperatures and adjust your "maximums" to compensate, then just
about any location will do.  The problem occurs when comparing one reading
to another.  A dipstick sender might read 25F higher than a sump sender so
you'd end up comparing apples to oranges.

that you have with the dipstick variety.

I still think that the best place is the main oil gallery.  That is the
oil that in circulation and will affect the bearings.  Circulating oil
will give more rapid readings than sump oil.
