Subject: Re: [T2] ??? Mystery Distributor

Hi Bob,
	Thank Gawd somebody else has seen one!  How did you get your hands on it?  
I had a friend working at Bugworld in Sacramento, and I found it while 
browsing through their pulls.  It looked brand new.  It is a vacuum and mech 
advance combo diz.  Interesting about the flat spot.  Mine drove like a bat 
outta hell.  No flat spots and a ton of pull from idle to 4th gear.  Let me 
know what you find out!  Thanks.

	Eron
PS.  If anyone out there has seen a root-beer metallic brown '70 Bug in the 
Sacramento area, stop her!  That's my distributor!
