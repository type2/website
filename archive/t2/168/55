Hello Friends,
I think I have come to the conclusion of the case of the fuel injection system that was so rich that fuel dripped from the exhaust system.

After checking everything two or three times as per the VW fuel injection manual the problem was narrowed down to excessive fuel pressure or some problem with the injector/s.

Fuel pressure/ regulator problems were ruled out by installing a fuel pressure gage (35 lb.) again. 

Next we looked at the injectors.  The signal to the injectors seemed good (weak pulsing light). The front left injector was found to have 70-90 ohms between the terminals and ground!  We disconnected it and the fuel stopped dripping and the motor ran surprisingly well on three cylinders!  Once the injector was replaced everything seemed fine.

I don't know this but I wonder if the one bad injector triggered the other injectors to pump fuel. There was a lot of fuel dripping out the exhaust.  Perhaps someone more knowledgible than myself can answer that question.

Thanks to all who gave advice it was helpful and appreciated.

Drew
