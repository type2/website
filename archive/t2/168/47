I agree with replacing CV's if they're sus (and I'd do them all 
together), but when I wanted to get my newly restored bus on the road 
recently and I was still waiting for my 4 new CV's to arrive I decided 
to put the old ones back on until the new ones arrived. They were (all 
4) BADLY pitted on both the inner and outer races (one direction only) 
but the balls weren't pitted. When assembled (cleaned with new lithium 
grease) they were all still 'tight' to assemble. I installed them so 
they would drive on the non pitted side. That was about 10k km ago (~6k 
mi) and they still drive smoothly with no noise!!! I plan to leave them 
in until they become noisy and keep the new ones as spares.

Here's a question though, with the new CV's (Lobro) how tight should 
they be? Of the 4, two are that tight I cannot move the inner race 
relative to the outer race at all by hand. The other two move quite 
easily, but without any 'play'. Is that normal?
