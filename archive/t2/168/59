Subject: Re: [T2] Insurance info for 78 Bus

Nah - State Farm sold me full (comprehensive) insurance on my '78 Westy.

Pretty cheap too.

Be sure that you set an agreed upon value - if the bus is totalled you get 
$5K (or more) b/c the book value on our busses is nothing these days. You 
may have to show alot of receipts and pics of the bus to make your point.

I'd hate to see you insure your bus and only get $750 when your bus was hit 
and totaled by a meteor one night.
