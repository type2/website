Its good that you are clear in stressing that for you_personally_driving a 
type 2 and placing low priority on clean air are related.  For many type 2 
owners, it is quite the opposite.  My 79 westy passes the tests here in Oregon with 
plenty of room to spare because it is well maintained and all emmission 
control systems are in place.

Driving a type 2 and placing priority on clean air are not mutually 
exclusive, its a personal decision to make them so.
