ok after months of reading about gear oil on both lists i figured gl-4 was the going 
item.  seemed ok to me but this am i decided to see what had been used in my garage 
for years.  trundled out to the barn and retrieved the yellow gear oil bottle only to 
find it completely different than the 'recommended'!! so what does this mean?

i found pennzoil gearplus 80w-140 and on the back it says  "exceeds requirements of 
the manufacturers requiring gl-5".

so this is what has been put in all the splitties i've had and nothing has ever been 
done to my knowledge on the 78.

so is there a way to tell what is in the gear boxes?
if not does it hurt to just use this?
should they be drained and start all over?
should i throw away the gl-5 compatible?

any helpful suggestions will be stored away to use when i actually brave opening this 
  fully functioning no current problem area.  hate to look and find a new problem to 
add to my list of to dos'!!

thanks.
