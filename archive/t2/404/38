Subject: Re: [T2] Engine lid seal

Richard,
Pretty sure the -711C WCM seal is what I got for my '77 ~1 1/2 years ago. I
had no problems other than they had to be cut to size and was in 4 pieces. I
didn't glue them in, they fitted tightly enough to stay in. Still looks like
new now.

3. WCM sells two seals: one 68-71 seal 261-711 and 72-79 seal 261-711C. I
saw pictures of these over at BugHaus:

Has anyone bought the 261-711C seal from WCM or BugHaus. From all my
research (it shouldn't have to be this hard) this one looks like the best
fit although you still have 4-pieces to glue.
