The engine can't compensate for a major vacuum leak. A minor one yes but
you'd have to advance the timing/rpm and that only masks the problem.

Based on this experience I would say you still have major vacuum leaks
preventing you from starting the engine.

Check the S-shaped boot for cracks. Check the oil breather hose for cracks.
Check the rest of the hoses:
