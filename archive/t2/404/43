Subject: RE: [T2] Motor diesels when I shut it off...

Oops, sorry.

	The motor is a 1.8 liter motor.. probably from a mid 70s? Mine in
particular is a 73 VW Bus. This particular motor is powered by an electric
fuel pump, with the 2-bbl Webber carburetor.. the one with those four LONG U
shaped runners.

I assumed the question was general enough.


Thanks!
