Subject: Diseling

Despite the technical advice of carbon buring, the symptons you mentioned
that goaway when it's cool at night and return during the day point clearly
to two causes:

1.  The heated air expands gas and leaves excess fuel to burn, thus the
diseling when it's hot

2.  You really need to burn higher octance gas or use a lead additive like
"gunk"  If I burn 87 octance I disel day or night. If I go up to 93...it
never ever happens...simple as that..

The added octance keep the engine cleaner, burns cooler, and gives me enough
MPG tradeoff to make up for the difference in cost.
