Kyle,
	To add to what richard has said. YOu can (just for testing) block a
lot of the ports for your engine. Go to your local home improvement
store & buy a lot of rubber stoppers (you know the ones like in
physics lab). disconnect the brake booster & any other large hoses
going to the intake manifold. plug these. Then plug any of the hoses
leading from the "s" tube from the AFM. See what it does. Please don't
drive anywhere though, you won't have a brake booster & I'm not sure
how well the fi will run w/out everything connected, but at least you
can simply hook one thing at a time back up & see if it starts to run
very bad. I would also invest in a vacuum gauge to verify this. good
luck.
