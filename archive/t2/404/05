Subject: RE: [T2] Cookin' the hub - it's done, anyone want a bite?

With the same coeffecient of expansion, the percentage expansion is the same 
for both parts. But since the hub has a  _slightly_  larger diameter than 
the race, the physical incresae in diameter is slightly greater for the the 
larger part, so you do get some loosening.

1% of 1.001 is greater than 1% of 1.000

I've used 300-400 degrees F and it seems to make the difference for my hubs. 
Still gotta pound the **** out of them though.

It's at 350 F now and has been about 15 minutes. I've taken it out twice and
tried to drift them out to no avail...


Heating the hub has no effect in getting races out, as the race and the
hub have about the same coefficient of expansion.  Now, if you could heat
the whole works and then hit the bearing race with something really cold
(liquid nitrogen leaps to mind) it might have the desired effect.

You should be able to drive the bearing race out at room temperature with
a punch.  IIRC, there are a couple of "cutouts" in the hub that allow you
to get up against the back of the races with a punch from the opposite
side of the hub.  Alternate sides and give the punch a good firm whack
with a ball-peen hammer and things should move.

Once the old race is out, grind it lightly all the way around its OD until
it slips in and out of the hub easily.  You now have a bearing
installation tool!  Just put the new race in the hub, put your new tool on
top of it, and tap round and round with a hammer. If you heat the hub
first and work fast it is even easier, but I've done quite a few at room
temperature.
