When you're hub is apart and you don't have a ride, you improvise. Is it
really the end of the world that I used a socket extension to get my bearing
races out? And yes, I intend to pickup a set of drifts the next time I'm at
Harbor Freight.

Hmmmm... No one ever told me that bearings are always done at the same time.
Not my Father when we've changed bearings before, not the VW parts store where
I bought the bearing, not the VW garage I tried to get to do it but they were
slammed...
