Subject: Re: [T2] EGR....optional??

Kevin, \
             I did disable the EGR on my 74 Ghia. It did pass emissions after 
that in AZ. But I had to leave it in place to pass the visual inspection. 
What I did was take the EGR off of the manifold and block the port with a gasket. 
Mine Ghia had a big vac leak do to the EGR not working and also a split in 
the EGR filter. But all factory emission components that the car came with must 
be there in order for it to pass. Boy I wish this county would lighten up on 
us enthusiasts. Dont know about your state or much about the injection on your 
type 2 . I do know the EGR doesn't do much.
