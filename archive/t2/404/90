Subject: Gas heater help needed

Hi Folks,
    As we go into the warmest part of the year I'm thinking ahead to
the coldest parts yet to come.  I have a BN2 gas heater, that I was
told, is from a bug.  I'm one part away from having it running
reliably enough to install in my '71 bus.  And yes I do know it's not
the correct heater for a bus, but it's what I've got.
    The diaphragm in the adjustable end of the pressure regulator is
shot.  The fabric has become stiff and porous and doesn't do the job
any more.  So I guess I'm in need of one of the following
    1.  A serviceable diaphragm or regulator
    2.  Info on where to purchase said diaphragm or regulator
    3   Info on how to make a replacement
I sure would appreciate any help you can send my way.
