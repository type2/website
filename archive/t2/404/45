Sounds like one of two things:  very rich fuel mixture and you're
dieseling on the unburned fuel.

or you don't have an (functioning) idle cutoff solinoid.  I've seen a lot
of the various weber conversions that didn't have a idle circuit cutoff.
Without this, you'll diesel.  If you have one you should make sure it's
closing when power is pulled from it.  (there should be two switched +12v
wires attached to the carb.  One's the choke, the other is the idle
cutoff.)
