Subject: RE: [T2] Cookin' the hub - it's done, anyone want a bite?

Note that I did state my assumptions correctly :0)  I'll try cooling it in a
cooler of ice before hammering next time just to see.

Might be, and the coefficient for the cast iron hub material might be
different than that of the steel race.

Hmmm, (looks at Mark's Standard Handbook for Mechanical Engineers) Carbon
steel:  10.8E-6,  Cast iron:  10.6E-6

Seems like carbon steel expands slightly more than cast iron, so heating
the hub will actually make it _harder_ to remove the race!

Solution:  dip the hub in liquid nitrogen!

Seeing as how I've never seen a LN2 Dewar at a VW dealer, I have a feeling
that they did it the old-fashioned way, by judicious whacking with a
hammer and punch.

Well, if the difference in diameter is 0.1%, then the difference in
expansion will also be 0.1%  Not very much with tight-fitting parts!
