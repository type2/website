 The first one is the driver's side and the 2nd the passenger side but I
think the photos should be different.

Both of those are the drivers [left] side showing the window from the outside! The pass [right] side should be
a mirror opposite. The fixed pane will always be towards the rear. The latch will always be at the front.
Here is a pic of the left side:
