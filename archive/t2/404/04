Heh... I just took mine off to get the engine out ... otherwise I wouldn't 
know how to do it either.  I took out the oil bath air filter as part of the 
engine removal, so that made the bold behind the flywheel easier to see.  
The offending nut is almost behind the air filter, but a little on the side 
towards the right hand carb; it's a 17mm.  Feel free to pmail me if you want 
help taking the air filter out.

I hope that helped a little bit.  Good luck.
