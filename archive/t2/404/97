Hello Kyle,

Are these new points? I have had problems in the past
with New Bosch points. For some reason when the points
were closed, the electricity would not conduct between
them. They had some sort of film on them keeping them
from making a connection. I "fixed" mine by using a
emery board to clean the contacts but have since been
told this was not a good idea.

Here is another big problem that I found with mine. I
had replaced the distributor and turned the dizzy
clamp up-side down when I reinstalled it. This caused
the distributor dog to barely make contact causing the
engine to run when first installed but it would
vibrate free and the rotor would quit turning. Make
sure the clamp is on right. Check to make sure your
rotor is turning when you crank the engine over. 

make sure that the condenser wire is hooked up to the
correct contact on the coil.

Is the little ground strap inside your distributor
intact? 

A multi meter is very handy when dignosing these
problems. check to make sure that your are getting 12v
to the coil when the key is in the ON position. These
are just some ramdom things that I could think of. Go
through this check list before you assume the coil is
to blame. Good Luck!

Regards,
David Kelly
