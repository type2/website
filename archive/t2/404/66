Subject: EGR connector removal

Just Do IT!

As a libertarian and an environmentalist, I can tell you that most of the
emmission inspection crap is only designed to give jobs to folks
particulaqrily in states where you have to go to service stations that
conventiently "can fix" what they detmine you failed for, and to keep you in
line.Just one more way where THEY know where you are on a given day or where
they can stop you and take your vechicle if you don't go along.

Yes, you can remove the EGR nonense and your vechicle will run better. Also,
even in California, a vechicle over 30 years old is not subject to emmission
inspection.

I once knew someone who "gutted their cat" (removed the crap from inside
their converter, back before the SS started placing converters where you
couldn't get a stick up them and do this). His 84 vanagon passed emmission
tests almost as well as before removal, ran better and did not necessiate
worrying about how to properly dispose of a contaminated converter. Not to
mention he no longer polluted the air with sulfer dioxide.

You will need to tune you carbs a bit after removing the egr system but it
will be good for your VW.
