I don't believe this.  Unless they've changed the chemical properties of
lead and sulfuric acid the voltages can't have changed.  I run a "modern"
battery on my '71 and it charged up with the old generator and with the
newer alternator.

Go to Pep Boys (or whatever FLAPS is handy), ask for a group 24 battery
with a 75 month warranty.  It's not the "specified in the book" battery
(seems all VWs originally used the bug-size battery) but it fits well and
has a bit more capacity.

Don't go for the "maintainance free" batteries, as they are really just
"you can't maintain it, so buy another one" batteries.  If you can't
remove the caps, you don't want it.

I avoid Sears batteries because of a blatant warranty scam they pulled on
me a few years back.

Pep Boys have always done well by me, even to the point of giving me a
pro-rate on a core that I didn't think had any time left on it.  The
clerk read the date code and gave me $10 off the new battery!
