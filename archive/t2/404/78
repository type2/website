Do you have the little collars that go from the rear heat exchangers (the
ones attached to the muffler) up through the tin?  The paper hoses aren't
supposed to go through the tin at all.  There is a rubber seal that goes
around the collar, and the paper hose sits on top of the seal.

Hmmm, this gives me the idea that you have an aftermarket exhaust that
doesn't have the rear heat exchangers.  In that case, the above
explanation probably doesn't apply (or even make sense)
