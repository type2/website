Subject: Starter current and clutch cable

I was cleaning the transmission ground strap and noticed that the washer and
nut that holds the strap to the diagonal arm had melted together. Wow.

Another bus owner I met in passing told me his clutch cable broke because
the strap made contact. I don't see how the strap could reach: the stock
strap is short and has a rubber sleeve to protect it. If you used the longer
beetle strap without a sleeve (homemade) I still don't think it could reach.

I think what's more likely is the best path to ground for whatever reason
was the clutch cable and the current snapped it. Right?
