Yow!  If you junkyard in California or other lawyer-infested state don't
leave good parts on the ground!  Put them inside the vehicle!  The yards,
having been sued too many times for "trip and fall" injuries have
employees who discard any loose parts laying on the ground, much to the
detriment of those of us who collect heat exchangers, tin, etc.
