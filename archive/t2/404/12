Hi,
       Used to be such a thing as freon in a spray can. Many moons ago 
pressing on and off rear axle bearings was common. I have before sprayed on freon to 
freeze a stuck ring on an axle shaft and then struck it from the side as hard 
as I could causing the ring to crack or split thus coming off of the axle. 
Some shops might still do this. So just an idea would be to freeze your bearing 
race and then clobber it from the back where the two notches are and see if 
this will break the race. Just a thought.
Regards,
