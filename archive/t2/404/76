I neglected to reconnect my tranny ground strap and went around like that
for months before I discovered it.  No ill effects.

As far as I can tell, the only grounds other than the ground strap are the
clutch cable and the small grounds between the generator and regulator.
The small grounds certainly wouldn't take starter current, so I guess I
got lucky with the clutch cable handling the load.
