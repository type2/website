Subject: Re: [T2] running rich, but stalling. smells. vacuum leak?

Vacuum leaks. I had the very same problems. Rotted vacuum lines, rotted 
vacuum elbow on the aux idle valve, leaky injector seals, and an EGR valve 
that was in fact a huge vac leak. Cost to repair? $30. 1 Saturday. Replace 
all that rubber.

Good luck!
