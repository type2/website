Subject: update: symptoms... now no spark

ok,
thanks to everyone who responded before.
I went back and checked every hose multiple times. Everything seemed to be 
ok.
so finally I went and adjusted the points again. Still nothing. Tried 
pulling off a spark plug wire and holding a screw driver to it while turning 
over the engine. no spark.
So now my quest to find a vacuum leak has become my quest to figure out why 
I have no spark.
I already went through this before I started looking for a vacuum leak. 
Everything was ok.
Any idea what might have changed?
Thanks for any advice.
Kyle
