My EGR system has been removed for several years, and
I see no difference in performance. Theoretically
there would be a slight difference in gas mileage, as
the unused gas gets recirculated. I doubt it is much
though. 

Also, I have passed two different emissions checks
since. Don't have to worry about it anymore though,
the bus is 25 years old now, and doesn't require it!!
;)

I hear that some states are more thorough than others,
and do a visual inspection for egr, and if it is
missing, well.....
