Subject: Re: [T2] My 64 Bug is Dead

sad news for the bug but great news for your kid man...
well all i can say is if you are in cali check www.thesamba.com for a deal on a bug i have been looking for one or at them at least on there in my area and all that i find that are decently priced are in cali...

here in the south they are exspensive for just a project bug no motor or anything...doors whatever still exspensive..


good luck to you and once again sorrow for your loss of your  64 sunroof bug...
