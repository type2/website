Subject: vanagon a/c in a bay?

while at the yard this weekend i was looking at a vanagon as i need to get
one of those huge vanagon engine hatches and i was also looking over the
vanagon overhead a/c unit that comes forward above the sunvisors also.  has
anyone adapted this to a bay and would it even fit albeit with some minor
mods?  i was thinking that it would provide a lot more air being that it
has so many more vents on it but i am a absolute rookie with a/c setups.
