Subject: Re: [T2] EGR....optional??

My experience has been that the engine has noticeably more power available
w/o the EGR. I'm able to pull hills with 5" vacuum that required WOT with
the EGR.  I'll see how the heads hold up in the long run...

The real benefit to EGR removal from my perspective is to the preserve the
parts for future need.  If you have it and remove it, do bag it & tag it for
the next owner.
