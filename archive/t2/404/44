Dieseling is very typically caused by carbon deposits in the combustion
chamber that glow red-hot and will ignite left over gas fumes when the
engine is shut down. Hence, you'll see this behavior more commonly when the
engine's gotten very hot, like driving during the day. You may or may not
also be experiencing pre-detonation; glowing carbon can ignite the fuel
mixture before the sparkplug fires.

The first thing to do is to check that your fuel/air mixture and ignition
timing are spot on. Problems in these areas can exacerbate the issue by
causing the engine to run hotter than it should. Next, you need to work to
eliminate the carbon build up. Various gas additives tout themselves as
solutions to this problem, but I'm not sure how well they work.  One
solution that I've read about, and probably does work, is adding small
amounts of water to the air/fuel mixture as the engine is running.
