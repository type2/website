Thomas, Open your engine compartment stick your head
in and look on the top of the engine(all the way in
the back)the case will be curved, on the right side of
the case will be a 17mm nut which is the top bolt of
the starter, take this nut off and push the bolt thru
towards the front of the bus, disconnect the battery,
go under the bus, passenger side. Take the wires off
the starter(under the bus). take the bottom nut(17mm)
off the starter, pull the starter towards the front of
the bus and lower it out, hope this helps. Phil (There
are no dumb questions, just dumb answers)
