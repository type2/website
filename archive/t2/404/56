Subject: Re: [T2] EGR....optional??

Definitely.. in my opinion keep the EGR system. You MAY gain a SLIGHT power
increase without it.... but SLIGHT. So long as you keep it clean, your motor
will last longer under similar circumstances with the EGR system. It does
help cool cyl head temperatures.. in EVERY motor.. not just VW motors.
