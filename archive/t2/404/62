Subject: auto tranny question

The bently may be very helpful in identifying the parts I am talking about 
sine I don't know what they are called. I will do my best.
Where the auto tranny meets the engine on my 79 there are some studs. ( If 
you turn to page 31 of the auto tranny section in the bently and look at 
number 35 in the picture you will see a ring. Directly to the left of the 
ring in the pic is a hole where a stud goes through and into the engine I 
guess.) There is one on either side of the tranny. My studs are not tight at 
all, I can screw them in and out by hand. On the drivers side stud there are 
3 nuts. Two are too big to catch the threads. they just slide on oand off. 
The third one is the correct size and holds the other two on. Now, on the 
passenger side I have nothing. a couple days ago I had two that were too 
big, but not one that is the right size. And that is probably why today I 
have none on that side. What is the deal with all this. Do I screw the studs 
in all the way. Is everything suppposed to be so loose. are the too big 
bolts there as spacers.

Also, I relized the other day that my tranny ground strap has been broken. I 
have already replaced it, but I'm sure I drove around with it broken for a 
while. Should I be concerned. What could happen as a result.

Thanks,
Kyle
