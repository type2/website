Subject: Unofficial Everybus Shirts

Hey Folks, uncle 'Doom here, 
Those of you who went to Everybus last year may have
noticed, or even bought a shirt with a "Red Cup" logo
on it. The person selling them was me. 

Once again this year I am trying to sell some shirts
to help finance the trip down to North Carolina. 

You can view the shirts here:
http://www.busesofthecorn.com/suburban/

The way we are working this is similar to previous
years, but I have changed some of the back-end to
avoid missed emails and streamline the whole process. 

This year I have two layouts, one on black, one on
green. 
The black shirt features the EB06 radio on the front
and the installation guide on the back. 
The green shirt features the Red Cup Ale bus on the
front, and a "6 pack o' bus" on the back. 

Both layouts are available in T or Hoodie. Sizes run
from Youth Medium all the way up to XXXL.

Prices:
Youth T's: $12
Adult T's: $17
Adult T's XXL & XXXL: $20

Youth Hoodie: $25
Adult Hoodie: $30
Adult Hoodie XXL & XXXL: $33

"Girlie" T's med-XL: $17

Prices are in canadian dollars.
