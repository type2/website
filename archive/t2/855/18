Subject: MexiMotor experience

I don't yet have 4000 miles on my engine but...

Based on the assumption that these MexiMotors have domed pistons and 
hence a decreased compression ratio, making them compatible for lousy 
grades of gas...

This engine does not have the power that my previous one had.  
Thatistosay, Lurch does not climb the hills the way he/she/it used to.

I guess the trade-off is longevity of the engine.  I THINK it runs 
cooler, but I still don't have enough miles on it to make an accurate 
assessment in that regard.  I've been watching CHT and oil temp.

My mileage (MPG) has dropped off (from about 18.5 MPG to 17 MPG).  I'm 
guessing it is because I'm having to be more aggressive with the 
accelerator pedal in order to compensate for the decreased power.

I am now using a SVDA distributor instead of a 009, but I am not seeing 
the benefits that many people claim (better gas mileage, cooler 
running).

My opinion is that this is not an upgrade from a rebuild, but I'm 
hoping time will prove me wrong.
