Hi, All.

I'm tuning my '79 California emission bus in preparation for the smog test.

Bently, in section 20.3, shows (figure 20-4) a tach connected to a 
couple of resistors and leads. I carefully constructed the device and 
used it as instructed. I noticed immediately that the idle was very high 
(to my ear), and I was unable to get the timing dialed in because the 
advance was kicking in, confirming my belief that the idle was too high. 
I then connected my tach in the conventional manner and successfully set 
the idle and timing.

I do, in fact, have the breakerless dizzy.

I have verified that the device I built is correctly wired, and tested 
it with an ohmmeter.

WTF? What's the purpose of the adapter? Has anyone successfully used one?
