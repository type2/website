100 to 1 says it just needs a charge.

Just set your battery charger on "deep cycle" setting if it has it and leave
it for several hours. The more the battery needs a charge, the more stress
it will put on your alternator, thus putting your alternator at risk of
overheating and failure.

Little things can drain a "low" battery. Wipers, headlights, radio, heater
fan, extended traffic with your brake lights on, etc. So some times it will
seem like the battery is fine, and other times it will seem that it is
draining. Those are the symptoms of a low charge.

An alternator is only a charge maintainer, not a mobile-charging system. I
would invest (if you haven't already) in a nice automatic multi-purpose
battery charger. Mine has paid off in gold.

Good luck!
