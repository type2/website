With the spark plugs installed you are fighting the compression of  
the engine so it's no wonder it's hard to turn especially with the  
piston rings loaded with oil as you describe.

Pull all 4 plugs and try turning the engine over. Use that feeling of  
rotating the engine to gauge your assembly skills.
