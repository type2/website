There is also a metal filter in the gas tank you should pull and clean.

The fuel pump filter isn't very large. I'd put a normal beetle fuel  
filter inline with the tank and pump.

Be careful. You could be 10 miles away from a cylinder head failure.

On the Type 4 case the oil control value is not in the same place as  
Type 1. It's on the right side of the engine between the push rod tubes:

A few possibilities:

- remove the extra slack from the accelerator cable.

- apart from the valve and timing issues, I suspect your timing is  
overly retarded. The 72 engine was setup from the factory to run hot  
to reduce the emissions. The heads tended to fail and gave the Type 4  
bus engine a bad reputation before people figured out what VW did to  
make it so. Disconnect the vacuum advance cutoff (left of blower) and  
run the vacuum advance right off the carb.

Before driving it anymore you should verify the timing with a  
borrowed scale and check the advance with a timing light but more  
importantly check the advance/retard with a vacuum pump. The vacuum  
cans tend to fail on those cars and if you are running with incorrect/ 
retarded timing you'll find the heads overheat and the valves  
stretch. They can only stretch a little before the head falls off and  
the engine is destroyed:
