Subject: Lingering battery/alternator light

We camped last weekend in our '79 Westy, and used the interior lights quite
a bit over the course of the evening. After we broke camp and I fired the
bus up the next morning, I noticed the red alternator light stayed on, even
after revving the engine a bit once it got warm. I allowed the bus to idle
for several more minutes, and the light remained on the entire time.
However, we got buckled in and on our way, and the light blinked off once
the engine was "under load." No more problems on the 100+ mile trip home,
nor this week when using it daily.

Until today, that is. It's been rainy the last couple days, and the bus has
been sitting on the driveway. It started up fine this afternoon (battery
seemed maybe a little weak), and the red light glowed for a couple of
minutes after I was underway, but blinked off again. I got to where I was
goijg, stayed a couple of hours, and the same thing happened on the way
home. No flickering at all, just steady red light until it blinked off
completely. Besides the (possibly imagined) slower cranking, there are no
ther symptoms.

So is it likely that I ran the battery down camping, and it just needs a
charge? Should I be looking at  replacing the alternator altogether? Or is
this something that could be caused by wet weather and a slippery belt?
There is no squealing or squeaking to signify slippage, however. Anyway, if
you've got insight, let me know. TIA-
