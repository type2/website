but be aware many people are sensitive to Latex, and some are very alergic
to latex and have even died just from touching something that has been
handled by someone wearing latex gloves.  it appears that the latex alergy
is brought on by extensive contact with latex.  I highly reccomend some of
the latex alternatives used by many hospitals and docs nowdays. the cost
is about the same but without the latex sensitivity problem.  IF you are
using latex gloves and you find your hands itching or getting red STOP
immediately and use something different.  Vynl or Nitrile work just as
well or better

nailpolish remover is considerably less concentrated than the using
industrial acetone or straight acetone
