 I believe the CR of the Mexican blocks is way down there, like in the 6's.
 You will notice a loss of power in my opinion for sure. I think the term 
you
want to use is 'dished' pistons, as domed usually means the tops are higher
 in the middle than along the circumference. I knew what you meant though.
 :-)

 I would agree, if you are flogging the pedal more to get the extra power,
 you're going to lose gas mileage. Not much you can do about the low CR
 unless you want to have the heads done, or else trim the tops of the
 cylinders. Too much work for that. If you feel you need more power, put a
 set of kadron carbs on and a free flowing muffler. In my opinion the Kads
 retain the mpg because you are not being as aggressive on the pedal. They
 are bullet proof too. As to the SVA dizzy, well VW used millions of them on
 production vehicles, and NOT ONE 009. Save the 009 for performance engines.
 YMMV,

================================================================
I don't yet have 4000 miles on my engine but...
 Based on the assumption that these MexiMotors have domed pistons and hence
 a decreased compression ratio, making them compatible for lousy grades of
 gas...
 This engine does not have the power that my previous one had.
 Thatistosay, Lurch does not climb the hills the way he/she/it used to.
 I guess the trade-off is longevity of the engine.  I THINK it runs cooler,
 but I still don't have enough miles on it to make an accurate assessment
 in that regard.  I've been watching CHT and oil temp.
My mileage (MPG) has dropped off (from about 18.5 MPG to 17 MPG).  I'm
 guessing it is because I'm having to be more aggressive with the
 accelerator pedal in order to compensate for the decreased power.
 I am now using a SVDA distributor instead of a 009, but I am not seeing
 the benefits that many people claim (better gas mileage, cooler running).
 My opinion is that this is not an upgrade from a rebuild, but I'm hoping
 time will prove me wrong.
