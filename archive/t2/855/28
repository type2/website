Subject: "I saw it at Home Depot"- useful for Bus owners

We need a weekly report on useful stuff spotted at the home stores.

1. Yesterday I picked up  "Big Fix"= Duct tape 12" wide by 30 feet long-
good for anything ripped, cracked, or generally falling apart!  Comes 
with peel backing and a strip cutter- very smart.

2. They also have "4" wide aluminum tape; the most useful stuff to temp. 
bridge rust areas on a bus to pass inspection.  Sticks like crazy (I do 
a QUICK wipe with acetone to make a good base)- sticks so well, I've 
seen it outlast busses it was put on.

3. Speaking of acetone, it's a favorite solvent for those of us who have 
worked in prepping specimens for the electron microscope- Nasty to the 
skin (will dry it out pronto)- use nitrile gloves or organic solvent 
gloves.  I'm sure sci teacher George Lyle will voice a disclaimer here- 
It mixes with  BOTH water and organic solvents, like 100% ethanol will. 
  Removes plastic layers, which ethanol will not-  If you are very fast, 
it will clean dirty (stained) plastic like seatbelt covers or handstraps 
or oxidized paint.   Trick is rubbing it on applied to a cloth followed 
by IMMEDIATE rubbing off.  Practise in the junkyard- makes a good prep 
for holding new paint if you are even in its use. Better than breathing 
methyl ethyl ketone products.

4. Also saw hose clamps which have THUMB SCREWS to tighten- I can see 
these as useful for those hard to reach airduct connections behind your 
engine.
