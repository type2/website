You didn't say what brand it is (VW label?) but it sounds like the bypass
valve didn't do what it was supposed to do.

One of the test points in most oil filter comparisons is the valve. Frams
use a crappy paper one. I blew a Fram that sounds just like yours on my old
GTI. That's when I started getting picky about filters.

(BTW: The GWB is stripped. I'm going to list it on Craigslist for a week or
so and see if anybody wants to give a few pennies for it...)
