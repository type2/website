RAtwell,  in "Double Relay Demistified", says bout the double relay, "It's 
mounted  below the series resistors [plural?? what goes...] that power the 
fuel  injectors and two plugs connect to the bottom."

Reading this, and the  electro-mechanical aspects of the Double Relay, I 
would expect to see a  greater chance of failure [If you fry the relay . . .] 
of this series  resistor.  What say you??

hey Barry  I can't remember when I last sawa series resistor go bad  but I 
have seen hundreds of double relays go bad  later  mark  Dearing
