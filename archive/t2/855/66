Subject: Re: [T2] Re:  acetone  and superglue use by us-a warning

I think surgical gloves are the best thing since sliced bread.  I  was in the auto parts business for a while and I sold to  mechanics.  Most of them use them.  And they're also used in  chemical and manufacturing plants.  Get used to them and use  them.  Plus they beat trying to de-grease your hands all the time  during a tough job.  Acetone is great stuff if used  properly.  But it can be nasty on humans.  JMHO...KR

Well it can't be all that bad, since women apply it directly to their 
skin all the time.

Now you are speaking to a histologist, microscopist, and 
inventor/putterer who unwillingly had to consult a dermatologist.

Women should apply acetone to their nails, not their skin.  Yes, nails 
are technically skin, but much more densely crosslinked.  PS; superglue 
is good for temp. binding of a badly ripped nail. Try using acetone to 
remove grease or auto paint (it is found in lacquers and car acrylics) 
from your fingers and it will turn the skin white as it easily 
penetrates and removes skin oils AND hydration.  Years of use gave me a 
"work induced psoriasis" on my fingertips, where the skin was thickened 
and cracking as though it had no collagen to bind between the ridges. 
Very painful, as it would crack upon any stress like hand-tightening 
bolts or pushing on screwdrivers.  Now, two years of religious 
non-solvent contact and minimal push pull on engine work my fingertips 
are fairly normal.  You should also avoid direct contact with gasoline, 
benzene, or tolulene, as they are also carcinogenic and can cause the 
same "psoriasis".
