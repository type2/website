From your experience, which would be the thing to go
bad, the Series Resistor or the Double Relay.

RAtwell, in "Double Relay Demistified", says bout
the double relay, "It's mounted below the series 
resistors [plural?? what goes...] that power the 
fuel injectors and two plugs connect to the bottom."
 
Reading this, and the electro-mechanical aspects of
the Double Relay, I would expect to see a greater
chance of failure [If you fry the relay . . .] 
of this series resistor.  What say you??
 
-----------------------------------------------------

It [the series resister] is plural because there are 4
resisters in it, one for each injector. If you look at
the wiring diagram, you will see 5 wires going to it.
One common in and four out.

In the past 10+ years I have only seen 1 resister bad 
and only one circuit was dead [open]. Bus still ran on
3 cylinders.

The double relay has a fairly high failure rate.
Probably because it has 2 relays and diodes in it, it
does not like excessive charging voltage.
