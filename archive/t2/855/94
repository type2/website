Hi Mario,

It's no wonder you can't sell it if fixing one up costs $67K!!!!

I found a very nice 87 locally last fall, it was *almost* as solid as  
my westfakia. But I could have bought another baywindow or two for  
what it would have cost me to fix the waterboxer engine and  
transmission. So I parted it out.... Now I have much nicer tires and  
seats on my westfakia.


Happy trails,
