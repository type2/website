Actually, dished pistons would be low compression.

Matches my experience.

I don't know about longevity.  It certainly is nice not to have any ping,
even on a hot day climbing hills at large throttle openings.

My experience too.  Lower compression means lower volumetric efficiency.

I didn't see any difference either.  I did see a big difference in
drivability, though, which makes the SVDA distributor worth it.

Having _all_ the parts be new is definitely a plus.  If I wanted to build
a higher compression engine, I'd start with a Meximotor and replace the
pistons for higher compression.

Higher compression might be a good idea these days.  The price difference
between regular and premium has remained about 20 cents even with the
overall price doubling.  It might be more economical to build an engine
with higher compression that gets better mileage even if it requires 92
octane.
