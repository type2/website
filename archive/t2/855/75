Could  someone verify which way the oil cooler seals go on.  I did not
pay  attention when I took the old ones off.  My guess would be that  the
thicker side goes on the the engine.

Hello Daniel    There isn't any difference on the correct  seal. Something 
tells me you have the adapter type seals for the type1  motor.   Are they 
green??  Most of the correct seals are either  black, red or orangish and are the 
same on both sides for the later type1 and  type 4 motors  later  Mark Dearing
