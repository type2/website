Subject: Who was kind enough to send me the thermostat bracket and

I just bought a new computer and don't have the email handy to check who it
was that was kind enough to send me the bracket and pulley for my thermostat.
Could that person please contact me via this list or pmail? My I.Q. and memory
are starting to work inversely to my age.
Many thanks in advance,
Courtney Hook
