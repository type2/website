It should feel this way. Your old engine was worn out. You are building a
new engine and until it is broken in, the parts actually interfere with each
other, especially the rings on the cylinder walls. Because of the
cross-hatch on the cylinders, there is a lot of friction between ring and
cylinder, and this is good, it is needed to seat the rings properly. Do you
hear the air pressure building and releasing on each cylinder as you turn
the engine over? This is a good sound.

It sounds to me like you have done everything right. The most important
feeling is the bottom end before the P&C are installed, and you say that was
very smooth, as it should be. Richard suggested removing the plug, a good
idea to be safe. There will still be some force needed to turn it over, but
no compression.
