Subject: Series Resistors versus Double Relays

From your experience, which would be the thing to go bad, the Series 
Resistor or the Double Relay.

RAtwell, in "Double Relay Demistified", says bout the double relay, "It's 
mounted below the series resistors [plural?? what goes...] that power the 
fuel injectors and two plugs connect to the bottom."

Reading this, and the electro-mechanical aspects of the Double Relay, I 
would expect to see a greater chance of failure [If you fry the relay . . .] 
of this series resistor.  What say you??
