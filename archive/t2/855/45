 Hi All,
Okay, '72 1.7L, progressive carb, all stock (except carb). Moving my 009 from my old motor to my new-ish
motor. P.O. painted the fan so timing marks are almost impossible to see, I've turned the engine so both
valves on #1 are fully closed, the "notch" on the top of the distributor shaft is aligned a la Muir's book (12
degrees off of the centerline with the "fat" section towards the centerline. Now, if I put the distributor in,
the rotor ends up pointing at about the 7 o'clock position, not the 4 o'clock position like the books show. I
don't have a Bentley (shame!) and I've rotated the crank on the old motor since removing the 009 (shame,
shame!) Am I missing something? Do I just need to run my plug wires accordingly? Any help would be greatly
appreciated.

Pull off the 3/4 valve cover. Turn the engine in the direction of rotation. Watch the #3 valves. You will see
the exhaust valve open and then close.
JUST as the exhaust closes, you will see the intake start to open. STOP.
As you rock the crank barely back and forth, you will see the 2 valves rocking. At the instant they are equal,
look at your crank pully, The timing mark should be dead on zero for #1 to fire.

Put your distributor in. Where is the rotor pointing in relation to the index mark on the top edge of the dist
housing? If it is not pointing to the index mark, your drive gear was not installed correctly. Depending to
where it is pointing determines your next job.

If it is pointing 90 or 180 degrees off, you can move the wires accordingly. If ir is between the terminals on
the cap, you will need to lift and turn the drive very carefully.
