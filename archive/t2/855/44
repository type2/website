Subject: distributor help

Hi All,
Okay, '72 1.7L, progressive carb, all stock (except carb). Moving my 009 
from my old motor to my new-ish motor. P.O. painted the fan so timing marks 
are almost impossible to see, I've turned the engine so both valves on #1 
are fully closed, the "notch" on the top of the distributor shaft is aligned 
a la Muir's book (12 degrees off of the centerline with the "fat" section 
towards the centerline. Now, if I put the distributor in, the rotor ends up 
pointing at about the 7 o'clock position, not the 4 o'clock position like 
the books show. I don't have a Bentley (shame!) and I've rotated the crank 
on the old motor since removing the 009 (shame, shame!) Am I missing 
something? Do I just need to run my plug wires accordingly? Any help would 
be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Jeff
