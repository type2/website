Look at your dist rotor, it will be pointing to #1 to  FIRE. If not, move
 your plug wires to match.


 Hi Volks,
Make sure that the #1 plug wire is in the correct spot in the cap AND the
rotor is pointed at the #1 notch in the distributor when you find # 1 TDC.
 Since the mid 1960s the distributor points lobe for #3 cylinder is slightly retarded to keep it running
cooler. So if the distributor or the drive for it is set wrong and you time your engine, # 1, 2, & 4 will be
advanced  more and engine can run too hot.

The 3 degree retard built into #3 dist lobe lasted about 5 years, from 64 to 70. Once the SVDA dist and the
doghouse shroud came along, the retard went away. there are not to many of those vacuum-only distributors
around. I used to have a list of the dist part numbers that had it, but in all the moves over time, it got
misplaced. If I remember right, it was only used on the 1500 engine.
