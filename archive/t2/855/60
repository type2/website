Well it can't be all that bad, since women apply it directly to their skin
all the time.

Acetone is also called "Nail Polish Remover!"

It also dissolves cyanoacrylate "super" glues.  I keep a jar of acetone
with a few superglue nozzles soaking in it.  When a CA nozzle
clogs, just swap it for a nice clean one and toss the clogged nozzle
in the bottle.  Much easier than poking the things with pins, etc.
