remains inside the tank 1-1/2" to 2" of slug tar). The tank does not need to 
be patched or sealed just cleaned. Does anyone have any suggestions? Thanks a

Take it to a radiator/tank shop. They have hot tanks for cleaning and did
a much better, faster job than I could...After that, I used the POR-15 sys-
tem...But there, others may differ...BTW, this was on a '59 Healey tank
quite a few years ago and still no leaks, but YMMV...
