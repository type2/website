Subject: Front door key code

Hello list,

I have recently purchased a 1970 westy, which came without keys for the
front doors (the previous owner had removed the original ignition and
apparently never locked the doors).  I would like to get new keys
cut.  However, after searching the archives I am still unclear as to where
on the handle the key code is located?

Thanks for the help-

Asaph
