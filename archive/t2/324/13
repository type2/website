Don't forget what you see out the mirror also depends on how tall/short you
are and if the seat high is different to standard.
I have heard the Vanagon mirror will fit the bay's also and are quite a bit
bigger.

As for the rear height, definitely adjust them properly (with the torsion
bars). The proper ride height will also affect CV life, and as the number of
"Baja Bus's" here in Brisbane have proven the shock mounts cannot handle the
strain of coil overs or air springs/shocks.
