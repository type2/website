Subject: rainy day question

well this isnt for me, but a friend was trying to start his bug and was 
having some problems. the question is does the coil need to be grounded to 
the fan shroud. well im only asking because i thought that i saw something 
in my haynes manual that said that it needed to be. well i hope someone can 
set me straight, or whatever. thanks

joey
