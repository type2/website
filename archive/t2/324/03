Subject: oil capacity

what is the oil capacity for an engine from a 411 or 412 or whatever they 
are. i think my engine is from one but im not sure. i also think that maybe 
the dipstick is not the right one for that engine. so where can i look up 
the engine code also. hope you guys  get this question cause it doesnt 
really make that much sense as im writing it right now. but i think that 
youll figure it out. thanks everyone
