I can't deny that having a tester would be handy. For those that are just
interested in setting the mixture to get the %CO right. An alternative to
the cheap analyzers that just measure O2 and convert using a table (that I
haven't tried myself) is to hook up a Lambda sensor if you already don't
have one and connect it to an air/fuel ratio gauge.  I haven't seen a VDO
gauge like this.
