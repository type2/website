Hi Jeff

this is a FART <LOL> that has been surveyed a number of times,,, we could ask
the question again to see if the results differ, but iirc the conclusion has
always been that coil over shocks that FIT correctly will not break off the
mount. or can I say, have never broken off a mount.

Do you have experience with a broken mount you can share?

 My Westy has about 200,000 miles on the mounts with coil over shocks, still
going strong.

Can anyone say they have experienced a shock mount failure with a properly
fitted coil over shock installed??

Please don't reply if you had a dune buggy with way toooo big coil overs, or ill
fitted air shocks that bottomed out before the suspension compressed
adequately..... 

just tell us about experience with stock coil overs on a stock bus used in
general driving circumstances.

Thanks
