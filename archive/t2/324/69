Whoo! not just a loaded subject, but seriously loaded....the folks on the 
megasquirt list are literally scouring the world for the wide-band sensors
since only one company apparently makes them(Honda) and the price just 
doubled last week.

Someone in Holland had a line on 11 of them, bought them all and then 
checked back a week later on them again...the price had tripled.

Now running about $245 each in the U.S.....but you can't get them at the 
flaps any more...only from across the Honda parts counter...and everyone 
*knows* what that means.

Cheers, dave
