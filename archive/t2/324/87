change your fluid, clean the filter, if you haven't done so recently.

. check to see that the shift linkage adjustment is correct
. check that the three bolts holding the torque converter to the flex
plate are tight, torque to spec, these bolts are not interchangeable and
will scrap if not tight
. check for metal flakes in fluid
. does fluid smell burnt
. possible beginning failure of torque converter one way clutch.


any other symptoms other than noise, does this noise also occur in other
gears?
