Hmmm, I put those coilovers in my 78 Westy around 120,000 and now it's
240,000 mi, and they've survived Philly potholes (Philadelphia)- but
your point is well taken- but like shear pins in a tractor, I think
you'd have the mounting bolts fail first.  I assume they  don't take all
the load; just share it with the torsion bars.  I have a vague memory of
some stock VW parts option that had coilovers; can anyone verify this?
