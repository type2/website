Maybe, maybe not. I have had various buses over the years. I had a 
well balanced 1972 Westy that had the short stem mirror and 
visibility was ok at best.

I can only guess that the long stem mirrors from 1968, 1969 and maybe 
1970 were considered a safety hazard because they hung down almost to 
the middle on the windsheild. Darn that Ralph Nadar :)

The  long stem mirrors rule with an iron fist.

Here are some pics of my 1968 bus which show the mirror location.
