Subject: Re: [T2] Subwoofer between the front seats

Hmmm, in my 71 Westy of yesteryear, that's where I put the CB radio, cb
switch (turned off the hi-fi/radio when you had an incoming transmission
or spoke into mike), and the cupholders/food tray.  The cup holder part
had six holes drilled around a circle holding a homeade net for each cup
& slid out towards the front, and the top had a hinged lid with a piece
of carpet you could step on as you went to the rear.  It all was
fastened to a shelf slung exactly between the medial sides of the seat
rails, with pins that engaged holes in the seat pedestals.  Behind this
I added a side hinged padded backwall that served as the rear to a
removable seat pad covering the portapotti...It hinged off the
sink/fridge.  Two small door bolts  held the cover in place.  This
allowed 2 pairs of people to sit around the center table.....and you
could still get through the walkthrough.......wish I had pics.
