Nice for you, though I do like to hear the engine noise too, so I really 
don't have any subs and don't turn it up all that loud.

Between the front seats of my '77 Riviera is the padded stool that a PO 
put the 12 disk changer in. and had screwed down. It has a flip up lid 
on the top and then padding on top of that like is in the back seats. 
You can lay across both seats and it is pretty comfy. My wife likes it 
because she can lay down while we are driving without climbing into the 
back, almost as comfortable as a bench seat for such things.

The stool is shorter front to back than your cabinet, as it stops just 
in front of the seat belt posts. The lid is hinged such that it flips up 
to vertical and stops there. It has a pocket on the back of the lid that 
I keep my registration and insurance card in. I should really put a copy 
of my license in there, just in case. Inside there is a box that is half 
the length and just shy of a CD deep that slides front to back on a lip 
attached to the inside walls of the box.  I keep tapes and CDs in it. 
The 12 disk changer, and a folder with reciepts for parts and manuals 
are underneath that. It's a good setup because my wife or I can change 
the CD's while we are driving.

You could easily build an enclosure on top that held a CD changer and 
some CD's, with either a pad or a lip like you have now.

I broke my digital camera or I would post pictures.
