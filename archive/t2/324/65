It is telling you that your engine is maintaining 14.7 A/F ratio.  The pulsing is what is supposed to happen with a properly tuned engine.  It should also indicate full-rich when accelerating hard and full lean when decelerating.  That is all the data it can give you.

Hoo-boy, is that ever a loaded subject.  The sensors are becoming hard to find and the kit is not trivial to assemble, but this is a good way to go if you're handy with a soldering iron.
