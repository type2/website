Subject: Re: [T2] type 2 engine specs

I put together a list of the specs which can be found at
http://www.cs.fiu.edu/~jstric01/images/VW/vw_type_iv_air_cooled_2.htm. I also
recently found the Kolbenschmidt catalog which states the following for rod big
ends if using their bearings. Bore range 52.800 - 52.813 mm.

Hope that this helps.
