Subject: petrol smell in cab

I would check the condensation lines that run up into
the vent area. on the drivers side if you run you hand
along the steel line back towards the firewall (behind
the spare tire protrusion) you will find a rubber fuel
line splice. These tend to be ovelooked and or unknown
as it is hidden from view. Over time they rot and will
leak. Check and see if it feels wet or if it is even
still there.
  symptoms are:
*Fuel smell after filling up.
*fuel smell when tanks is close to full and you go
around a corner.
  The cold gas from the underground tank is put into
your buses fuel tank which is warmer causeing
expansion. the metal condensation lines, as i
understand it, are there to handle this expansion of
the gasoline and or vapors.
  If this isnt the case then it may be the filler neck
has a leak.
