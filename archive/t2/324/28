Thanks Christopher,

I'm trying to utilize my front speaker balance.  I've got a CD player 
and some Pioneer 6x9's in the back, under rear seat - no middle seat 
installed.  Need some front speakers to fill it all in.  As of present I 
have to blast, 80% to 90% max., the rear speakers to get over the road  
noise.  Windows are always open - unless raining, fortunately it's 
always warm :-) .

The previous owner had some speakers mounted low, as you describe in 
your original post.  I  made new front door panels when cleaning up the 
bus.  

I have also kicked around the idea of trying to mount two small speakers 
under the dash, but not in the front kick plates.  Space is limited....
