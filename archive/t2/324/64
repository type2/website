Subject: Parking Brake

Hi.. The rear brakes should be adjusted first before doing the parking brake. 
Anyway, if that doesn't work it maybe that your parking brake cable is ceased 
or stiff on one side. I had this problem and it turned out to be stiff 
because of corrosion in the cable where it goes under the rear torsion arms. 
No amount of adjustment could lock both wheels when I applied the brake, I 
could get one OK but not the other although I could get it tight but not 
locked. The cable sheath is reinforced here but mine had managed to cut 
through in the past and let moisture in. Someone had patched the covering and 
the cable (wire) itself was OK but I guess some surface rust was there and 
that had caused the problem. You will have mark the cables inside the rear 
brake and apply 6 clicks to the parking brake to see if you are getting 
movement in both drums. I replaced the cables on both sides and then OK.

     I was wondering if anyone might be able to help me out with a
parking brake problem.  I have a 72 and you need to adjust underneath by
holding the slotted cables and turning a nut.  Well I did this, with the
parking brake pulled out six inches.  I did not have good results.  I
either got both tires locked up and could pull the brake or one tire
locked up when the brake was pulled.  So now I am thinking I need to
adjust the rear drums.  Has anyone had problems with trying to adjust
the parking brake?  Is adjusting the rear drums going to solve the
problem?
