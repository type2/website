Subject: Re: [T2] oil capacity

It has been awhile since I owned a pancake but I recall it being 3 
quarts w/o filter and 3.5ish with. I usually changed the filter every 
time. Here is a hint if you do not already do it this way. Fill the 
filter up with oil slowly. Smear a bit of oil on the rubber seal 
before you screw it on. Cap the half empty bottle and set it aside 
for another day. Use three full quarts to fill the engine.
