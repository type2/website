I'm sure I've missed something here important but where is the trapped 
pressure?

The solenoid I plan to use (once I locate and buy it) will be right at the 
gas tank so that when it is off there is no way for fuel to leak out (in 
case of fire). If the valve is anywhere else you've got fuel line between 
the tank and the valve that can leak, burn, or fall off.

In my '78's case it will be gas tank, valve, filter, pump, engine.

As I see it if I close the valve when the engine running it is just going 
to stall as if it ran out of gas.

I'm sure I'm missing something that you guys are getting at so please 
correct me.
