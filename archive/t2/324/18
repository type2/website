Where are you in NJ? (I am near Princeton, NJ)- we have a 78 Westy and
75 bus...fast idle could be as simple as accelerator cable mounted to
your throttle incorrectly or a sticking gas pedal. May be the former as
you had an engine pull for the clutch.  Sometimes it is kinked where it
goes through the firewall.  Pull the engine access cover and lie on the
rear seat if it flips flat-and stare at the throttle as someone steps on
the accel. pedal- you will see what part is being pulled and rotated as
engine speed is demanded.  You can usually feel the throttle bottom out
vs "trying to stretch the cable" as you force it to fully off.  At that
point the throttle plate is fully closed.  To visualize that, you may
need to pull the air cleaner/Air Flolw Meter by loosening the clamp over
the throttle housing, removing attached hoses to the air cleaner, and
then unsnapping the lower front clip under the air cleaner.  Lift the
air cleaner up and swing it out of the bus.  Now, the throttle plate is
visible with a mirror you hold from above.  Usually I loosen the barrel
bolt holding the throttle cable (use a small 8mm? socket) and verify the
maximum adjustment to get full throttle, and it should go to fully
closed on its own.
