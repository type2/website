Subject: help! BA6 switch

I've got the BN4 installed and working and now all I have to do is get this
dash switch hooked up. Through the kindness of a list member, I now have a
really nice switch from (I think) a BA6 heater. It has a green knob with a
light bulb and temp written on the front with arrows indicating turning
clockwise. It clicks once when moved clockwise and then has a rheostat that
moves through about 270 degrees of arc. The body of the unit is about 2"x3"
and 2" deep.

The problem is that there are 10 terminals on the back.  Does anyone know
the proper hook-ups. I think one is for switched power (while running), one
for unswitched power ( for the timer ) one for ground (?) and of course one
to go to the heater.

I can't seem to get the switch to change the voltage of any of the
terminals.
Any help would be most appreciated.
