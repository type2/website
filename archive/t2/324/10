Subject: Engine racing!

Where is the first thing I should look at if my engine suddenly starts 
racing when idling and in neutral?  I was coming home and this problem 
came up at a stop light and didn't go away.  My bus goes thru all the 
gears fine but when idling the engine races as if it were in second or 
third gear.  (I am guessing as a don't have a tachometer.)  I just had a 
new clutch installed, if that means anything.  Thanks for mulling this 
over.  Beth in NJ and the '78 Bus
