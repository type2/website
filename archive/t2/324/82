Subject: Re: [T2] Re:coilover shocks-were they ever VW option?

your point is well taken- but like shear pins in a tractor, I think
you'd have the mounting bolts fail first.  I assume they  don't take all

I wouldn't assume that at all, back in the 70's (and my hot rod days) I saw
many a shock mount sheared off the at the frame due to over-inflated air
shocks.  Jeff
