Subject: Subwoofer location

The 74 parts Westy has the wide rear seat/bed, and the PO cut a
centerhole for a subwoofer (8") and side oval treble/midrage speakers-
it is a Pioneer system.  As the frontwall is nice and stiff compared to
the 75 flipseat, I may want to switch seats. Does the subwoofer have to
face down or was this setup OK?  I know that bass perception is better
the longer the run for the sound waves, and am considering the bass to
come out there but have front mounted tweeter/midrange speakers for
presence.
