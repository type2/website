There are 2 different long mirrors:

From 218 000 001 to 219 060 788 used part # 211 857 501A.
It was held on by two screws.

From 219 060 789 to 219 300 000 used part # 211 857 501B.
It was spring loaded, break-away style. But the pic of the base appears different than the later style
break-aways......

If the upper header cover plate needed to be replaced, only the later style was available and the B mirror has
to be used. Header cover plate # is 211 805 283A. I cannot find any difference in the hole for the break-away
styles.

Below are short mirrors:

Mirror # 211 857 501C was used to vin 219 300 000 on m-codes M46 and M62. M46 was 211-271 models in Denmark.
M62 was 211-271 models in Sweden.

Mirror # 211 857 501G was used on USA buses from 210 2000 001 to 211 2300 000. It has the day/night feature
[anti-dazzle].

Mirror # 211 857 501H was used from 212 2000 001 on M124, 211-274 models in France.

Mirror # 211 857 501J was used from 212 2000 001 on USA models 211-274.

Mirror # 261 857 501 was used from 211 2000 001 on M62: 261,265 single and double cabs in Sweden.

I cannot find the part # number for the 78/79 brown Champagne Edition mirror.
