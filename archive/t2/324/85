Subject: Gas tank problem

Dear List:
       Today I pulled a beautiful gas tank out of a 69 Westy. It looks like 
it did the day it was built. I thought the tank was empty but when I removed 
it from the bus it was full of old gas. I poured out the gas but there 
remains inside the tank 1-1/2" to 2" of slug tar). The tank does not need to 
be patched or sealed just cleaned. Does anyone have any suggestions? Thanks a 
million.

Paul
