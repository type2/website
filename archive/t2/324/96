Subject: Who is Shawn Madison

I am writing this message for Susan Dolvin. (pk451301(-at-)pocketmail.com)
 She just called, stating Shawn
went to her house in OR, and picked up a westy interior from her property,
paid a sum substantially less than any potentially discussed price, and left
her property WITHOUT negotiation..!  Susan's' young son
was on the property, and took the money because Shawn said he was talking to
her.
  Susan is out of town, and has tried repeatedly to contact Shawn
unsuccessfully.  If
ANYONE has the ability to get in contact with Shawn, or if YOU, Shawn
YOURSELF reads this, get in contact with me or Susan Immediately.

Eric&Barb - Contact us regardless.

Thank you.
