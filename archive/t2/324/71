Don't bother. Go to a REAL parts store like NAPA. NAPA keeps Heli-coil kits 
in stock and usually have people working the counter that know something 
versus the $6.15 an hour crowd at the supermarket FLAPS. I used to work at 
Advance Auto part time so trust me on this one... <grin> My coworker there 
one night leaned over and quietly asked - "What's a sparkplug for?" And 
they hired this person - yes, one of many.... <grin>

>1. What caused this type thing to happen?

Stripped threads caused be cross threading the plug, removing the plug when 
the head is hot (steel plug expands faster and further than the aluminum 
hole it is screwed into so it can rip out the threads when removed hot), 
simple wear. I've heard some folks recommend grease or antiseize on the 
plug threads when you put the plugs in. If you do this use very, very 
little. The argument against it is that the grease or antiseize will harden 
and lock in the threads and threaten to ruin the threads again in the 
future. Read up on it. Don't take my word on it.

>2. What other damage could come from this?

Most likely none unless you were running on 3 cylinders and running it hard 
and overheating it. This is a common failure. I have dealt with a half 
dozen myself for friends and on cars I bought.

>3. Whats the best fix now that she is home in the drive way?

Remove the engine. Strip off the tin. Carry to machine shop and have them 
install the Helicoil for you. Reinstall engine, roll over with starter 
(ignition off, spark plug out) to blow out any aluminum chips.

It is very difficult to repair this with the engine installed and tin on. 
It can be done with the engine in place but the tin off but removing the 
tin with the engine in place is pretty difficult too.

Pull it, remove the tin, fix the threads, put it back together with a few 
new gaskets, some cleaning and/or new paint  and above all new fuel lines 
with clamps.

Good luck.
