Subject: Re: [T2] pulling crank gear

I think that vwalley.com sells a gear puller (much cheaper than the others I have seen, around $25) for the type IV engine. If not he is always willing to create a new product. Contact him and ask. I got a nice cylinder head hold down kit from him for the type IV engine. Not in his catalog yet.

I just had my gear pressed off at a local shop. Only cost $5.00. The brass gear was on there tight.
