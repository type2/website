There is a GOLF or JETTA relay that you can just plug in that has a custom 
timer built in. Something like you turn on the wipers and then off and then 
after the period of delay you want you turn them on again and they will 
wipe at that delay. It is variable for a wide range of time. I have the 
details if anyone wants them.
