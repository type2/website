Subject: urgent accelerator cable removal

Thanks everyone who called and helped out.
Still having trouble with the acccelerator cable.
I removed the c clip and the spring from the rod that the accelerator cable 
is connected to that they were on.
I figured I could just push the rod back tyhrough the firewall. nope.
There is a nut on the rod before the rod goes througe the throtle then the 
spring was on the other side of the throttle. Should I do something with 
this nut?
All the stuff in the 3 manuals I have is for earlier models.
Not sure where the cable connects to the rod.
Last step besides fuel lines before I undue the bolts and drop it.
Thanks.
