Chris,

Sounds like a case of petrolis neglectus  when you were tapping the
hole--

You'd play hell drilling out that tap---


The only way I have ever been able to remove a busted one is by smacking
it with a chissel or punch--try working it out in reverse--

I've also used a small needle nose vice grips and plier's and stuck them
in the slots on the side of the tap--and worked it out too--

You'll smoke a bunch of drill bit's trying to get it outa that
hole--your Drill Doctor will be doin' double time--

Later,

TK

So how would you remove a broken tap? 
Cheap tools are fine and dandy until they break and while a cheap
screwdriver is aggravating... I think a cheap drill or tap stuck in the
hole is worse. 
Help! How do I get this d*%$ thing out of there? Can't drill it with my
ordinary drills, too hard. Rotary stone ala Dremel? (knowing full well
the Dremel ain't really for REAL work... <grin>) 
It's wedged in there pretty good!!!
