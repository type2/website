Subject: Re: [T2] Cheap Taps - It BROKE! Oh %^&*!

Got it out... Whew!

Was drilling the 1/4" driveshaft yokes that slide into both sides of the 
Corvair tranny. Needed the holes to be 5/16-24 for the Trans-vair 
conversion I'm doing.

Broke the first tap in the freshly cleaned and drilled yoke, then broke the 
second tap in my spare yoke! YIKES!

Used a fancy drill bit for hard steels I bought yesterday. It cut for about 
3/4 of a second. Probably reduced that bit's effectiveness to making holes 
in wax and sponge cake...

Used my Dremel with a stone on it to "drill it" and got it to within 1/8" 
of breaking through when the brushes overheated and the first Dremel 
died... Used a second one and the stone died. Got really frustrated and 
brought out the BIG F&^%ING HAMMER (TM) and punch.

Turned the yoke over and gave it a BIG WHACK (TM?). Cracked the tap. 5 more 
BIG WHACKS and it came out in chunks. Did not wreck the threads but left 
crumbs of the old tap embedded in the hole which wiped out my new tap. 
Replaced it and got the remaining 3 holes tapped out. Only took 10 hours 
for tapping 8 holes. I'm time rich and money poor so oh well.

Thanks for all the helpful suggestions from everyone. I'm going to try to 
salvage the other yoke for a spare so I'll try out the ideas I got from the 
good folks on the list.

Thanks to AirVair, Keith Hammett, Tony Underwood, Terry Kalp, Tony in NJ, 
Jim Arnott, George Lyle, Bob Access and anther half dozen folks on the VW 
Type2 list.

(And everyone I forgot to mention).
