Subject: Cold Windshield Wipers

Last night during a balmy 4degrees in Idaho. I went to use the
windshield wipers and they did not move, due to being frozen to
windshield (or ice rather). But the wiper motor made a sound (?)pipe
moving acorss another metal object that had teeth. A studdering sound. I
quickly turned it off, broke the wipers away from the ice. They worked
fine. (except they never actually returned to starting position when
turned off, they just stop, so you have to time it to the right point to
turn off.) Is that normal? 
Well today I went to use them, made sure no Ice contact was on
windshield between the blades and glass. No movement just a buzz sound
from (I think) below or behind the instrument cluster.  Now when I try
no noise or movement just the click of moving the wiper switch.

Where should I start?
