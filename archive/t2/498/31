Subject: finding #1 tdc firing position

Could you let me know if my thought process is correct here?

78 type4 engine.

#4 piston on downward stroke, gets to bottom, #4 exhaust valve starts to
open, piston one should now be at tdc ready to fire, mark on pulley
lines up with 0 degree mark - piston 1 at tdc matching with ditributor
firing cylinder 1

Sound right?

I'm rebuilding my engine and I want to make ultra sure that I'm putting
the distributor shaft in the correct position.

thanks!
Mike
