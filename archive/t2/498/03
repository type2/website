My '76 appears to have one of these Ford parts (I posted about it 
recently, asking for help identifying the part :-)  A few people 
suggested that I replace the Ford part with the Bosch relay, as the 
Ford part draws about as much current as the VW's starter solenoid does 
(i.e. "err, so, what's the point?").

The Bosch relay kit is only like $8, or so, and includes the wiring 
harness and fuse.
