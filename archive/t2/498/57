How deep in the hole?  Can you get in there with a punch and tap the thing
around backwards?

You might be able to attack it with a Dremel equipped with a tungsten
carbide bit.  These bits are somewhat pricey, so they don't come in the
normal bit assortment.  Get a 1/8 inch round end bit and see if it helps.
Even if it doesn't, you'll still find the bit to be a very useful thing
to have around.

If all else fails, take it to a machinist who has an EMD machine.  It will
eat away the tap very nicely.
