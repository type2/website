Yep.

If you can't remember, first draw 1's along the diagonal in a matrix
representing the 4 strokes and then fill in other spaces left to right
remembering the 1-4-3-2 firing order. Each row represent 180 degrees of
crank motion and you can determine what the other pistons are doing at any
one time.

      In  | Comp | Power |   Ex
    ------+------+-------+------
180   1   |  4   |   3   |   2
    ------+------+-------+------
360   2   |  1   |   4   |   3
    ------+------+-------+------
540   3   |  2   |   1   |   4
    ------+------+-------+------
720   4   |  3   |   2   |   1
