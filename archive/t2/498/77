Subject: RE: [T2] Type 4 dual carb spark plugs

According to Bill May(worked at Bosch in California "forever") the 
platinum plugs are *not* for a air cooled cars.  He says that
they used to give them to the employees to try out and that on his
a/c vw's it made them run hotter with not much other changes.

Bill is on the vintagvw list and has been "doing" vw's since back
in the Gene Berg days in California....actually, I am not sure that
Bill and Karl are not brothers<grin>.

Bill is extremely adamant about *no platinum* in a/c vw's but never said
anything about the porcelain.

Wonder what late model a/c porsche engines came with from the factory???


Just my 2 cents worth!

Cheers, dave
