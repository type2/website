Mark is right on here, but to make it maybe a bit clearer:

Index the distributor and drive together out of the engine, with the
distributor rotor installed and pointed to #1. Have the distributor
hold-down clamp installed on the distributor, but not the o-ring - this is
just so the distributor will slide into the bore with no resistance. Grease
the gear and shim(s) and install the two as a unit into the engine while
holding #1 rod at the top position. You may need to rotate the distributor
very slightly to mesh the gears. Install the nut on the hold-down and leave
it for later. The distributor gear should indexed, and the gear will not
fall out while turning the motor upside-down during assembly. Later in the
assembly process you can remove the distributor and install the o-ring.

This method is foolproof.
