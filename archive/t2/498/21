Subject: re: [T2] cut off hose

Hi Christopher,

Ohh..... That hose!!!!   :^)

I have a 1.8L 1974 VW 412 engine that has two of those (one per
side)... they are connected to the case breather box.

Since your engine has one head that doesn't have the smog port plugs,
(and one that does) it tells me that something must have come from
somewhere else.... and in this case I would expect that the somewhere
else was from a 412.

If it's capped off properly, you've got nothing to worry about.

Happy trails,
