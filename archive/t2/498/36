Subject: Cheap Taps - It BROKE! Oh %^&*!

So how would you remove a broken tap?

Cheap tools are fine and dandy until they break and while a cheap 
screwdriver is aggravating... I think a cheap drill or tap stuck in the 
hole is worse.

Help! How do I get this d*%$ thing out of there? Can't drill it with my 
ordinary drills, too hard. Rotary stone ala Dremel? (knowing full well the 
Dremel ain't really for REAL work... <grin>)

It's wedged in there pretty good!!!
