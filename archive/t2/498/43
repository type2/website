   Would they make a double slider with all that furniture in the way? What
   would it bolt up to? It makes more sense as an airport passenger delivery
   vehicle or commercial than a camper. Pretty rare.

i think you're right. i guess i should have said double door transporter
straight up, not panel. when considering bolting it up, i see my westy sink
(75) as a huge waste of space, and i'm better off replacing with a rear
facing seat. transporters "as rare"?
