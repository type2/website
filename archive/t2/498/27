Yes, I'm in the same boat with my '76 Westy.  My rubber mats are really 
torn up and ratty, and I can't find ones compatible with the Westy 
captain's chair.

So, what I decided to do instead is ditch the rubber mats, and use 
low-pile black automotive carpeting to cover the seat pedestals.  Where 
stiffness and shape are required, a stiff wire frame will be employed.  
I figure it will be a lot of work to cut / trim / glue the carpet into 
place, but it should look really nice, and be more durable than the 
rubber mats.

I'm going to give the same treatment to my kick panels, whose vinyl 
coverings are in bad shape.  Just trim off the bad vinyl bits, glue on 
the black carpet, trim with a utility knife for the cut-outs.
