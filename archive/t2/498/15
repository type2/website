Subject: Re: [T2] Seat Stand Mats

Yep, had the same problem with my '78 last summer. I looked at all the
online vendors and it seems no one makes the Westy specific pedestal mats. I
ended up salvaging the top part where it goes up over the lip of the
passenger side from my old mats. I still have about a six inch section that
I wasn't able to cover along the back of the seat stand but it doesn't look
to horrible just not quite right. Short of finding some that are still in
good shape in a salvage yard I think we are out of luck untill someone
starts reproducing them.
