Subject: STARTER WOES

Hello,

On my old 72 van and my newly purchased 72 van this happened to both of
them!
The old one had old corroded wires at the starter, it wouldn't start one day
and I looked underneath. I wiggled the wires alittle to see if maybe one of
the wires was loose
and the wires broke off due to the corrosion. I replaced the starter with a
new one and had to re-do
all the connections and she fired up. On the recently purchased van I had
the same problem,
wouldn't click or anything turning the key. I again purchased a new starter
and put it in but it didn't
fix it? somehow i noticed a tiny blue? wire in the engine compartment that
goes to a little
box by the right side (near battery) had come undone. I connected the wire
back up and then she started. To this day I still don't know what that
little wire was but it got the van started.
anyone know what this little wire might be?

Darren
