Andy,

I've repaired that same problem decades ago by soldering to the steel
plate with a 100 Watt iron and rosin cored electronics solder. You need to
get the area clean and shiny. Best to do it in a warm environment to help
heat the steel up. Finding the smallest projection on the steel base
plate, a tab for instance, will allow easiest and most successful
soldering to be done. Apply some solder to the tip so there's heat
transfer to the steel, then add solder to the steel cleaned-up area, while
gently scraping the iron in the area, to help get the solder and flux to
penetrate the surface of the steel. Takes a couple minutes, but it's
rather easy repair. Once you've got a puddle of solder wetted to the
steel, you can add your pre-tinned wire end to the mix. Remember not to
move the connection until the solder has set up.
