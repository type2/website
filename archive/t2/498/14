Subject: Seat Stand Mats

Gretings,

Thanks for the brake job input so far.

78 Westy

Does anyone know where (if even possible) to get new rubber seat stand or 
pedestal mats for the passenger side in a westy.  This is with the swivel 
seat and the regular mats don't fit.  I have the set made by WCM which will 
work great for the drivers side but the back is too low on the pass. side 
and the top side might work with a fair amount of cutting.

These would be in place of part #'s 211867765A and 211863665B

Anyone else run into this problem?

Thanks,
Brandt
