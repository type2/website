"As far as we can tell, the mails are getting trapped in AOL's junk mail 
filters."

I work for a company that sends out a million + emails every month and have encountered this exact problem.  You have to contact AOL to have the situation resolved whereby they don't filter messages to anyone from this email list.  This is the only way to properly resolve this.
