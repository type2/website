this strange blue hose was on the 73 super beetle i used to have & 
appeared to be factory. when replacing it, i took it to my local VW 
FLAPS & they had some in stock.

however, on the 74 bus i used to have, when i changed out the MC, it 
did _not_ use the blue hose, but rather a firm plastic non-flexible 
length of hose to connect the fluid reservoir & the MC.

hope that answers your question,
