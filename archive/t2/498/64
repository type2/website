Type 1 for sure, not positive on the year(s). It looks like it will attach
under three of the strainer nuts. The type IV ones have the attachments to
the case bolts, there are 2 tangs that the lower case bolts pass through,
and I do not see the tangs on that one.

Those heaters used to be available (for t1 and t4) cheaply all over canada
at any parts store, even at Canadian tire, but not any more.

I have a t4 one, it is not installed on my bus as I don't drive in the
really cold weather. It's going in the museum...i can send you some photos
if you like.
