Subject: Re: [T2] KYB Gas-a-Just rear shock too short?

"The shocks should fit on the bus without having to compress the suspension.

What is the number on the shock? It should be KG 5530. The number is stamped
on the lower part of the shock near the eyelet."

Spoke with Chris at CIP.  He confirmed that the shocks they sent me were 
KG5530.  I'll double check the part number on the shock to be sure though.  
Chris said that it's not usual to need to compress the suspension to install 
shocks.  Sound right?
