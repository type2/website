All the new Mexican (AC) engines come with NGK plugs, even though the Bosch
factory is in Mexico. At the SEMA show I talked to a Bosch engineer and he
said do not use Bosch plugs PERIOD in an AC engine unless brand new or fresh
rebuilt. I have not found Bosch to be any better then NGK or visa/versa
except they are cheaper in price. In type 4's I use NGK B5 or B6 es, not the
bpr's (extended reach)

According to Bill May(worked at Bosch in California "forever") the 
platinum plugs are *not* for a air cooled cars.  He says that
they used to give them to the employees to try out and that on his
a/c vw's it made them run hotter with not much other changes.

Bill is on the vintagvw list and has been "doing" vw's since back
in the Gene Berg days in California....actually, I am not sure that
Bill and Karl are not brothers<grin>.

Bill is extremely adamant about *no platinum* in a/c vw's but never said
anything about the porcelain.

Wonder what late model a/c porsche engines came with from the factory???


Just my 2 cents worth!

Cheers, dave
