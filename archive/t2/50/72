Subject: rocker arm to head rings

The books say there are two types of white gaskets that can go between the
rocker arms and the heads. My kit had none. I need the taller type as there
is a deep indention around the stud (SP head), and my FLAPS is clueless.
They only have the small (2mm?) white o-rings and they get lost in there.
Any help? In desperation, I used a blue o-ring from an air conditioner kit
that was here. I can take it out. What are they for anyway?

In addition, the quality of gasket kits suck. I have to drive 50 miles to
the closest place and after going there today and getting no help, I found
upon my return that one of the oil cooler seals was misshapen. Now I have to
make another trip. My advice for those like me in "the boonies": buy two or
three kits before you start the job!
