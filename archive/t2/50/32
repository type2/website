Subject: '75 Westfalia interior picture question

My cousin just bought a '75 Westfalia (because he liked my '78 so much) that 
is pretty much a basket case.
There seems to be an excess of cabinetry (there are parts to more than one 
camper) and we are unsure as to the layout of a '75 interior.
Does anyone know of a picture(s) on the web that we could access to see how 
the interior should be laid out?
I've looked around some, but I've not been able to find any pictures at all 
of the inside of a '75.
Thanks in advance
