Instead of Bondo which soaks up moisture and leads to rust - - - get a 
gallon of metal impregnated filler.

The brand name I have used is "Metal to Metal". It is a bondo like material 
full of ground up aluminum. It is waterproof and much harder stuff. We have 
used it to seal Swiss cheese floors with good results. (Structurally it was 
solid with many little holes, full frame car).
