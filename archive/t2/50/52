Yes, but if you can triple (or more) the life of your exhaust, especially if
it's a stock system, it think you might be saving money in the long run.

I have no idea what the cost to jet hot is? Any ideas?

Do we really think that this will help reduce operating temps on a type 4
motor?

Thanks,

Other than the cost ($$$), I'd do it. A few of the guys on the Morgan list
recommend it highly to keep under-bonnet temps down especially with
tubular headers. They also claim better performance but that may well
be rationalizing the outlay.
