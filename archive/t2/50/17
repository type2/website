Subject: Re: [T2] OTHER WHEEL CHOICES

You'll probably get plenty of answers on this, but 17x7" shouldn't be a
problem, the alloy wheels on my '74 Sopru Campmobile are actually 15 x 5.5JJ
with (I think) 26mm offset (not marked too clearly on these wheels), but I'm
running 205/70/15 BF Goodrich Touring T/As all round (a fraction taller than
stock, I believe, the tyres were chosen for a planned extended trip around
Australia, so the extra gearing & clearance would have been of use), totally
standard bodywork, and they don't touch at all.

(Mind you, you can just put your fingers between the tyre & the inner
wheelwell lip in the rear, but in about 2 years I've never seem any marks on
the tyre to indicate that it's ever touched.)

Hope this is of use.

Now the 18x8.5" Anteras with 20mm offset are going to be more of a
challenge, the outer edge is level with the inner lip, suspension hanging,
no tyre, I THINK I may be able to just fit in 225/45/18s in, if I do
something about the inner lip of the rear guards, but if not, they'll be
good for fitting for shows maybe ;^) Anyway, at $550 AUD (about $250USD) ,
including a black powder coat job, for the set of 4, I couldn't pass them up
& can't really lose much on the deal ;^)
