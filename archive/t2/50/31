Subject: Re: [T2] Torsion arm install?????


am putting a new front beam on my 78 and gotten to replacing the torsion
arms......??  Bentley, Haynes, Pocket Manual all say the same,, "replacing
is reverse of removal"  ^%(-at-)#$  got one side on, but HOW IN THE BLOODY BLUE
BLAZES do you get the splines of the torsion bars into the torsion arms!!!

I have twisted and loosened the other side and and can not get those arms
onto the bars!!   gotta be a trick there somewhere before I lose what's
left of my mind!!  (tried the wire tie trick already with no results)

HELP!!!   This is the only thing holding up finishing the job

TIA
Bob
