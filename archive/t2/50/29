Subject: Re: [T2] ridge at top of ring travel

I have 7k on the engine.  I overheated one cylinder and I'm replacing
that cylinder and piston (put a hole through the piston).  I also wanted
to change the rings on all the cylinders so that the compressions match
up...

Will cylinders that new have a ridge?

I will measure them to see what they're like.
