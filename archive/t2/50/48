Subject: Re: [T2] new muffler




> > I bought and installed a new German stock style muffler on my 71' stock
1600 bus this weekend.  All went very well and the new system sounds great.
The muffler was coated with a grey powdery paint that is in the process of
burning off as I drive.  I know that this is normal, but it smells awful.
My concern is that the burning paint smell is coming through the heater
system anytime I turn the heater on.  Is this normal?  Will it go away when
all the paint is done burning off?  Or, did I screw something up an am now
feeding exhaust into my heating system and through my bus?
