Hey all:

I recently built and installed a mild performance engine in my 71 bus.  It
has a header exhaust system, but I've been using the old muffler from the
old engine.  I have a "Fat Boy" muffler, but it won't quite fit, since the
body of the muffler hits against the moustache bar.  I talked to the folks
at Gene Berg, and they use the "quiet pack" type of muffler.  Unfortunately,
the guy I talked to at Berg didn't know much about the performance aspects
of that type muffler.  Does anyone out there in list land know anything
about "Quiet Pack" mufflers, or any other kind of performance muffler?  I
don't want to install a muffler that's obnoxiously loud, either.

Thanks!
