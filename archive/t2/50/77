Hey, Jamie--

You may be on the right track. I didn't go into this in my original post, 
but only part of the surface of the wheel is cruddy.  Some areas remain 
smooth and glossy, probably like when it was new. It seems to be localized 
more nearly on the parts where the driver's hands would touch it 
most--between 2 and 4 o'clock, and 8 and 10 o'clock, on the inner and outer 
edges, and on the side edges of the crossbar. Maybe 30 years of skin oil and 
who-knows-what-else off drivers' hands has taken its toll.

I suppose it wouldn't kill me to shop for a new steering wheel, since I've 
redone the seats and floormats this summer. But for some reason, maybe 
connected to how connected one gets to the the steering wheel of all parts, 
I sort of hate to do it--and are they even available?  Guess I need to start 
doing my homework. Ron?  Are you out there?

thanks
