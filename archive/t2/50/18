Subject: pre-lubed for easier starting...

Instead of snake oil, what about a VW FI pump for pre-oiling the engine prior
to start up? 30 lbs. pressure, check valve to prevent the oil from 
reversing...
Wired through the dash, a couple seconds of power and you've got about 30
PSI oil lubing everything so the engine never has to start "dry".
 Plumbing shouldn't be that difficult to fab together...Any thoughts, Jake?
Anyone else? Cheaper than Accusump.
