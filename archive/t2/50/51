That's in the ballpark but possibly a bit low for a fully charged 
battery.

>Jumps up to about 16.9 with it running. 

I hope that's a typo.  16.9V is way too high and indicates that 
your regulator is not doing it's job.  Anything over 15V will fry 
the battery in short order as it will overcome the battery's 
internal resistance.
