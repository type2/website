Subject: Heating with water - seeking what-if-ideas

Just wondering - thinking too much actually...

Has anyone created sealed heater boxes and circulated antifreeze through 
them to capture the heat and then circulate it through a heater core inside 
the bus and heated the interior like a normal, boring watercooled car?

Any such thing as an electric pump that would deal with the recirculation 
duties?

Just wondering...
Ciao!
