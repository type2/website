Subject: Re: exhaust studs... (broken weld)

Hey Snoop.  I found the same on my bus last fall, and had a friend stick
weld it back on (along with reinforcing the others).  I know someone
else said the weld might not hold, but it's been over a year and mine's
been holding up just fine (and it's seen some rough terrain).

Hope this helps
-Roger
