Subject: [T2] Engine Case website

I've been designing a website for a guy making really cool engine cases
for Type Ones. I can't use them myself as I've got a '78 westy, but
thought I'd pass on the info for those of you with older VWs. His
website is:   www.precisionalloy.com

and I guess there was an article about his engine case is the December
Hot VWs if you want to find out more.
