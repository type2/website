Subject: Re: [T2] new muffler

May indicate a leak in your cooling system - is the perimeter seal on the 
tin to body good?

You may be recycling exhaust- sucking it into the cooling fan through 
missing tin or seals.

They all stink for a while but I don't remember my VW's stinking inside 
unless I was sitting still.

<snip>

The muffler was coated with a grey powdery paint that is in the process of 
burning off as I drive.  I know that this is normal, but it smells 
awful.  My concern is that the burning paint smell is coming through the 
heater system anytime I turn the heater on.  Is this normal?

<unsnip>

The stink may got away once the paint burns off but you need to be sure all 
the tin and rubber is in good shape because the carbon monoxide gases will 
still be there and you won't smell that.

Good luck.

Ciao!
