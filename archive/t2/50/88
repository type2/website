Please when you get a chance - I would love to see the info!

I'm thinking stainless steel casings around OEM heat sinks and pipes 
(properly coated with a paint to slow any rusting) and this would eliminate 
any chance of exhaust fumes in the interior. When the OEM pipes and sinks 
rust out (but shouldn't be fast with a proper anitfreeze) you just dig out 
another set of rusted heater boxes, cut off the shell, move the watercooled 
shells from your old pipes to your "new" pipes.

Should be several years per set or more.

But how to pump the water around without a bunch of pulleys....
