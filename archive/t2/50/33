Subject: Re: [T2] Torsion arm install?????

BTDT & yes, you are right. the manuals are really no help on this one.

we used a small section of 4x4 wood along with a hammer.  work one side on
(which you have already done) & then try to get the other side on. you might
have to go back & forth from side to side & keep working them on little by
little until they are both secure.

or if you have a helper - both people can have wood/hammers & try easing both
sides on at once.

also, did you replace the spot welds on the ends of the torsion leaves? until
we realized we needed to re-do that weld, we had no luck whatsoever in
getting the new arms installed. the leaves wouldnt line up with the notches in
the arms until they were welded together.

HTH & good luck.
