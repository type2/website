Hi all,

     Well, since we really got no bites on selling our westy we decided =
to keep her.  I am very happy.  I was extremely depressed ever since I =
started trying to sell her.  Finances be what they may, we will survive =
some other way.  Selling the bus would only been a bandaid to the =
problem.  Anyway, thanks for letting me share this.  I do look forward =
to getting to the next Wetwesties event.
