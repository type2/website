Or if you cannot find a replacement piece of glass - pull the piece from 
the other side and have a glass shop dut a duplicate and have them send it 
off to be tempered (safety).

If you really have some extra money (couple hundred) replace all the glass 
with new tempered tinted glass - the tinting is in the glass, not an 
external film that gets scratched...

Same glass store can do this.

We had excessive rust in the vent window on the driver's side rear. I 
replaced that section with a single piece of glass.

If I ever find a good set of vent windows I would add them to both rear 
side windows but I really doubt I find those. My frame was no where near 
useable. The seal traps alot of moisture. Terrible design.
