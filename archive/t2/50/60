Subject: Re: [T2] Stud removal

If there is enough to get vice grips on, don't chew it up further with vice
grips.  I haven't followed the thread 100 percent, but folks a good PIPE
WRENCH would beat any tool for removing the stud...after a long bout of
soaking, tapping as per GM Bulley's gramp.  Good luck. PS: the wallyworld
Popular mechanics pipe wrench is a no-no.  Use a good one or you may as well
chew with vice grips.
