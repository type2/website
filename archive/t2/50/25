If the pump is a replacement you might have the same "problem" that I did. 
It was noisy for a while and then with time got quieter and then silent.

I figure it was some manufacturing defect. I've never had any problems since.

I do not know the brand - just that it was an Auto Zone pump purchased by 
the PO to close the deal for us.

If you have an old pump, maybe it would be a good time to start saving for 
a new one - maybe it's trying to tell you something.
