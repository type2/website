Subject: Hot VW's "Project Westfalia" articles


Can anyone tell me if these articles are any good or not?  I searched the 
archives, saw a few questions posted about them, but no real indication if 
they provide any good info or not (plus ordering 7 issues at $6 bucks 
apiece is another stopgap...).

The winter cold is starting to set in, so it's time to do some indoor 
research on things to do to my '69 Westy, and I thought this might be 
something interesting to check out.

The list of the articles is at www.scottandmaggie.com.

Thanks.
