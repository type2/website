Subject: RE: [T2] beams/5 campers for sale

Ronnie,

I would like to see some documentation on that. If this is true what is
changed? We are holding fast on "all '68-'69 beams being the same". Story at
11. Any late '69 list members that have a chance to measure there beam bolts
spacing (should be about 3" i.e. not 5") please do so and let me know.

  The late 69 beam is different then a 68 beam. I don't know where the
production changed on these but have run across this a few times on split
bus beam trade outs (to the 68/early 69 beam). I guess I could go to the
storage lot and get vins, but most of my beams are gone (down to my last
10). I am currently parting 5 bays of assorted heritage, then off to the
crushers. I have rust free shells FOR FREE, if you come and get them. Still
a lot of good little parts or just swap your stuff over!  I also have a 68
turtle top camper (no camper interior) original Deadhead bus ($400.00) no
engine and a 70's pop top westy complete interior needs canvas, no trans or
engine for $500.00 .
  Looking for a bay camper project just come on down to Lake Havasu Az and
pick one out, just bring your trailer or tow bar!

There are still 2 68's and 1 71 Westy still for sale here in Havasu, 2 have
engines, 1 doesn't, trannys in all of them. 1 pop top, 1 high roff Westy and
1 hardtop 71 westy, all mostly complete, last I heard was 2000 for the 3 of
them but I'm sure he'll take a lot less. He will not seperate them. He also
has 6 more late models but I haven't seen them.  If you are interested in
ALL 3 and are serious I will take some photo's and mail them to you with the
owners phone number. He doesn't want to play games on these just wants to
get rid of them.
