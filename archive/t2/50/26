If we're talkin' FI hear, the only thing that will make a new Bosch pump
noisy is a restriction in the tank outflow. If it must start sucking the
gas, it loads up. Verify you have good gravity flow of fuel from the pump
inlet hose. If that's good and it's still noisy, it's either a very old
Bosch pump or something like described below. Other than a sewing machine
smooth almost inaudible noise from a Bosch FI pump and it's on it's way
out. Typically, original Bosch pumps on T-II's last until the tank starts
putting off rust particles and powders, which load the filter not replaced
in the last 3 PO's maintenance, your's after you bought it, putting undue
strain on the pump, overheating the brushes and solder joints and bearings.
Bosch pumps in maintained systems make no noises of concern for 25 years+
unless killed by lack of maintenance or other improper operation.

Whenever you replace a pump, you must adjust the mixture or you risk
lean-hot or cat/oxy/plug fouling from heavy carbon.
