Subject: RE: [T2] turn signal/dimmer switch

Sean,

The '72 only directional switch is a pain. The thing is circular and weak.
They always snap. I have one used one left. These sell for $56.70. I'm 6'-2"
and can appreciate the vertically challenge. I'll give you free shipping or
10% off, which ever is greater.

Must be something in the air...while making a sharp turn, shifting gears,
and using the blinker, I (being 6'3") hit the blinker arm with my left knee
and broke the arm off.

Dumb luck, or has anyone else ever done anything like that?
