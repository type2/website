I bought and installed a new German stock style muffler on my 71' stock =
1600 bus this weekend.  All went very well and the new system sounds =
great.  The muffler was coated with a grey powdery paint that is in the =
process of burning off as I drive.  I know that this is normal, but it =
smells awful.  My concern is that the burning paint smell is coming =
through the heater system anytime I turn the heater on.  Is this normal? =
 Will it go away when all the paint is done burning off?  Or, did I =
screw something up an am now feeding exhaust into my heating system and =
through my bus?

Thanks for any help you can give,

Scott
