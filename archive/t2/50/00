A 72 sold in the United States has a T4 engine, and since the 1700, the 1800
and the 2000 are all T4 engines this isn't much of a swap as far as your
"legal engineering" (jury- rigging) skills go.

A 70, no matter where it was sold, has a T1 engine in it--which is an
upright. Lotsa difference between the two.
