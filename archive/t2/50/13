Subject: rear vent window

Hi All,

Recently, somebody broke into my girlfriend's '77 just to wreak some havoc.
In doing so, the destroyed the driver's side, rear vent window. Its right in
front of the bench seat. I'd also call it a wing window, but that's from my
Marlboro days. Anyway, if anyone has a replacement, with the latch,  I could
buy, or know of a place to acquire, I would appreciate it.
Local pick & pays didn't have it.

thanks,

Pete
