Howdy, Ron--

I imagine it really is just natural degradation; I just found it odd that 
the problem jumped in level so much this season, compared to the last few 
winters.

And, of course, rubbing your hands together at stoplights in the winter 
probably helps compensate for the trademark VW lack-of-heating systems.  So 
maybe this steering wheel crud is really just more of those original 
engineers' simple-is-better cunning at work.

thanks
