Subject: Alternator/voltage regulator trouble.

I have a constant alternator light on in my 74 bus.

I checked my voltages and here is what I found:
Battery is about 12.6 with the bus off.  Jumps up to about 16.9 with it
running. Tunring on the lights drops it to about 13.5, turn them off and
it jumps right back up.

Should I suspect my voltage regulator, or my alternator, or something
else?

thanks,
