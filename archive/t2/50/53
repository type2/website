Subject: front axle beams

Hello Folks,

I thought I would add my two cents on front beams.

1968-1969 front beams are the same. These have closer mounting bolts about
3" apart.

1970 front axle beams are the same as 1971-1979 just with out the plate for
the brake booster.

1971-1979 again are the same as 1970 just with the plate for mounting the
brake booster.

Therefore if you own a 1970 bus you can use a beam off any 1970-1979 bus. If
you have a 1971 or later you must get a beam off a 1971-1979 bus. If you
have a 1968-1969 bus you must use a beam from a 1968-1969 bus.

We sell and have in stock all of these beams.
