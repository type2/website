Bingo,  I have a MIG welder so a went out there and cleaned the ends up,
grabbed the welder and put a line down the center, when I was sure they
were straight.

zap.

much banging and "encouraging" language.  also found it makes it easier to
get em started if you take off the upper rubber stop. (of course then you
have to get the bugger back on)

in any case, fought with it for 6-7 hours before posting, after finding
the "Trick" took about an hour after welding.

only have one spindle back on but it is moving along

THANKS big time

Bob
