Subject: Breaking in (to) a VW bus

Hey,

If you just gotta break a window to get into a bus, try the FRONT passenger 
vent window.  They are extremely easy to replace.

It is just the glass, and I have taken glass out with my bare hands in the 
junk yards.  Try it, just for fun the next time you walk by a bus in the 
junk yard (open vent to outside of the bus; grasp edge of glass and pull 
DOWN; now UP, now DOWN, now . . . and all the while pulling BACK)  Takes 
less than 30 seconds, and the glass slips right into the vacant frame of the 
poor, violated bus.

The rear/middle vent window(s) glass pane is a pain.  It CANNOT be R&R as 
easily, you MUST take the whole frame out of the bus and then take it apart, 
and then slide the glass out of the capture frame.

In both cases, the latch STAYS where it is.  (Bay window buses)

The rear vent window glass replacement is a 10-20 minute job, AFTER you get 
the experience from taking the glass out of similar frame at a junk yard.
