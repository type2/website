Subject: plugged fuel line/tank(beetle)

I just purchased a 1971 Super Beetle from the original owner for $50
Canadian. One wheel is seized and they did not run the car since 1986. Well
I put in a battery and the engine turned over. I checked that there was
spark. Poured some gas into the carb and vhhhhmmmmm! fired right up then
died. I tried disconnecting the fuel line going to the tank, which I had
added new gas to, and sucked as hard as I could. Nothing. I attached a
bicycle pump to the fuel line to try and blow the blockage out of the line.
I can get it up to 60pounds of pressure with no fuel flowing. Does any one
know what my next step should be. Should I pull the gas tank and try to
clean it? Any other suggestions would be awesome. Is there a way to clear
the blockage with everything still on the car. My mechanic skills are
limited.
thanks in advance,
Glenn
