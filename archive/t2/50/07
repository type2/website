Subject: Re: [T2] Stud removal

>>one of the studs that comes out of the heads broke barely but just enough
that I can't get a nut on it.  So I am trying to remove. Not budging.  My ex
mechanic said to use a torch to loosen the aluminum...  Is this right, if so
how much?

I think Jim's right.  I have turned nice aluminum to feathery ashes in
amazingly short time with a torch, with no obvious change in the
reflectivity of the metal to give warning.  However, if you're really brave
and impatient and have a mig welder handy, you could try tacking a blob in
the center of the nut when it is on the stud and then trying to unwrench it.
