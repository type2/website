Subject: black crud coming off my 1970's steering wheel


Hi, folks:

I could probably let it stand with the subject line, but here's a little 
more detail:

The rainy season has begun in Oregon, and with it, the usual sort of tacky 
surface feel that my steering wheel gets from the moisture. Only this year, 
it's much worse--the stuff is coming off on my hands, big-time. This 
morning, shortly after I'd parked the bus and was walking to the office, 
someone glanced at my hands and asked me if I'd been tarring roofs. It's 
probably the original 1970 steering wheel. Cleaning/scrubbing the gunk off 
simply seems to expose the next layer which becomes tacky in a day or so. 
For that reason, I also figure there's no point in putting on a steering 
wheel cover--even one made from the hide of the finest free-range 
Naugas--until I fix the problem.

I know that part of this is simply about some rubber I need to replace 
around doors and windows, but since that isn't going to happen immediately, 
I'm interested if any listees have already been here and have suggestions 
for how to make the crud go away. Something I can clean it with, treat it 
with, etc.?

thanks
