Subject: ATF in my fuel answers

Thanks to all who both castigated me and helped me out on 
understanding just why I should not put ATF in my fuel.

I thought it would help quiet down a noisey fuel pump and if so, that 
would point to the source of a whine. Most likely I have a healthy 
engine.

Can you still buy the tape?
