Re: Mr Henley's comments...

To quote Phil Ochs, "There but for fortune..."

<http://www.cs.pdx.edu/~trent/ochs/lyrics/there_but_for_fortune.html>

Statistically most Americans are within only a few paychecks from living
on the streets.  Unemployment happens.  Ask me how I know.  

Bus owner wants to crash in my driveway for a few days?  That's what
it's there for.  For a few weeks?  Maybe. Depends on the circumstances. 
Remember the Grendel Saga.
