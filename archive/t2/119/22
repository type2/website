Subject: Help, need wrist pin material suggestions

This isn't van related, but there are some smart people here and it
is VW related, in a constant fight to make a 2.0 liter FWD engine
from ancient components I bought years ago, and a budget set of
83.5mm pistons I bought recently I face the need to make custom
reducing wrist pin bushings to use 20mm pins in old 136mm rods.
Machining isn't a problem, material selection is.  Any opinions?  I'm
sort of confused between using a high lead tin/copper bronze like a
932/936 alloy or using an aluminum bronze like a 954 with increased
impact strength and surface hardness but no self lubricating properties.
Any suggestions appreciated.

Mandatory bus content, well I need to make some custom wrist pin
bushings for a set of overbore T4 pistons I had put together a few years
ago as well, so this data will be dual purpose.

email me if you know.
