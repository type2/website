So here's the deal,
She's a '73, 1700cc, dual carburated, manual transmission, transporter. =
I pulled the engine out last week to replace some leaky oil cooler =
gasgets, and clean up the #3 cylinder as it was covered in oil from the =
fan blowing oil all over it. I completed all of that and got the engine =
back in. Installed new plugs, points, wires, cap, condenser, oil filter, =
and changed the oil while I was at it. Now, she has about half the power =
she did before I pulled the engine. The engine runs great, idle is =
smooth, and when it revvs up it's smooth as well. What could account for =
the loss of power? Any ideas are appreciated!
