Subject: Clicking Sound

Today I was Driving Home from work in my 71 Panel and
about 2 miles out, A strange Clicking sound started,
it was pretty loud. It only clicked when I was on the
gas and off the clutch at first. By the time I got
Home it was going a little with the clutch on and when
I hit bumps also. I stopped a couple times to look at
stuff and everything looked fine. I sat there for a
few minutes and started again and no sound for about
three blocks and then it started again. No difference
in braking, acelleration, clutch feel, or Power. The
sound was coming from what sounded like the rear of
the passenger side. Is this likley a broken CV, or a
brake component out of whack on that wheel, a tranny
problem?

Thanks,
Tyler
