Subject: Re: Buying New vs. Used car

Mike,

I've bought both ways.  New car smell is sure nice!

My personal choice would be to start out with a new car
and then you *know* exactly what has and hasn't been done to it.

I've had exactly 1 new car in my life<grin>...and probably owned 
20 cars in my life....it's just that the price of a new car that 
approaches 1/2 the price or so of a nice "new" house($60,000) bothers me.

I've had both good and bad luck with used ones also.

Good luck!

Cheers, dave
