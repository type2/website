Hello John,

Is the engine missing at all? If so, check to see if
you have a spark plug that is fouling out. I don't
know much about these engines but my brother and I had
a similar problem with his beetle. It appeared that
oil was leaking out the exhaust from cylinder 3. It
turned out that the carburator was bad and was dumping
fuel in the cylinder. The fuel washed the oil in the
head and cylinder out the exhaust causing a black
liquid to drip from the exhaust. Needless to say, that
cylinder did not fire. That would explain why you have
good compression all the way around. Like I said
earlier, I don't know if this is your problem but that
is what happened with the beetle I worked on. Good
luck!
