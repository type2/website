I knew that was going to come back and bite me ;)

But since you ask <grin>....

How WVA was settled:
1. Truck breaks down while heading for Ohio.
2. House is built next to broken down truck.
3. Kids grow up, build more houses next to the truck.
4. Fifty years later, grandkids part out truck on eBay.

I guess the same applies to where I grew up in Western
Pennsylvania. Our family always had no less than three
vehicles on blocks at any given time. ;)
