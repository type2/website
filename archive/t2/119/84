Ray,

Thanks, I had second thoughts before I got your post and went looking, but 
didn't find these!

Interesting to note that BUG was filed on 
Filing Date   October 20, 1998

and BUS was May 2nd, 1961.

I can't figure out what all of the extra verbage is on the "bug" one 
though.  It makes it sound like *all* of the people who currently have 
"bug" in their trademark are in violation.

Now!, I am truely getting p.o'ed about this.  Sounds to me like all of the 
people that have bus or bug in their name need to get a defense fund up 
and see how far it goes....I did notice that one of the places that had 
"bug" of somesort in their name was an insurance company...they generally 
have money to fight with.

I noticed after I figured out how to work the site, they even trademarked
"Drivers Wanted".

The world is getting weird, dave
