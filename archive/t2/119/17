Here in central California, that has been the norm for the past 4 years. Along
with all bus transaxles, they are getting removed before the bus even settles
on the stands. Crews come up from Mexico at least once a month and rape every
bus. In addition, the new 'hot' item is the lower sliding door channel. They
cut out the whole outer edge, 6" into the bus and 3" past the ends. Plus they
grab all the front doors!
