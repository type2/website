Subject: Re: [VB] VW air compressor

Yeah!  I'll second that question and ask another: Does anyone have any 
personal experience with it that they can share?  I know I have seen 
"Volksair" on someones signature, but never remember to remember it.  I have 
a complete (needing rebuild) 40hp motor that would be perfect (I think) for 
such a conversion, but would like to know if it is worth whatever it costs 
for the kit.  A setup like that with a good sized tank mounted on a small 
trailer and a handfull of air tools would be just the ticket for a lot of 
uses.
