I have a 'tunnel' tent similar to the ones Steve sells (same make, different
model).  I can't compare it with the old Westy tents because I've never had
one, but I have had some experience with caravan* awnings* with the same
rigid pole / canvas construction.

Advantages of old style:
Period look and originality if that's what you want
Tough and hardwearing
More rigid (don't need as many guy ropes to hold it steady)

Advantages of new style:
Packs smaller and lighter for same overall size
Not so bad to put away when wet
Cheaper to buy

Speed of assembly / disassembly, probably about the same for both.

* UK nomenclature: caravan = trailer that you sleep in, awning = side tent,
not just a sunshade
