my old 65 Westy had a zipper between the tent and the bus.  of course
getting lined up when one got back was a real trick but surprisingly easy

this was a stock set up on that year I suspect since the whole van was
stock to the bone when I bought it in 72

well the one I had was more a "sun room" than an actual tent but it was
pretty sturdy and tough, sorry I didn't keep it when I sold the van...
