>>This is a VERY good question, but in fact, they do.
Which is probably the biggest indicator that there will be
a lot more B.S. coming down the line in the future that
will be detrimental to the mom & pop parts supplier or repair shop<<

does this mean that our list vendors such as Bus Depot, BustedBus &
Bus Boys, Inc.  will soon be coming under fire?

do they also own the words "Transporter, Station Wagon, Kombi,
Beetle, Thing, etc..."?

i can understand them being picky about someone using the letters VW
w/o consent, but the words "bus" & "bug" - thats streching it a little
IMO.
