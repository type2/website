while i will be a long, long way from this event, i do think this is the
best idea presented so far.  if there are alot of acvw's there with black
cloth covering the emblem, the news media at the event is likely to ask
questions.

someone mentioned renting out a vendor spot in the event to distribute
literature, etc.  i also think this is a very good idea. but be careful -
apparently there are some real sticky legal situations surrounding this
event, so watch your back.
