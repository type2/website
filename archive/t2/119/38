Subject: RE: <FMBC> Jack Raby engines

I would second the recommendation of Mark Dearing at Salem Imports.  The
engine he built for me is great and has pushed my bus from Cincinnati,
Oh. to NC and Niagara Falls and many points in between without a
problem. No connection- just a happy customer. TBear
