On second thought, I went to the trademark office

http://tess.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?f=tess&state=m5tfv.1.1

and had a look for myself.  1580 trademarks which include the word 
bug...some live and some dead.  It is interesting that some I thought 
belonged to certian people, in fact, do not.

Remember the Holley "bugspray"...hmmm nope, not to holley, but to  
Sailwest Computing.  If vw thinks they can get the trademark for bug, then 
I suspect that a lot of these people are gonna have a fit.

Even the "bug out" folks.....try to guess...it doesn't belong to the 
people who put it on every year.  It belongs to  BUG-OUT OUTDOORWEAR, INC. 
CORPORATION NEBRASKA.


Ok, so how about "bus".   How about "BUS PARTS WAREHOUSE"....nope wrong 
again...they supply school bus parts.  Only 686 trademarks with the word 
bus...I guess this one would be easier.

The point being,  VW does not, nor has it ever, in my knowledge presented 
a trademark with the word bug or bus in it.  Wups, forgot about the 
"sunbug"....naaaa...it belongs to these people...Finch, Jason Cory 
INDIVIDUAL.  So, does that mean that he can sue vw cause they made a 
"sunbug"????

Now, if you look up the word "volkswagen", that's a different story.

What about vw then?  Only 55 records and a lot are marked dead.

Interesting note that "vw trends" trademark is marked "dead" and 
"abandonded"...wonder if they know that?  
Abandonment Date  February 25, 1992

Lot's of interesting stuff in there..."Meyers Manx" is still a valid 
"live" trademark!  
                    (APPLICANT) Meyers Manx CORPORATION CALIFORNIA PO BOX 
1491 Valley Center CALIFORNIA 92082

I personally have a hard time believing that vwoa/vwag can go after anyone 
with the word bus or bug in their name.  Maybe after busbarn cause they 
displayed vw someplace they should not have.

Cheers, dave
