Since you just bought your bus .........
I'd check the valves right now.
I'd also change the oil.
I'd also buy a new battery.

Make a log of what you read on the valves before and after you adjust them, 
if necessary to adjust.
Check them again at 2,000 miles when you change the oil.
Repeat
Repeat

See what appears to be happening.
If you are comfortable with what you find as to their retaining their settings,
slide back to a procedure of checking them at every 6,000 miles, minimum.
