These are corrections that attempt to make all tests comparable dispite
the fact that conditions did change while the engines were being swapped,
etc.

Ronnie's dyno has a big dial that measures in HP/1000RPM.  This dial
really measures torque, but the scale is calibrated to make it easy to
find power.

Ronnie will have to bring it out to BBBVII instead of the engine stand for
the raffle engine.  It'll be fun to see some real numbers!
