Subject: Re: [T2] Living in a Bus


I was not suggesting using someone else's address, I was suggesting renting
one from a mailing center rather than a postoffice, as some of them do not
have to say box number and it passes for an address. Nor was I suggesting
camping on private property, but on the street in a dead industrial area.
dead as in no buisiness open in the section you are in so no one for you to
be in the way of. As for the bathroom, every one has to poop, and I'd rather
they did it in the toilet at the burger joint rather than on the side of the
road, and I'm betting that the owner of the burger joint on the side of that
road feels the same way. I lived in a vehicle for more than a year and never
made any problems for anyone or got in anyones way. I rented driveways for
most of it. I ate largely from the waste of others. As long as you are
respectful then I can't see how that would be wrong. Not every one has
someone to fall back on in a bad situation. Not everyone makes a living
wage. Sometimes people need time to get their sh*t together. It took me a
few years.
      I consider the best use of the list to be helping other bus drivers.
the advise I offered was sound, and time tested.
