It has been a long time since I have posted and I have only had time for
minimal browsing. I asked about this last summer..... and then the bus a =
79
has been in seldom use for most of the winter. As someone suggested last
summer, I checked my oil temp gauge today with some boiling water and a =
meat
thermometer in the water. If  you do this remember to ground the sensor =
(I
thought I might have damaged it untill I remembered!). Any way the guage
seemed fairly accurate - by the time I got every thing coordinated the =
meat
therm. read 190 and the temp gauge about 187 or so. What worries me then =
is
driving temps last summer around 250 and sometimes higher. This leads me =
to
the external cooler. Two main questions (1) do I need to put in a =
different
oil pump to do this, (2) where can I look at kits - who sells them =
(actually
I have seen one at busboys) TIA
