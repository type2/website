Subject: Re: [T2] External oil cooler

Before you spend the extra $$ for an external oil cooler, I would
highly suggest you check out the entire cooling system. I also have a
79 & it ran hot for the first few months I had it. I pulled the motor
to replace seals /etc & found that 75% of the oil cooler was plugged
as well as the fins on the jugs pretty darn blocked as well. After
cleaning it my temps went down & by the reading of my oil temp gage it
heats up to under 240 or so at most. VW wouldn't have put out an
engine that needed an extra oil cooler. Check what you have first,
before putting a band-aid on. Good luck.
