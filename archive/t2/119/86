A trademark is "generally distinctive symbols, pictures, or words that
sellers affix to distinguish and identify the origin of their
products". The blurry area here gets into the idea that most people
wouldn't mistake something completely unrelated to automobiles w/ VW
if the word "bug" was used. From what I understand these laws were
simply put in place to protect unscrupulous peoples from cashing in on
a recognized product. VWoA seems to be going well beyond what they
should be doing to protect their "mostly" good name. I have a tough
time understanding how something like "bug", "bus" or even "beetle"
can be trademarked in this way. It is usually used simply as
identification.

I don't think (& IANAL) that these words can fall under the "common
word" umbrella where it kinda means a lot of things, such as the term
Unix to identify many different branches of OS. Someone who mentions
"bug" or "beetle" will cause whoever is listening to identify that
converation w/ a small air-cooled rear engine vehicle build by VW. Not
get it confused w/ say a corvair, etc.  I'm guessing this is where the
lawyers are getting their leverage.

I'm going to guess that this thread has gone into it's tangents. I'll
kill my contributions to the thread now :) Just hated to not send it
since I spent the time writing it.
