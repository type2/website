Subject: Re: <FMBC> 68 westy Emergency brake cables

The info below is taken from an original 1968 VW Dealership parts 
book. There is only one line drawing of the cable and the parts page 
has the three listed below in the same order. The is no reference to 
right of left side but there are two radically different lengths 
listed for early 68 model years. Only a 3mm decrease in size for mid 
year up to thru 1972 model years.  Usually VW part#s that are the 
same but have a letter at the end are revisions that supercede 
previous letters.  I still does not make sense. in this case. Maybe 
you cold use a string to make a mock up and then measure it.
