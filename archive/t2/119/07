Subject: RE: Fuel Smell

If you're smelling fuel, *PLEEEEEEZE* check all fuel lines.

This is *DEFINITELY* a potential fire hazard.

Check every fuel line on your bus -- if it even *LOOKS* old,
replace it. Fuel line is cheap, engine/cab fires are *NOT*.

If you're smelling gas, replace and re-clamp every single fuel
line you can find. I had a '75 FI bus several years ago (no
heater), that *always* had that gas smell -- came really close
to becoming a bonfire. AGAIN -- REPLACE AND RE-CLAMP EVERY
DAMN FUEL LINE RIGHT NOW! Unless, of course, you have great
insurance and a perverse desire to watch your bus burn.

Make sure you get *ALL* of them. To and from the heater. To and
from the engine compartment. All the little sections between the
injectors (and check the injectors to make sure none of them are
leaking -- I ended up having to replace 3 of my injectors because
of leaks).

This is definitely *NOT* a cute "bus quirk". Trust me.

The fuel line is cheap, and it shouldn't take you more than an
hour or so to replace and re-clamp all the lines. Also, keep an
extra 3-4 feet of fuel line in your emergency kit -- you never
know when one of them buggers is going to cause a problem.

And *PLEEEZE!* keep this in mind... if you replace just "parts"
of the fuel lines, you're just asking for trouble -- the old
sections *not* replaced will fail *VERY* fast, since they can't
hold the pressure that the new sections will -- ESPECIALLY since
your bus is fuel injected (30-some psi of fuel, compared to 3-5
psi for a carb system).

This is an easy repair (a bit dirty, but easy), and the consequences
of *not* doing it could be catastrophic.

If you're still smelling gas after replace every single inch of
fuel line, then you've probably got a faulty heater. If that's the
case, yank that bad boy and repair/replace before your bus blows up.

Good luck!
