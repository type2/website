Subject: [T2] RE: living in my bus & follow up on window seal

i hate this thread. there, i said it & i feel better.  & actually my post
has nothing to do with it.

all i want to add is that i think Rob was trying to say "guests & fish start
to stink after 3 days", or something to that effect.

there can be a very fine line between someone who has had a run of bad
luck/needs help & someone who is just a plain leech.  sometimes its hard to
make a distinction between the two.

i never posted a follow up about my rear window seal.  well, it went right
in on the first try after i got a 3rd helper.  we needed 2 people to hold
the glass from the outside & apply pressure.  took all of 10 minutes.
