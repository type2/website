It's not strange at all. The theory is, if you don't defend your mark you
must not care about it.

Here's what's weird to me: "Bug" seems like a pretty solid trademark for a
car (as is "Beetle") because only Volkswagen makes "Bug" shaped cars. But
"Bus"? Let's see...school bus, short bus, muni bus, hippie bus, tour bus,
Greyhound bus, IEEE 1394 bus, universal serial bus...not to mention busboys
and busman's holidays! How can you trademark Bus?
