Subject: 1976 Westy Starts But Won't Run???

Hi Guys,

I just started my 1976 Westy after a 4 month storage. I cleaned all the 
direct battery conections well and installed a freshly charged battery. The 
bus started immediately but will not stay running.

When I first start it is runs fairly smooth but at 2000 RPM. Then after a 
minute or so the idle start slowing down and it just cuts right out. I try 
giving it gas but it just dies. It will start immediately after and act in 
the same way.

It's been a little while (2 summers) since I have had a good tune up so 
maybe timing, valves, points, distributor cap, condensor need replacing? 
What are your suggestions?

Thanks,

Matt
