Sounds to me like the infamous "kitty litter letter" that many 
journalists get. Use the words "kitty" and "litter" together in a 
national publication and you get a letter from Ralston Purina (or 
whichever corporation currently owns the trademark for Kitty Litter.) 
I've never heard of any actual legal action. It's just something a 
company has to do to protect a trademark in this Byzantine era of 
intellectual property laws.

  I'm guessing the most appropriate action to a VWoA threat is to say 
"ha! Ha! Ha! I got the kitty litter letter." But I'd make sure I 
opened any subsequent certified mail.

Sorry if I'm beating a dead horse to death  here.
