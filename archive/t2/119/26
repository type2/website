This is a primer/filler, not a paint.

I looked thru the Material Safety Data Sheets for Glasurit products posted
at: http://www.health.adelaide.edu.au/ComMed/consulting/eap/eap.htm and
the only thing I see with either "water" or "latex" is a rubbing compound.
I tried the Glasurit site, but ran out of patience before I found anything
(I have a 5 minute limit on waiting for "dancing baloney" javascripts to
download :-)

Automotive paint is a big universe and while I would be surprised if it
were possible to make an automotive-grade paint in a latex base, I would
not be shocked.  I think of latex as a very "soft" base for paint, but in
the olden days, flats were latex and gloss was enamel.  Today, latex
enamels are all over the place in house paint.  Chemists have done amazing
things before, and may yet make an acceptable latex-based paint that is
hard and glossy enough for automotive use.
