Ray, one of my customers makes Sandblasted Wooden Signs. He uses plain ol'
filter sand he buys by the truckload. His crew wear activated-carbon masks--
he tried the Dust Masks they have at Home Depot and the sand, wood chunks,
etc., went right straight through. They also like Tyvek bunny suits and
cheap chemical goggles. (On the goggles: chemical is the key point--those
don't have vent holes in the sides. Cheap is the word because they last
about a day, and they use motorcycle-racing tearoffs on them.)
