Subject: Not all Vanagon Heat Exchangers are created equal

I've noticed that my heat exchangers haved rusted through and 
its time for new ones. I have heard that NOS is better than 
the Danish OEM is this true? Anyone experimented with high 
temperature coatings on these? If I buy rust free used ones 
is there anything I should watch for? I am running air cooled 
federal setup with no cat (stock in Canada) 071-256-091B & 
071-256-092B.
 
Thanks,
Chris
