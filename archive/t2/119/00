Not immediately, but if it goes on or the oil becomes chocolate-milk color
it might.

I had a girlfriend who drove a Subaru that had leaky barrels.  It had oil
in the water and water in the oil.  We changed oil every 2000 miles, but
otherwise were just waiting for the car to expire.  It went five years
with foamy brown oil before we gave it away still running well.

I can't say that water won't hurt anything, but it is expected that a
quantity will find its way into the oil.

I was going to ask if this was metric or US/Liberian units, but at -37 it
hardly matters.  Brrrr!
