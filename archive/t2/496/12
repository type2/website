when ford starter relays are used don't they replace the solenoid.  i am not sure 
(obviously) but on my split i thought years ago there was a ford starter installed 
'to replace something' in the 6 volt setup to get more juice and make starting 
easier.  what ever was done does seem to be effective. usually the bus starts easily 
provided all the ignition wires are connected!!! :-)
any shot in the dark clues on what really happened???
