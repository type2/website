Subject: Differing Pushrod tubes on 76?

Hey gang,

I just pulled the pushrod tubes from #3 & #4 (driver's side) on my 76 to
replace the seals and noticed that I have two different kinds. Two of the four
are fatter, have an incut slot on the large end and the small end has a space
for the seal about twice as large as the others. You have to look closely at
this picture, but you can see on the right side the small o-rings just flop
around because they don't fill the larger gap. The new ones I ordered are all
the same small size.

Is this normal for there to be two different types of tubes? If so do I need a
different o-ring for these?

I can understand if these differed between intake and exhaust, but this
picture shows the exact order in which they were positioned. The larger tubes
were both on the left side of the cylinder. I'm new to type IV motors, but
aren't the exhaust valves on the outside and the intake beside each other on
the inside? If this is correct my theory of these tubes differing between
intake and exhaust doesn't fly.

Anyway, they were gushing oil before I pulled them and I'm afraid they'll do
the same thing if the seals on the small end don't fit better.

Any insight appreciated.

Thanks,

Mike
