you have a point, it is used as a patch most of the time to fix
marginal wiring, but think about it this way. is is really a great
idea to have power pump all the way from the back of the bus to the
switch (and through it as well) then go back just to power the
solenoid? Having the relay in place takes a load off the switch and
essentially helps promote a better situation for all things to do
their jobs. I suspect the relay was left  out origionally just for
cost reasons.
