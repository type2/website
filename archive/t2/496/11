Yah, the consensus seems to be a Ford starter relay used as a hot start
relay.  Karl suggested that it would be good to replace it with a
normal relay, since the Ford part is actually a solenoid that sucks
about as much juice as the Bus's starter solenoid.

Last I was underneath the Bus in this area, I do seem to recall that
wired did in fact go to the solenoid.  I'll put "map out the apparently
modified starter wiring" on my to-do list.

Thanks for the quick replies, everybody.

Feliz Aqo Nuevo.
