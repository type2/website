Subject: Help identifying a part

Can someone identify the electrical part on the lower-left of this 
photo?

http://www.shagadelic.org/VW/electrical-part.jpg

On the right of the photo is the starter/solenoid, and this picture was 
taken with my feet sticking out from under the right side of the Bus.

Thanks!
