Subject: Bus Doesn't Go into 3rd?

Hi Everyone,

I spent the day welding new body parts in my '74 Microbus... As usual my mind
pretty much wondered the entire time due to the fact I hate body work.
I began thinking about the tranny problem I've yet to tackle.  I only drove
the bus around the block once before dismantling for the restoration.  The
previous owner mentioned the bus ran great, but the transmission would not
shift into 3rd?  I tried as well and it felt like something was keeping the
shifter from moving in that direction.  All the other gears felt fine and
didn't pop out with Muir's test.
Anybody gone through an issue like this before?

Thanks,

Tom
