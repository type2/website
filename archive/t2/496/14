The bar is only a simple hollow tube.

Nothing should have to have been disassembled in order to remove the roof.
My technique is to use a rope to tie the upper and lower supports together
on both sides and then remove the top.

No worries. The cable and spring in the side supports are a tensioned assist
mechanism. When the top is erected fully the supports pass thru 180 degrees
of angle then "lock" into place under the tension and weight of the roof.
