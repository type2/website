Subject: Mystery Lights on Dash

Here is a picture of the dash of my 76. Under the radio there are two small
light bulbs, one red and one green. Also, further right below the glove box
knob is a small round opening. None of these are shown in my owner's manual.
Does anyone know if these are stock and what they are?
Thanks,
Mike
