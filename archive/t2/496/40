Subject: Re: [T2] Mystery Lights on Dash

Jason's right about the LED's. The round hole is a european 12V accessory
adapter. Works like a cigarette lighter style adapter for a cell phone
charger, radar detector, etc. Oooh, wait, this is the bus list...the radar
detector was probably a bad example to use.

I'm not sure what kind of accessories they used in the '70s... CB radio
maybe? Those were probably more a USofA thing...

Here is a picture of the dash of my 76. Under the radio there are two small
light bulbs, one red and one green. Also, further right below the glove box
knob is a small round opening. None of these are shown in my owner's manual.
