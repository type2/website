Right, the relay doesn't have to be hefty.  As I understand it, the 
relay only provides the "signal" input to the starter solenoid.  The 
problem being solved is insufficient "signal" current in the stock 
set-up due to old, tired wiring combined with the current having to 
make a round-trip to the front of the Bus.

You know what's funny...  I just remembered that the PO of my Bus 
pointed out in the box of parts that he gave me that there was a 
starter relay kit in the box.  It looks exactly like the one offered by 
Bus Depot:

...which is presumably where he got it, since I know he ordered a some 
other stuff from Ron before he sold the Bus to me.

He may not have even realized that another starter relay was already 
installed, or may have simply not paid much attention when he replaced 
the starter solenoid (which I also know he did before he sold the Bus 
to me).

Well, at least it's nice to know that I have a suitable replacement 
part :-)
