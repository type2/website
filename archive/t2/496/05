Subject: ASI pop-top at Oakland, CA Pick-n-Pull

I was cleaning out iPhoto today and ran across a photo of an ASI 
pop-top I took about a month ago (11/02/03) at the Oakland, CA 
Pick-n-Pull.  The top appeared to be in pretty good condition, and this 
bus also had a fair bit of Westy cabinetry still intact, as well.

If anyone in the San Francisco Bay Area is looking for a replacement 
ASI top, early-Bay camper interior parts, or looking to convert a 
non-camper into a camper, it might be worth going over the the Oakland, 
CA Pick-n-Pull to see if this Bus is still there.  It was in the back 
of the yard, surrounded by several American vans and some Vanagons.
