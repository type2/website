Jason, could this be a isolator for the second
battery, seen one that looked like that on one I was
parting out, when the alternator is not putting out
the battery is isolated from the one that starts the
bus.. Or it could be a hot start relay, does one of
the red wires go to the starter soloniod?? could be
either one of them depending on where the wires go.
