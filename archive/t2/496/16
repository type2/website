Karl can take the Bosch 5 digit short number provided at those source and
map it to the longer version.

e.g.

07 060 is 1 237 121 581.

For this particular can, what's key is that 581 is written on the arm of the
canister. This will help you locate a compatible can from any seller
offering a mystery part.
