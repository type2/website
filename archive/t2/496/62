Make sure the shifter is adjusted per the Bentley manual. You may also want
to disassemble and check the shifter and linkage components, it's easy to
get to most of it. (tranny needs to be out to look at all the bushings
though). All of my "tranny problems" to date have turned out to be clutch or
shifter adjustments, or missing shift linkage bushings.

Good Luck,

previous owner mentioned the bus ran great, but the transmission would not
shift into 3rd?  I tried as well and it felt like something was keeping the
shifter from moving in that direction.  All the other gears felt fine and
didn't pop out with Muir's test.
