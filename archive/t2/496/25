Happy New Year volks.

Some sightings of the new microbus near Motorola HQ have been reported 
on this list -- Yesterday morning I saw one on the road here in 
Canada. Luckily I had my new digital camera with me and was able to 
sneak a pic while the driver was away from the vehicle. I'm not 
thrilled with their color choice, but it looks very true to the 
prototype:

For those who are skeptical, I can assure you no photoshop trickery 
whatsoever was used in this image.

Happy trails,
