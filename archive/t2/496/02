Subject: What holds pop top up on 1978 Westy ? How does tension work ?

I am restoring my 1978 Westfalia. I just re-installed my pop top roof
on the Westy after getting it back from the Fiberglass restorers
(5 coats of new resin, sanding, epoxy, and PPG paint!).

As a part of the restoration they replaced the horizontal bar that is part of
the front arms that
you push on when lifting up the top. My old one was rusty and I found a good
new one
from a junkyard bus with no rust. This is the bar that goes horizontaly
between the two front arms.
It hooks to the large round hinge connectors on the front bars.

Was this center bar under any kind of tension or spring, and is it a concern
when it was removed
and replaced by the painters ? I asked them about it and they didn't seen to
think it was under
any tension when they removed and replaced it.

I noticed there is some type of cable hooked up to both front arms at the
round hinge connectors.
It looks to me like the cable is pulled out as you lower it to help slow down
the roof as it lowers ?

How does the tension work on the front mechanism for the pop top and should I
be worried
about the painter replacing the center horizontal bar ?

I don't want the top to fall on the kids when camping next summer !

Thanks
Dean
