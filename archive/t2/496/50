Billy knows the smog system probably better than anyone. Lost of info in the archives.

To guarantee passing you have to get the mixture set with an exhaust analyzer. The bus can run perfectly fine but fail miserably.

If the mixture is set too rich on the AFM the Pertronix won't compensate for it. It works best at high rpm where the spark from the points is weak and the smog test stays in the 1500-2500rpm range. I'm not doubting that it's an improvement, only doubting it's a big one.
