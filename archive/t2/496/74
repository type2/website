Subject: 1981 Westy A/C

My 1981 Westy is in the shop getting its motor rebuilt. The mechanic reports
that the York compressor broke a rod. IIRC the previous owner (my brother)
replaced the compressor once or twice during his ten year ownership. I've
seen that busdepot.com has an adapter kit to replace the York compressor
with a Sanden. Should I put another York compressor in it? Is there an
advantage to the Sanden? Is A/C even a good idea on a 2 liter Westy? The
original motor went 125k with A/C. Not bad. And it sure is nice on those
long drives acroos Nebraska in the summer.
