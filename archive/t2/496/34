Subject: RE: another relay question

OK I have a question about relays now........
I accidently messed up the rear window defroster relay
and so I ordered another one from CIP i believe that
looked very simular to the one mentioned......"Part
Number:330-077 at
http://www.partsexpress.com/webpage.cfm" And I was
wondering now can someone give me a diagram about how
to hook it up as this relay has five pins and the
acutal one that i have has just four?
