Subject: RE: [T2] Starter Relay

Relays eventually just wear out; they could wear out sooner if it's not
designed for what it's being used for.  The bottom of your bus is not a
great environment for most electrical parts. But they're pretty cheap.

As for the alternator light, you can remove your instrument cluster (easier
if the steering wheel comes off first) and swap the light bulb with one that
you know works. Also look at the wiring behind the dash...maybe clean the
ground connections (brown wires that got to spade connectors mounted on
structural stuff). I think the only common point between the oil pressure
and alternator lights would be the ground.

I recently discovered I have one of these Bosh relays (WR1) installed on my
bus after a few list members played "identify this picture".

After pulling my hair out for a few days trying to figure out why the bus
would not start, I purchased another one of these. I didn't even have to
replace the wiring portion, just plugged the new box/terminal portion into
the
existing wires and it fired right up.

While trying to diagnose my problem and start the bus I crawled underneath
with a piece of wire and bridged the gap between the terminal from the
switch
