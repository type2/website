Agreed. I've been wanting a set of a while and this is the first time I've
been hobbled without it.

I have that but it's hard to measure sometimes were there are only a few
threads and it's hard to tell tapered from straight.

That's what I was hoping someone would answer when I suggested I've
overlooked something obvious.

Yes, the VDO ones look it.

None is listed.

FYI, identical switches on 911 cases (from Hella and identical except for
bar value) torque to 14.7 ft. lbs. no matter the case alloy. I think you've
probably found an appropriate value to start with and check to see if there
are any leaks before applying more torque.

I did count how many times the original switch rotated when I removed it. 4
1/2 turns with the last 1/2-3/4 turns where the torque had to be applied. It
sure would be horrible to wreck the case for such a simple item.

No doubt true. In my case the sender is stamped 1/78 (bus built 2/78) and
there is also a VW part number and logo on the bottom of it.

This is where I'm still confused. Here's another photo of what I bought:

The female end and the male end of the adapter are definitely of the AN
variety. The other two match as you saw in my other photo of the cable
eating itself. Since the male end does not fit the case or my tee with the
female M10x1 straight thread tee I'll have to get it measured to satisfy my
curiosity and locate a suitable substitute or adapt it. This VDO 150 752D
seems to be a dud with 1/8-27 NPT threads.

Thank you Scott. I'm on the road to recovery.
