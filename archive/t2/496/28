You note the hydraulics and friction materials, but you also have to
resurface or replace the rotors and drums as well, perhaps you are doing
this already but you did not mention it.

The flex hoses are easier to undo after cutting them. Then you can get a
closed end spanner over the hex end of the hose. Since you are replacing
them anyhow, this will save some time and skinned knuckles.

You should also replace the spring clips that hold the flex hoses to the
frame, there are 4 of them and they are available at the VW dealer.

It is a good idea to bench bleed the master before installing, it will save
time bleeding. You still need to bleed the system after, it will just make
it easier. You may also need to replace the blue hoses from the reservoir to
the cylinder, and if your new master didn't come with a new o-ring for the
connection between the master and brake booster, you need one of those.
