Subject: Big Brake job Q's

Greetings fellow bussers,

78 Westy Stock

Still have not solved my front torsion troubles, but that's another story...

I am getting ready to start on the restoration of my brake system. I have 
new rear cylinders and pads, new front pads and a new master cylinder and I 
will replace all 4 flex hoses. I have even thought about replacing all the 
steel brake lines availible thru OEVeeDub.

I haven't messed with brake systems much and I have never replaced a master 
cylinder, rear cylinders or the flex hoses before.  Any tips? I have found 
Steve Dolan's  "procedure" for bleeding in the archives plus some other 
usefull info.

I would like to flush all the brake fluid too. And it seems like it would be 
best to do this before I install all the new parts, right??? then replace 
with the new parts and bleed as normal? DOT 4 right?

Fianlly, how difficult is it to rebuild the front calipers? Mine don't look 
so great and I noticed BD has a $20 rebuild kit. Any special tools?

What would/did you do?

Thanks,
Brandt
