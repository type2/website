You probably also want to replace the springs, adjuster screws, and adjuster
nuts in the rear brakes, mine were all pretty corroded. Please make sure the
new parts are exactly like the original ones. The early bay springs and
adjsuter screws are almost but not quite the same. The older screws will
fit, but the slot has a different angle, which will cause the pads to not
seat right and rub during normal driving.

This is important: make sure the slots in the adjsuter screws are oriented
correctly on installation, so the shoes sit flush on the adjsuters.

If you remove the rear brake backing plate, the bottom dowel pin needs to be
driven out from the inside of the bearing housing, not the outside. I think
Bentley has it backwards.

I also replaced the rear masters, at $15 each, it's a good idea while the
whole thing's apart.

Do your wheel bearings need to be greased? This might be a good time while
it's all apart...

I am getting ready to start on the restoration of my brake system. I have
new rear cylinders and pads, new front pads and a new master cylinder and I
will replace all 4 flex hoses. I have even thought about replacing all the
steel brake lines availible thru OEVeeDub.
