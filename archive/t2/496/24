Subject: Starter Relay

While we're on the topic.....

I recently discovered I have one of these Bosh relays (WR1) installed on my
bus after a few list members played "identify this picture".

After pulling my hair out for a few days trying to figure out why the bus
would not start, I purchased another one of these. I didn't even have to
replace the wiring portion, just plugged the new box/terminal portion into the
existing wires and it fired right up.

While trying to diagnose my problem and start the bus I crawled underneath
with a piece of wire and bridged the gap between the terminal from the switch
and the terminal from the battery.

I noticed after doing this sometimes the red battery or oil light would not
come on when the switch is turned to the right. Now the oil light comes on
consistently, but the battery light does not ever come on with the switch in
the on position. Prior to my relay going out and me "jump" starting it, these
lights always came on with the switch in the on position.

Why would this make the battery light not come on and what would make the
relay go bad to start with?

Thanks,

Mike
