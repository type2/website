I don't think the "Volkswagen" script appears on the back on the  
"square ear" bay window Busses.  As far as I know, the only VW branding  
on the Busses of that vintage is the emblem on the nose.  Automatics  
are the exception with a "VW Automatic" script on lower-left of the  
rear hatch.

As for the "Westfalia" script, I don't believe that was present on any  
bay window Westy, except for maybe '79.  I think all Vanagon Westies  
had that script on the left-rear of the pop-top.  The "Westfalia"  
script is pretty cool looking, and I think it's fairly common for folks  
to place the decal in the Vanagon location on their late bay Westies  
(I, for one, am thinking of doing this on my '76 :-)

Some (all?) bay window Westies (later ones with the luggage rack in the  
front) had a Westfalia crest on either side of the luggage rack,  
towards the rear of the luggage rack.  Most Westies that had these  
originally no longer do, I think (perhaps some glue marks remain).

If you want replacement Westfalia script or crest decals, Go Westy! has  
them:
