Hmmm. If you have brand new pads, this would probably work ok. But if you
adjust the parking brake with the shoes retracted all the way, it seems that
after you extend the shoes to where they need to be, that you would have
pre-tensioned the parking brake cables, maybe causing misalinged or
non-symetrical brake shoe geometry?

I've found that it works much better to adjust the
parking brake cables with the brake shoe adjusting
stars completely retracted, then adjust the shoes.
