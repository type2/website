There is no going back for me. I adore Linux. I fix Windows for other 
folks but I am not drawn it it anymore. I've been using Linux for years 
now. About a decade. There are some really interesting projects out 
there that can be useful for vehicle mods and restoration!

(PortableApps: for using open-source software on a Windows machine that 
you can not alter such as at work or on a univ campus or library)

For the non-Linux or non-open-source software folks - there are about 
36,000 programs out there for free in Linux-land. Several hundred 
(thousands?) are full fledged software and the rest are components of 
the other software.

Best of all no anti-virus protection needed (just like a Mac) at this 
point in history. Much more secure than a Windows environment.

I know the Type2 list isn't really the place to discuss it but if anyone 
wanted Linux guidance, holler p-mail and I'll help you out. I am self 
taught over several years but think the topic could be boiled down to a 
couple hours of guidance. I have set it up for folks from 7 years old to 
80 years old.  It is SO much easier now than it was a decade ago. If you 
go looking on the web for Linux info - note the dates of the articles 
and tutorials. Just pay attention to the information two years old or 
newer. Lots of naysayers quoting old problems in their anti-Linux rants 
that have been long solved. Lots of articles from 2005 and back 
explaining long arduous methods for accomplishing setup tasks when the 
modern way is like any other OS - click-click-click.
