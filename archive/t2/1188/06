hey thanks - the busdepot OEM - at $33 looks just like the cheap  
China one I have - at ~$5 - no wonder it breaks.  Still BD has one  
for <$2 so might try might try that - once I make window easier.

but seems time to take off the panel and look inside. I expect  the  
felt is gunked up after all these years.

thanks for getting back to me
