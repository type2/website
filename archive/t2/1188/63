I'm not really sure what that means.  The free-air calibration should 
include pulling the sensor out of the exhaust and then holding down the 
calibration button that was included in the LC-1 installation.  If I 
remember correctly, there might even be a calibration button on the 
gauge if it's hooked up with the digital connection.  The little LED 
will blink and then it'll be calibrated and should read around 20:1

Yeah, that's where I was thinking of putting it.  It's unfortunate that 
there's nowhere closer to the cylinder heads than the individual headers.

Ahhhh.... ok.  Now I think we might have found the problem.  First, 
could you send me the exact specs of the gauge you got?  Does it accept 
a digital in - that would be preferable.  Otherwise, we need to make 
sure you're using the correct analog out because one is configured for 
WB02, and the other simulates a NB02 output.  I can help you out with 
this config.  What color analog out are you using - I think it's an 
orange and brown?

no worries - even if there is a problem, Innovate is really good - I 
brought my unit back a couple years later and they replaced it.

The software's free.  Is there any way you can get a Windows laptop with 
a serial port?  That way we can check the configuration to make sure 
nothing got changed.
