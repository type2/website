Pull the sensor out, calibrate it, and if I remember correctly, it 
should be somewhere around 20:1 when it's hanging in the free air.  Then 
you can take a bic lighter and press the button and the butane (not lit) 
should make the mixture go rich to 8:1 or something like that.

Btw, where did you mount the sensor on your exhaust?

When you connect the gauge to the LC-1, do you use the 1/8" plug, or are 
you using one of the analog outs?

We need to get some reasonable readings - it definitely shouldn't stick 
to 10:1 all the time - then somethings wrong with your configuration or 
the sensor.  You might want to load up logworks and hook it up to the 
LC-1 to see if the configuration is correct.
