>  Experience vs opinion. I'll throw my opinion out there - had a JC Whitney
replacement engine in a Beetle I bought years ago. It was crap and within 10K
miles had ruined one connecting rod and the crank journal for the #3 cylinder.
Also overheated.

Out of curiosity, was it billed as a Mexi engine or just their own build?
