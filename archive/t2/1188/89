This may or may not be of help to you, but I would *highly, highly, 
highly* recommend the Hellroaring battery isolator.  That thing is 
awesome.  You just run a wire from your starter battery positive 
terminal to the isolator and then from the isolator to the other 
battery.  It's such a great system, especially if you get the selector 
switch.
