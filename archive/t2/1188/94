Subject: Samba Ad for my bus

Hi all:

Here is the SAMBA ad for my bus.  I've updated some of the photos based 
on feedback from people who have come to see it.  As it's been on the 
market for only 2 weeks the price is currently firm.

Pass it along, contact me if interested, or give me feedback for 
improving the ad if you care to.

Moving to Boston, and can't afford to rent storage for her there.

Thanks,

BEN
