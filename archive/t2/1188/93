There is always WINE in Linux for running Windows software. I run Mint 
Linux 13 KDE. if you'll pop me a software download link I'll be glad to 
see if I can get it to work in Linux and tell you what to do.

FWIW I use some OBDII scanning software on my Linux laptop by running 
WinXP inside VirtualBox (free). All you need is a WinXP setup disc. I 
also have Win7 setup this way. I do this to run certain apps here at 
work for folks who need me to troubleshoot stuff.

If there is anything I can do to coach you through setting up VirtualBox 
let me know. Pretty simple once you've done it. All mouse clicks.
