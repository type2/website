Subject: WTB: used but good, Pop-top canvas, 71

was about to patch once more, but canvas too brittle. New one, plus  
installation , is too expensive to justify, BUT someone may be  
replacing a fairly good one when restoring, that's what I am  
considering. I have checked Samba.

until then I use a mosquito net.

btw, can a later year bay canvas be adapted?

anyone still finding any bays at wrecking yards in So. California?   
Do they call 'favorite' people when one comes in?
