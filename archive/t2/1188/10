Subject: Re: [T2] window cranks, '71

I got tired of my window crank handles breaking, the new pot metal ones are a
joke, so I bought one of the few things EMPI makes that actually work. Do a
search on " EMPI 11-4521-B Window Crank - Chrome " you won't have to replace
them ever again! Hope this helps, Timo in Hawaii
