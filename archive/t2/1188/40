I didn't use bulbs but rather reconfigured the inner part of the taillight 
housing to hold multibulb truck  clearance lights.  with the cover back on 
looks stock, but tail light is like a straight bar of light  accross the 
housing and the brake light is a second bar below it. quite bright.  got 
the lights at PEP boys but seem pretty generic, and were rather straight 
forward to hook up.

could send you private e-mail a photo of the setup
