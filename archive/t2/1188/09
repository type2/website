Every time i go into a autoparts store I haven't been to before I check the
"Help" section for window handles. Lots of times I can find old VW handles
in stock for a few bucks - considering they break so often its just been
easiest for me to keep a few cheap ones on hand for that inevitable moment.

Good luck and don't bother searching for any around Albany NY, I've already
snatched them all up :)
