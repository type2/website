I would clean all the connections and try again.  Check the battery
connections (posts may be clean but the cables may not.  Wire brush them).
Pay particular attention to your grounds.  Pull the wires (one at a time
only to avoid reconnection mistakes) from your voltage regulator and take a
file or dremel to them till they shine.

Clicking to me usually means a starter issue.  Either you aren't getting
enough voltage to through the bendix (gear) out or the solenoid is shot.
If cleaning your connections don't work then tap the starter with a hammer
and try again.  If you still get a click the solenoid may have gone out in
your starter.  If it starts after the tap then its a sign that your starter
is probably going out.  Make sure you always carry a hammer with you until
you get a chance to change the started out.  Always Start with cheap and
move up.
