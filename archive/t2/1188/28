Oh I have no idea where the engine came from. It was a Beetle I still 
own but purchased while I was stationed overseas in about ~1992. The car 
was covered with all sorts of JC Whitney stuff most of which at the time 
did not fit or did not last. Rubber gaskets that turned to dust in less 
than a year after I installed them from a box of parts that came with 
the car. Chrome tin that did not fit right or apparently cool well. The 
engine came from the catalog but I have no idea who built it.

That was about the time I quit using them b/c their postage at the time 
was based on price rather than weight I think.

Who knows with all the competition, maybe they've gotten better but I 
don't want to try them again with my money.

Still have that Beetle here in dry storage but it needs some TLC. Hope 
to restore it.
