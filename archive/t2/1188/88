Subject: Re: [T2] D+ alternator wire disconnect

Right, exactly. OK. Thanks David. I'm a bit more sorted, but still not
quite sure whether I have an actual issue then. The system seemed to
maintaining charge on both batteries fine - I was surprised to find that
wire cut tho.

I have an utterly unlabeled dual battery relay. Instead of running anything
off the55amp alt's D+, that wire has been cut and capped. The B+ also runs
direct to the relay, and a small terminal on the relay is connected to a
wire that is spliced to the remains of the D+ where is meets the blue wire
at the plug for the voltage regulator.

I don't know if this is a standard dual battery relay change from the
conversion or a PO hack - s'pose it doesn't matter. I'll see if I can find
any info on it.

Will this potentially cause the already vague idiot ALT light to be even
less useful?   Is there any harm in not having the D+ hooked up? If there
isn't, I can assume that since it is not a "regulated" power source, it
should not be used to power anything without being run through a voltage
regulator?
