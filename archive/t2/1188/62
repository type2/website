There is no way that the stock EFI can keep a constant 10:1 - even with 
the megasquirt tuned to stay at a particular AFR, it still bounces 
around a few.  Just stepping or letting up quickly on the gas should 
make the mixture momentarily go rich/lean respectively.  My guess is 
that something's not right with the LC1's config.
