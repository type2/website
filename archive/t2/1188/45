Hi folks,

After returning from a 2-week trip in Oregon, my '70 bus sat parked for a 
week, and when I went to start it, I got just a click.  I pulled the battery 
and put a meter on it and got 11.7v.  Since the battery was 10 years old, I 
figured it had chosen that moment to die.  I bought a new one and installed 
it.  Still wouldn't start.  I got dash lights, and the starter solenoid 
engaged but wouldn't turn the engine.  I tested the battery voltage and got 
12.5v.  I figured they hadn't fully charged the battery, so I pulled it back 
out and put it on a charger overnight.  The battery was 13.5v this morning, 
but only 12.9v three hours later.  I hesitate to put the battery back into 
the bus yet.  I'd like first to know what the voltage should be for a normal 
battery in order for it to crank the engine.  Is this new battery behaving 
normally, or did I get a dud?  By the way, I've been running a Hella starter 
relay for 10 years, and I've never had starting issues.  Any thoughts?

Thanks,
Jerry
