Thanks Mike, I appreciate the input - looks like a helluva unit. I picked
up a Blue Seas Systems starter isolating auto charging relay (#7106) and
their dual circuit battery switch (#5511e) that I'd like to install, once I
understand the current wiring and the changes that were made. I still have
the receipts, so I'll have to compare the Blue Seas relay to the
Hellroaring unit.
