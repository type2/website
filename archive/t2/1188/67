Ok, I just looked at the docs for the DB gauges 
(http://www.innovatemotorsports.com/support/manual/DB_manual.pdf) and it 
looks like they expect a 0-5v signal, which by default is supplied on 
Analog Out 2 (brown).  Check that you have the gauge's white wire hooked 
up to the LC1's brown.

Well, then let's pray that the LC1 is configured correctly because I 
have seen the controllers lose their config before.  It was rare, but it 
can happen.
