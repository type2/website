Subject: Re: [T2] Cancel Ring 71 bus

On my 74 bus, the cancel ring bumps a tiny little plastic nub in the
turn signal lever base when the steering wheel turns back to straight
ahead. This little nub switches the signal off. Sometimes this little
plastic nub gets worn down so it can't do its job, even if the gap
between the signal lever mount and the steering wheel hub is correct.

In my case, I had to replace the turn signal lever assembly. I suppose
I could have gotten creative with JB weld...

Oh, its also important that the steering wheel is oriented properly. A
few degrees off messes up when the turn signal cancels.
