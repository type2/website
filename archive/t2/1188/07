Subject: Re: [T2] window cranks, 71

After breaking about 3 of the cast metal plastic covered POS handles from 
suppliers, I decided I didn't need to look OEM, and bought a set of these.

After 20 yrs, they're still there, still work, look good.
HTH,

I have non-matching window cranks. The passenger side breaks and  the
window is hard to wind up, but not often used as I really like the
half-light window.
