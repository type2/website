Subject: window cranks, 71

71 type-2
I have non-matching window cranks. The passenger side breaks and  the  
window is hard to wind up, but not often used as I really like the  
half-light window.

1) Is the pebbly crank cover original?  I can only find one source  
one line and that says out-of-stock.  or maybe that too was changed  
and is from a bug?   most replacements seem to be smooth with a  
circle impressed on the top , and will probably break again.

2) How do I lube the window.

thanks
