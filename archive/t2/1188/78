Ben, unfortunately, this list is not nearly as active as it was for such 
a long time.  I don't know why exactly that is but it is true.  There 
are probably not enough people monitoring the list in different places 
for it to be a dependable source of help anymore. For travelers, that 
is.  I'm in Chattanooga, TN or I would offer my help.  I hope they find 
a good local mechanic that knows air cooled VW's at the very least.
