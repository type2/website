Subject: Re: [T2] Electrical frustration

This is all valuable information about addressing corrosion issues with any 
electrical problem.  I'm still interested in knowing what the normal voltage 
of a fully charged car battery should be when it's just sitting there with 
the engine not running.

Thanks,
Jerry
