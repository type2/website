Try posting a request on the Mt. Baker Vintage VWs (http://mbvv.org/). We're an hour from the Tsawwassen ferry. Hell, I'd even deliver it for you and visit a friend in Nanaimo if you pay the ferry at least one way.

We're 40km from the border and I think you have a good chance there. Or post on craigslist too for Bellingham or Skagit Counties. My friend might have one too. I'll poke around. Let me know how serious you are though...
