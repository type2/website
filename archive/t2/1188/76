Just checking -- anyone contact this guy?


Hi all:

Just got a call from a guy who limped into Sacramento  late last night 
from Colorado in his Westy.  He's stuck at Tesla and Fulton, in front of 
Chet and Cliff's, which is closed up tight.  He spent the night there 
last night and is still breathing which is a good thing <g>.  We reckon 
it's a fuel system problem.  Sounds like he's running on 2 cylinders.

He has his wife and kid <s?> with him.  His cell is 720-231-4430.   He 
also needs a place to park and camp tonight.  I can't fit another bus in 
my little yard and drive or I would.

Hope you all can help him.

BEN
