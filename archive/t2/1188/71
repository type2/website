think I may have found the problem but wanted to run it by you before I 
start messing with wires

Gauge is the G-5 analog

the LC1 instructions say to wire analog to yellow wire which is what I 
did.

G5 instructions say wire the gauge to the brown wire.

I did not notice this discrepency in the instructions until I put them 
side by side.

will wait for you to get back to me but I suspect I should swap the yellow 
wire and attach the brown????
