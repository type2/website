BOOOOOOOOOOMMMMM!!!!!!!

guess that is why I was a medic in the army..

---

but switched the wires

volia  real readings..

didn't get to take a drive  but warmed up

idle 13.5-14
fast idle (1200rpm) 12.8-13
1/2 throttle 12.5-12.8
1/2 to idle (released throttle) bounced up to 14.1

all with no load.

got family here from out of state then up to my ears in work (probably 
overtime) thru Wed so probably next Fri/Sat before I can really do 
something.

at least the gauge is working and I can get a feel for what adjustments or 
changes are actually doing.

still only getting 10mpg, now I have a lot of junk in it (not as bad as 
Steve's was) and there is the extra weight of the low floor mod. and it is 
an Auto tranny and I do a lot of stop and go city driving, but 15 was 
acceptable and occasionally got 16 around town and 18 on the road. once in 
a great while with the wind in my tail and a good draft off an 18wheeler I 
have touched 20mpg.

so now to find out what the problem is (I hope)

thanks mucho
Bob
