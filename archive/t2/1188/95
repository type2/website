HI Mikes,
       I'm probably the one that recommended the Blue Seas set up.  Mike S and
I have chatted about the Hellroaring  equipment several years ago.  I too
recommend that equipment, as well as the Blue Seas kit.  The Blue Seas ACR and
battery switch are more widely available and have proven to be extremely
reliable in many marine installs.  Believe me, the boat folks have an
"internet hair trigger" for anything that is unreliable.  You can't "pull over
to the side of the road" to fix something out on the ocean.  The Blue Seas
ACRs are about 1/2 the price. Not that VW buss owners are frugal ;-)  I
heartily support the choice of the Hellroaring folks.  They seem to know what
they are doing and, based on their solid state relay tech pages, have more
than enough knowledge to build a superior product.  Designed and made in
Montana, cant be beat.

Either way you will have a MUCH better solution than the standard  "second
battery relay kit" or "diode isolator".
