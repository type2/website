Subject: Re: [T2] laying under the bus

I bought high lift/wide base heavy duty jackstands. About $45 per pair. 
Needed two pair. Torin brand. They replace a pair of stamped sheetmetal 
and tube stands and a set of diminutive Craftsman stands that were 
really too short for the application. MUCH larger base and that was my 
main concern.

Bus never moved with the old set of stands under it but I'm under it now 
working on everything and there is not much suspension left on the bus 
(none in front) and not much to keep the bus from coming down on me. I 
do add my two trolley jacks for backup when I'm under there.

The roof of the van is as high as it can get without the garage door 
rubbing the roof of the bus.

I REALLY want a two post lift. And a ceiling high enough to take 
advantage of it.

Lots of wishing going on at my house. ;)
