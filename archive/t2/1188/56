Subject: Re: [T2] Base settings for a 34PICT-3 carburetor

Tim -

I agree with David - chuck the 009 and install a SVDA, you'll be loads
happier.  But make sure you re-set the bench specs first.  Here's an
article I wrote for Airhead Parts awhile back.  A copy is inserted
into each H30/31PICT or 34PICT-3 (MPI or Euromax) box before shipping.
 The so-called defective rate plunged to almost nothing after that.  I
know it works because I've installed carbs over the years using these
methods time and time again.

Hope this helps.
