Hey Bob,

Which bulbs did you use? I just know when I have tried to find LED's it
looks like there are a lot of different kinds, and they need to be sourced
on the internet, so you can't just hold one bulb next to another to compare.
In other words do you have a model number or something?

The source I used for my LED dome bulbs was superbrightleds.com

I have tail and brake LED lighting (not single bulbs) and they use almost no
electric.
