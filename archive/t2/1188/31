No, they have not gotten any better.  I bought the carpet for my wife's '97
Buick Skylark (I know, non-VW) about three years ago from them because the
price was not too expensive and they said it was "custom cut and molded for
your application."  It was cut but sewn together, not molded.  It didn't
last two years before the seams came apart and the pile started to fall out.
I replaced it with a better carpet this year.

That was about the time I quit using them b/c their postage at the time was
based on price rather than weight I think.

Who knows with all the competition, maybe they've gotten better but I don't
want to try them again with my money.

Still have that Beetle here in dry storage but it needs some TLC. Hope to
restore it.
