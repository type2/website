Subject: Base settings for a 34PICT-3 carburetor

Hello all, I'm trying to set up a brand new 1600cc dual port motor running a
new 34PICT-3 carb and can't get it to idle. Timing is set 32 degrees total
advance on a 009 distributor. It runs great above about 2500 rpms, but
stumbles and dies when it approaches idle. The throttle positioner screw has
to be on the topmost notch just to stay running. I saw a video on YouTube that
recommends 2 1/2 turns out on both the volume and mixture screws, but this
leaves me with an engine that still runs with the smaller screw turned all the
way in. Anyone know a base setting for both the screws in question?
