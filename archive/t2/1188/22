Take your window regulator out of the door and put fresh grease into all 
the moving parts. I cleaned out the old grease and pushed new grease 
into the groove that the window lift slides in. The felt was worn but I 
think the biggest difference came from the new grease and removing the 
old grease. Same for the door locks. Took them out of the doors and 
cleaned/regreased everything and the door locks were SO easy again.
