scratching head, and work,  the guage no matter how I drive or how warm 
the engine is stays firmly planted at 10.1  never moves.

I am wondering if maybe somehow the wires were cross or the color code 
wrong and I have the digital guage wires on the analog gauge.

I have phutzed with the AFM and engine gets better or worse but gauge 
never varies.  I know the control box is good but it ain't that good.

so my seat of pants can't figure out why gauge isn't reading something. 
has been raining and I have to go out of town and had a whole bunch of 
family "Stuff" so really haven't had a chance to really trouble shoot the 
wireing yet.  but it sure is purty filling the last empty hole in my gauge 
pod.
