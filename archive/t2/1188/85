Assuming all cells are good, a just charged battery will show over 13 
volts (ave 13.2v)- and it should show 12.7 (give or take a tenth 
depending on temp) as its resting voltage (after 2-3 hrs off charge.
An older battery should be load tested- a known draw (100 amps?) over 10 
seconds should not let it drop voltage below a certain point- you can 
get load testers at Harbor Freight; I have one.  Thus I have a battery 
from a 2004 Subaru that still showed good on charge voltage, but leaving 
on the roof light drew it down enough overnight to not start due it 
having lost capacity.  I charged it up, used the load tester, and it 
showed weak.
New battery time.
