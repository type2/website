I've been away from the list and most things VW for a while, and just  
saw the dedication on Richard Atwell's website.

I couldn't believe it. Steve was a stand-up guy and a great and  
patient administrator back in the days when people would join the list  
from AOL and type their first message in all caps.

I know this is old news, but it's sad news today.
