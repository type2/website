$5K? How about a rebuilt engine from one of the online list suppliers? 
Drop your engine and move over all the cooling tin, renew whatever needs 
it, maybe some paint and new rubber parts wherever necessary...

I am seeing replacement Type IV engines in the $2K range from a popular 
online supplier. Just look for a "longblock".

I've had hit and miss success with used engines. Worked most of the time 
and a few times I bought some else's problems.

To me this would be an excellent opportunity to clean up the fuel 
system, throw some new paint on the engine bay and engine tin, replace 
exhaust gaskets, etc. I'd avoid the cutrate el cheapo guys. Spend some 
time seeking opinions on longblock brands vs warranties. Experience vs 
opinion. I'll throw my opinion out there - had a JC Whitney replacement 
engine in a Beetle I bought years ago. It was crap and within 10K miles 
had ruined one connecting rod and the crank journal for the #3 cylinder. 
Also overheated.

MAYBE they have come a long way since then. Maybe they haven't but I 
wouldn't been keen to spend my money on their long blocks.
