Subject: Fuel consumption/Leaks

I went & filled up the 70 westy this morning and looked in my fuel/mileage 
data.
I have a palm pilot app that keeps track of my vehicles.
I now see that there must have been a leak for about 2000 miles as the fuel 
consumption had increased guess that the metal fuel pipe was weeping and that 
will give you bad gas mileage,
The moral is that if you keep a log you can see symptoms of a problem before 
they cause a problem.
I should have looked for why my gas mileage had dropped from 18 to 16 mpg.
