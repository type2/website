Subject: '73 vs. '71

Hello Everyone,

I own and drive daily a 73 bus that I purchased last July.  This is my first
bus although I've driven bugs for the last 10 years.  On Saturday, I test
drove a 71 camper as I want to do some camping this summer.  I was extremely
disappointed with the performance of the 71.  The steering felt loose, the
brakes had a hard time stopping the vehicle despite a recent adjustment, and
we generally just felt unsafe.  The 71 has been maintained regularly by a
good VW mechanic.

According to a longtime bus-driving acquaintence, my 73 drives as a stock
vehicle of that year should.

So, I'm wondering about the performance differences between a 71 and a 73.
Are the larger disc brakes in the '73 the first brakes able to stop the
vehicle safely on their own?  The 71 needed the clutch to assist in the
slowing the vehicle if I was traveling in excess of 25mph.

I guess I'm really just curious as to how a 73 should compare to a 71 when
both are running properly.  The obvious differences to me (at least on
paper) should be a stronger engine and slightly better stopping ability.

Thanks for any feedback,

Brian
