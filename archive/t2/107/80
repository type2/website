Subject: Windshield rubber

I've been investigating windshield rubber prices and have found a huge
disparity in prices - from under $20 to $99.  At first I attributed this to
the difference between cal look and the rubber that takes a trim strip.  But
now I'm not so sure.  I'm looking for the trim strip style.  Any
recommendations?
