Not likely

Probably not, but I'll check the torque on those nuts (it seems that I 
_might_ have heard some chuffing under load that you will usually hear when 
the heads work loose).

Timing light is strong and no dropouts through all RPM ranges.

This is an older 009, which is cause for concern, in that the shaft (on BOTH 
distributors, anyway, shows a little lateral play).  I'm using the 009 right 
now, because it seems to run better.  When hooked back up, all wires ran to 
the appropriate cylinders, so apparently it is NOT180 degrees out.

INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, WHEN COLD, AND I'M GETTING MOST OF THE MISSING, WHEN I 
HOLD THE SPARK PLUG WIRE AWAY AND I GET ARCING, THE SYMPTOM GOES AWAY, (I'm 
shouting here because this is an interesting finding in my opinion).  It has 
followed through all the ignition changes, suggesting a problem with the long 
block, though I can't imagine.  These are (as far as I know) NEW heads.

?????  You might have something here.  I have noticed crud on the outside of 
the manifold,  (aerosolized oil from the breather box?), which was not there 
before the rebuild (manifold is cooler and not burning stuff off?).  

Done that -- no change.

What's a shrouded spark plug?  I see no carbon beyond the threads, suggesting 
that it is seated well.  Bosch W8AC plugs, by the way.
