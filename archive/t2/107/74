Subject: Re:  Polishing Problem 

Remember that you need to get the clear coat off before polishing but once
you do that you could simply polish it with a bench top buffer and then
re-spray the clear coat. It is indeed aluminum. Brite Dip is simply a
process that was used on the aluminum to reduce manufacturing costs. In a
restoration there is no need to Brite Dip it again.

You won't get satisfactory results with a rag and a can of aluminum polish,
or anything for that matter, until you get rid of the clear coat.

Let me know how it goes as I have set of trim awaiting the same treatment.
