The 74 trans most likely contains the same ratios as the 75.  I say most 
likely because the manuals don't make it clear when the change from the 
5.375 ring and pinion to the 4.86 ring and pinion took place.  It was 
either the middle or the beginning of the '74 model year.  All '74's that I 
have driven had the 4.86, but I have only driven a few.  The '75 tranny 
case has a few more ribs than the '74, but I believe they are completely 
interchangeable.  Bottom line, if it's a '74 tranny you should remove the 
rear cover of the tranny before you install it (make sure to obtain a new 
gasket first, it may not be easy) and count the teeth in the pinion.  If it 
has 8 teeth, it is 5.375.  If it has 7 teeth, it is 4.86 and the same as 
the '75 tranny.  I would go with the 4.86 ratio unless you want 
stump-pulling ratios in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd (4th is about the same in the two 
trannies).
