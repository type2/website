I just realized this is a 2 piece duct I need. Here is a pic from the Ron
Van Ness' article in the library:

Subject: [T2] BN4 Heat ducting


Well folks I pulled my old engine this weekend and after beginning the gas
heater install I realized that the main duct on my BN4 is for a type 1
engine bus. (old firewall, etc.). I really need the duct from the heater
that goes through the firewall with the thermostat for the bowden cable for
a LATE BN4/bus. I just need this one piece. (I assume the late piece will
work just fine with the early heater)

I have the early duct to trade or can buy the piece or trade for something
else. Please help as I can't install my new engine til I get this heater
in!!

Thanks
