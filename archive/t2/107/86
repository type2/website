Subject: Re: [T2] racing buses on dirt

I got the book  "VW Bus" The First 50 Years for Xmas. On 
page 131 there's a picture of VW LT(Load Transport) 
built for the Yamaha Paris-Dakar team. It bears a 
passing resemblance to a vanagon(I mistook it for a crew 
cab vanagon at first glance).
The LT was front engine(water cooled) rear drive utility 
truck. I don't think they were ever sold in US.
