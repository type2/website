Subject: Heaqlight /turn signal ????

Hi All, I have a problem when my headlights are on myn
turn signals do not work. The turn signal indicator
light comes on but none of the outside light come on
or blink.
Without the headlight on the turn signals work just
fine.
Also the emergency flashers do the same don't work
with headlights on but work OK when the headlight are
not on.
By the way this is in a 1981 Westy.
