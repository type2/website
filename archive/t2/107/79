IMO, no, but I've had bad luck with Michelins.

You should also check out the Bridgestone RD603V in 185R14 load range D.
Firestone dealers carry them (they were stock on Toyota 1-ton pickups) and
they can be a deal if you catch them on sale.  Last pair I bought were $70
each out the door.  They wear very evenly, are smooth and quiet, and
aren't worth beans in snow, so I have a pair of mounted snow tires for
that eventuality.  They also work well in soft materials if you air down,
as they will spin without digging a hole.
