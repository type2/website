Subject: Polishing Problem

Hiya All,

Just a bit ago I recall reading a post to the list which described the 
beltline trim as being "bright dip" rather than polished aluminum.  And, I 
believe, there was a further reference to the differences in polishing this 
stuff as opposed to aluminum.  Well, I have my beltline trim off the Duck 
while it's being painted.  And, of course, I am interested in making this 
stuff look good to go with the new paint job.  So...........just how does one 
go about "renewing" bright dip metal trim?  Any information (but especially 
info about products or refinishers to use) would be appreciated.

ps.  This trim sure looks like aluminum to me.
