The white wire to #1 is a single wire that comes all the way across the engine
from about 6" from the ECU.

Correct, it should go to an in-line fuse also, for the backup lights.
Now you should find the 3 wire harness that comes down from the heater blower
motor. It will have a dark blue with a tracer and it goes to the oil pressure
sender. It will have a black wire that goes to 15, it is key-on power. It will
have a white with green tracer and it goes to #1.

Only if you have a 79 Cal version with electronic ignition, but then the black
power wire for the control unit connects 4" away from the double relay.

On a Fed version bus, you should have 5 wires going to the coil:
#15 = black from 3 wire harness, black to in-line fuse/ double relay
#1 = white w/green from 3 wire harness, green to distributor, white to right
side of bus [look for a LONG single wire with a grey sheath on it]
