Subject: Re: polishing aluminum trim

Hi Mike,

try using a magnet to determin if your trim is steel or aluminum. if it's steel it
can be replated by a commercial plating company. if aluminum it can be sanded with
a DA sander with about 320 grit to remove the anodizing or "brite plating" then
repolished to the desired finish.
i've done quite a bit of polishing and it is no easy task for the do-it-yourselfer.

if you have any questions feel free to email

ps.  This trim sure looks like aluminum to me.
