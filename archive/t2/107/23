Chris,

I'm gonna ramble thru my thought process here...
Vacum gauge shows good...so probably not cam, valve or lifter
problems...hmmmm

I might check lift at the valves for #1 & #2 just to be sure that you
didn't have something weird going on there....shorter/longer pushrod by
chance???

Rocker arm is not loose on that side? Correct rockers on 1 & 2??

I am also assuming stock vacuum advance dist....if it is stock dist, then
timing for #3 should be a little retarded over the others....could you
have dist 180 degrees off and somehow have retard that is supposed to be
on #3 on #2?  I can't imagine such a thing, but it is worth checking the
timing on all 4(not just #1).  This will show spark on #2 as well...always
get spark, or is it missing cause no spark is getting there?...if the
timing light always shows spark(no dropouts) then probably something else.

Might also be why the 009 seemed a little better as there is not a retard
for #3 on 009 distributors(late model ones anyway).

Something in the intake causing the fuel to condense again(not be in vapor
state) on the way to #2?

You say that you switched plugs?  Try switching what you have between #1
and #2 and see if it follows the plug.

Try switching the wires between #1 and #2 and see what follows(if any).

Shrouded spark plug? from the head being rebuilt?  Spark plug not exposed
in the cylinder head properly?

Just my 2 cents.


Cheers, dave
