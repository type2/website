Subject: We Lost One...

  Alas, the ranks of air-cooled drivers just lost another member to the "real car" world. This weekend, one of my close friends and bus brothers, rescuers, and adventurers put his '71 and '60 buses into storage and bought a S*t*rn coupe. He was lured away by those shiny promises of speed, heat, and reliability that seem so far from a bus, but even he admits that a little part of him died as he left the car lot. It seems that more and more people are finding it easier to swallow a monthly payment over adjusting valves or doing some other maintenance or repair in the freezing cold, or rain. I'm pretty fortunate in that I actually ride a bike as my work commuter vehicle, but the crew cab and the bus are my only vehicles for shopping, errands, and road trips. Would my perspective change if I spent an hour or two each day in the bus stuck in traffic? Who knows... And as I look out my front door at home and see the two empty parking spaces, the street seems a little darker, a little!
 less spe
cial...
But wait, that means that there's room for me to bring home two more! Wahoo!
The circle continues, one way or another.
