Subject: Re: popping noises

Sorry it took so long, but I wanted to thank the guys who helped me with
this
problem. I appreciate you very much!
However, I have decided it is NOT a popping noise but more like a little

explosion interspersed with backfireing. So this weekend I am going to
adjust
the points and timing (using my idiots guide to VWs) and see if that
helps.
If not, I will be back asking for more help and advice!

Thanks again guys!

Sherri

P.S. Replaced the Thermo Switch this weekend and put on new battery
cables. I
am offically inducted into the VW repair crowd! Maybe by this time next
year
I will be answering questions.
