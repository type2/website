perhaps, but not necessarily.

Your 1600DP should run at 29-30 BDTC when fully advanced.  In other
words, when your dizzy will not advance the timing any more (which
is at about 3200 RPM for the 009), the #1 should fire at 30 BTDC.

The stock vacuum adv. dizzys had ~34 degrees TOTAL ADVANCE, so by
timing them at 5deg ATDC (-at-) idle, you knew you'd be ~29 deg BTDC
when fully advanced.  Since the 009's don't have a reliable amount
of "total advance" you time them at their full advance (3200 RPM)
to 30 deg BTDC.

Hoop goes into a lot more detail here:

Any more than 30 deg BTDC will cause your engine to overheat...ask me
how I know.
