Hiya Larry,

Before I took the Duck in for painting I took all the windows out.  After 
all, the window seals were 32 years old and some were leaking.  And I wanted 
to get the paint under the seals where rust usually starts.

I wound up getting my seals (the chrome trim type) from Wolfsburg West.  
These things are big honkers.  They look great.  Handling the windshield seal 
was like wrestling a boa constictor.  They haven't been installed yet, but 
they sure do look good.  

And, you are wise to ask about seals.  With seals I have seen the biggest 
variation in quality of any of the VW-related parts.  I ordered window seals 
and trim for my Bug from West Coast Metric.  They have a great reputation for 
their rubber products.  What I got was practically worthless.  The windshield 
seal hardly fit over the seam.  As it is I can see all the clips on the 
inside of the car and the seal is just barely over the seam.  Lousy stuff.
