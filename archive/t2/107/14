Subject: Bus Idles, dies under load

OK, Everybody, I was so proud of my van, I drove it
300 mles to Va Beach without any problems. I get the
stinking thing inpsected and the thing has not run
well since.  It started out with what acted like a bad
vacuum leak.  It would not idle.  It turned out that
the injectors on one side has worked loose from the
intake runners.  Ok, Fixed that.  The thing idles
great.  I even replaced the fuel filter again.

All injectors seem to work, I tested by pulling the
wires to each injector one by one, each time the
engine stumbled until I put it back on.  It revs fine,
idles even, but when put in gear and a load put on it,
it dies.

I am thinking.. spark.  Seem to have fuel, have air,
injectors work.  How to test if the coil is bad?  This
is one thing have not replaced after the bus sat for 6
years.  I seem to remember it being a yellow spark
when I did test it a few weeks ago.

Anybody have any suggestions?  I really am in a fix as
I am 300 miles from home, but at my mom and dads in Va
Beach.  I will go through Bentley in the morning to
see if anything turns up there.

It is really frustrating as it ran great. got 21 miles
to the gallon, never got below 60, even when there
were truck lanes indicating a steep grade yesterday.

Any help would be appreciated.

Mark

PS, it passed inspection with flying colours with
those new brakes.
