Its GONE !  REWARD, 
someone ripped off our 21 window Hippy bus
they had to tow it, it has no motor or windows.

faded blue / white , lots of rust on the roof

you saw it here for sale but then we decided to collect parts and put it 
together for VW Classic  as a ratty runner

cool old Hippie graphics , Get out of Vietnam now and American flags with 
Peace
                                     Symbols
                                a relic for the past.....

It has to be within a few miles of  El Segundo Blvd and Prarie in the city of 
Hawthorne,
