Subject: Hurst Shifter for sale

Hi Volks,

I have a type2 hurst shifter that I picked up for my bus in September.

Unfortunately, building a westfakia has left my bus with a mis-matched 1973
tranny and a 1979 linkage that makes using this shifter impossible for me. I
have decided to sell it and use the $$$ to help pay my way to EveryBus 2002.

There are pics online at:

It shifts smooth and precise, and it looks cool too. If I could get it into
3rd I would keep it for sure, but the only way I could make that happen
right now would 

I want 100 US$, I will accept paypal or you can send a money order by mail.
I can deliver to EveryBus or I will ship by mail.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
