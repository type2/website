Hello Everyone--

Just wanted to thank everyone on this list for all the help and information 
these past few weeks. Tomorrow I am leaving here(Florida) and heading out 
I-10 for California. With my AIRS list in hand and a spare 1 Gallon Fuel 
container I am feeling pretty good about the trip. Hope to see some of you 
out on the road....have a great day...any advice on this route would be 
great....
