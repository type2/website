I have owned both a 71 and a 73 Westy.  My experience with these two buses is that, other than accelation and power, they handled almost identically. Obviously the bigger engine in the 73 is goona give you more power and speed, but the braking, steering, and over-all "driveability" feel exactly the same to me.  Now, it may just be that I just have a better than average 71 and had poorer than average 73?  But after having driven both, I sold the 73 and still have the 71 (the upright engine made the 71 more desirable for me because I am familiar with it. And as always, YMMV (your mileage may vary!)
