Hi Sam,

18 mpg down to 16 mpg is only about 12% difference, so unless there are
other symptoms of a fuel leak you shouldn't yet rule out other possible
causes: bad spark plugs, clogged air filter, vacuum leak, brakes sticking or
just a thief with a siphon. Engine damage could also lead to poor gas
mileage, if it was still drivable it would be less efficient and lead to
poor economy.

I'm not denying that a log is a great diagnostic tool, I keep one myself.
But if you've lost more than a gallon of fuel to a leak you'd have left a
puddle somewhere and the smell would be everywhere, at least until that
gallon had evaporated.

Just don't rule out the other possibilities.

Happy trails,
