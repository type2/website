Mike,
In the 7x busses, the hazard switch is notorious for becoming loose or co=
ming
apart and causing all kinds of fun electrical problems.
It is a phenolic (or celluloid) plastic lid in an aluminum chassis.

A small zip tie does the trick. Fixed the same symptoms on my 74.
Reseat all the connections while you're at it.

Dono about the vanny, but if your hazard switch is a pull-out, remove it =
and
check it out.
