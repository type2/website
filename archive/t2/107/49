Just got a new Brazilian universal case and noticed that the sump tube =
is
not quite verticle.  Has anyone experienced a problem with this such
as getting the oil screen on or anything else that might pop up later.  =
I=20
thought of replacing it with my old tube but it's a bugger to get out.
Thanks,
Greg
