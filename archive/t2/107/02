Subject: Corvair Gas heater in bus?

Anyone out there ever tried to put a Corvair gas heater in their bus?  Anyone advise for or against trying to do this??  P.S.  I'm leaving this afternoon to go pick up my "new" 65 Kombi from Kent, Ohio.  I'm sure I'll be back posting some questions about it tomorrow!
