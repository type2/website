Subject: Lopsided - not firing on all four

This has been going on (intermittently) since the engine was rebuilt.  I have 
a few thousand miles on it now.  It was rebuilt last June, so obviously not a 
daily driver.

I got back the long block and then put everything back on.  

Cylinder #2 appears to be running cold.  It misses and the spark plug gets 
black quickly.  It's worse when cold, but seems to go away (mostly) when hot.

When I first got this engine back, I discovered a crack in the spark plug 
connector (Bakelite?), so I replaced all the spark plug wires.  Still there.

I've switched distributors without any noticeable difference (in fact, it 
seemed better with the 009).

I put in a new coil without any noticeable difference.

I switched spark plugs without any noticeable difference.  Spark plug gap OK.

Put in new points, condenser, cap -- no noticeable difference.

Timing good -- advances OK, either distributor.  Dwell at 50.

Sprayed everything along the respiratory system with ether while idling, no 
change.  A vacuum leak would make things run lean anyway, right?

Valves spot on.  Compression good with no intracylinder differences to speak 
of.

Vacuum gauge shows a steady needle at idle -- about 15 mm Hg., which is what 
I've seen for every 1600 DP I've owned (and that's been since the '70s).

What am I missing?
