Or, it could be that the pilot bearing is dragging.  Same fix, remove
engine and see what is wrong.  If it's the pilot bearing the needles will
likely fall out as soon as the engine is removed.

You _don't_ want the
pilot bearing to lock up completely, as this will make getting the engine
and transmission apart difficult, possible releasing the pilot shaft from
the transmission, another bear of a problem!
