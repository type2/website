Ok, does that mean you still demand that I acknowledge that what you say is 
factual. Or am I off the hook now that someone else has climbed on your 
wagon. 2 against 1, I lose, boo hoo.

Is this before or after you fixed the problem that killed the original 
regulator??

Some new technology is released too soon, before problems have been rooted 
out. Recall what I offered about the current ignition tech. That is an 
example that goes against the rule.  It is a very rare annomaly. But with 
exceptions rare as hen's teeth, more skill and effort means better work. 
It's only an opinion David, don't take it personally.

Stock ist beste. Again, it's just an opinion. Don't take it personally. 
That you do I find childish. That you attempt to coerce me into validating 
your opinion when I have reason to differ I find childish as well.

Electric Circuits 101 (actually, I learned this in HS shop over 30 years ago.)
Resistance equals heat. If there is resistance in the circuit, that portion 
of the circuit which can least take the heat will fry.

That's how points in relays get fried by bad battery cables. Same reason 
why a loose nut at the solenoid can overheat the ignition switch contacts. 
And the same type sources can overload the alternator components, 
overheating the brushes and commutator and diodes. The same reason accounts 
for an overheated starter motor with circuit resistance at the tranny 
ground strap. You need to catch up on some foundation knowledge here, 
David. Poor connections fry components elsewhere in the circuit. It's a 
fact of physics you are going to have to accept least you waste a lot of 
time/money on electrical diagnosis and repair.

Adequate maintenance means all connections are maintained clean and tight 
for low resistance at all times. That's why I say, failure to keep this 
stuff in good order is lack of adequate maintenance and does indeed lead to 
failures. Only the ignorant then bitch at the part that failed and testify 
as fact that the part was the source of the problem. They are so danged 
certain they are right that they demand others to validate their 
conclusion. They can go get a rope and a half rack of beer as far as I am 
concerned.

By definition, the purpose of maintenance is to prevent failure. If 
maintenance is not adequate to prevent failure, it is inadequate 
maintenance. If maintenance is adequate, there is no failure. Again, by 
definition, from Engineering 101.

Now go one step further. Study the wiring diagrams. Key on all wires 
leading to/from the regulator. Trace all circuit and verify clean and tight 
everywhere. Look for evidence of heat stress. The culprits will scream at 
you when you learn to recognize the evidence. A hand glass and good light 
is essential. A lot of this evidence is not apparent to the unaided eye. 
That's why so many miss it and end up with re-do. Corrosion is easy, a 
cracked solder joint is not. It requires more 
time/knowledge/skill/experience to find.
