Subject: Optima charging requirements

Could someone comment as to the correctness of my understanding of the
discussion on regulators?:

1. The original Bosch voltage regulator and generator in my 70 bus will not
provide the proper charging required to properly maintain  an Optima/dry
cell battery.
2. A  solid state regulator will allow an alternator equipped bus (72 and
later) to properly charge a dry cell/Optima.
3. A solid state regulator cannot be used with a generator to properly
charge an Optima.
