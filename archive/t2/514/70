Subject: Torque Wrench & Digital Readout

I definitely want / use a torque wrench that gives a 'click' and slips when 
the dialed-in torque setting is reached.

I use the Harbor Freight 3/8" drive for most everything but the wheel lugs.  
I use it for the CV bolts (24, count - 24!!) where you cannot easily see the 
digital readout, and with the sparkplugs.  BTW, I am resurrecting a '72 
[sans engine access hatch], and when I get the engine in the VW, it will be 
a really bear to torque the spark plugs with a digital read torque wrench.

I also use it, occasionally, when I torque the oil drain plug, and always 
(OK, once..) when I torque the oil screen plate nut. These would be 
difficult to do with a digital read-out torque.

Even on the wheel lugs nuts, it is a pleasure to use the Harbor Freight 1/2" 
drive at 94 ft/lbs. Man, just twist - click, and twist - click...
