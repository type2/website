22mm.

The other place you need this size for sure is the reverse lights switch on
a manual tranny. Not sure of any others.

For the alternator, I find the best wrench to use is a bent ratchet type. I
mean the old school ratchet wrench, the big ones with a toggle on the side
to change directions. This tool is very good for turning the motor over when
doing a valve adjustment. You need the bent style to get at the nut.
