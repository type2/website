"I realize I am displaying my ignorance here...I'm used to it."

Me too Matthew. This thread probably will not go as far as the Great LocTite 
Debates of early Feb., but while on the Hydraulic Lifters I was looking 
through the Archives and could not find what I am looking for.

Dear List,

Although I am the Heir of Superman my Xray vision doesn't seem to penetrate 
the these super German Engine Cases. So how would one establish that an 
engine has Hydraulic Lifters without splitting the case. I am sure this is 
an easy answer for some of you out there. Can it be done? If so how to? Is 
it possible for Matthew to have a '79 2.0L FI and have Mech. Lifters? Those 
POs can do the darnest things. I myself like things to be correct. As my PO 
had an affliction with GEX, Taiwan, China, and parts that would make a 
second rate mexican manufacturer cringe I need my Xray vision back. It will 
be here soon i hope seeing that I am out of Betty Ford for my Mainlined 
Kryptonite Addiction. TIA

Michael Knight

'77 Westy Deluxe el Verde, (Green like the lovely glow of Kryptonite 
aaahhhhh......)
