It's OK ... people learn by asking questions.

In a nutshell, compressed air is blown into the cylinder (locked at TDC 
of the compression stroke) using an air compressor and a special 
device.  This special device knows the volume of air that is being 
pumped in, and thus knows how much backpressure there should be.  Any 
less backpressure represents leakage.  The amount of leakage is 
reported as a percentage; the higher the number, the worse the leakage.

In addition to knowing the leakage, it is possible to determine where 
the leakage is occurring by listening.  If you can hear the air through 
the crankcase breather, you have leakage at the rings.  If you can hear 
the air through the tailpipe, you have leakage at the exhaust valve.  
If you can hear the air through the intake manifold, you have leakage 
at the intake valve.

If you have your mechanic do a leak down test, you generally get a 
report back like:

	#1 - 30% at intake valve
	#2 - 40% at rings
	#3 - 40% at rings
	#4 - 40% at rings

Hopefully your numbers aren't quite as bad as those.

I don't think any engine is 100% tight (0% leakage), although someone 
please correct me if I am wrong.  I seem to recall that 10% leakage is 
generally acceptable running condition for non-rebuilt engines of the 
72-79 vintage (I think I gleaned that from Wilson's rebuild book).
