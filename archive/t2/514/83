Subject: Re: [T2] leak down test

How Michael know I had a '79 2.0L Fi bus is beyond me.  It is the
foster bus...previous/future owner is in the Peace Corp.  The lifters
are noisy as all get out, but they are hydraulic...this is about 11 out
of 10 on my projects right now, as the owner will be gone for another
24 months.

I was just curious about the leak down stuff....

Have a gooday.

I think Michael may be super man with some mind reading powers.
