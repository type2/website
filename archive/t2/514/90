No matter what brand or type of torque wrench you buy, please remember that
when you are finished with it for the day, to unwind the micrometer handle
to relieve the internal spring tension. If you don't relieve the spring
tension the torque wrench will become uncalibrated that much quicker.

Heh, good, glad you're happy with the HF (Pittsburgh) wrenches.  I
ordered the 3/8 and 1/2 models last week.  They were inexpensive[*]
enough that I figured I didn't have much to lose.
 
[*] Perhaps they are also cheap, but I'll reserve that judgment until I
actually put them to use.
