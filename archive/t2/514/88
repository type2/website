Subject: re leak down test

It is my understanding that a leak-down test is not a substitute for 
a compression test. Rather it is the next step after determining from 
a compression test that compression is low in a cylinder. If 
compression is low, that can be because the rings are not sealing or 
because either the intake or the exhaust valve is not sealing.

In a LDT, one injects compressed air into a cylinder through the 
spark plug hole and monitors the decay in pressure on a gauge and 
also by ear.

One builds up a pressure of, say, 100 psi and then observes how much 
of this pressure the cylinder will sustain. If the cylinder leaks, 
then listen and relate the leak to the following:

If it leaks past the intake valve, you'll hear it at your carbs
If it leaks past the exhaust valve, you'll hear a hiss at the muffler
If it leaks past the rings, you'll hear a hiss in the oil filler funnel.
