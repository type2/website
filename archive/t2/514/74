The bumper was changed exactly at the modelyear change
from 1972 to 1973. This must have been in July/August
1972 counting in calendaryears.

So there was no changeover. The dogleg was changed at
the same time from 'no step' to 'with step inside'.

So I suppose there are two front bumpers:

old type: modelyear 1968-1972
new type: modelyear 1973-1979

Vincent
