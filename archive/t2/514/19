Subject: Looking for good or good rebuildable 1.8 heads

My buddy Sid has found a crack in both of his 1.8 heads in the middle of a
rebuild. Does anyone have a set of heads (1.8) they'd like to move along? He
would be most appreciative as he is trying to get rolling for the summer.

Many thanks,

Courtney
