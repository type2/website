Subject: torque wrench $10.

I bought the ten dallor torque wrench at harbor freight. It appears to be a 
sturdy wrench.
I also plan to buy a torque wrench from sears;

It goes from 5lb to 80 lb. I plan to use it for such things as changing the 
oil.
What do you think about this sears torque wrench..
Thank You Very Much
