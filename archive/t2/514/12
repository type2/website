I was rejecting and replacing Wells products and other cheap parts in 91 
when I started my commercial shop. They were available then, not sure how 
long before that. So that's at least 13 years. Somewhere out their are 
Wells units that were replaced back then. I have never seen one with age 
patina so I expect the bulk of them have made it to the land fill some 
years ago. I have replaced several with youthful appearance. And not just 
Wells regulators, but Wells ignition modules, Wells caps and rotors, Wells 
turn flashers, Wells relays....lots and lots of evidence of very low life 
in Wells components generally when used in Bosch systems. My experience 
leads to this advice as to Wells products generally. If you cannot find the 
OEM part, rule out Wells as an acceptable option and you rule out risk of 
failure bigtime. Standard is another brand name to definitely stay away 
from. When it comes to Bosch or VW specs, they haven't got a clue.

Testing is the key. If they were a better item they would have been tested 
and proven as such my the manufacturer and would have been used. Having 
never been professionally tested and approved by those who know best, their 
use involves risk. In such cases, whether they meet OEM specs or not 
remains UNKNOWN.

The assumption they are equal or better than OEM is simply..........risky!!!

I have yet to have a failure out of the box of any OEM part. I won't say 
it's impossible, it just cuts the risk to the bone. And remember, I 
probably put more hours servicing Bosch systems every week than most 
DIY'ers do every year.

It takes more time/money/skill to make a product superior. When comparing 
parts designed to be cheap with those designed to work right, results are 
best insured by which one do you guess??


>>>Stressed by poor connections?  How did you determine that?

By repeat observations of hundreds of failures. It is pure observation of 
the evidence of excessive heat.

I am reporting observations. Melted insulation, frayed wires, tarnished 
fittings, corrosion, porous solder, resin weeping from solder, purdy colors 
on terminals, quicky-cheap terminals, dirty batteries. In every case excess 
resistance building heat at the weakest point in the circuit.

My observations show high failure rates with other than OEM, not to mention 
in too many case not installable without reworking the part. What's a high 
failure rate??? Less then the longevity the OEM parts have proven to provide.

One example: 1959 Mercedes 190, unknown huge mileage. Starter motor 
problem. Found very pitted points in the ignition switch, re polished and 
adjusted, found greasy splices with gobs of solder in wires to the 
solenoid. Looked to me like someone decided to cut the wires rather than 
remove the terminals when jacking up the engine to replace the motor 
mounts. How much did this quicky-cheap compromise to correct procedure save 
in the long run?? Didn't save a danged thing, cost many hundred of dollars 
more than correct procedure by adding to the premature demise of a $500 
starter. Fixed those, then was able to confirm further fault with the 
starter as well. This car had the original Bosch mechanical voltage 
regulator still function nominal. The starter was killed by excess wear due 
to excess heat due to bad repair procedures creating excess resistance. In 
this case, the heat ate the brushes and commutator. That's my professional 
observation and opinion. As I said before, it is rare to find a failed 
starter, alternator or regulator without poor connections (lack of 
maintenance) causing excess stress. The only exceptions are due to 
EXTREMELY long life, at least when comparted to any aftermarket part generally.


>I don't know how we crossed over to alternators...

Mine is a systems approach, just like the designers. To address a single 
item in the system and ignore all the rest is the road to re-do, re-do, 
re-do. Think you have a regulator problem based upon a hunch??? Better 
inspect the whole system before shelling out money for parts, but only if 
you want to spend the least amount of time/money for an actual solution and 
NO time/money at all for re-do.

My Bus is nothing like pretty. It is however extremely safe and reliable 
due to OEM parts throughout and good and full maintenance inspections to 
keep the stresses within OEM operation parameters and wear rates in check. 
I have at least three times the time/money in it than anyone would pay me 
for it. Guess what, it's not for sale. It's largest value to me is in NO 
HASSLE use for very long time/mileage. The key is ATTITUDE. Less compromise 
is better, NO COMPROMISE ist beste.

Whether you see yourself in there or not is simply not up to me, it's up to 
you. It is a general statement and not made with any particular individual 
in mind. I would consider myself STUPID, not ignorant, if I acted on 
assumptions or ate hook line and sinker the claims of a very sharp 
charlatan. Were it not for the ignorant, stupid and greedy, half the US 
economy would disappear.

Very much my motivation as well. My advice is always directed toward least 
possible time/money invested per mile. In my case, that is simply easiest 
to accomplish by spending nothing at all for tow bills or failures of any 
kind. It can be done, but the key is absence of compromise to OEM 
procedures, including necessarily application of the attitude of the OEM 
designers.

I can't see why you have a problem with me giving the opinion that a Wells 
regulator has nothing to do with a solution at all. It adds weakness to the 
OEM robust design. Want a high cost compromise solution?? Dead battery, 
assume regulator issue, buy cheap replacement, fry it in a few months under 
the same excess stresses that killed the OEM part in several years of 
holding up to building excess resistance elsewhere. The root cause was not 
the regulator, but poor maintenance. And you go on to report a problem with 
the OEM part. That is the value of testimony from attitudes allowing 
compromise, or more often, trying to justify compromise to shore up the 
"wisdom" any ego wants to be identified with.

If it does last that long, it will be due to keeping the battery and cables 
and terminals clean and tight via proper maintenance procedures more than 
anything else. I suggest that if the vehicle was properly maintained in the 
first place the failure would simple have not happened in the first place. 
But one example can never be called a data base. When that time comes, 
others will be able to report on failures as well. It wouldn't surprise me 
if a search of the archives would find numerous examples of bad news with 
Wells regulators. But in the end, 30 years of info from all the people on 
this list is not even a pimple on the butt of the OEM engineers actual 
data, as far as empirical testing and proofing is concerned. That is why I 
always advise doing things THEIR way. It is by far the best approach to 
lowest possible cost per mile. Superior results involves MORE 
time/money/skill, not less.

My viewpoint is simply not the same as a Bus owner only. Added to a Bus 
owner's view, mine must provide results to clients who pay for and expect 
proper procedures to be followed by someone with advanced skill and 
experience. What might seem to be small risk for you I will see as 
unacceptable risk for my reputation and business viability. I take the easy 
road to results, NO COMPROMISES at all to procedures that insure RESULTS. 
Guess what?? This is also my owner's view.

As to new technology, even Bosch is failing this one. I replace far more of 
the new electronic coils at over $100 each on late model systems than I 
have ever seen for the earlier coils. 3, 5 or 7 year life, and a 6 cylinder 
has 6 of those coils, one for each cylinder. We are talking $100 or so per 
year just for coil replacement budget for far less than half the life of 
the proven prior technology. I know this, you can assume the plugs will 
last 100,000 miles like the book says if you want, but if you think you 
will be replacing more $20 plugs than $100 coils, guess again. A fine 
example of more time/money/skill invested for inferior results. I key on 
these rare cases where the rule of thumb does not apply. Anomallies like 
this always stand out in professional practice. I consider this very much 
the reason why so many of us prefer the earlier technology in the VW Bus.

Just how many of these new tech designs do you think people 20 years from 
now will be interested in keeping in functional order for continued use??? 
The value of the VW Bus 20 years from now will be that the 
plugs/cap/rotor/points can all be replaced for less than the total cost for 
1 new tech coil. I will opine as well, if the 4th iteration of ignition 
systems doesn't solve this inherent 3rd iteration issue, I sure will be 
glad to have a stock OEM 1st iteration system.

I express no system of my own. I interpret the information given by those 
who know far more than I, and I add to it my observations in actual 
practice. My actual practise confirms THEIR advise, which is why I follow 
it in deference to anyones assumptions, including my own or David's or yours.

Cheaper is better is a fools assumption unless cheaper means apply the 
highest knowledge base given by those who know best and lose never a dime 
to poorer results than OEM provides.

When compromise gives poor results, better results will require more 
time/money, and in most cases, the same amount of time/money it would have 
cost to fix it right the first time added to the cost of the initial 
compromise. You say you don't have enough time/money to do it right the 
first time?? Your budget demands compromise?? If you haven't got the 
time/money/skill to do it right the first time, where you gonna get the 
time/money/skill to do it over????????????
