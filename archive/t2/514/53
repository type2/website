Subject: Exhaust Recommendation 

I'm preparing to replace the heater boxes on my 68' Kombi and I figure this 
would be a good time to replace the exhaust system, too.  I'm looking for 
better breathing w/o making the bus louder.  It's already too loud on the 
highway (I guess that's what happens w/o any soundproofing, carpet, 
headliner, etc...), and soundproofing is the next project.

I don't plan any radical engine upgrades in the near future, just ignition 
stuff (CDI, etc) and possibly a carb upgrade.  Does anyone have a system 
that they recommend?  I was looking around at some of the usual suspects 
web sites and the only site that I saw something on was Bus Boys.  They 
have a "dual quiet muffler system" which appears to fit the bill.

Comments?
