The 122 mains are deffinatley too small.  That will make you run lean once you get above about 2800 rpms.  You will have to go up to 130's. And most likely up to 135's.  The Idles at 60 should be okay but those too might have to be increased to 62's or 65's.  And the 180 air's usally do not have to be incresed.
 
The air by pass screw you are referring too (the little screw next to the larger mixture screw) is for syncronizing the two barrels of one carb.  It allows you to totally dial in each carb.  When you are using your uni-sync, check that both barrels on the same carb, are drawing the same amount of air and if they are not you can open the air by pass screw  to increase the air flow for the barrel that is not sucking as much.

I am rebuilding my dellorto 36mm to go onto our 2.0l bus engine, few 
questions, one is the main jets are 122, the idle jets are 60 or 09 if Im looking 
upside down and the pump jet is 50. If someone has experience what do you think of 
these sizes for a 2.0l engine with a one step up cam, solid lifters and the 
rest stock. Looking for good long runner mostly highway driving. Also my other 
question is, in the book dellorto superfprmance it says to set the by pass 
screw at closed for first install but says nothing about this being adjusted, how 
do you know if you need to adjust this. Thanks Dylan
