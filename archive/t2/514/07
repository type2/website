I know that a late Westfalia (ie. 79) hole was wider & deeper so that
basically the entire roof of the bus was cut out to the drip rails.  My 72
Riviera has a hole cut towards the front & it does not run completely to the
rear of the bus, the bed was built basically on the roof.  I cannot comment
on the 80 but maybe this will start some answer stimulation.
