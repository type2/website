Subject: W: Late Bay Quarter Panel + Engine Hatch

Okay, folks.

There's no getting around my desperation.  I have had a series of
leads that just didn't pan out, so I'm looking to the list to
provide some relief.

I need:
(1) right rear quarterpanel from a late Bay, extending from just
beyond the gas filler _around_ the corner to where it meets the
hatches.  Topmost horizontal line is just below the sliding door
track.  NO cancer, no significant dents.
(2) rear engine hatch, clean and straight.

Items will need to be shipped to Deland, FL.  These two parts are
the _only_ things I need to finish my restoration; I've been
looking for months.  Will pay reasonable amt for each or both
items together.

Help me get my Bus back on the road -- especially now that my
Volvo blew a headgasket!

Thanks,
