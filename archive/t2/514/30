If this is a FI system then you forgot to plug in the lead to the AFM or
the brain after you last worked on it.  If this is a carbed engine then
your main jet is plugged.

If it won't idle but will run with the throttle open it's a vacuum
problem.  If it will idle but won't run at higher RPMs then it is usually
a fuel delivery problem.

Off to play... back tonight!

                             OOK!
