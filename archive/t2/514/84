Matthew,

I believe Green Lantern told me when I was picking up some of that green 
stuff. Up Up and Away! Honestly I think I was confused with a question 
someone asked and questions you had asked. Luck is how i hit the nail on the 
head. I can't read minds but i am faster than a speeding Beetle and I leap 
over a fully extened camper top with a single bound. I even once fell off a 
camper roof and hit my head.

Thanks,

'77 Westy Deluxe el Kryptonite
