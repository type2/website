Subject: Re: [T2] Stuck Heater Cable

Chuck.. good luck!!  One of mine was stuck permanantly to the tube.
The best I could do was to (get ready for this)  clamp vice grips to one end, tie a rope to the vice grips, tie the rope to a tree (or whatever solid standing thing you may have), rev her up, and let out the clutch slowly.  I got the cable out but left pieces of the sheath in there...too many pieces to get the new one through.
If you've tried pulling on your own, you may know that this may be your only hope, and probably will not get all the cable out if it's in bad like mine was.  There's simply no way to do it unless you take the tube out, which is my next step (unweld the spot welds).  I'll probably just get one from a yard and re-weld it in.  The point is, if it's in bad enough to where you can't pull it by hand, you're not gonna get it all out.  
I don't know how you'd get any solution in there with it ON the bus, you'd have to unweld it first, in which case you may as well just get one from a yard too.
In the meantime, I ran the cable along the outside of the tube right next to it and cable tied it a few times.  Works great.  If you don't want to deal with it, just cable-tie the valves totally open for the winter and cut the ties later.
Hope this helps or at least makes you feel not alone, let me know!  -Chris
