Subject: Re: [T2] voltage regulator toasted

Now I'm worried. My 70 Type 2 which I bought new has the original generator
and VR (149,000 miles). I've spent several months redoing the engine (new
heads, case, P&C's, cam, etc. It is pretty stock except for full flow ,
balancing and doghouse. Before installing the engine I noticed a few rust
spots in the battery area. I am refinishing this area for about the fourth
time so I thought why not put an Optima in and forget about future
corrosion. From what you indicate I am in for trouble using my original VR.
Can I in fact install a stock looking solid state VR that will properly
charge my Optima or will this only work with an alternator.
