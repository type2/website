Go to any Bosch authorized parts dealer. Within every ReMan/NewMan starter 
and alternator box is an instruction sheet giving step by step procedures 
for SYSTEM testing. Same is found in the back of all Bosch ReMan/NewMan 
catalogs. Ask them to photocopy the instruction sheet for you. Now you have 
better info than anyone else can provide for PROVING any parts in the 
system before spending money on guesses or hunches or assumptions by you or 
me or anyone else. Very much the same test procedures are given in the 
Bentley. Again, a better solution than listening and picking and choosing 
among the comments on this list from all and sundry including me. If you 
follow those instructions, you don't need me, or anyone else for that 
matter, suggesting otherwise.

Bosch doesn't sell kits for rebuilding alternators. No back yard rebuild 
can in any way enhance their products reputation. How you gonna rebalance 
the stator after resoldering all the segments and turning down the 
commutator, which might be all your unit needs?? Fix that part then how 
long until the next weakest part fails?? Do you want one R&R for another 
20+ years life or 2 or 3?? The odds on you doing a long life rebuild of an 
alternator are remote indeed. The odds on saving time/money with this 
approach are virtually non-existent.
