for some reason your clutch is sometimes not disengaging completly (or
is that engaging). You can try to tighten up the cable a bit and see
if it just isn't moving the fork enough. 

it COULD be what happened to my 66. One of the rivits that is part of
the pressure plate was actually un-riviting itself from the fingers of
the plate. so what was happening was that even though it would move it
wouldn't move enough to completely disengage the engine from the
transmission. It's gotta be in the clutch assembly though. if
adjusting the cable doesn't help any, you must pull the engine. no
other way to see what's going on.
