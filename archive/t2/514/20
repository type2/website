Hi Mike

there is an error in your information I'd like to point out.....  as it
effects Westfalia style propane tanks.
You and I MUST ensure this information is conveyed to mis-informed filling
stations,

The propane Regulations that you speak of DO NOT APPLY to horizontal
permanently installed tanks installed on Westfalia Campers.

If you install a new style OPD valve, <overfilling prevention device > you
will NEVER be able to draw propane out the valve.

Gravity OPENS that OPD <overfilling prevention device >


Do you have a wet vac,,, most of them have a plastic ball in a cage, when
the water level gets high, the ball rises up and plugs the vac motor
inlet,, protecting it from having water drawn thru the motor.
Turn your vacuum over and see what happens,, the ball will not function
properly


The valve in a westy tank is not on the top of the tank
the valve is almost upside down to a standard BBQ style tank valve

The OPD will not work and therefore is not included in the REGS for
horizontal permanently installed cylinders

If  *ANY* service or filling stations indicates this information to you,,
please ask them to read the the regs,,

permanently installed horizontal tanks are exempt from the OPD reg  North
America Wide.
