I believe the 75 and 72 used the same transmission ("002").  So, that's 
fortunate for you.  However, the transmission in the 76-79 ("091") is a 
better transmission.

If you get a transmission of the other type, at the very least you need 
to get a new flywheel and clutch of the correct size (the bell housings 
are different).  The Type2 library should have more info.
