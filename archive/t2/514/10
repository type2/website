Subject: Rear window defroster relay

Hey all
could someone explain something to me. I read
somewhere where the relay for the rear window
defroster for, 68 and up, was in the engine
compartment........well I have seven vans, I got for
parts but have a couple 68's that i hate to cut
up...........and need to sale......anywho out of all
those four have rear window defrosters and I cant find
a relay in any of them in the engine
compartment.........is the relay actually in the
switch itself.......? I cant even find a relay on the
electrical schematics............for the rear window
defroster..........thanks everyone
