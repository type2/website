Subject: Re: [VB] faux flip top westy, Dormobile top for Sale

There's is a guy down in the Monterey area turning his 63 bus into a flip 
top, or so he said he intended to when I sold him a spare flip hatch.  

When installing a flip hatch, you also oughta have the wooden bows around the 
hatch top, which help support the hatch area. I just happen to make them 
(blatant shameless plug)

FWIW the flip hatch was the door in the roof westy made before they did pop 
tops.   You under the hatch and flip it open.  It is rectangular, on the side 
by the cargo doors, It has two hinges, and then rest it on the other side of 
the roof.  

 some people think it's so you can stand up in the bus to put the trousers 
on, some think it's so that girls can sit on the roof and smoke cigarettes. I 
think they were used through 64 ish.   

Someone said he drove with his open a notch on a hot day.   (there is a prop 
rod that you can hold it a tad open instead of flipping it all the way over)
