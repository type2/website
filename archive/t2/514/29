James Hayden and I have already been over this a couple of times.

Fair enough.  Let me rephrase that - "It does a more consistent job of 
keeping MY batteries charged than MY stock regulator did".

>>It takes more time/money/skill to make a product superior.

Not always true.  Some products are superior by virtue of more modern 
technology, and often they are simpler and less expensive to produce at the 
same time.  Do you think that parts designed in the '60's are the best that 
ever were and will be?  Please.  Better tell John(-at-)aircooled not to sell any 
more Mallory distributors (or SVDA) as they are not stock, and therefore 
inferior according to you.

Dodge - That does not explain how or why the regulator failed.

An extreme generalization.

Again, you did not explain how spliced wires, etc. caused the starter to fail.

I disagree - I think it improves the OEM design.

A totally contrived, meaningless scenario.

Failures happen, even in the best-maintained vehicles - to believe 
otherwise is to be ignorant.  I would like to think that the vast majority 
of the members of this list care enough to properly maintain their busses 
and minimize (not eliminate) failures.  I can tell you that my battery 
cables are all clean and did not contribute to regulator failure.

*sigh*.  I never said cheaper is better.  You are dodging my legitimate 
questions and putting words in my mouth - I think it's time for me to throw 
in the towel on this subject.  I am keeping my Wells regulator though.  I 
will keep your bad experiences with other Wells parts (useful information, 
that) in mind and if the Wells ever fails me I will look for another 
solid-state, modern regulator (Bosch?) to replace it.
