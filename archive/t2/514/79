since this is a 79 w/ 2L it should have hydraulic lifters. Was the
compression test done with the engine warmed and all lifters pumped
up? this can affect the compression test outcome. A leak-down test
would be a good idea after a rocker arm inspection. Then if all this
tests out as the #3 still bad you can think about pulling the engine
and looking at that head.
