Subject: LP Tank

Anyone know off hand how long the LP line from the tank to the stove on a 76
is?
Went to get my tank filled and checked at a local RV shop today and found out
my regulator is leaking and my shut-off valve does not work.  :-(
So now I'm researching options....
The local RV shop quoted about $35 for regulator $50 for valve and $90 labor.
Gowesty has a new tank with valve and regulator for $289 + $20 required
adapter + $20 shipping (my guess) which they say I can easily install myself.
Apparently new EPA rules prevent a lot of shops from filling the old tanks
(lack of a auto stop valve).
So anyway... Thought while I'm in there I might as well replace connections,
etc. too.  Found this place that sell hoses but wasn't sure of the length.

Any wisdom appreciated....
Thanks,
