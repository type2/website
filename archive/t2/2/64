The aux. air valve is easy to check.  When the engine is completely cold (like 
over night), pull a hose off of it and try to blow through it.  It should flow 
freely.  Then, after warming up (within 5-7 minutes of driving), you should not 
be able to blow through it at all.  These things get gummed up and stuck 
sometimes.  I've had very good luck disassembling and cleaning them (beats 
forking out the $$ for a new one).

The other thing I'd check up front is the head temp sensor that is screwed into 
the head near #3 spark plug.  On a completely cold engine you should have 1500 
- 2500 OHMS resistance.  That should drop fairly quickly into the 300 - 500 
range and then go as low as 75 on a really hot engine.

I've got D-jet FI on both my bus and my 914 so they're completely different 
animals than your L-jet system, but on both of them I've had to install a 300 
OHM resistor between the temp sensor and wiring harness to richen things up a 
bit.  Without the resistor, both engines lean-hunt really bad and the 914 was 
almost non-drivable until it warmed up.
