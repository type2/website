Subject: fuel filler neck and hose needed

I have a couple of  questions about replacing the hose that goes between
the tank and metal fuel filler pipe and
the rubber peice you see when you open the gas cap. The hose is a couple
inches across and I have not
been able to locate anything locally to replace it with. I also need the
filler(neck?) the rubber peice you see
when you open the gas cap. I did see Ron had maybe this for sale on his
site,but that was listed for a regular fuel
bus. Is there a difference between the leaded and unleaded tank setups?
I have a 78 that was orig. from California.
Could I use the one Ron has listed? All replies welcome.
Thanks,
Bill
