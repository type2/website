Subject: RE: Installing VDO oil pressure sender on Type 4 engine?

Sorry all, I got the answer from the supplier of the VDO.  He recommends
installing a 1/8NPT adapter into the engine case hole, a 4" extension pipe,
and a "Y" adapter into which I can insert the original "dummy light" sender,
and the new VDO sender.  It also seems that I needlessly ordered the nylon
tubing kit (for a mechanical sender/guage) since my sender and guage are
electric.  Live and learn.  Off to the hardware store!

VDO oil pressure sender and guage for it.

sender goes, a tubing that connects the sender to the guage which is mounted
in the dash.  My problem is the following: the tinware hole above the oil
pressure sender hole is too small to accomodate the VDO sender.  How do
people resolve this problem?
