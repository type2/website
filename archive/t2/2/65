The titles I have on three 81-83 Westfalias list them as 3500 pounds.
Trannys last a long time, I replaced one at 195K.
I've got an 81 manual tranny Westy and the tranny has 91 K on it and it
shifts smooth as butter. Much better than the other 4 speeds I've got.
4 speed manual trannys for 80-83 Aircooled are hard to find and even used
can run $500.00, rebuilts with an exchange as much as $1000.00, core
charges if you've got a bad case or bad ring and pinion set can be as
much as $450.00.
Make sure the tranny is good or take $600.00 off the price the seller is
asking.
