Subject: My '77 Westy Project

Hey Folks,
    Work continues on the '77. I have most of the glass back in. =
Tomorrow I am repainting the upper half of the sliding door that I =
scratched while trying to install the jalousie widow last weekend, then =
I'll try the window again. I've gotten a couple of replies on how to get =
these windows back in, so hopefully they'll go in OK this time. FWIW, =
with the other glass talcum powder spread around the seal and the =
opening does seem to make the glass go in easier-messy too, but at least =
it smells good. I have also refinished all the wood panels, the one that =
runs down the wall behind the sink cabinet, the rear hatch, and the =
sliding door. The "veneer" had worn away on mine, but the panels were =
otherwise in good shape. I sanded them down to bare wood with 220 grit =
paper and stained them then coated with a clear poly-they turned out =
great. I was also able to reattach the white plastic strip that goes on =
the rocker of the sliding door by heating it up with a heat gun to make =
it soft, put it back into place, and held it there 'til it cools and =
becomes hard again ( I wore my welding gloves for this, it does get =
HOT!). I also found Mother's Mag Wheel and Aluminum polish will make the =
curtain tracks look like new. Under the (new) carpet I have a new 11/32" =
 plywood base, with a 1/8 inch hardboard surface over that just under =
the carpet. This was as close as I could come to duplicating what was =
there originally, which was rotted and black with mildew. Whew, there is =
a lot to restoring one of these things! I'm never selling this one! New =
canvas is on order as well. I still don't have any good pics up yet of =
the new paint, but I'll try to get some this weekend. Take care, Jeff

PS- Anyone know of any upcoming bus events/campouts within 300 miles of =
the DC area? I can't find any info on Buses By the Bay or Buses By the =
Trail.
