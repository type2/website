Shoot, Nikki, sorry to hear it. Anybody on the good side of The Big Muddy
would do themselves a favor and get their engine from NW Con Rod in
Seattle. You don't get ANY of this type of junk from them. Pay Jerry his
price. Get a By God spec motor with German bearings and Mahle pistons with
quality machine work and rote, proven, procedures. No flaws. No pulled
studs, always new. This guy is not your typical Californicated used part
assembler. Tell him I sent you.

Sorry also to hear your mechanic had to try 3 sets of manifolds before
discovering the bad ports. Man alive, get that guy a hand glass.
