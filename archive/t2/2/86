Hello All!

     I'm getting ready to leave for Colorado on Wed. the 8th. I'll be in
Denver on the 9th then on the night of the 10th head towards the RMMW
show, the morning of the 1th head back up to denver, for the Bandemere
show, So if any listee's see's a White bus, with vanagon alloy wheels,
with a brown engine lid, with chrome bumpers, with 2 chrome tail pipes
sticking striate out the back, with Idaho plate's, and with possibly a
bra on, wave because it's probably me.

Thanks,
Shawn Reed
