Subject: Deal on Brake Rotors!

Just a quick note that I have obtained a small quantity of European made
(Brembo) brake rotors for '73-79 Busses from the bankruptcy liquidation of a
brake parts wholesaler.  They are $34.95 each, which is below the usual
WHOLESALE price. I only have 20 available at this price.  Part number 211
615 301B.  You can order toll-free, or via the website.
