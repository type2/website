It's still Friday on the west coast, so I guess I'm OK with this.

On my recent 1100 mile trip through four states on expressways, state
highways, in big cities and small towns, I did not see so much as ONE air
cooled VW of any model on the road. Imagine my disappointment as I drove,
hand poised over the horn button, ready to sound a greeting to my fellow
travelers only to find that none came my way. As a matter of fact I only saw
a half-dozen a/c beetles (all parked and none looking roadworthy) and one
bus. The bus was parked in a sea of weeds and showed years of neglect but
was identifiable as an early 70's Westy.

(If anyone's interested, it's a pea-green bay window with a white poptop
sitting in a yard on US 12 between Romulus and Saline, Michigan. South side
of the road.)

Just wanting to whine,
Dave
