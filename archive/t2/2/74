Subject: VW Love!

I haven't been able to drive my beloved 73 transporter for two weeks because
I had been troubleshooting an electrical problem, I finally broke down and
took it to my local mechanic, which made me feel like a horrible person for
giving up, but I think the bus forgave me. Anyhow, I just got her back, I
can't believe how much I missed just driving her around town, a lot of
people looked at me weird when I hugged my car in the parking lot, but I
guess that is a little strange...  Anyhow, no one else understands, and I
needed to tell someone how great it feels! Keep on keepin on everyone, and
thanks to everyone for being such a great group!
