Subject: Wendelin update

Well, it looks like Wendelin's gonna break a year in the shop. My VW
mechanic had the manifold remachined per AVP's instructions, and that
didn't fix the exhaust leak. Now my mechanic says the ports are fried on
the head from an old exhuast leak from its past life. AVP says it's the
manifold(s) -- we've tried three. Now I'm out the machine shop costs.
I'm a little frustrated, and of course I go off on this internal tangent
about professional integrity and pride in workmanship and I coulda
rebuilt the engine myself (even as a first-timer) by now.

The good news is she'll be safe in the shop while I'm out of town for
the next two weeks. Wouldn't want the city hassling her, parked on the
street. She's a bit dusty.

The bad news I guess I'm gonna have to get tough with AVP. I'm thinking
I want them to replace the head under warranty. They were resistant last
time I suggested this option. Argh.

We'll get it handled, it's just frustrating. I miss my bus!

P.S. My friend Andrea is letting me park the 69 Euro-Westy in her
driveway while I'm gone. Yay! I better bring her back something nice.
