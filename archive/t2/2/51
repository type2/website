Subject: Charging Probs. & Attempted Fix

Oh-Tay Volks,

This was the situation,  Alternater was frying my bat. w/ 18volts to batt 
and fuse panel.  So me and Dave Martin says, Voltage reg!  Dave M. says "use 
mine, I'm not needing it right now".  So I unplug his and hook it up to 
Janis....No juce except what the batt. supplies.   So....
I try retrofitting a Gen. from a '71 bug, (which dosen't fit right, but darn 
it I wanted to go to High Country bus fest)  but still no chargeing, never 
did polorize but I'm frustrated and depressed about not making it to High 
Country and give up!

Any sudgestions and/or words of encouragement.  I'm in Landrum SC, first 
exit inside SC from NC on I26.  Desperatly need to get Janis running seeing 
how she's the only legal ride I have at the mo and am unemployed needing to 
be employed and so broke I can't make child support payment this week!

I'm begging here VOLKS!
