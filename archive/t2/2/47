Subject: Archives are broken

All,

The archives at type2.com are broken.  I have not yet installed the
search software and re-indexed the archives since the move to the
new server.  I hope to get to this sometime this weekend - I'll send
another announcement to the list when it's ready.

The Web reflectors for both mailing lists are working fine.  Ken Hooper
saw to those promptly.  :)

Thanks!

Matt Roberds
