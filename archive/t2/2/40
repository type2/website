Very simple solution, they make a converter that you can buy at Walmart that
converts the seporate turn light into combined for the trailer, just follow
the directions.

I pulled the back off the lights, bought some double spades at the auto
parts store and came directly off the back of the bulbs where the wires
hook.  You can put the covers back on when you are finished.  Just lay the
wires inside the engine lid and run your pigtail out under the lid.  When
you're not pulling the trailer, lay the pig tail in the engine compartment.
