Turn the mixture adjustment screw in while counting half turns till you hit
bottom. Note number of half turns. Believe me, counting half turns is much
easier than whole turns. Now you will always be able to reset it to what it
was. 

If it's been two years since it was set, does that mean the plugs are 2
years old?? I would inspect them anyway to see if they look black and
confirm rich running. If they look young, clean and descent, fine.
Otherwise, blackness or wear of 0.1 mm on the electrodes means new spec plugs.

Change your oil. It can give off fumes that spike the charts. Clean oil can
make a difference on the meter of 2% CO if the old oil is absorbing fuel
from a lot of short run driving. Smell it. If you can smell gas in the oil
and it seems a bit thin, change it and you then may pass.

When that's all good, the mixture is enrichened when turned in, leans out
as you screw it out.

If you give it 4 half turns in and the rpm doesn't rise, something else is
wrong. Likewise, if you turn it out 4 half turns and the rpm doesn't drop
some, look for a prob elsewhere. 

Verify that ignition before touching the fuel system. If the points are 2
years old as well, regap them and reset timing before fueling with the fool
system. If you got electronic, verify spark energy at the plug gaps. Hot
blue snap. Ignition modules and Hall sensors of 20 years age have served
their life and get weak. I replace far more modules and coils on electronic
systems, far more than the cost of points with coils that last 30 years
many times.

But first of all, verify that you haven't got a cylinder losing
compression. 'Member what was done up above?? Do it when the plugs are out.
Look at your last three documented compression tests and compare with this
one. See any trends?? That's why you do these test. So you can note when
something is weakening and plan ahead to fix it at your leisure with known
budget, or sell it before it gets noticeable to a novice.

Always verify in this order. Mechanicals, ignition, fuel. In other words,
FOLLOW BENTLEY. It's the only way to be sure you don't waste time/money on
things guessed at but not causing the problem.

Verify the maintenance since the last smog test. Anything due or past
due??? I mean, according to BENTLEY, the maintenance section. Maintenance
really is first. If that doesn't clean things up, then 1. Mechanicals. 2.
Ignition System. 3.Fuel Delivery System. Any step you skip could be the one
that identifies the culprit and you will miss it and waste time/money.

Bottom line, a little bit rich or lean can be caused by a whole lot of
things. Keep notes. Write down everything. A 0.99 cent spiral pad will do. 

You can swag all you want at it, Barry, but if you want to insure results
you can't just poke screwdrivers at it. That just adds up to waste in the
long run no less so than daily lottery tickets.
