I know what the door jamb GVW says. 
My GVW says 5370 on the door post.
I'm telling you what my titles say.

Guess somebody should spend two hours emptying their Westy and pay $2.00
to get it weighed.
Personally I know mine changes weight  every mile I drive and every soda
pop I drink.

The titles I have on three 81-83 Westfalias list them as 3500 
 pounds.
 
Gee, that seems really low to me.  I'd guess my 82 is closer to 4500 
 than
 3500, maybe even more.
