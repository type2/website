Hi Robert,

I ran into the same problem when I tried installing an oil pressure sender 
in my '79.  I solved it by using a 4" length of brass pipe and a 90* elbow.  
The pipe gets the sender above the tin and the distributor, and the 90* 
elbow rests the sender against the dizzy so it doesn't flop around -- if you 
just let the sender sit free above the engine, it will act as a pendulum as 
the engine vibrates, and will eventually elnarge the hole in the case and 
leak.

The sender has tapered NPT threads, so it will mate with standard pipe 
threads.  I believe it's 1/4" diameter, but bring the sender to the hardware 
store just to be sure.  You need to thread the pipe in without using pipe 
tape, since the sender has to ground to the case, but if you tighten 
everything down well it should work fine.

Good luck!

Hi all
I am completing the re-assembly of my type 4 engine (73 Bus) and bought a
VDO oil pressure sender and guage for it.
The kit comes with a sender that screws into the place where the original
sender goes, a tubing that connects the sender to the guage which is mounted
in the dash.  1. enlarge the tinware hole?
2. install some kind of pipe fitting extension in the oil pressure sender
hole to that the sender sits above the tinware?
I was thinking of doing something along the lines of option 2, but will
welcome any suggestion of how to best do this.  Thanks!
   --Robert
