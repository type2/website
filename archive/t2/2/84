Subject:  [T2]  new inventory, thermostats, and free shipping


Hey folks,

A shop in our area has unfortunately gone out of business and we are,
fortunately getting our hands on more bus stuff, new and used. The word is
that there are a few good thermostats kicking around. I have a few promised
to folks, but should have some left over. No pushing now, one at a time. Who
needs one, who cannot live without one?

It will take us a while to sort all this stuff out. We are a strong
supporter of the list and have a ton of great new, used, and rebuilt parts
just waiting to find a home in or on your bus. Help us become the place for
1968-1979 bus parts, order or request your part from our on-line catalog
today. Because bay window buses are all we do!

Remember we currently have free shipping on all engine parts. Just select
type 2 for your shipping type and only a $3.00 handling charge will be added
to your order. Thanks again!
