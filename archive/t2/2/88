Volks,

Thursday evening, I responded to a question on how the rockers get lubed
with the answer that they are basically splash lubricated.  The following
p-mail from Robb chased me down to the basement to look at some parts I
have down there in boxes.

Sure enough! What a neat system and I have been looking at its bits for
decades without even suspecting its existence. The oil gets pumped to the
bore for the lifter, out thru the lifter, up the pushrod, thru a passage
in the rocker and to the rocker bearing.  Fascinating!
