This was not a good solution for me when I installed FI in my '72 Westy.  It
created a vapor lock nightmare when the car idled for 5 minutes or so.

The  fuel would get hotter and hotter while it recirculated through the "T"
connection, vaporized and the van would die and not start until it cooled
down.  In a normal FI set up the return line goes back in to the tank and
cools off. It took week and some good direction from the list to detect the
problem.

I resolved this by putting in another fuel line connection on the top of my
tank just behind the sender.  Not pretty but it is safe and it works.
