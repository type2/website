Case = "engine case."

First, remove any rear tin that may impede the engine's moving back. Stick
some sort of engine support device with wheels on it under the middle of
your engine; make sure the engine is firmly planted on it. Crawl under the
Bus and look at where the engine and transmission meet. There are four bolts
that hold them together, two on each side. Remove the four bolts and shove
the engine back.
