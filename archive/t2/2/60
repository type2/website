Subject: Re: [type2] Jalousie Window Install Question

Corners hitting?

I had to use a friend to pull down on the outside of the frame while I got 
some screws in the bottom row - don't tighten...

Then pushed in at top to start top row...

Then tightened them all in a criss-cross pattern.

Make sure that you are putting them in right so the knobs at the front or 
the rear - where ever you prefer.

If they aren't right - swap the left for the right side and go again.

I used silicone spray and a plastic knife.

I also replaced the OEM screws with tiny (same size) stainless steel screws 
purchased at LOWE's hardware.

Looks nice and no corroded screw heads.

If it makes you feel any better, I scratched the hell out of my sliding 
door too.

The second window was easy!

Good luck.
