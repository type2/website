Subject: Fuel Tank Question

I plan to install a complete 1978 L-Jetronic fuel injection system into my
74 loaf. I was able to purchase everything from the donor with exception of
the fuel tank. I currently have a non-FI tank that I; cleaned, etched, and
polymer coated. I would like to be able to keep this tank, but as read
through the archives there seems to be no other optons aside from brazing a
fuel return port into my current tank or purchasing a used good used FI
tank. I am going to throw out a couple of ideas to the "Bouncing Wall": #1
Could I possibly run the fuel return line to one of the top vent ports on my
tank? #2 Would it be possible to add a T-fitting to the standard fuel port
on the bottom of the tank? I've tried Miller Fuel Injection (thanks Mark)
and
they offer a sump kit which is a little cost prohibitive at $149.
