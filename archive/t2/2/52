You didn't say if you are carbed or fuel injected.  Can't help without that bit 
of info.

3 and 4 are most likely related.  I'd be willing to bet your rubber engine 
mounts are torn in two.  The number 1 cause of torn engine mounts is putting a 
jack under the engine and raising the bus with it.  Don't do this (unless you 
really enjoy replacing engine mounts).  They're pretty cheap and replacement 
only takes an hour or two.
