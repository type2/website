Greeting list,

 Once again, I have something sad to inform everyone. Todd Norman passed
away yesterday and  I found out this morning. At least he is no longer in
pain, the cancer had really wreaked havoc with his body.

 There will be a prayer service on Sunday evening at the St. Francis of
Assisi Church in Oklahoma City followed by a mass at 10 am Monday. Smith and
Kernke on NW 23rd street are handling the funeral.

 At this years JRMC, we will have a tribute to Todd as well, This years JRMC
will be held next month and details will follow.

Art Long
