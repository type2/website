Subject: re: Vanagon bike rack

<<Hi Volks,

Anyone have a good design for a 2 bike rack for the
back of a Vanagon?  Or do you have a Vanagon bike rack
for sale?  I understand the Paulchen is considered by
some the best, are there any racks that compete with
it?  Thanks.

The Fiamma is an excellent choice.  Much lower priced than the Paulchen and 
you can equip it to hold fat tube bikes.  Vanagon rack is $250 plus shipping.
