Subject: Friday! - Bus Relationship

Hi Folks,

Thanks to all who offered their advice on my oil pressure woes.  It's 
amazing how a $7.95 part can cause so much trouble, but I guess that's to be 
expected with the close tolerances of VW engines.

As I've been worrying and working these past several days, I've been 
thinking about the relationship that has developed with my Bus.  You folks 
who are going thru full restorations or repeated troubleshooting know what I 
mean...  My Sweet Pea takes a lot of money and a lot of time, but the 
rewards seem worth it after just a few miles of traveling with her.  There's 
something about the relaxed pace combined with the hardworking powerplant 
that makes for a driving experience unlike any other.  Add to that the great 
design and styling, and the Bus ends up being VERY unique.  It's nice that 
there are others out there who enjoy keeping these beautiful, nerve-wracking 
machines as a part of our reality.

Thanks again.
