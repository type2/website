I am going... That is, if the new paint job gets done
in time! What a close call! I'll be in a '73 Westy.
The bottom half will be a freshly painted Indigo Blue.
The top half will be White. Do you know when
registration starts & How to register? I've never been
to a show...
                                    Thanks,
                                    Paul Deatherage
