Subject: Oil Pressure Woes

Hi Folks,

I've been dealing with some oil pressure woes recently, and am at my wits' 
end as to how to fix the problem.

It all started last week when I installed a NAPA 1088 oil filter on my 1979 
2.0L Type 4 engine.  Oil pressure began to get lower with each successive 
running until it was around 15psi at 4,000rpm, 240* oil temp, and full-load. 
  It used to be 25psi under those conditions.

I put another NAPA filter on today; this one is specifically rated for the 
1979 Type 4 engine.  Oil pressure is up somewhat, but is not as good as it 
used to be.  I'm also running Castrol 20W-50 oil to try to help things.

So, short of rebuilding my engine, is there anything I can do to improve my 
oil pressure?  Will a new oil pump help?  Will an external oil cooler help?  
Does any place sell SAE-50 oil?  Can I run SAE-80 trans oil??

Thanks for any help,
