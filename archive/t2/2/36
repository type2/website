Greetings,

This theoretical question has been driving me crazy for the last two weeks
and between problems with my mail server and the list's problems, this is
the first chance I've had to ask:

On a type 2 engine, how does oil circulate to the rocker arms?

My best guess is that the excess flows back to the crankcase through the
push rod tubes via gravity. Correct?

But how does it get out there and how does it get into the rocker arm
bearings where I would guess it's most needed?

Prespiring minds want to know!
