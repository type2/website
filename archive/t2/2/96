Subject: Oil cooler leaks?

How can I tell if an oil leak is coming from the oil cooler, or something
else?
It only leaks while running, or right after being shut down. Engine is an
1800 type 4.
The oil seems to be coming from above the oil filter which makes me think
it is the cooler. I put a new one on before putting the engine in. Maybe
i didnt tighten it up?

Does it sound like this could be my problem?
Ed
