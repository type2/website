Tom.. you are getting some really good readings for instruments like that...
you can also shoot the temps from underneath.. and if you pick a spot along
the oil galley near the rear of the engine.. you can get an idea how hot
that area is ..

My opinion is ... that engine is running cooler than many I have checked ,,
mind you I check them while we are pushing hard to get to somewhere ..
usually in a carabus .. I take a few minutes to compare similar vehicles
that are driving the same speed on the same roads...  there is usually a
difference between the T1 engines. and the T4 engines..  but there is sooo
many other differences like load, and trans gearing,, etc etc.. that I have
always considered them to be pretty even..  380 deg plus or minus 50

here is a picture that sort of shows the heat in an aircooled.... you might
want to take your ignition coil temps for interest sake. I know it has
nothing to do with head temps...
