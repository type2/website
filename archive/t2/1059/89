Subject: 12volt cooking accessories?

This website shows a whole lot of 12v powered cooking/camping products from RoadPro. I'm thinking that if one was using the stove while driving, the drain on the battery would not be much, and you'd have something warm ready to go, when you pull over? My 77 Westy doesn't have the lovely amenities of the newer rigs :-)
