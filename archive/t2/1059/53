The only difference in the plug to the alternator is that the wires were
"sealed" in a boot-like shield that is integrally molded to the plastic
plug.  Otherwise a 55 Amp Harness will work - just plop "rubber goop" on the
existing plastic plug.

I now make and sell 72-79 Bus replacement alternator harnesses minus the
plugs.  Can't get those anymore new, so you have to use yer old ones.  All
wires correctly colored as per original.  $49 including Priority Mail
anywhere in the USA, Alaska and Hawaii.  $10 more to Canada Priority Mail
International (formerly Air Parcel Post).  Paypal accepted.  Getting ready
to upload an ad to Samba on these pretty soon.
