Subject: Road Salt and Salt Spray on Roads

Anyone have any information on what the newer methods of salting roads in
winter mean for old Buses.  I live in Connecticut and would keep my 71 off the
road once I started seeing sand and salt crystals on the road and keep it
garaged until the beginning of April.  The new method of keeping the roads
from freezing is to spray a salt solution and no sand which means that you
don't easily notice when the roads have been sanded and if it was time to park
my bus for the winter.  Yesterday I say trucks on the road spraying the
solution.  Is the new method less toxic that the old  sand and rock salt
method as far as 1970's vehicles are concerned?
