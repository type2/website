Hi Michael, I think this knob maybe the one to power the "rear cabin roof
light" (for want of a better description). In my bus it's a "master switch".
Unless I pull out the knob on the dash, the rear light cannot be turned on.
I only discovered this because the guy that examined my bus for "road-worthy
certification" (as we call it here) was familiar with buses and told me what
it was for.
