Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Woodstoves in your bus

I have seen a couple of split window busses which used wood burning 
stoves for heat.  One bus was used for ice fishing and had holes cut 
in the floor and used lawn chairs for the front seats.  A nice wood 
burning stove sat behind the drivers seat.  That was a really cool 
bus, even had a pull starter on the engine in case of battery or 
starter problems.
