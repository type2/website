Subject: Re: [T2] breaking generator straps/misaligned pulleys

The GR17X Generator requires the *VERY Hard to Find* 211 903 109 Generator
Pulley with the cast iron half.  This pulley accomplishes the proper
"set-back" to properly align the belt to the crankshaft pulley.  Having
owned a '69 and a '71 in the past (way, way back), I became very much aware
of this problem when replacing the belts far too often.  Using a Bug 12V
pulley just doesn't work well with the GR17 because it is a bit longer than
the GR15 (Bug) variety.

Busted Bus in Colorado or Way Out Salvage in Arkansas are two possible
source for this pulley or check out the Samba Classifieds - you might get
lucky there.
