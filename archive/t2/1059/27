Subject: Re: Breaking generator straps/misaligned pulley

Thanks for the replies, first of all, I don't believe that the backing plate is the issue as everything was fine before I took out the (original?) generator and broke the outer half of the pulley with the puller.  Not enough penetrating catalyst!  I replaced the pulley with the El Cheapo brazilian one from busdepot when I got the new generator.

So...anybody got a 211 903 109 pulley they'd like to sell me for less than the $94 busdepot wants?  It doesn't have to look nice...

Thanks,

Blake
