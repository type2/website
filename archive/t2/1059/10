I've taken the injectors off before and set up a test rig that mirrored 
the bus' fuel rail.  I just pulsed them on and off into clear tubes to 
see how much they flowed.  I've also flowed them backwards to flush 
stuff out - I don't think there's really much more you can do.

If you want to really pulse them, you can get a megasquirt and hook it 
up.  It has a testing mode and you can tell it to pulse injectors and 
stuff like that.  Haven't tried it, but it could be kinda need to mess with.
