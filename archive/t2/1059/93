Don't be fooled into thinking that "stove" will work like a
conventional oven.B  I bought one a few years ago at a truck stop and
it took over 45 minutes to warm up a slice of pizza.B  If you have
hours and hours to wait, it might be okay for heating a frozen
burrito.

> This website shows a whole lot of 12v powered cooking/camping
products from RoadPro. I'm thinking that if one was using the stove
while driving, the drain on the battery would not be much, and you'd
have something warm ready to go, when you pull over? My 77 Westy
doesn't have the lovely amenities of the newer rigs :-)
