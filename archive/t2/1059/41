I've heard others say they did this too, with similarly good results. 
Something you could do to reduce the voltage slightly to the starter is 
to add some wire to the starter circuit.  An 8-foot loop of 4 or 6 gauge 
would drop the voltage at the starter under load slightly and reduce the 
risk of burning it out.  You'd want to experiment to make sure the wire 
does not overheat.  If it was my bus I would shoot for 8-9 volts at the 
starter while cranking.

I did this same thing to reduce the voltage to the scooter-powered air 
brake on our 24hoursofLeMons car last month to keep it from burning 
itself out.  You can see the wire loop in this picture:

We thought about entering a bus, but believe it or not, someone had 
already done that!  There was a Baja bug in our race though - it lasted 
half a day before throwing a rod.  :-)
