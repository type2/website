Subject: Re: 12volt cooking accessories? 

Hmmm...

Long ago in a galaxy far far away, during the travels I used a sterno  
stove for heating my coffee pot or soup.  I didn't drive while using  
it though.

The 12 volt stuff is always lesser than advertised.  But then there is  
the 12 volt coffee warmer on a cord.  That little dude ain't bad at  
all.  Its just a coiled piece of stainless steel with a little plastic  
handle.  If you plugged it in the lighter hole, dropped it in a pot of  
soup, and put the pot on a tray with a lip, and put the tray in the  
floorboard it would probably be boiling in just a while.  The heat,  
sitting in liquid, has no where else to go, other than to the soup.

It would work fine for liquids, but it might be a bit impractical to  
think about driving and cooking anything else.  That's why God created  
convenience stores and honey buns...or granola snacks.  Whichever one  
might prefer.

Rambling less in more ways than one,

Merry Christmas everyone.
