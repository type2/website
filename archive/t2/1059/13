Hey y'all
There IS a bus in the background so I hope this meets the stringent list 
standards.  Found a 1978 Toyota Corrolla with 15021.7 miles.  That's 
right fifteen thousand twenty one and seven tenths miles.  I now believe 
all the stories of the little old lady cars found in barns, under tarps, 
and in the woods.
