Jamie, good to hear from you.  Got any snow up there yet?  I'm with 
you, that ice fishing bus was really cool.  He came to one of our 
shows in Kansas City a few years ago.  I didn't realize he had a 
telescoping chimney, that's really inventive.  I think ice fishing 
would be interesting, but I can't imagine a 3 week ice fishing 
vacation!  I would like to see that bus again, and check it out a 
little closer.

I was thinking having a wood stove in a bus would be pretty neat for 
some of the winter camping events such as your "Busses By The Corn" 
in Canada or "Freeze Your Bus Off" here in midwest.  And I think the 
guys that do the Shasta trip also camp during the run.

The site with the boat wood stoves was really cool.  Most of us 
around here use the little propane heaters in the bus for overnight 
heat keeping a window cracked a inch or so but a wood stove would add 
so much more to the feeling of camping.  I heat my house with wood 
and love to hear the stove crackle all night and the smell of wood 
smoke outside my door.  After a cold night outside the bus in the 
morning it would be pretty cool to heat some coffee and cook some 
bacon and eggs on the wood stove!

I have a pretty nice '66 walk threw standard which came from Alaska 
complete with a hole in the roof.  May just leave the hole in there 
and reinstall a wood stove.
