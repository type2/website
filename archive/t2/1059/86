	Let me get a bit more thorough.

1.  Tank removed from vehicle  -  no need for any risk whatever of a 
flashback setting fire to, or exploding,  your Westie.

2.  'quite a ways from the house and no open flames for several 
hundred feet'  -  good.

3.  Wind very desirable  -  I'd say essential  -  and in a steady direction.

4.  No sources of ignition  -  including vehicles running  -  for at 
least 100 m downwind.

5.  Remember propane (& butane) vapour is denser than air, so the 
invisible vapour cloud you'll let loose will go down into drains etc. 
if it can.

6.  It is possible to make a free-space vapour-cloud explosion, but 
confinement greatly increases the chances.  (At the Spanish seaside 
holiday camp propene disaster, it was the discoteque that exploded.) 
So any buildings or vehicles downwind should be > 100 m away  - 
preferably several hundred m.
