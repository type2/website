Subject: Running Hot

Here is a little more info about my hot engine. I picked up an infrared
thermometer today. Pretty neat little tool! Ran the bus today to get it up to
temperature. The Cht gauge said that #3 cylinder was about 375 degrees. I shut
off the ignition and pulled over as quick as I could. Pulled the bonnett and
took a reading on the head right next to the sparkplug. 290 degrees was the
reading off the aluminum next to the plug. Took a reading on the nut part of
the spark plug 350 degrees. Looked up at the CHT gauge, looked like it was
just over 350 degrees. Took readings all around the spark plug, but not the
plug itself. All areas I could mark with the lazer thing, through the spark
plug hole in the tin, were all at least 60 degrees cooler than the plug
itself. Seems the plug is much hotter than the head itself. Also looks like my
CHT gauge is fairly accurate for a non-compensated gauge. I'm using the sensor
under the plug.

This still doesn't leave me feeling good considering the gauge used to
indicate the engine was running cooler before. I need to look through my
repair logs. I think I put normal heat range plugs in last time I changed them
and the previous set was one step cooler. Would this make a difference in my
readings? I'll let you all know what my logs say, when I check them.
