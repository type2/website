Subject: 70 amp alt

The alt on the Guac seized on me today. So I was bopping though the web
looking at alternators when I found this:

http://www.autozone.com/R,408526/store,834/initialAction,partProductDetail/initialAction,partProductDetail/initialpartType,00086/initialR,408526/initialstore,834/initialvehicleId,1317401/shopping/addToCart.htm

With a lifetime warranty!
