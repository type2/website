My stock '71 setup used the long (38A) generator, the "dished" tin
in the fan shroud and the ordinary stamped pulley.  The belt aligned
perfectly.

I now have an internal-regulator alternator with the non-dished style tin
and the same stamped pulley.  The belt still aligns perfectly.

I think the alignment issue arises when the wrong tin is used for the
generator or alternator and the cast pulley has been found to
be a bolt-on cure for the problem.

IMO, the better cure is to use the correct tin (and fan hub) for the
generator you have.  Dished for the 38A, flat for the 30A or alternator.
