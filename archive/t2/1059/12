Subject: Re: breaking generator straps/misaligned pulleys

Hi Blake,

Could it be that you have a bug generator backing plate (tin that connects the
generator to the fan shroud)?  I ran into this problem many years ago when a
deceitful mechanic replaced my broken bus generator with a bug generator and
did not replace the plate.  The difference was about a 1/2" of misalignment.
I got a bug backing plate from the parts yard and fixed the problem.  Do you
know the history of your 71?  Could you have the same problem in reverse?

Best,
Jerry

someone asked if the gen. and crank pulleys were misaligned and sure enough -
they are.  the gen. pulley sits ~1/2" or so (i haven't measured) further out
than the crank pulley, so the belt is at a wonky angle.
