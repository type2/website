I'm pretty sure you have to change out the flywheel too. Also, 6v carries more
amps than 12 does, so the wiring in 6v cars are usually larger gauge.

have to change the coil, cutoff valve/choke, and generator/regulator.... I

that would be it. Lots easier than changing every bulb, starter bushing,
battery, etc.
