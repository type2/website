From left to right...
1. Black pull knob.  For ??? I don't know
2. Black turn knob for wipers
3. Red emergency flasher pull knob
4. Green rear window defroster
5. Brown turn knob (with light inside).  Appears to have two settings.
Haven't been able to track down wires as yet.

*** I assume this is the knob you are referring to here...

*** Is this the vent you are talking about that is at the walk-through area?

Thanks for the reply.  I don't know what should be there, what was swapped out
over the years, etc...  That is why I have been looking for a set of good docs
on the web.  The Bentley doesn't have much in it on the heating.  I want to
get this up and running better so my kids won't freeze in the back.  The heat
works pretty good up front and so does the defrost.  :-)

Thanks,

Michael in Montevallo
