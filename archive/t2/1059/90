Subject: Re: [T2] how to drain a propane tank from a 78 westy

I assumed this had already been done, thus the pressure in the tank is
equal to atmospheric pressure. But then you would still have some
propane in the tank. How do you get that out? If propane is indeed
heavier than air, then just use gravity, I suppose.
