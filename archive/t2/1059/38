Subject: Plug choice?

I've been using NGK plugs in my 80 Vanagon Campmobile since I put the rebuilt
engine in because I use a CHT gauge. No problems with them. The last time I
changed them I put BR5ES plugs in because I couldn't find the B6ES plugs I had
been using. I want to go back to the cooler heat range plugs. I found a place
that stocks both the B6ES and BR6ES plugs. is there any advantage to using the
resistor plugs if I had no problems with radio static? In my other incarnation
as a 2 wheel fanatic, putting resistor plugs in when you have resistor plug
caps can reduce your spark enough to cause your bike to run awful. Running
with out any resistors can cause you to have to do tune ups more often.

I'm running a Pertronix unit in my dizzy with stock coil. I don't remember if
my plug wires are resistor or not. I'll go check them with my meter if it
makes any difference. I want as much spark as I can get, without causing
troubles.
