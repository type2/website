Back in "the day" they didn't even plow the roads over the Sierra.  They
just sanded them so folks were driving on a couple of feet of ice and
sand!

The ironic thing is that my local government has just passed an
ordinance making it a misdemeanor to use a water softener.  The reason is
that the water softener puts salt into the sewage system and this is
considered a pollutant.  Yet, some states are throwing tons of salt
directly into the environment.  Go figure.

I'm really lucky to have a California bus that doesn't have a lot of rust
happening.  If I had to face some of the reconstruction that the east
coast folks routinely perform I would probably not have a bus.
