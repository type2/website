Hey Greg,

Here is the web site.  I actually called and talked to someone about 6 or 7 
years ago about the louvered or jelousie windows. Of course they no longer 
make them, but the individual I spoke with recommended that I look around 
for a recreational vehicle store that had been in business for a long time, 
20+ years and see if they had any old windows. Sure enough, I found 2 old 
windows, incomplete, but good spare parts.
