Howdy  Y'all,
Read a lot in the archives about taking a 6 volt vehicle and  converting to 
run on a 12 volt engine and electrical setup.  BUT, I have  a perfectly good 
complete turnkey 6volt 1500 SP engine that I want to put into  a bug that is a 
12 volt vehicle.  So, what is the QUICKEST, EASIEST,  CHEAPEST way to 
accomplish what I need to (which is make my 6 volt turnkey  engine run in my 12volt 
vehicle?)




hey john   As has been said it probably is easier to change the  motor to 
12V.  The flywheel might be a problem,   If the crank  has the 6V offset on the 
flywheel end then you can't just stick a 12V flywheel  on there without 
machineing the flywheel.  If the crank offset is for 12V  then no problem just 
install the 12V flywheel. change the generator and stand,  choke and coil .  Much 
easier than changing all the 12 v stuff on the car.  also probably the cheapest 
way also as I know how important that is to ya   :)  later  mark d
