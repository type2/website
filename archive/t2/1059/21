Subject: road salt, jalousie windows

Chris,
I should have been more specific. This company makes the glass panes in the 
jalousie windows. At least they made the panes in mine.? 
The Hehr Co. must have supplied the aluminum frames and assembled them.

As far as I know, most of the jelousie windows were made by the Hehr Co. 
here in Los Angeles.
