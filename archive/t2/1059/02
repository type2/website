I just passed my smog check last week. Passed it quite well actually.

Apparently back on 11/5 I passed a roadside sniffer and had a high CO%.
Yesterday (a week after I passed emissions), I got a certified letter from
the state saying I needed to have the bus inspected. Again. By "state of
Colorado personnel".

Idiots. I'll bet they only work M-F, 9-5, and won't reimburse me for my
time.

Stupid Colorado.
