You might want to take your old alternator and have it rebuilt and keep 
it as a spare and just eat the core charge. I doubt alternators for our 
old buses will be easier to find in the future.

FWIW alternators are not expensive to rebuild - either yourself or 
getting a starter/alternator shop to do it for you.
