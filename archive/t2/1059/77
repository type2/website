Wow - very good points!!! I have one of the temp guns too and they are 
useful little tools.

When I put a temp gauge in my bus I used one of the head studs instead 
of the sparkplug. I had already twisted the sensor until it broke 
installing or removing a spark plug. Didn't have a temp gun to isolate 
whether this was a good place to measure temps.

Keep us updated!
