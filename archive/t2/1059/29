Subject: how to drain a propane tank from a 78 westy

Hey Everyone,
Anyone have a suggestion on how to drain my propane tank
on my 78 westy. The propane guy said my valve was bad so
I have a new one that I would like to install on the tank.
I took off the regulator and I opened the valve, but I'm
not sure if that's the safest thing to do. I do have the
tank removed from the bus, but I just want to find out if
there's a better way to do this than just opening the
valve.

Also, if I do just open the valve, is it better to turn
the tank upside down so the fluid flows out instead of the
gas? I figured it might go faster.

I was going to try and find somewhere to vent it to the
open, but I'm not quite sure where to do that around SF.
I'm heading towards Morro Bay tomorrow so maybe somewhere
around the beach...

Thanks,
Mike
