Subject: Re: [VB] Backwards voltage conversion 12v to 6 v

I've done this... I?bought a 12V?1959 SC? truck with a dead motor and had a good running 6V 40hp to put in it.??

I swapped out the battery for a 6V unit and?ALL the light bulbs for 6V ones? Use dielectric grease at the bulbs and battery connections.? It is anti-diabolical grease and helps keep the demons out of the electrical system.

I swapped the starter bushing and starter over to the 6V ones.
I guess also removed the voltage drop for the wiper motor (if there was one)No, there wasn't one, but the wipers worked normally with the 6V system when they had gone really fast with the 12V battery
The 12V radio well,?I disconnected it.
If you have a 12V horn, swap in a 6V one.

You may have to swap the wiring back to normal for 6V if you had a regulator in the car? and now have the kind that sits on the generator... check wiring diagram for that.

That's all I can think of, but I may have forgotten something.

Howdy Y'all,
Read a lot in the archives about taking a 6 volt vehicle and converting to run 
on a 12 volt engine and electrical setup.  BUT, I have a perfectly good complete 
turnkey 6volt 1500 SP engine that I want to put into a bug that is a 12 volt 
vehicle.  So, what is the QUICKEST, EASIEST, CHEAPEST way to accomplish what I 
need to (which is make my 6 volt turnkey engine run in my 12volt vehicle?)

PEACE! 
John Baker
