Subject: 1974 Exterior panels

I need left and right rear exterior panels for a 1974 transporter. The body
shop originally said that just wheel wells would work but now they want the
whole assemblies. Anyone know where I can find these? I'm in California so
local sure would be best but anywhere will do. You know, I called one of the
"regulars" and he wants close to $1000.00 including shipping! Thanks!
