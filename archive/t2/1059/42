Subject: Oil Filter Change?

I change my oil every six months, since I don't drive enough to do it based on mileage.

But I was wondering do I need to do the filter every other oil change (once per year) or can I do it on mileage...it seems that mileage would make more sense for the filter? That would probably work out to be every 18-24 months.


Thanks,
Rick
