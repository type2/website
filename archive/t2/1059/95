Haven't done it with my air-cooled vehicles yet but I use to find "hot
pockets" created with the thick aluminum foil placed on the top of the engine
use to work very nicely on my old V8s.  Just take the thick aluminum foil,
make a pouch, put in your favorite starch (potato, rice,...) with some
veggies, a little meat, and some liquid and drive for a while.  The aluminum
keeps the food in and the oil, gas, and other stuff out.  Might be worth a
test.  The rear engine hatch looks a little like an oven too.  :-)

You would have to get out of the vehicle however.  At least with the earlier
model bays without the inside hatch compartment in the back.
