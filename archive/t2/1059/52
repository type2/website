You have two red knobs on the dash.  Those control the heat on/off at the
heater boxes.

You have a pull knob on the driver's seat pedestal.  That controls the
heat from the floor outlet in front of the middle seat.

You have a flip lever on the vertical duct in front of the
driver/passenger, under the dash.  Up is heat, down is defrost to the
windshield.

Station wagons have a pair of levers beneath the rear seat that control
the rear outlets, but I don't know if westys have those.

If you want good heat up front, make sure that all the middle and rear
outlets are closed.  Crack the rear vent window to allow air to flow into
the cabin.
