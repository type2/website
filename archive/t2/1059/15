Subject: Re: [T2] Injector Testing?

Mike,
So if I just hook them up to a 12 volt battery with a normally open momentary
switch in the line, and provide fuel tapped off the pressure test fitting of
the fuel rail of my running bus, I can tap the switch to get the injector to
open? Should I put a resistor in the circuit? I think I have a spare resistor
set somewhere.

  I've taken the injectors off before and set up a test rig that mirrored
  the bus' fuel rail.  I just pulsed them on and off into clear tubes to
  see how much they flowed.  I've also flowed them backwards to flush
  stuff out - I don't think there's really much more you can do.
