Hey, I can save you some energy..

the engine bay has coool air flowing thru it while driving.. less than 140
deg F ...

If you want the hot area then you need to hang the food under the engine,,
near the exhaust ..  it might work on a 36hp T1 engine that have those big
pockets under the cylinders...

It isn't very good on a Late Model engine  imho.. as the road debris .. and
it is in the dirty air flow, ie.. any oil leaking is smoking and blowing
over the food...

I tried this ... put the chicken wings in the sauce,, tin foil wrap.. in the
engine compartment right on the tin.. I had a 90min drive.. and to make it
worse. .. the traffic was slllooooow! ... the cyl heads didn't even get up
to 300 driving in stop and go traffic,,, let alone the chicken!   All was
fine at the picnic tho! I had the BBQ with me,, so I lit it up,, and that
gave me time for a few refreshments waiting for the chicken .
