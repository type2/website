Good point.

Disclaimer: not saying the alternator you are considering is one of 
these but -

When I worked at a FLAPS the cheap rebuilt stuff was DOA from time to 
time. After dealing with a few angry customers who struggled to get the 
old part off, the new one on and then back off to return for a new new 
one - I began testing the starters, alternators and ignition modules 
before letting them out the door. I found DOA parts that way.

Be sure to test the one you buy before you install it. Any FLAPS worth 
ten cents will have a test rig.

Can anybody confirm that the cheapest "rebuilt" parts often have many 
"good" used parts reinstalled inside them? Our area manager claimed that 
the cheapest parts were torn down, the good parts piled in bins and the 
bad parts tossed. The "rebuilt" alternators and starters were then 
reassembled with the "used" parts and only occasionally received new 
components. Seems really, really cheap to me but then getting a rebuilt 
Chevy starter for $15 can't allow for much time or new parts. I've done 
this sort of repair for myself using old parts I've had laying around 
but I usually have to tinker with it again sooner rather than later. 
Again these were the cheapest parts the store sold.
