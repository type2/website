	Not a huge difference, I believe.

	sounds like a practical solution.  You want as much wind as 
you can find, blowing in a fairly constant direction for the part of 
an hour that the draining will take.
	Of course the tank should be downwind of anything that might 
catch fire in the event that your propane, diluted with air so as to 
make it combustible, got somehow ignited.
	There is an argument for letting it out pretty fast, because 
then if the propane/air cloud gets ignited downwind it'll be too rich 
near the tank to burn right back to you.
	I did a similar draining recently.  The tank will get very 
cold around the valve owing to the latent heat of evaporation of the 
propane; you may well see ice forming.


Good luck
