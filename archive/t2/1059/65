As far as operating the heater goes, take a look at the '71 owner's manual:

http://www.thesamba.com/vw/archives/manuals/71bus.php

There's no mention of your brown "HEAT" knob (which doesn't look like a
stock knob) to the right of the rear defrost switch, but it does explain
what all the other knobs/levers (like the "Push/pull knob for interior light
at rear") do.

Page 21 has a description of how to operate the heating controls.:

Page 24 has a description of how to operate the optional gas heater:

I don't think there were any auxiliary fans in '71 for the heating unless
you had the optional gas heater.  It doesn't look like you have the optional
gas heater because you are missing the knobs to operate it.
