Don already knows about this "lifetime warranty" from AutoZone.  I seem 
to recall he got a lifetime of changing starters in his GWB in the 
AutoZone parking lots!

Don .. I'd rather swap our starters than alternators in an AutoZone 
parking lot.  Good luck man.  I think I have a good 55a (el cheapo 
FLAPS) you can have.
