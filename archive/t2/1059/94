Subject: Re: [T2] 12volt cooking accessories?

Thanks David, my thoughts were putting something unfrozen into it when I break camp in the mornings, and leave it in there for 3-4 hrs as I drive along and see the sites. It says it can reach 300 deg. so perhaps some beans, or usual road fare along the way. :-) Is this unrealistic since you've actually owned one and would know what it's capable of?
Thanks,
Courtney



 
 Don't be fooled into thinking that "stove" will work like a
conventional oven.  I bought one a few years ago at a truck stop and
it took over 45 minutes to warm up a slice of pizza.  If you have
 hours and hours to wait, it might be okay for heating a frozen
 burrito.
