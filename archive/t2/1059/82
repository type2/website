Subject: Re: [T2] how to drain a propane tank from a 78 westy 

on a more scary note, and OT to a degree, I've found
a full size acetylene tank in the weeds beside a
small warehouse I'm taking over; as one might guess,
I don't want to do something stupid but I am not
sure what stupid means here; I do not know if it
has remaining pressure -- there is a valve but no
gauge or regulator; the provenance of this tank is
unknown and likely unknowable

and, of course, it is in a position where no vehicle
I have can get to it so, if it is to be moved, it
will be a hand-carry by two people

offlist or onlist advice welcome...
