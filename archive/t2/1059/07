Subject: breaking generator straps/misaligned pulleys

Howdy all, back again after a (relatively) short hiatus and am still dealing with an old problem.

My '71 1600DP breaks generator straps, both the gold bolt type and the stainless captured bolt type.  I posted about this a year or so ago, and someone asked if the gen. and crank pulleys were misaligned and sure enough - they are.  the gen. pulley sits ~1/2" or so (i haven't measured) further out than the crank pulley, so the belt is at a wonky angle.

I have a new stamped brazilian pulley on the gen as the cast one broke, I am guessing that this is at least part of the problem.  Could it also be that my generator is too long?  Bosch GR17X 

This bus is currently a state away in storage, so I am hoping to be able to take what I need to fix this issue when I go to retrieve it sometime in the spring.

Thanks in advance to the collective wisdom.

Blake
'71 Westy
