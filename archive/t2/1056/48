Subject: 30PICT on 1776sp (also 1776 SP or DP)

When I posted last, I forgot to follow the same thread.  Sorry.

I looked at my stash and found a manifold center (with vacuum nipple)  
that accommodates a 34 PICT 3 plus the single port end pieces.  The  
whole assembly can be yours for a $40.00 donation to the list.  Free  
shipping.

Re-jetting is probably the easier way to go.
