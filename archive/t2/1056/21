My 71  Westy's 1776 is a single-port.  That is what it had when I got it.   I 
love the torque I seem to be getting out of the 1776 but not real happy with  
the up-hill power issues I am noticing on some of my longer trips.  Some  of 
the issue may be the 6-rib tranny I have.  However, I think one issue  is that 
the single port carb has my motor grossly under-carbed.  Any  advice or 
suggestions from anyone?  Can I put an adapter on the single  port intake to but 
the 34PICT I have laying around from a dual port?   Would the 34PICT help with 
my issues?

Thanks,

Michael in  Montevallo



hey michael  I haven't seen any adapters to go that direction. I have  seen 
single port adapters for the progressive webers that work good as long as  you 
get some heat to the carb. Exhust header systems will give more power as  will 
big valve heads. Dual carbs work better with these 2 things done  also.
