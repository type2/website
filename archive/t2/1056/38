I think the best thing to do would be to remove as much of the 
administrative overhead as possible - in other words, not run our own 
servers.  Like I mentioned before, palosverdes.com hosts non-profits for 
free.  They have a great web service and also host mailing lists (which 
may or may not fit the needs of the list).  Besides the mailing list, 
there are no reasons to require donations for equipment if free hosting 
services are available (and there are plenty of good free mailing list 
services as well).  We're making this much more difficult than it needs 
to be.
