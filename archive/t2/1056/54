The VDO tach I used had 3 terminals labelled "-12", "15" and "+".
The "15" goes to the coil, the "-12" to earth and the "+" to a 12V supply.

My bus has slightly dodgy electrics, hence the fluctuating tach readiing. I 
constantly need to charge my battery too...why?....but that's another 
topic...

Cheers,
