Subject: Carb on a 1776...

After doing some research, searching the forums over at TheSamba, and getting
feedback from this list, the consensus seems to be that a 1776 single port
would be more than sufficient for my bus.  However, my 1776 seems fuel
starved
when I am climbing hills in my 71 Westy with a 6 rib tranny.  Given that
money
is so tight right now and that others are saying the 30PICT carb should be
fine, I am thinking that the jetting on my carb may be all wrong.  BUT, I
know
absolutely nothing about jetting and it all sounds Greek, Latin, Hindu, or
whatever to me.  I've got several 30PICTs laying around my garage, a 34PICT,
and a rebuilt kit, any suggestions?  What kind of jetting should I do and how
do I do it?

Thanks,

Hi Michael,

Can you give us a few more details.  Exactly which carb is on the motor, a 30
PICT-1, a 30 PICT-2, or a 30 PICT-3?  You can change the jetting in your carb
once you start to dis-assemble it, although you'll need to find a source of
Solex jets for your Solex carb and while you're at it buy a good carb rebuild
gaskit kit as well.

I'm in the middle of writing a 4 part series on Bus carburetion in my
"Transporter Talk" column in Hot VWs magazine that might be helpful with
background info and some rebulid tips.  I think part 3 just came out in an
issue this month.  Disclaimer:  I am not carb guru!  I own and have rebuilt a
lot of 'em, but by no means am I "the" expert...
