Subject: Re: [T2] Tach Power 

I don't think the reason your tach bounces around has anything to do with  
the power supply.  If it did, you would be seeing a host of other side  effects, 
like headlights flickering, etc.
 
The problem I had, after installing a VDO tach in my 71 Westy, was  that 
there is some kind of noise issue with the signal coming from the coil, to  the 
tach, and the tach was not happy - needle bounced around and the reading (if  
you could even tell) was way off.  I have to believe that this is a generic  
problem, because there is nothing special about my bus (well, there really is  
something special about my bus, but nothing having to do with the tach!).   The 
solution is documented by VDO in a service bulletin, which I have somewhere  
if anyone needs it.  Basically, you install a diode in the signal line from  
the coil to the tach, with the "arrow" on the diode pointing from the coil to  
the tach.  The service bulletin has you installing the diode at the tach  end 
of the wire, but I put it at the coil end and it works fine - tach settled  
right down and reads accurately.
