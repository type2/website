Subject: Re: [T2] 78 Bus shifter problem 

I know it sounds crazy but it could be the grommets.  I had almost the
exact same thing happen with me about a month ago.  After checking the
clutch cable, the shifter adjustment, etc... I checked the grommets
where the shift linkage meets with the tranny and the grommets fell
apart.  I thought it was peculiar since everything worked fine when
the engine was off and, in my case, I could get all gears to work
except third.  After I changed out the grommets I haven't any
problems.  The strangest thing is that a friend of mine in the car
club I belong to hand a similar problem with his not going into
reverse.  He changed out his grommets about two weeks ago and his
problem went away too.  It is definitely worth crawling under there
and checking it out.

Let us know what you find out.
