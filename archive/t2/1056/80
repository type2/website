Subject: Re: [T2] 81 air cooled, engine tear down

I be the guy who couldn't get the last wrist pin out of my engine teardown,
on old number 4.

I also be the guy who is so far in debt to all of you who keep bailing me
out over the years. Got a lot of pmails and a lot of help, which makes me
feel a lot less alone out here :-)

The pin is out, its time to start working in the other direction, and
putting the new stuff on.

Thanks a lot for being there guys :-)
