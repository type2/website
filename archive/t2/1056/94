I just want to know how they got my home movies?!

I understand what they were trying to do, and how far they missed it.
But the one thing I have learned as I grow older and grayer is to laugh
at myself and even more laugh at what people think about me.

An entire generation was generalized in this commercial, sad attempt at
humor.  The real humor is that the people making the commercial are the
ones struggling to find out who they are and who we were.  We know,
therefore we can laugh. They don't know therefore they are lost.

The 60's generation came out of a fog and built upon "The Greatest
Generations" foundations.  Look at what we have done!

Wait until their grandchildren try and define them in a silly commercial
to sell something new on the coat tails of something great.  Hopefully
by then they will "get it".

Rock on.

They reinvented nothing.
