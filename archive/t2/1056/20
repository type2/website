-------------

As an owner of a 71, I would have to say that I love the Type 1 motor over the
pancake Type 4.  Parts are easier to find and the repository of knowledge out
there is great.  I put a 1776 in mine that I found that someone was going to
but in a buggy and have never regretted it.  I do have some advice to ask the
list though...

My 71 Westy's 1776 is a single-port.  That is what it had when I got it.  I
love the torque I seem to be getting out of the 1776 but not real happy with
the up-hill power issues I am noticing on some of my longer trips.  Some of
the issue may be the 6-rib tranny I have.  However, I think one issue is that
the single port carb has my motor grossly under-carbed.  Any advice or
suggestions from anyone?  Can I put an adapter on the single port intake to
but the 34PICT I have laying around from a dual port?  Would the 34PICT help
with my issues?

Thanks,

Michael in Montevallo
