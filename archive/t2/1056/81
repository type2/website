Volks:
Anybody heard of Colin Kellog?  He has done remarkable illustrations of the
VW engine.  The illustrations have very informative copy to along with how
the engine works.  Found some of his stuff on the internet a few years ago.
 A Google search turns up nothing.  Was he just a Veedubber who was a good
artist?
