Subject: 78 Bus shifter problem 

Hello, I have a 1978 Bus that has spawned a shifter problem, or so I am told. 
Heres the rundown: I was noticing the shifter was sticking, and depending on the gear, "thumping" in to place. 
One day while I was in the Wal-Mart parking lot I shifted into reverse, and then after backing up, could not force it back into first (or any other gear for that matter) 
Upon turning the engine off, I found that the shifter worked fine, so I put it in to nuetral and rolled her back. 
Asking around, I have been told that there is a problem with a rubber gromet connecting the shifting link to the transmission
I have not tried anything yet, but I would like to see if this is a legitimate problem or any other suggestions that anyone has 

Thanks!
