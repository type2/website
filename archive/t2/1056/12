Subject: What should my friend get? 71? or 72+

Hey guys,

      I have a buddy that wants to take an early retirement and take a cruise around the US in a VW Bus. He wants to buy mine, but I'm not selling!!! In any case, I'm trying to help him figure out exactly what he wants. He has basically determined that he wants a "Weekender". Since he will be sleeping in it most of the time, he wants something that he can stay in, and use the facilities at a campground. He doesn't need a full Westfalia since he's not particularly a fan of the pop-top.

The big question is, what years should he be looking for?

I have a 73 VW Bus, so I've got the Type-4 motor. I was seriously suggesting to him that he should consider looking for one that's a 1968-1971 because it utilizes the Type-1 motor. My reasoning for this is becasue the Type-1 is pretty much bullet proof. I love my 73, don't get me wrong, but I recognize that the Type-4 motor is not as reliable as the Type-1. (no offense). This guy is not really all that mechanically inclined, although I hope to help teach him some basic maintenance things before he makes his trip. My hope was that the Type-1 would be the most reliable and lest issue prone motor for him to take his trip. Granted, things can always go wrong, but I figured he'd have a better chance with the Type-1.


If you guys don't mind, does anyone have any pros or cons towards this argument? Like I said, I really like my 73, and really like the power of the 1800cc that I have, but I don't know that it will necessarily be so important for him.

Also, is there a major difference in fuel economy between the two engine types?


Thanks!!!

Todd
