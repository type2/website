Hi George,

FullMoonBusClub.com is one such group that operates precisely as you 
describe. AIt's a lively bunch of volks, but the change to a web forum 
has changed the groups dynamic considerably. And the operating costs are 
considerably higher.

OTOH, I moderate a local VW-oriented Yahoo group that works as both a 
web-forum and email list. The moderators approve new members and can 
moderate members if their conduct requires it. IIRC there's still a 
yahoo backup list set up once upon a time when the type2.com hardware 
was kind of iffy. I suppose that's another option.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
