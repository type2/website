Sounds like your clutch cable needs adjustment, also crawl under and check
the shift coupler

Hello, I have a 1978 Bus that has spawned a shifter problem, or so I am
told.
Heres the rundown: I was noticing the shifter was sticking, and depending on
the gear, "thumping" in to place.
One day while I was in the Wal-Mart parking lot I shifted into reverse, and
then after backing up, could not force it back into first (or any other gear
for that matter)
Upon turning the engine off, I found that the shifter worked fine, so I put
it in to nuetral and rolled her back.
