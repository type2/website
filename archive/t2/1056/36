Hit up a Pick & Pull yard and get cranks from an '80s watercooled  
VW.  I'd aim for a Scirocco, Rabbit Convertible/Cabriolet or Vanagon  
because they're German-built, but you should still have to watch out  
for replacement aftermarket crap that was installed over the years.   
Or check with BusDepot or GermanSupply for new.

If OE-style isn't important, you're willing to tinker, and you're  
lucky enough to find them, the earlier manual-window Saab 900's have  
beefy aluminum cranks.  Splining and shaft diameter  is the same as  
VW cranks, but the splined area is longer/deeper so you'd need to  
shorten that area.  The Saab window cranks are probably Swedish-made  
though, not German...
