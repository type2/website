Subject: 30PICT on 1776sp

After doing some research, searching the forums over at TheSamba, and getting
feedback from this list, the consensus seems to be that a 1776 single port
would be more than sufficient for my bus.  However, my 1776 seems fuel starved
when I am climbing hills in my 71 Westy with a 6 rib tranny.  Given that money
is so tight right now and that others are saying the 30PICT carb should be
fine, I am thinking that the jetting on my carb may be all wrong.  BUT, I know
absolutely nothing about jetting and it all sounds Greek, Latin, Hindu, or
whatever to me.  I've got several 30PICTs laying around my garage, a 34PICT,
and a rebuilt kit, any suggestions?  What kind of jetting should I do and how
do I do it?

Thanks,
