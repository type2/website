Nice guy. Good VW mechanic. When I first got my first bus I couldn't
get it running and Colin came out to where I live and we spent all day
with working with me and teaching me the beginner ins and outs and we
worked until we got it running.  Turned out it was a bad set of plugs
fouled by carb cleaner. I think we settled upon a VERY reasonable fee
for his time. Looking back all I can say is wow.
