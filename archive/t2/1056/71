On a cross country trip we camped once in a very very damp state forest 
in Oregon, or was it Washington State?  Next morning I pushed the clutch 
in and started it, and it started to roll as if pedal was never pushed 
in.  It did break free when I stayed on the brakes and revved it.  At 
the time I thought it was a stuck (siezed) needle bearing gripping the 
tranny shaft, but I can see how the plate might stick to the flywheel 
given the right conditions.

gets
  stuck, is to start it and warm it up in neutral, the turn it off,  put 
it in a
  gear, like, reverse, and then start it again, whereupon it 
immediately takes
  off.  Slamming the gas pedal a few times while holding  the clutch 
pedal down
  breaks it free every time, so far.  Highly  annoying..
