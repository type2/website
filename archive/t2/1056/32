Subject: Re: [T2] Donations

A fairly typical msg of this past week reads, in part:

>Has a decision been made on the site?  I would like to donate some moolah
>where it will do the most good.  I guess I don't want to donate if it's a
gonna shut down, or should I donate if it will help keep it on-line ???

	May I help to bring this uncertainty to an end?

	Three issues have been raised by at least one of those who 
control the T2 list & site.

1.  Equipment  -  a plethora has been offered in response, but I for 
one can't tell whether it can serve.

2.  Expertise  -  ditto

3.  Functions  -  I have noticed little impetus to change what we 
have viz. T2 list and the Type2.com website, a treasure trove of 
technical notes & archives.

4.  Running costs  -  Ron Salmon has kindly offered a channel thru 
his firm's site; if that is sufficiently secure, that would appear to 
be OK.


	I have little idea of what a web forum would be; but I'm 
unaware of any real advantages that it might offer.  Given the 
skilled workers to maintain & add to the site, it would continue to 
earn its status (reported a few y ago to be the tenth most-used site 
in the universe).  And the list is about as good as I can imagine; 
lower 'traffic' is not a reason to dumpt the whole plurry schemozzle.

	Given then that 1 - 3 were settled in a new configuration, I 
strongly suspect (4) would not be a problem.  I can even contribute 
from New Zealand before our dollar sinks even lower wrt the US$ 
without allowing any parasitical banker to rake off a huge fee.
