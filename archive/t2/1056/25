Subject: Source for window crank handles needed 78 Westy

Hi Volks"

Yesterday in the middle of the first real downpour in Sacramento, while 
the window was DOWN, the window crank came off in my hand.  It looks 
like metal fatigue.   I got the window up with the trusty Vise Grips, 
but need a new one - make that two as these tend to happen in pairs.  
I'd like German OEM if possible. 

Any ideas, let me know!

Thanks,

BEN
