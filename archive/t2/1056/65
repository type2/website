Hi Michael,

This isn't just a problem on buses; I've also seen it on beetles, fords,
chevys etc.

Did the ebrake handle spring back when you released it? If so, then it's
a classic case of a frozen ebrake. Have someone swat the hubs with a 3
lb hammer just as you let the clutch out; this should break the bonds
created by a thin rust coating between the drum and shoe.

If you can't find a helper then you could try the dramatic approach and
just dump the clutch at 4,000 RPM; but that's a whole lot riskier. I've
seen both approaches work on more than one occaision.

If the ebrake handle did not spring back, then you have rusted out the
ebrake cables, and they will need to be replaced. But this is a lot less
common than the previous scenario.


Happy Trails,

Released the parking brake...my driveway happens to have a fairly
steep incline, and normally when I release the hand brake, push the
clutch in, the bus immediately rolls downhill out to the street. No
need to shift into reverse.

I pushed the clutch in, and...no motion. She didn't budge. Shifted
into reverse, and still wouldn't go. Brakes are totally locked. Tried
the hand brake a few more times, and no go, brakes won't release.
Brake pedal feels pretty stiff too.

Any thoughts as to what my problem is (I'm guessing it's the hand
brake), and what I might need to do other than see if my repair guy
makes house calls?

Thank in advance, oh wise ones....
