Plenty of vendors sell the German window cranks.  OEVeedub, German 
Supply, GoWesty, just to name a few.  Expect to shell-out well over 
$20/each + shipping.

If you need a window crank(s) now, I suggest getting the Help! brand 
that are available at most local FLAPS.  They are packaged as a pair for 
around $7, and are of decent quality, for the price.
