Hi,

I'm moving the Tach over from my '71 to the new '75 along with a slew
of other projects.

Quick question, I need to run 12V+ to the tachometer - I've got a
fused 12V+ line handy and unused behind the dash, however it is always
live. I'd rather used a 12V-when-running input, but don't want to
start opening up the fuse panel just yet. Thoughts on using 12V
always-on to power the tach?

Thanks
jules
