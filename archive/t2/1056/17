I think the mileage actually goes down a bit with the T4 just because
of the larger displacement. Though that mileage loss is mitigated
quite a bit by the more efficient fuel injection on the later ones. If
I drive right, I can get 22 mpg from my 78. When I drive it hard, I
drop down to 19 or so. And I live in Denver.

I doubt the reliability you state. T4 engines have one weak spot:
Heads. The aftermarket heads have eliminated even that weakness. The
engine in the 78 has been re-ringed, heads replaced, and that's it as
far as I can tell. The crank is sloppy now, the cam is darn near flat,
and it still runs great. I've put 30k on it since I bought it from
Troy and I still have 90's compression all around.

When I finally pull the engine to rebuild it, I'll have to mill the
mains and crank, replace the bearings, cam, lifters, and P&C, and
finally refresh the heads. With a T1 you'll need all of the above plus
a case. And much sooner than with my T4.

Your 73 came with dual carbs that when dialed in are amazing, but can
be problematic (at best). Any replacements will be an adventure as
well.

Having the power of a stock 2.0 fuel injected engine is enough for me
to not be interested in a T1.
