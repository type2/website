Subject: Re: Did I break my brakes?

The happens periodically with my 71 Westy.  I think that making sure  the 
rear bakes are adjusted high helps make it not happen.  My usual  solution is to 
not use the parking brake, which works for me when parked in  my level 
driveway, but, of course, is not an option everywhere I might end up  parking the 
bus. 
 
When it gets stuck, I can usually free it by rocking it, as you would do  
when stuck in the snow or mud.  Dumping the clutch at 4K is sure to bust  the 
tranny....with my luck.
 
Anyone ever have this problem?  With my 51 F*rd F1 truck, if I let it  sit 
for too long, like, months, without starting it, the clutch disk will get  stuck 
to the flywheel.  So the clutch never release.  The solution,  when it gets 
stuck, is to start it and warm it up in neutral, the turn it off,  put it in a 
gear, like, reverse, and then start it again, whereupon it  immediately takes 
off.  Slamming the gas pedal a few times while holding  the clutch pedal down 
breaks it free every time, so far.  Highly  annoying...
