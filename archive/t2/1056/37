I think we all have full faith and trust in the collective that is
working on the problem.

Suggest maybe those that are "in the know" select a specific subject
line to indicate emails that represent "official" type 2 list status
updates.

Personally, I'm no longer reading all the traffic on the issue, but I
don't want to miss those that have info on the more official nuts and
bolts of it.

Thanks all,
