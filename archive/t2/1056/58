Diodes have ratings for maximum current and PIV (Peak Inverse  Voltage)  
1N4005 is the recommended diode (1A and 600V).  Any diode  that meets or exceeds 
the 1N4005 ratings will work fine.  Probably, a  lesser diode would do - in 
fact, I'm not exactly sure what diode I  used.  I grabbed it out of a parts box 
and it was not labeled, but so  far it works fine.
