Your shoes are rusted to your drums.  Not an unusual occurance with VWs.

Solution, if you are lucky, is to put the bus in gear, brake off, and try
driving forward.  Then try driving backward.  Forward, backward, a few
times.

If your karma account is paid up things will break loose.

If not, then you will have to do the following:

All wheels chocked, you don't want your bus to roll!
crawl under the back of the bus.  Look at the brake backing plates.  See
the slots on either side (not the round holes.)  You can see the brake
shoes through these slots.  Take a punch, stick it through the hole up
against the brake shoe and give it a healthy whack with a hammer.  Repeat
for the other shoe and for the two shoes on the other side.

With luck this will break the shoes loose.

I have to park on an incline as well, and I learned early on to put a
piece of 2x6 or 2x8 out for a drive-over wheel chock.  That way I can
leave the e-brake off and avoid the locking problem.
