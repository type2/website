Subject: Did I break my brakes?

So....I recently got my 76 bus back (engine rebuild, newly rebuilt  
heads). It's been running great, especially since so much weight has  
been removed from my wallet  ;-)

Took it into the shop after about 600 miles to have the valves  
adjusted, oil change, and other minor tweaks (including fixing a  
broken shift coupler)

Got it back, drove it all last weekend, then left it parked in my  
driveway ( I have another car that is my daily-to-work driver).

Today, I got my dogs, threw them into the bus. We were all looking  
forward to heading for the hills for a pleasant drive and some hiking.

Released the parking brake...my driveway happens to have a fairly  
steep incline, and normally when I release the hand brake, push the  
clutch in, the bus immediately rolls downhill out to the street. No  
need to shift into reverse.

I pushed the clutch in, and...no motion. She didn't budge. Shifted  
into reverse, and still wouldn't go. Brakes are totally locked. Tried  
the hand brake a few more times, and no go, brakes won't release.  
Brake pedal feels pretty stiff too.

Any thoughts as to what my problem is (I'm guessing it's the hand  
brake), and what I might need to do other than see if my repair guy  
makes house calls?

Thank in advance, oh wise ones....

-MH
