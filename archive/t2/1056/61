Subject: Vanagons in local yard, Florida

Hey guys,

    I know this is a type 2 list, but occasionally I go to the junkyard on
Saturday to look for VW Bus parts, and whatever else for my cars. I didn't see
any Type-2s, but I saw 4 Vanagons. Two of them looked watercooled (with A/C)
and two of them were air cooled. The two watercooled ones (and one of the air
cooled ones) were in REALLY REALLY, REALLY good shape. The three good ones
were totally rust free, not a dent on them, and totally complete. Interiors
were immaculate as well, I mean, the interiors basically looked new. There was
a blue one, a white one, a beige one, and then a rusty green one.

The yard is U-Pull-It located in Davie, Florida. (in Fort Lauderdale). Take
I-95 to 595 (in Broward County). Take 595 West for about 1 mile, and take
SR7/441 SOUTH for 1 mile. The junkyard is located on the right-side.

Please forward this to any Vanagon lists you guys know of.

Parts are DIRT cheap here by the way.


Thanks!!!

Todd
