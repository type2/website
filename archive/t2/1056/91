It doesn't even *look* like the old busses.  

Okay, it *may* look like macroencephalitic inbred cousin of the vanagon
and Eurovan, combined with some DNA from Jimmy Durante....

But a "New Microbus" it ain't.   

The old hippies aren't pining for their lost youth.  They aren't
depressed about their bus no longer being "cool".   They're crushed that
VW would produce such a fugly vehicle and compare it to their cherished
splittie.   I didn't see the "interest in recapturing their youth by
buying an overpriced, cheaply made cookie-cutter minivan" when that
abortion from Toyota drove by.  I instead saw the maniacal gleam that
usually proceeds one of the MythBusters deciding "If two ounces of
gunpowder doesn't do it, 400 pounds of C4 should get it done...."  

As for that rolling shoebox-with-doorstop-for-a-nose.... 

Yeah... I'd roll that.  



Right out the back of a C-130 transport at 20,000 feet, into the city
dump.  

They can have my fatchick when they exhume the 20' cube of concrete me &
the bus are interred in, chip away all the concrete and pry the steering
wheel from my cold, arthritic, hands.  

But they'll never get the grin off my face.
