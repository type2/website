Subject: 1776 SP or DP

Michael,

You should do fine with the single port arrangement.  Certainly  
either way (SP or DP) your 1776 bus will still be underpowered.

Mark Dearing's advice is spot on.  One step is to put a tuned  
extractor exhaust on ~ $100.  The most noticeable difference would be  
to put dual carbs on, but dialing them in is usually a challenge ~  
$400.  (I appreciate a challenge.)

I don't think that putting a 34PICT on will deliver much more  
performance.  I haven't seen an adapter for that - I have an adapter  
for putting a 30 PICT on a DP manifold.  I THINK I have a 34 PICT  
center piece and single port end castings that should do the trick.   
The advantage of a SP head over a DP head is that they aren't prone  
to cracking like the DP heads sometimes do.
