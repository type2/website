Subject: List and Type2.com

I once again will offer my technical assistance or volunteer in any way I can
to help.

But I do want to say one last thing and then I will "sit down" and "shutup"...
This list and Type2.com is my top resource, like so many have already said.
It is where I go first before doing almost anything on my bus and I have even
relied on many of you for assistance on my other VWs.  I belong to a local VW
club but nothing like this list and the website has the repository of
knowledge and people that I trust and use like this group.  TheSamba is a
great resource to, as are other VW websites, but the Type2 Library and the
list archives and these wonderful people that make up this list put the
"Volks" in Volkswagen.  No matter what is decided, I will understand and
support the decision.  After all change is everywhere and is inevitable.  If
the list and website goes away, I would like to request (if possible) a copy
of the pages and list so that I could look into making a mirror site.  Or, at
least, ask if the content can be mirrored to another VW resource, like
TheSamba.  But more importantly, I would also ask that we find a way for the
people here to remain connected and in contact with one another.  It is the
biological, not just the technological, element that I would miss the most.

Let me know what you all decide and let me know if I can assistance in any
way.

Sincerely,
