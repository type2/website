Subject: Re: [T2] rear brake shoes.

Bob, mine doesn't use those, but a couple weeks ago I bought brake shoes and spent several hours trying to install them with spring issues - finally remembering to compare these shoes to the old ones - Only 1 of the 4 was a match! The holes were in different places. Perhaps you have a similar situation?
