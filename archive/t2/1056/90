Using a  big screwdriver, lever the spring around the inside of the lever
and put  the hooked end around the lever.  Be careful that you don't  put
yourself in the position of getting injured if something lets  go.



hello george     It doesn't take a real big screwdriver  to do this also 
there isn't a whole lot of room. I use a philps head one that is  about 6 ins long 
and has a round shaft on it as it slides off easier.
I have seen some that the lever would not come off and have replaced the  
spring with it still attached. I remove the set screw and slide the arm and  
lever out as much as possible. be sure to line the bushing hole back up before  
replacing the set screw. Good luck  later  mark  d
