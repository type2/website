Subject: 81 air cooled, engine tear down

getting lots of answers on this on, but none are working yet. Looking for
someone familiar with replacing the pistons and cylinders on an 81 air
cooled vanagon engine.

To get right to the point, how in the heck do I get the wrist pin out of
number four piston, the one closest to the oil cooler?

The other three were easily pressed out with a long bolt and some PVC pipe
to create a sort of a puller, but there seems no way to get out old number
four.

The case is in the way of pressing it out towards the rear of the engine,
and there is no hope of getting that circlip out of that side anyway. I
removed the clip from the front side, but there is nothing I can think of,
that will press the wrist pin out from the  other end. Its in there pretty
good, lots of miles on  her :-)

Those who have done it, will know what I mean. Many have said to pull the
oil cooler, but that is not what is blocking the way. The case itself is too
close to where the pin is, to get anything in there.

I have been told to order Jake Raby's DVD to find out how to do it. Okay, I
give. I can't spare fifty bucks, but I did rent it. Then they told me it was
out of  stock, and might take a few weeks to get one back to send to me, so
please, if anyone knows this secret that is being held for ransom for $$
:-) would you share it with me? I should be done with this project by now,
but this one has me stumped. I was seriously considering just reusing the
old piston, clean it up nice, clean the ring grooves, and put new rings on
it, but that only comes to mind, when I am totally frustrated at how long
this is taking.

Anyone have the correct answer, and willing to share it, for free? :-)

Thanks much,
