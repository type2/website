Subject: So, what do we need to do to prop up the Type2 list?

Hi Volks:

I've read through all of the email, and want to be sure, that since we 
feel this list is good, someone has started setting in motion plans to 
save the list and the site.  This will take money, something not a lot 
of us have, and maybe expertise to run the site if the people running it 
need to rest a spell.

I'd suggest setting up a monthly voluntary "fee" of the list of $5 per 
person to go into a paypal or similar account.  We set up a "club# and 
elect officers to basically handle the money end (we might already have 
this?).

We figure out the location we will host from, and if necessary all of us 
who have offered servers ship them in..  Ssince my server would cost 
$100 to ship across country, we might want to see if there are better 
ones nearby the place which hosts the site.  But we HAVE offered of 
equipment and should be able to handle that angle for cost of gas for 
shipping..

I am working two jobs after a partial layoff AND going to school at 54.  
So I can't lead this effort, but I can HELP get it going.

Maybe other people have other ideas/.

Please let us know.  Fell free to email or call me if something I said 
here makes sense.

BEN
