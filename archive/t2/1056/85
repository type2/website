It is true! .. every time I see that ad I yell at the TV !
I wasn't aware it wasn't North American... and just aimed at Canada.. but I
really don't care about the Vw after 1979 anyway.. lol

Vw did this before... I think it is a planned "crisis"....  cause everyone
will TALK talk talk about it..
remember when they dropped the beetle from the helicopter,, and had to come
out with the appology ads.. from our humble beginings ?

first they insult the buyers..... then they let them talk about the new
product line in an uproar... then they regain the respect and confidence and
trust ... by back pedalling....

is that what a con man does?
