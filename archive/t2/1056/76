Sometimes those wrist pins are a pretty snug fit, even when new. If you can
get a heat gun to the underside of the piston, heating the wrist pin bore
will make things a lot easier. I've had to do this on NEW pistons to get the
pins in, but no driver or puller was necessary; they just slid right in.

arbitrarily the first principle of association, 'the guarantee to every one
of a free exercise of his industry, and the fruits acquired by it.'"
