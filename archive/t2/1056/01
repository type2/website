They may not be much traffic on the list.  But I know there are people like me that read it each day but don't say anything.  I have been reading the list for years, but may have actually posted maybe twice.  This post is a rarity for me.

I know I would be glad to help support the list financially.  I have no computer skills to offer, but there sounds like there is plenty of those talents already.   Please make sure to post what the final verdict will be, and what $$ would be needed.   
I am one that dosen't like the forums on TS.  Love the TS for everything else.  I like the list because it brings what I am interested in too me, I don't have to go look for it.

Thanks,
