Subject: Re: [T2] Replacing clutch return spring

This happened to my daughter's bus-we did an on the spot fix that is 
still working, using a small eyebolt through the engine compartment wall 
to which is fastened a spring (selected at hardware store) whose other 
end goes around the release lever just below the cable- has worked that 
way over a year, no more sagging pedal!
