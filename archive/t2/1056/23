Subject: engine tin

 Does anyone know where I can find half decent engine tin for my '78 Westy?
I don't care what the condition of it is as long as it is one piece.

 

First of all, I'm relatively new to type2.com. I found this site through
ratwell.com, but I might as well throw my two cents in.

I'm all for the "KISS" (keep it simple stupid) method of running the site.
The only rule I have is to be civil to one another. 

Not everyone is an expert. When I was in the Navy, my chief said that "the
only stupid question is the one you don't ask." 

Take the answers to your questions graciously. If you don't like the answer,
say "thank you" anyway. 

There are many places to find the correct answer to any question.

 

Well, there you have my brief minute of philosophy.

 

Be safe and drive far.
