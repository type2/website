Ned: My story is much like yours; I read every message and follow the 
threads with great interest.
In my case, it was Steve Dolan whom I met when he went way out of his 
way on a winter night to drive to my house and pretzel himself under 
the dashboard to show me how to remove the ignition switch from my 
'71.
Without the list, I'd have gone on to other passions.
