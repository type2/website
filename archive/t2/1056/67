  78 Bus shifter problem


> Hello, I have a 1978 Bus that has spawned a shifter problem,

Late this past summer our '78 van developed a similiar problem in that it 
wouldn't go in or come out of  1st, 2nd, or reverse unless you shut the 
engine off.  I pulled the engine expecting to find clutch or throwout 
bearing problems but they appeared fine.  What was shot was the bushings 
holding the arm that holds the throwout and pivots when the clutch is 
depressed. (the name for this part eludes me at this time)  After replacing 
the bushings and thowout bearing we haven't had anymore trouble.  I'm sure 
there are many other things that can cause this problem but this was our 
experience.  Good luck, Thomas
