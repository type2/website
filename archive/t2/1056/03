Since lately, most of the traffic on the Type2 and Vintage list has been
about the demise of the list, and, well, that seems to say a lot.



Could we get back to discussing the proper tires to use on our beloved
vehicles, or oil, or even vacuum issues?



Has anyone lately read Washington's farewell address? Will the Type2 [slowly
fade away] be as well remarked?



Do you know why, in the English language, it is not considered acceptable to
split an infinitive?



Is there more to WIKI than some 'cyclopedia?



Did anyone recently look at Bob Hoover's BLOG and wish him well?  Or do we
only consider our friends and sages after they have left us?  [

And who are YOU to criticize ME!!!



              [Yes, it HAS been a good day so far]
