Just as a thought, you might get ahold of Greg Merrit of vwtype3.org  
and see what he's doing as far as hosting.  I know the Type 3 list  
has a bounced-message-unsubscribe function and some message filtering  
going on, so wherever he's hosting it (possibly a server in his  
closet for all I know) may be able to handle the T2.com list as it's  
set up now without too much hassle.  And unless he's sold it since I  
was last at his house in Oakland (2001, sheesh has it been that  
long?) he's got an early Baywindow in the driveway.

Dunno why the idea to suggest this didn't occur to me earlier...
