I don't know what kind of tach you have exactly, but I recently fitted a VDO 
tach myself (to my '71) - in the hole sometimes occupied by a clock.

As I tried to confirm the wiring of the tach, I tried the "always live" "fan 
on the dash" 12V supply which worked really well until I turned off the 
ignition and the engine kept running. Apparently the coil was receiving 
power, via the tach. Also, not wanting to get into the fuse box, I used a 
temp solution: the dash mounted switch for the fan. I hooked the tach power 
to the "non-live" side of the switch. I drove to work like that for a week 
and friends all thought it was hilarious that I had to turn off my tach to 
turn off the engine (and that I had to flip a switch to turn on the tach).

I have since connected the tach to a terminal at the back of the fuse panel 
which is powerd by the key switch. The supply is not as steady (the tach 
bounces around a bit) but at least the key is the only switch ;-).

Cheers,
Bruce
