One possibility I haven't seen mentioned it the possibility of a Type2.com
web forum.

It wouldn't replace TS because it would be a private forum, just as the
list is private.  Standards of civility and topicality could be enforced.
The forum wouldn't be accessable until the user subscribes and an
email address is provided, just as it is now.

Upsides:  easier-to-use interface, threading, ability to show pictures in
posts.

Downsides:  Bandwith possibly higher, archiving issues, not available
through traditional email.

I'm a physics geek, not a computer geek, so I don't know the ins and outs
of running a forum.  I do run a freebie forum for my students on
invisionfree.com, but I don't archive anything.
