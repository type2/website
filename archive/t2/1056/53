Subject: RE: 1776sp (was 30PICT... and others)

My apologize to the group.  The original email when converted to plain text
made my ">" turn to "X".  This makes reading my post confusing.

Bottom line... I am going to try to find an adapter plate and "reverse/flip"
it to try to make my 34PICT-3 work.  If not, I will probably pull the engine
and combine the middle from my old dual port intake with the cut off ends from
an old single port intake and mount the 34PICT-3.  In the meantime, I am going
to see what I can do about my exhaust.  What I have seems to conflict with the
mustache bar but it may can be modified.  Any suggestions on the adapter
plate, modifying the intake(s), or with the exhaust would be great.

Thanks again everyone,

Michael
