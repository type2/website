Yup, I went through all the other stuff first.  I've gone through 3
different Bosch manuals looking for hints.  The new AFM is from a 76
bus.  My bus is a 77 Westy manufactured in 76.  Both AFM's are of the
7 pin variety.  The part numbers are different but, I was of the
understanding that the L-Jetronic AFM was flexible in its use between
models - the new one works, its just a bit flat.  In fact, like I
stated, it actually makes the engine operate smoother.  However, when
I install the new AFM, I have to turn the idle air mixture 2+ turns
clockwise to bring the idle back to normal.  I picked up the new AFM
to have a spare for long trips.  I'd still like to have the absolutely
best performance and fuel economy that I can get and if that could
help to increase longevity, I would be happy with that too.

If the mixture adjustment screw is primarily there for idle, how can
you dial in the AFM?

I'm with you there.

That test seems good.

Its fine.

Temp sensor #2 is good.  Where is temp sensor #1?

I've check this recently, it holds pressure for a pretty long time.
Well over a few minutes.

Do you say this because of the backfiring?  I think that the leakage
may be at the connection of the header to the head.  I had quite a bit
of trouble getting them to seal.  I'll check them again once I have
the spare time.

Thanks for you comments,
