Subject: Timing gun issues...

Hi everyone,
    I just bought a direct connection timing gun and I thought I'd test it out, but I'm having some problems.  I hooked the negative to the negative and the positive to a ground, and I unplugged the first spark plug and inserted the spark plug spring wire, like the instructions said.  However, I can't get a light out of it.  I can look inside the end (I know this is dangerous) and see something spinning and sparking around, but it won't project onto my scale.  Has anyone had this problem before, or does anyone know what I could possibly be doing wrong or what could be wrong with the gun?  Thanks for you help in advance.

-Rob
