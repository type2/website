Subject: Re: [T2] Scratching sound on acceleration

John, look for something that is loose and moving to
contact a rotating part of the engine on accel. Also
look for loose bolts at starter and all of the clutch
housing bolts. Look for something in the well where
the crankshaft pulley is. Grab the alternator belt and
pull it hard to see if alternator is anchored
properly. Finally, look for something in the airflow
of the heater / defroster like a piece of paper that
is rattling at a certain frequency - of course if you
have had the heat totally off, that is eliminated
already. - BaH
