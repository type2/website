Okay, wait for it:

In a strange case of reality echoing fiction, Vespa's parent company  
Piaggio is now testing a couple of prototype HyS hybrid gasoline/ 
electric scooters in Milan. The company has developed two versions,  
based on their Vespa LX 50 and the more sleek and powerful Piaggio X8  
125 (125cc gas & 2500W electic motor). The combination of electric  
and gas engines provides approximately 25% more power, helping to  
alleviate fuel consumption when starting or accelerating. It also  
reduces gasoline consumption by 20%. The scooter can also operate in  
locations where combustion engine fumes would be undesirable (inside  
buildings or covered areas) by switching into a low-speed "electric  
only" mode.

Not quite ready for prime time...BUT, right around the corner. One of  
my cousins (Roman) who works for Piaggio confirms that this is the  
real deal.

So...we wait.

In the meantime, there are some larger ATVs and Scooters/Cycles out  
there that run diesel/biodiesel.
