Yes, it does. Read down on page 4:

Connect the spring adaptor and spark plug
lead between the spark plug (or distributor
cap) and the removed wire as shown in Figure
1. Route the timing lights spark plug wire away
from the exhaust manifold and surrounding
hot areas to prevent damage.
4. Connect the RED clip to the positive (+)
battery terminal.
5. Connect the BLACK clip to a secure engine
ground such as the alternator bracket or
engine block. For safety reasons, do not
use the negative (-) battery terminal or fuel
system components as a ground connection
point.
