 So I just replaced the original GR17X generator on
 my 71' with a new
 Bosch GR15N and have two questions.
 
 1) the new gen, being about 1-2 inches shorter,
 leaves very little
 clearance between the 34pict3 carb and the belt -
 about 1/4 inch. Can
 I put shims in front of the belt pulley to push it
 out a bit? Any
 other ideas?

* Yes, take it off and send it back. You got the WRONG
one. The GR15N is a 30 Amp generator. Your 71 requires
the GR17 which is a 38 amp generator. It is longer.
The mounting tin is 38 amp. The hub is 38 amp. The
pulley is 38 amp. But the biggest concern is the
voltage regulator.... it is 38 amp also. You cannot
use it on a 30 amp generator.

 2) the pulley nut (19mm) from my old gen doesn't fit
 the new one, it
 is too small. Anyone know the right size? Do I need
 to order a special
 one or can I pick one up at a hardware store?

* Start over with all the correct parts!

And your bus is NOT 71 feet long. When you put the '
after a number it means FEET. To abbreviate a number,
you use the ' to take the place of the number: 1971
becomes '71. Basic English 101.....
