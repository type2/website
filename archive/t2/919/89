All the pre-terminated packaged wire sets I have looked at have been overpriced junk compared to the Bosch set. Especially avoid anything that says "with Aftermarket Style Boots".

Even the over the counter Bosch sets for Asian/Domestic cars are junk but luckily the European style sets made for VWs are still high quality. With the stock ignition, my advice is to stick with Bosch especially at that price point.
