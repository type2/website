We had the same problem with the '79 for a while - usually when the weather 
turned foggy or damp. (we live at the beach). First we replaced the cold 
start sensor over the #3 cylinder. Easy fix, but that didn't fix it for 
long. If I can remember correctly, it ended up being a wiring harness to the 
EFI sensor that measures the ambient temperature in the engine compartment. 
Sorry, I can't remember what it's called. I'll try to look it up in my 
receipts. On later models with EFI, that sensor regulates the fuel mixture 
depending on the ambient temp., but if it gets cooler and foggy, bus will 
cut out (I think the engine actually floods) after a few blocks, a 
half-mile, or just long enough to get to the market. You'd think a warm-up 
would help - but it never did for us until we replaced the wiring harness.
