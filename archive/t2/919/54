Subject: OTP - Electric bike conversions when camping etc.

I realize this is somewhat off topic, but who better to ask than a bunch of
campers that by their badge of vehicle ownership pretty much say " let's take
the road less travelled", or else, are into tinkering.

I've been keeping my eye on the price of gas when commuting, and let's be
frank; it ain't gonna go down. Mr Harper up here in Canada, and Mr. Bush are
NOT going to give up their lifestyle by giving me a break on gas, so I'm
looking at commuting much more cheaply. The latest Electric bike conversions
utilizing a hub motor are indeed starting to look good. With claimed distances
of 30Km on a charge at up to 32Kmp/H I'm definitely interested. Does anyone
have any real world experience with one of these? I would especially like to
know if I can really just sit back and the let the bike climb a hill for me,
while I wave royally at the people sweating it out to make the same incline?
:-)
Curiously yours,
Courtney
