Hi Courtney,

I have my radio wired to the battery full-time and it has not been a  
problem. The LED on the faceplate does not draw enough power to worry  
about, even if the bus stays put for a week or more. If I am away  
from the bus any longer than that I usually pull off the faceplate,  
and the radio and battery have lived like that in harmony for months  
at a time over the winter.

I'd suggest you check out the current draw when off before  
permanently instaling the radio, in case you happen to have a more  
thirsty rig like Bruce does.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
