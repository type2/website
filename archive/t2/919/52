Subject: Re: [T2] Adjusting FI mixture without an EGA

So, after your post, I start poking around as well and I'm looking to 
get the LC-1 from Innovate.  It runs about $200 which isn't that bad and 
for the tunability it can't be beat.  It looks like you can hook it up 
to a laptop to watch your AFR, but even better is when it's teamed up w/ 
the megasquirt for full air/fuel ratio control throughout the entire 
throttle range.

After pulling apart my engine, I noticed that the tops of my cylinders 
were a bit blue.  I really need to get my AFRs dialed in to drop those 
head-temps.  I'm gonna pick one up in the next few days and I'll post 
the results.

thanks,
Mike
