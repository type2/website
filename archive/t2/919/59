I think you can get realtime data, you just need to have a laptop.

I'm kinda curious how consistently the stock system holds the AFR.

Also, in regards to one of your previous posts about your mixture being 
funky when you changed out AFMs -- I don't know if you said you got a 
new one or are using a different AFM, but the contacts under the wiper 
do wear out and that could be causing you problems as well...
