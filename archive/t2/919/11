Subject: Black wire with white stripes?

I have a black wire with white stripes coming off my old cassette deck that's
being replaced, but cannot for the life of me figure it's purpose. It
disappears into the depths of my dash towards the front bulkhead of my 77
Westy. My Bentley is useless as it's in black and white, and I don't really
speak schematic anyway. :-) I am thinking (dangerously)    that this may be a
lighting wire for the display??? Any help on this?
Thanks,
Courtney
