Subject: Future VW bus design study or what?

Remember a few years ago I posted up a site that had a design study on VW
campers and what the future might look for a future VW camper.  This is a
video from that site back then!

Now there is a new solar bus video that I thought I would share!  Neat stuff!
Here is a free one for you!~ http://www.verdier.ca/images/3d.jpg
