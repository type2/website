Holy Man, BatShlt. As you know, with key on start, fuel pump gets 
volts from switch. When the key is in run (after starting), the fuel 
pump gets it's volts from the switch in the AFM. Sounds to me like 
you simply must have wiring fouled up. Either hooked up wrong or 
cross feed in a worn harness. That is just pure logic. I would hook 
up a volt meter to the fuel pump + terminal and verify volts during 
testing to confirm what's happening.
