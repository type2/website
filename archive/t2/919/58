scrap the stock setup and hook up the megasquirt.  You'll actually be 
able to control your AFR.  It was amazing how easily I passed the smog 
test, and I think my egr was clogged, too.

by adjusting the spring tension of the flapper door.  You have to pop 
off the lid and use a screwdriver and twist the big wheel a few gear 
teeth at a time.

It's integral in the AFM.  If I remember correctly, the bentley explains 
how to test it.
