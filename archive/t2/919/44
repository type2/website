Subject: Rebuilding Options?

Hey there folks -
  So I just returned from a 3 week business trip in Oregon.  I did as
much research as I could while I was out there, but I was quite busy
and didn't really find as much info as I was hoping.  I have a 1800cc
(I think..the stamp on the crankcase says AP, but the fan shroud says
CB) thats in need of a rebuild. From what I found, 1800cc P/C's aren't
readily available anymore and most of my fasteners probably need
replacing as well as they're quite rusty.  There doesn't really seem
to be any rebuild kits for the 1800cc's either, the closest thing I've
found is the Raby "Camper Special".  Right now that seems to be the
direction I'm leaning towards, since I can't really find any other
options (other then buying all the parts I need individually, which
I'd rather not do). I'm not really sure what the inside of the engine
looks like as I haven't cracked the case yet.  Any thoughts would be
appreciated.

Also, can someone tell me the size of the studs that hold the case to
a 2-armed engine yoke?  I recieved this bus with the engine already
pulled and the studs don't seem to be in the engine or on the tranny.
Thanks in advance
