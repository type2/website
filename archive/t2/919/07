Clogged fuel filter
AFM flap sticking
something blocking the outlet in the fuel tank
don't assume, verify spark and volts to coil during event
Run long lead to a volt meter, hook it up to the fuel pump, monitor 
voltage until fault occurs

The fuel pump cannot run without power from the AFM. If it does when 
the AFM is unhooked, it is verification that false voltage is getting 
to the pump via a wiring snafu somewhere. That's an absolute certainty.
