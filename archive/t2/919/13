Subject: dipstick seal????

happy Sunday folks!   I was out tweaking with the 74 fuel injected single cab and pulled out the dipstick while the engine was running.  The idle speed of the engine dropped dramatically and picked back up when I put the dipstick back in.  My question is:  do FI buses have a seal at the top of the dipstick to keep the engine vacuum where it ought to be?  The reason I ask this is my engine still has the stock dual carb (long) dipstick and I don't see a seal on it anywhere.  I was just wondering if I should get a proper FI dipstick to make sure the crankcase is sealed as it should be.  thanks!  Greg
