My gosh, that is a dumb question!  Every third grader knows the answer to
that one!  You should be ashamed to ask such a question to which
even the cockroaches under my sink are yelling the answer!

Just kidding!  There is no such thing as dumb questions, just stupid
mistakes that come from not asking!  :)

I used "exterior" grade double-sided foam tape to stick the glass to the
housing and then ran a bead of hot-melt glue around the exterior edge to
fill the gap.  Leave a little drain hole on whatever edge you consider to
be the bottom.  I considered using black RTV sealer, but was worried that
it might attack the silvering on the back side of the mirror.  Others
might have more data.

This was on a set of Hagus replacement mirrors.  The glass and metal are
excellent, no corrosion at all.  The plastic bead that holds the glass
into the mirror deteriorated over the years.  I wish I could just find a
replacement bead, but quite a bit of searching yielded nothing usable.
