Here's what Tuna Can says about AP:

AP  '74-'75 VW Transporter   7.3:1  68hp  Only sold in Europe.  Came with
dual carbs.

CB talks to a 1700:

CB  1972-73 VW Transporter   7.3:1 63hp (-at-) 4800, 81 Ft-lb (-at-) 3200   Dual-carb,
manual trans. "Manual" trans indicates it was made by Mexicans  ;-)

Check thesamba for 1800 P&C.  Yes, we know, AA Performance, they were made
in China, but can we lay aside some of our big-a-tree here....
