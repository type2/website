Unless I'm missing something, is there a reason you hooked up the 
positive to a ground?  I'm not exactly sure what a direct connection 
timing gun is, but I usually connect my red lead (positive) to the 
positive battery terminal (or +12 lead on coil) and the black lead 
(negative) to the frame.  Then I put the pickup around the wire to plug 
#1 and time away.
