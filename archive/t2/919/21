Subject: Re: [T2] Timing a unique engine.

From Stevie Havoc:

So I am seeking some advice on timing my new engine setup.
 
I've got a freshly built 2L with Dual Kadrons and an Aircooled.net  
SVDA with Petronix and I have been mulling over  my timing and would  
like your suggestions !
 
After a jaunt across town the oil temp hit 220 while chugging along  
and the block was definitely hot to the touch. I think my Cylinder  
head temp gauge isn't wired correctly because it didn't read anything  
so I will look at that. She ran smoothly though a tad gutless. I was  
thinking that perhaps my timing was out as I checked mixture and  
jetting on the carbs and that seems to be right.
 
Anyways, I would love input on what a good timing would be !

I would start at 7.5 before with no vacuum. Hopefully you have a ported
source?
