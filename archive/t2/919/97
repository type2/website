	It is easy, if you want to do it, to make
an electric vehicle (e.g a VW beetle with changed
innards) to burn rubber at 70 mph.  The issue is
the compromise between power, range, and weight.
Few have struck lately what I consider a better
compromise than the long-gone Sinclair C5.

	big deal, as New Yorkers sarcastically
say  -  a marginal improvement in what is not v
impressive economy.  Judicious use of air
injection can do a lot better:

Peugeot scooters now have this; Bajaj were
supposed to several y ago.

	- giving what range?  (I couldn't get that Google translation to work)

	IMHO what's needed is a hybrid with a
tiny air-injected stroker ca.35cc working near
flat-out; decent battery volume but without
making the vehicle too heavy; and a 1-bhp boost
for hills, overtaking etc ;-) viz. pedals.  The
mopeds were a good start; modern versions
thereof, with electric 'hill-smoothing', could be
good.  My usual city runabout for a decade has
been a Jawa 50cc (soupled to ca.4 bhp); it is
almost traffic-compatible despite happening to be
the 'sport' model lacking pedals.  The Suzuki
"Street Magic." 50cc does 70 km/h (40 mph).
	Metal-air fuel cells e.g Zn/air or
Al/air, developed at Livermore natl lab etc, look
very promising, especially if not only electrodes
but also the alkaline electrolyte can be changed
at 'filling' stations.  This would seem easier
than the hydrogen fantasies  ...
	  A lo-rust bus with ruined powertrain
could be a good testbed for some of the
technology mentioned.  Waiting for Vespa, Bajaj,
VW etc corps to produce something sensible is not
working out well ...  In all friendliness I'm
confident these are more worthwhile ideas than
any 'water-powered' concept.

	BTW anyone who fails to slap regenerative
braking on an electric vehicle should be viewed
with scepticism.
