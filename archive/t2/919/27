So you have run all the tests, but not during the time
that it won't start? May be wise to leave the fuel
pressure gauge on there a few days and maybe a
voltmeter hooked to the fuel pump so when the event
occurs, you can actually diagnose on location. Also
leave a timing light hooked up to the coil wire
instead of #1 plug wire. You can rig a timing light
through the rear hatch so you can see it from the rear
view mirror.When it starts to cut out, look at the
light. You DO need to figure out why there is power to
the pump when the AFM is unplugged. Did you carefully
inspect the wire connectors within the big plastic
plugs for the double relays? Is that ground wire well
secured? How about the keyswitch? Is it nice and crisp
in its action or real wishy-washy? Could be all right
there. -BaH
