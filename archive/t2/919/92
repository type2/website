Subject: new generator questions

So I just replaced the original GR17X generator on my 71' with a new
Bosch GR15N and have two questions.

1) the new gen, being about 1-2 inches shorter, leaves very little
clearance between the 34pict3 carb and the belt - about 1/4 inch. Can
I put shims in front of the belt pulley to push it out a bit? Any
other ideas?

2) the pulley nut (19mm) from my old gen doesn't fit the new one, it
is too small. Anyone know the right size? Do I need to order a special
one or can I pick one up at a hardware store?

Thanks much,

Ryan
