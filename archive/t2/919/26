Bus is "chugging" Chugging is usually very rich
although there is no mention of black smoke. Goes
along with pulling hills well but then on flats and
downhills it's crappy (my interpretation)

I would look for these things first: If she has hit a
bump or RR crossing hard recently, one of the "formed"
vacuum hoses may have come loose from its connection
but because they are a formed shape, they stay put and
look like they are connected. They all need to be
grabbed hold of and securely seated in their
connections That is, the hoses that attach to the big
"S" hose between the throttle body and the AFM / air
filter, and the other ends of those hoses.
Next item, pull the electrical plug connection off of
the cold start injector near the distributor. Leave it
disconnected until you've diagnosed the problem unless
the ambient temp is below 50 degrees - it only works
(supposedly) below 50 degrees. Next item is the temp
sensor #2 which is just ahead of #3 spark plug (see my
photos for exact position - link in my sig) Unplug it
(wire pulls out of the little plastic connector) and
measure resistance between the end of the wire and a
clean ground surface. At about room temp, the
resistance should be about 2400 ohms. Above 70 degrees
the resistance is less, below 70 degrees, it goes up,
so if it's around 65 or so, around 2800 or so is good.
Ratwell has a chart on his website, but close is
definitely close enough.

(black smoke should have accompanied the chugging for
the sensor and the coldstart injector {thermo time
switch, actually}and usually the loose hose will
result in a no-run-at-all situation) -BaH
