Subject: Re: [T2] Clicking sound up front when applying brakes

Anton - Check your front wheel bearings first. Once I
had an itermittent clicking sound from the speedometer
cable only while braking. Could be a crud build-up on
the rotor that contacts the splash shield when
braking, or something else on the rotor, or even a
loose caliper, but everything should stay relatively
aligned in all situations if your wheel bearings are
good. -BaH
