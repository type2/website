FWIW, the problem is FI, not ignition. We have spark throughout.  The  
system is going full, wet the plugs, rich.  The cold start valve is  
not the culprit as it's been unhooked for months.  At this point,  
based on the suggestions of many, I'm leaning toward a short or  
broken wire.  It has always 'smelled' like a double relay issue and  
others' opinions have pointed me further that direction. The obvious  
issue of continuing to run with the AFM disconnected and not starting  
until the power to the double relay is removed seals the diagnosis.  
Now to sit down with the wiring diagram and find the circuit that  
will allow that to happen....

BTW, there is a website with a good explanation of the double relay  
function. Does anyone happen to have it in their bookmarks?

Thanks all.

Jim
