Subject: Free engine in NC

Hi everyone,
This is probably really more for the vintage list, but I'm not a member of 
it and some of you may be interested.
I took an engine from a guy who was going to throw it out that I really have 
no use for.
I think he said it is from a 55 singlecab.  He said it was running before he 
took it out, but then it sat out for a couple years.  Now it is sitting in 
my yard.  I'm not real familiar with the early engines, but I suppose it 
could possibly be rebuilt or used for parts.
I'm in Pittsboro/ chapel Hill, NC
Let me know if you're interested and feel free to pass it on to the vintage 
list.
Thanks,
Kyle
