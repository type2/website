Subject: More on 75 Westy project FS, Knoxville TN

Had a fine visit from listmember Chris and Surge; we looked over my 
project and he offered me an alternative of help getting the engine in 
my Westy. So:

If I can't find a buyer for the entire project, I'd like to find someone 
in the Knoxville area who wants my 74 (I think) parts bus after I remove 
the parts I need. If someone has a place to put this bus and can take it 
before month's end, then I'd gladly give it away rather than taking it 
to the crushers. Might be able to help with transportation, as well.

Still looking for offers on both busses :-)

Cheers/The Fader
