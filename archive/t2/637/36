Wayne, you really, really, really don't want to use
the smog pump pully assembly for the AC compressor.
It is rubber mounted and the 1st time you engage the
compressor clutch, you will shear the shaft rubber
mount.

You want the pully that mounts between the fan and the
hub. It takes the place of the spacer.

I may have one in my driveway somewhere......
