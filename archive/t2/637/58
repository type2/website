The engine is a 78.  I don't know about the tranny.  I'm assuming it was a 
78 also.  The guy who is selling it had the bus for a couple months and 
drove it before it went bad.  Also, the guy who had it before him drove it 
too without a problem.  At least this is what the owner is telling me.

Thanks,
Kyle
