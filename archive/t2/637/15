Subject: variable resistance - part 2

I found this info.  Does it make sence with the radio shack potentiometers??

Using a pot as a variable resistor

Potentiometers can be converted and used as variable resistors. By 
connecting terminal 2 to terminal 3, A standard pot is converted to a 
variable resistor. The resistance can be changed by adjusting the pot for 0 
ohms to the full value of the potentiometer.




So, how many ohms should I be looking for to make 36 Amps at 14 Volts.  This 
will be a ball park figure.

Electricity is not my strong suite.
