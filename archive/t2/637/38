Wayne,

Ok, I was going to do a complete writeup, but here goes.

1978 Champagne edition switched to early model heater boxes and 
stainless steel exhaust from BD.
THere **was** a york compressor fitted in the beginning which I had 
already removed and replaced the cut up sheet metal with new 
parts....including a section that fit pretty well where the body had been 
cut out....got that one from Busted Bus...it works perfectly to just screw 
it in....I doubt that anyone has ever noticed that it wasn't welded back 
in.

Everything else bone stock(for now).


Sanden 508 with a 125mm pulley.  the 125mm pulley  is essential.

The sanden 508 *must* have the freon ports  exiting toward the side, 
*not* the end.

Like this one   
http://www.streetrodgarage.com/index.asp?PageAction=VIEWPROD&ProdID=392

But with the 125mm dual groove pulley where the inner pulley is made for 
the same kind of belt that is original on our buses(10mm IIRC).

The compressor mount adapter that BD sells, but we aren't going to use it
as an adapter to the original, but drill two new holes and mount it 
directly to the fan shroud.

The only problem here is that the mount adjustments go the wrong direction 
when used in this manner to use the adjusting arms.  If you try to use the 
adjustment arms, then the belt is pushed into the the oil cooler bracket.

My opinion was that the original mount didn't swing, but that the 
compressor was moved horizontally away from and toward the engine with a 
and adjustment screw and then tightened up on the bottom to lock it in 
place.

So, I modified the mount from BD to do something similar by drilling 
a couple of new holes in it and the using studs into the fan shroud
with nuts on the back side of the mount *and* the front side....I can 
adjust it out away from the shroud and then lock it down.  This method is 
not really the best, but will do until I revisit it this winter.

It twould be better if it had a hinge plate of some sort on it so that you 
could swing the whole mount out from the top and away from the 
engine....there is a lot more room to swing down than up...but not much..

The best thing however is to just come straight out from the fan shroud.

It then clears *all* of the frame and upper sheet metal easily with 90 
degree service ports on it.  The only bad part is that it is close enought 
to the frame to not be able to use the service ports on the 90 degree 
connectors...so you buy service port splices and put them right into the 
lines somewhere else.


Yes, it is about 2 inches just above the muffler with nothing between it 
and the muffler...but so is the apron in back.  A check after running down 
the interstate showed it to be about 160 degrees or so....probably not 
much different than when the compressor is running.


Hoses are routed along the *inside* of the frame rail to an almost 
straight shot up and over the pulley to the connectors.

Now, the good the bad and the ugly.

The really nice deal that Ron at BD was selling with the compressor and 
mount kit was great...except that his compressors had the freon ports 
coming out of the back(they would **never** clear that way).  I sent him 
pics of it sitting in my engine and he worked out a deal where he had the 
factory send the correct head plate for it.  *very* nice of him...but he 
was mystified as to why  no one else had contacted him about it not 
working!  The other bad part was that the compressor I got had the 132mm 
pulley on it.  I took it off and had a friend cut it down to 125mm.  This 
is critical!  Measure the clutch on your old York compressor. You don't 
have much room between the moustache bar and the 
oil cooler bracket anyway and the 7mm makes a *big* difference.
I do **not** recomend doing it this way...buy it with the correct pulley 
to start with as it takes 4 guys and some fancy language and the 
**correct** puller to get it off....and more fancy language to get it back 
on again with the correct armature air gap.

WORD OF WARNING...the compressors come to you ***DRY***  

You must add the oil to them before doing anything else!

A **big** round of applause to the NAPA folks....they hung with me for 
about 2 weeks while we got the correct 90 degree fittings for the 
compressor...those guys are great and they will work with you....**much** 
different than the other guys who say...whut???...you need a whut???..for 
whut kinda car????  They also were very nice while I traded belts three 
different times to get the right fit....they will deal with you when you 
say I need one that is XXXXmm long.  I no longer go anywhere else as I 
have found that they are **very** competitive compared to autozone and 
some others.

Took 3 cans of Freeze 12 and I am COOL!...as I said 44 degree air right 
down the neck!

I know you are going to want pics, maybe I can do it this weekend.

More questions?

Cheers, dave
