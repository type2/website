Subject: Re: Bay window & Vanagon jack points?

I p-mailed my original response to Mr. Elliot.

There seems to be some confusion here...

I own both a bay and a V'gon. The bay has square jack point holes (at 
least on my '77 model 23). The V'gon has round holes (on my '82 and my 
'83.5).  The jack point holes are different. So the answer to Mr. 
Elliot's question is, "No. They are not the same."

Will one work on the other? Dunno, but it'll be a simple matter to 
check after bit. (Go Chargers!)

can be calculated in advance, and it becomes part of the ceremony.
