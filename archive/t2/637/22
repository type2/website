Subject: re: variable resistance 

Barry,

Don't go to VWofA except as a last resort. Also, the radio shack
potentiometers are much too small for automotive testing. A potentiometer
that would take 36 amps would be about the size and weight of a brick and
expensive. The best approach would probably be to go to a shop that
specializes in automotive electrical repairs only. This would be much
cheaper than VWofA. Every time I have gone to one of these, the guy could
diagnose the problem in the parking lot by taking a few measurements.
These can be hard to find in the yellow pages. Look under automotive
electrical, automotive starters, automotive generators, automotive
alternators. Also try all of the above without the "automotive" in front. My
yellow pages has it under just plain alternators. Try to steer clear of a
shop that does general automotive repairs and says that they do electrical
also. This could be hit or miss.

Good luck,
