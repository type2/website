Subject: Sorry...another seatbelt question

Have you looked to see if the seat belt mounting nuts are present under your 
rear seat? If so, any lap belt at all should do, whether from another bus in 
a wrecking yard, or from a VW or generic shop. Kragen/Checker/Shucks sells a 
generic seat belt for about $20 each.

alternative. Bear in mind, I'm only needing lap belts, at least for the next 
2
years or so.
