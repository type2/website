Chris --
         in my experience if the body is a terminal-cancer case, the 
mechanicals are not worth much either.  Forget the front axle tubes; and those 
light-metal-alloy cases suffer; not to mention the problem of working with 
badly corroded studs.  I stand by my recommendation, but in future I will not 
waste time on "wants" without background or search parameters

"My first reaction to your question is WHY you would wish a vehicle that is 
typically rusted to hell..."

Maybe he has a good shell and needs good mechanicals...  Chris
