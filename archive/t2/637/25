Wayne,

Finished my new A/C install about a month ago.

If you use the right sanden compressor with the right pulley and are 
willing to modify the mount that Ron at BD sells, you can get the whole 
thing to fit **under**  the original tin.

Yes, I can tell when the compressor kicks in, but I can still do 75+ while 
it is on.

Otherwise, there is an article in the library by David Schwartz about how 
to do it....plus pics...ummm...welll, there used to be pics, cause I have 
seen them.

Maybe David can provide a pointer to them.

My original VPC unit now blows 44 degree air down the back of my neck!!!

Cheers, dave
