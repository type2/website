I just ordered my CDI set-up from ACN yesterday.  I am assuming that 
your '76 has the stock FI?  If so, did you need the tach adapter in 
order to trigger the FI properly?  I included one in my order "just in 
case".

I'm looking forward to hooking mine up.  With the price of gas out 
here, 3-4 MPG improvement could save me a lot of money (and pay for the 
CDI rather quickly).

I'm considering using a wiring harness plug to connect the CDI to the 
ignition system, and wiring another "jumper plug" that would allow me 
to quickly go back to stock.  Anyone done this with their CDI set-up?
