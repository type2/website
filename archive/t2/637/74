I know this is for type 2 air cooled only list, I have a 1974 westy 
good running condition, however today i saw a 1984 westy for sale.  It 
is loaded with heat and a/c, propane stove and fridge.  It runs well, 
with auto tranny.  it only has 66,000 miles on it.  everything is there 
except upstairs bed.  it is missing.   owner is asking $5000 obo.  What 
do you think of these waterboxer westys?  any good, or problem child?  
Is asking price reasonable?  Appreciate all the insights and wisdom.  
thanks.
