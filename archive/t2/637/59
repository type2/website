I posted a request for assistance on my bug a while
back, ya I know it's a bug but I have to drive
something till my '79 Bus is back on the road! 

What would happen is that it would run for a while and
then died.  Well I finally got it running!!!  To do so
this is what I did and the result:
Replaced fuel lines - Still died
Replaced coil - Still died
Installed elecric fuel pump - Still died
Cleaned gas tank - Still died
Replaced auto choke - Still died
Disabled choke - Still died
Did tune up - Still died
The I took the carb apart and checked to float which
looked good.  Then I ran it for a bit and it died
again.  I took the carb apart and there was no gas in
it.  The float moved fine, I took the needle valve
thingie out and it moved up and down ok.  Then I
looked in the fuel inlet part where I took out the
needle valve and saw something in there.  I got it out
and it was a little sliver of the hose, about the
shape of an arrowhead.  What was happening was it
would float around in there, settle down over the hole
and starve the carb.  Once removed and carb was back
together it run nearly as good as a bus, just not as
fun.

Once you eliminate the complicated, it's always
something simple.
