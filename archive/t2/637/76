I just sold my 84 Westy (see http://www.californiawesty.com ) after 
owning a 72 westy.

I plan to buy another Vanagon series westy in the spring.

While the Bay windows westies have a better vibe, the Vanagon series 
are much sweeter once you actually spend time in one.  Real engine 
heat is great.  They drive more like a car.  They have a bit more 
power.  The fridge and Stove are wonderful.   There is more room 
inside.  Visibility is much better because the closet is on the 
drivers side, not the passenger side like a 72.

The waterboxer is a PITA with its retarded cooling system.  You'll 
probably have to replace the head gaskets and cooling 
hoses/radiator/water pump any minute, but aside from that they propel 
the van well and get 20MPG, about the same as a Bay Westy.  If your 
engine gets hosed you can always install a subaru engine!

The upstairs bed may not be installed because the roof was a 
chop-shop roof.  i.e. make sure it was a westy poptop from the 
factory, not bolted on by someone at a later date.

How good is the body?  West Coast Vanagons seem to last longer than 
Bay Buses, but East Coast Vanagons rot away quite easily.

However, $5000 seems like a great deal if it truly has 66k miles, run 
a carfax report to get that verified.  You'll have to learn about 
water cooled engines but there is lots of help available on the 
vanagon mailing list.
