Subject: OT: Pre-71' Ghia Wanted for my '62 Ford Falcon

OFF TOPIC:

If anyone in Northern CA/Bay Area is or knows someone who dabbles in the
'other' classics, I am currently looking for a home for my beloved '62
Falcon, Stuart. My goal is to trade it for, or get cash and buy, an old
Ghia. This isn't for me... I'm in love with buses and campers. (And,
frankly, at 6'7" my hubby won't fit in a Ghia. He doesn't fit in the Facon,
either. Anoher reason to say good-bye to that vehicle, since I am keeping
the husband.)

The Ghia is for a mechanic friend in Germany. We are both 30 and go back
fifteen years together, since I stayed exchange with his family; he's a
brother to me. He has always wanted a Ghia, and he fell in love with working
on old VW engines over here, working on my '71 camper with me. But Ghias
(and campers) are terribly difficult to find over there, and also cost
prohibitive. It is cheaper to buy one here and ship it. Even then, he is
going to need me to hunt down and ship over parts. (Me and eBay.)

I really want to help him with this project. I also want to minus myself one
vehicle... so that I can justify buying another bus or camper to restore.
