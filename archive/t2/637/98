Subject: difference btwn Type 1-3 and type 4

Hi All,

I'm putting together a presentation on Volkswagen engines...

Is it correct to say that *all* type 1-4 engines are horizontally opposed?

Is the Type 4 called a "pancake" simply because it's "smooshed" whereas 
a Type 1 stands taller?


TIA,
Harry
