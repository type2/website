Subject: GR-2s

I know there was a recent thread about shocks but I missed most of it.  Anyway
I thought I would pass this along in case it was not covered.
I got tired of waiting for my back ordered shocks and went with some KYB
GR-2's from my FLAPS.  Turns out the ones listed for the rear of a 76 (344045)
are shorter than the original.  To get them to fit I had jack up the mount
raising the spring plate about an inch.  When I did the old bolt would not
thread because the top of the GR-2 is wider than the original.  A quick search
of the archives produced this article.

Apparantly GR-2s for the Ch*vy Astrovan - KYB p/n 344082 are a better fit.  I
have some ordered and can post the results later.
Thought this might save someone some trouble.
BTW - If anyone has any of the longer bolts for the lower rear mount I could
use two.

Or if anyone knows the thread size I might try to order two.  I guess they are
a "hex head shoulder bolt"?
Thanks!
