Subject: late bay fan switch scrounge

i looked at my harness fire [7/25/04] a little more carefully today.  turns
out i didn't even need an engine harness, i just needed the 4-wire loom
that hitches to the fan, its fuse, and the coil. the worst of the meltdown
occured in the plastic plug connector at the fan. as a result i'm out of
the male half of the switch that bolts on the front right side of the fan
vw part #211 963 141. anybody have a spare?  - steve
