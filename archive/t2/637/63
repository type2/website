Hello Tony   I have repaired many front axles   Aa from bays  the front axle 
on bays are a lot weaker than splits  They are famous about the center pivot 
breaking loose I have even fixed those using angle steel to reinforce them. The 
other places they rust out is on the sides and can be patched with sheet 
steel  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
