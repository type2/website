Subject: Fun with the double relay

Well, back behind the bus again today, finally with manuals in hand!  I 
decided to figure out why the fuel pump starts to run anytime the key 
is in run position (instead of starting when cranking).  I guess its 
not a big deal, so long as the pressure regulator's doing its thing, 
but removing safety features from a bus seems like a bad trend to start!

Reading the Bentley, I expected to find mix-ups at the solenoid.  All 
is well, though.  The double relay passed all tests but one and I'm 
stumped.  86a (red/white from solenoid term 50) correctly receives 12v 
only when cranking.  This should close the pump relay and send power to 
the fuel pump via 88d (red/blue).  The weird thing is that 88d gets 12v 
in the run position BEFORE 86a is powered.  Any ideas?  I wish I had 
another relay to try, but I can't relay understand how a relay could 
fail in this way.  Thanks,

all the best,
