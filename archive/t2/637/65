Subject: Looking for A Bus

Hey Volks,

I have been trying to help out a friend to get his bus going. Engine 
rebuild, reseal Tranny, Replace seals on the windows.... when I pulled the 
windshield today and found the non-existant channel below the window, he 
might be changing direction. This bus has a lot of issues that are not going 
to help him out at all. He wants a weekender for all his uses. This bus is a 
standard transporter.

Long story short we are looking for a decent bus body, weekender 
prefferable. This is a '73 with 1700, the engine is going to go to the newer 
bus, possibly the tranny, lots of usable stuff on this one. The new bus does 
not need to be show quality just solid. Any thing out there let me know. We 
are in North Carolina.


Side note: Clark Gardner if you are out there I lost your email and I like 
what we talked about before, pmail me.

Thanks,

Michael Knight
'77 Westy Deluxe, "el Verde"
