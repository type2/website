Wayne,

On my 78, the regular place is a bolt just below the FI box connector.

I looped my cable around and used the second ground lug just on the actual 
lower FI box mounting bolt as well.  Now I *know* that the ECU is getting 
a good ground!

Yes, I have read the reference to the length of the cable being important 
to to analyzer<grin>....if anyone still has one!

Richard Atwell probably has one packed away deep in in garage of goodies!

Cheers, dave
