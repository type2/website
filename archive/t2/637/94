The later Vanagons, which had plastic moldings over the jackpoints, used a
different jack that reached in further to avoid damaging the moldings. I am
not sure if that later style Vanagon jack would work on a Bus, but I do know
that it would not work in reverse; if you tried to use a Bus (or earlier
Vanagon) jack on one of the later Vanagons you would crack the plastic
molding.
