Rob & John,

I *know* you guys have checked a lot of stuff and the frustration level is 
hight, but it's just an engine...we can do it!

To recap:

"breaks up" at high rpm and has no power.
"sounds like" an exhaust leak at higher rpm's

Compression is good, so that means,
	no holes in pistons
	valves seem to be seating well

Guys, to me, this sounds like  a classic electrical hi speed miss 
problem.

From here, it sounds like a cracked distributor cap, where the wrong 
cylinders start firing(or missing) because the spark is going everywhere 
inside the dist cap.  Had a chevy that did this once...exactly the same 
symptoms...bucked like a wild horse a 40mph...went away when I replaced 
the cap and rotor.

Measure the wires with an ohmeter from the copper contact on the inside of 
the distributor cap to the inside connector on each spark plug connector.

Absolutely watch the timing advance with a timing gun.  Does it advance 
properly?  Does the timing light stay bright at higher revs and not go 
dark or show the timing mark jumping all over the place...do this with gun 
pickup closest to the spark plug...*not* the distributor.

I can't say enough about watching the timing light intensity in 
relationship to the mark at both low and hi revs.

What if the ground wire from the side of the dist to the breaker plate
is broken and only comes loose at higher rpm's?

Recheck spark plugs for tightnes...had this problem once(on a fresh 
tuneup) and spent 3 hours troubleshooting my carb cause the symptoms all 
said carb problems....tightened it about 3/4 of a turn all was well again.

The fuel pressure test was just that...eliminate the obvious and go on.
JUst hook it up, pop the top engine cover hatch and watch it while sitting 
in the back seat.  Unless it "breaks up" while in the driveway, parked.

If you guys really drained the tank, then the gas can test should probably 
be left for later.

And finally, divide and conquer!

Is it just one cylinder causing the problem or all equally?!

Pull a spark plug wire off one at a time and rev it up...any difference 
of one over another?

The only other thing I can think of is maybe a broken or bent push rod.

Since you didn't say so in any of the posts, I am assuming it is not 
hydraulic and you have checked and set the valves?

verify proper afm flapper operation by watching it with a flashlight
while reving up to the "break up" point....does it really open up as you 
increase the revs?...wasn't it someone last week that had a mysterious 
problem that went away when the put the clamp back on the S tube at the 
afm connection?

And finally, pull valve covers, disconnect distributor and watch the 
valves on both sides while trying to start it...each cylinder show the 
same amount of movement on both intake and exhaust as the one next to it?

This is just a visual, but if you don't see roughly the same amount of 
movement, say on #1 as #2, or all the sudden you notice that the exhaust 
rocker arm on #1 isn't really moving much...then...

Cheers and good luck, dave
