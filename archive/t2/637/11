The earlier Autos did but this one doesn't. I don't know if Wes Brown will 
chime in here, but he used to have a lot of fun with fuel tank 
issues/blockages. By pulling the line to the filter and adding a bicycle 
pump to the fuel outlet, a few good pumps were enough to dislodge the clogs 
temporarily to keep going for a while. I can't remember the exact symptons 
he would get but these do sound familiar.

Three pipe mystery.

Good Luck,
