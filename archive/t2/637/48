Subject: AOLLLL....

I was reading a site about repairing front axle beams when I
was bumped by AOL...The site was in German but with an 
English translation. When I got back on, Googlin' the same
words (type 2 front beam repair) didn't turn up the site...
The site had drawings and text about welding in plates to
the shock towers on a 1972 if this helps...
Has anyone else come across this site...??
