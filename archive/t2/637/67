Subject: Substitute FI Fuel Pump #

Hi Volks,

A fuel-pump thread on the Vanagon list has uncovered a VERY useful 
tidbit of information for those with fuel injected buses. The original 
VW pump is not commonly stocked at a FLAPS and is usually priced near 
$200US when you can fin one. We now identified a source for affordable 
replacement fuel pumps... The NAPA part # is 2P74028.

Many thanks to Charles Hill for supplying this part number.

Happy trails,

Regarding yesterday's discussion of a less expensive, more available 
fuel
pump for the Vanagon:

     I have been using a fuel pump for one of the Ford Bronco/Ranger 
vehicles
that has a Bosch look-alike fuel injection system much like our 
Vanagons.
The NAPA part # is 2P74028,  and the price is around $60.00.  Napa also 
has
a couple of suitable fuel filters for the intake side of the pump.  
Their #
is 3032, or Purolator F63169.  These both are metal can types, not the
plastic that VW used.  Again, use these on the intake side of the pump.

     I hope this saves somebody a buck or two, or maybe saves a lost day 
or
two of vacation time.
