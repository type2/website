Barry,

I guess we will run into each other then tomorrow at Crazy Ray's. When I was
there today, the carbs were already gone and someone had taken the vacuum
can off the distributor, but the dizzy looks fine and is still there. Wanted
to grab it myself. You can have it, but the heater boxes and the intervall
wiper switch are mine... This thing seems to have been maintained with VWoA
parts all around. The seats are gone IIRC.

I recently saw a '73 WV bus there (with the three passenger middle
seat!) and it looks like an original bus (dual PDSIT solex, with the dashpot

and and the hoses and the air pump - but no air pump belt!!)

Guess I will pick up the distributor while I am there, along with another
regulator...
