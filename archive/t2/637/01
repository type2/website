Subject: Looking for Bus

Hey Steve,
            I lived in the Chicago area 1965-1991.  My first reaction to your 
question is WHY you would wish a vehicle that is typically rusted to hell... I 
remember being forced (for rust reasons) to scrap a number of otherwise very 
worthy Type-2s, including a real heartbreaker, a Greenhouse of 1965 vintage, 
given to me by its original Downers Grove owner.  May I respectfully suggest 
you look south or west.

Can you tell us more about your search parameters?  Years...?  Westy...?  
Transmission (if applicable)...?  Budget...?

Thanks and best of luck
Glenn
