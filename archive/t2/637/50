Subject: CDI Question

I ma have a line on a Mallory Hyfire 6a for a pretty good price. Can
someone tell me the difference between this and what Aircooled.net lists
as Hyfire VIa (yeah I can read Roman Numerals). Is this an older version
or something. Anyone have any stories with this unit.
 
Thanks
