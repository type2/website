Zach, same unit- I believe they just changed the "numbering."  
It rocks!  Gap up your plugs to .040-.045.  Get good power, fast starts,and better gas mileage.  If you have a tach. though, it may not work with the CDI so you'll have to get an adapter.  AC.net sells it.  If you need any install help or ?'s, let me know, I just did it.  I got my Hyfire from AC.net and have no problems with it.  I'd be leary of others- demos, customer returns, or whatever.  Spend a little more and get a good reliable unit that John C. will back up.

I ma have a line on a Mallory Hyfire 6a for a pretty good price. Can
someone tell me the difference between this and what Aircooled.net lists
as Hyfire VIa (yeah I can read Roman Numerals). Is this an older version
or something. Anyone have any stories with this unit.

Thanks
