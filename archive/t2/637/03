Tom,

http://www.eurosportacc.com/quaife.htm

These folks actually make these for bug trans...so I would assume they 
probably also have them for busses...never tried one, but their was a
short movie on the net for awhile of a guy that had one in his bug, doing
dougnuts up and down an industrial back street.

Leaving double tire  stripes whenever he got on it.

There are pro's and con's to doing this...check the literature...

Cheers, dave
