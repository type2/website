Subject: need temporary storazge for bus near Knoxville

Anyone near Knoxville Tn with room to store a bus for abt. 3 wks while I 
remove some parts needed to get my 75 Westy China Cat running?

I'd be pleased to leave the rest of the bus to whomever helped me, or 
I'd haul it to the crushers if no one else wants it.

TIA/Don Carron
