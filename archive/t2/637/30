Subject: Solid No-Rust $1500 Bus In Indiana

Listees,
A 1970 VW Bus needs to be sold fast in Bluffton, Indiana.
I just went to look at it. It has NO RUST through and VERY LITTLE surface 
rust. It used to be a Westy. Now it has a middle bench where the back would 
be and a back bench rear-facing just behind the front seats...so the people 
in the benches face one another. It's white over light blue...five lug 
wheels...it's all there. Only damage is a bent rear bumper, but no body 
damage.
I have no interest in the sale of this bus except for wanting the lady that 
owns it to be treated right. It is well worth the $1500, but she needs to 
sell fast.
She also had a 1969 Yellow Baja Beetle she would sell for somewhere in the 
$750 range.
Contact me and I will put you in touch with her.
