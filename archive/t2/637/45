Subject: Fw: [T2] Still no get up and go... Did I miss anything?

I am going to step in for John while he is away at Fix Yer Bus, helping
others work on their buses while his is down. Here are some answers to the
questions I know about...

>> Coil?  Yes it was replaced twice with Bosch blue coils, and shows a nice
spark.

>>Interesting!....probably not the word you were looking for, but as
Sherlock would say,...a proper 3 pipe mystery.<  Yeah John is truly
frustrated..I have never seen him like this before.

>>Absolutely verify that you are getting full advance...with timing gun. No 
>>advance, no go.< Yes John has a timing gun and there is advance. The dizzy 
>>was changed with another vacum advance, as original, and with a .009 (out 
>>of exasperation) and no difference. Both vacum dizzies held vacum and I 
>>believe were advancing (I wasn't there that time).

>>Will it rev up properly at neutral?...or "miss"  there too?< It does break
up in nuetral or in park. I haven't been on a test drive with John so I 
don't know what it sounds or feels like when driving, but will idle all day 
just fine, however when he revs it up it "sounds" like an exhaust leak to 
me. We found one and fixed it...can't find any more.

>>As Richard or someone else pointed out, *measure* the wire
> resistances....even ones straight out of the box can be bad.< I am not 
> sure what you are refering to here.

>>Fuel pressure is a little too high....wonder if the tank has blockage.This 
>>is a consideration...it is perplexing as John's bus has been purring like 
>>a kitten since the rebuild (about a year ago I believe) and this problem 
>>just started out of the blue.

>>When you tested injectors, you actually did the spray pattern test?...I am
> assuming so.< Yes he did the spray test and all were good.

>>Is it possible that someone can watch the fuel pressure gauge while test 
>>driving at the "break up" point?  I've had this problem with crud in the 
>>tank...would idle all day long, but I could drive exactly 2.6 miles and 
>>the engine would lose power and die...wait 15 minutes and could drive back
home and it would idle all day long.> John has helped me out many times and
I am willing to hang out of the back of the bus and hold a pressure gauge, 
around his neighborhood anyway. Will suggest this when he gets back. I don't 
think he ever had a fuel filter problem in the past, and I would "think" he 
would have noticed that if there was crud in the tank...but maybe if there 
is crud the particles are too large to get into the line.

>>John, sound like you guys have covered almost everything....the one last 
>>thing is the gas....get some long fuel hose and run straight out of a gas 
>>can....with the line from the regulator going back into the gas can.< This 
>>sounds like a good way to test the gas tank. We'll have to try that  next.

>>Maybe the gas has some sort of contaminate in it that is not readily

>>Only other thing I can think of is something wrong with the
> auto-trans...check fluid?>I assume so, but he'll have to answer this one.

>>however

> I still suspect the distributor, have you as Doc Tim says, Verified the
> proper function??< I think I have answered this already, but just for the
record, yes the vacum was verified on two different dizzies and I believe
the advance is there when revved up. John will confirm this or not and we'll 
double check it again to be sure. At this point that would be great news if 
it was just the dizzy. Oh and yes he has the correct dizzy and ECU. These 
were both correct and doing fine for a long time before the 
problem...however both have been swapped out with exact replacements

Sure appreciate all the input....John's bus has been down for a month now 
and several of us have looked at it to no avail. I hope it is something 
simple in the end. He has swapped out most every darn thing and can't figure 
it out. The gas tank however is one thing that hasn't been swapped.

If anybody else has some free time and can think of something we might be 
missing we sure would appreciate it. It's coming down to tearing down the 
engine, or replacing the tranny or gas tank to keep diagnosing. We are 
perplexed!!!

Thanks from John and I, as I owe him more than I can repay him already for 
all the help he has given me on my bus.
