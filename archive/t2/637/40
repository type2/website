Subject: What causees a pilot bearing to go bad

HI,
So we finally got the pilot bearing out and the new one in on the bus we 
were thinking of buying.  Got it all back together started it up and the 
engine sounds great. Try to put it in gear and it is having a hard time 
getting into first try to drive and it sounds like the pilot bearing went 
again.  And the bus won't go.
What we cause 2 pilot bearings to go bad? Too much end play in the 
crankshaft?  It seemed a bit worn on the tranny shaft where it sits inside 
the bearing.
Thanks,
Kyle
