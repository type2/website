John,


Interesting!....probably not the word you were looking for, but as 
Sherlock would say,...a proper 3 pipe mystery.

Absolutely verify that you are getting full advance...with timing gun.
No advance, no go.

Will it rev up properly at neutral?...or "miss"  there too?

As Richard or someone else pointed out, *measure* the wire 
resistances....even ones straight out of the box can be bad.

Fuel pressure is a little too high....wonder if the tank has blockage.

When you tested injectors, you actually did the spray pattern test?...I am 
assuming so.

Not being real familiar with auto trans, is there a vacuum line running to 
the shifter in it?....that might cause a massive vacuum leak when reaching 
high gear?

Is it possible that someone can watch the fuel pressure gauge while test 
driving at the "break up" point?  I've had this problem with crud in the 
tank...would idle all day long, but I could drive exactly 2.6 miles and 
the engine would lose power and die...wait 15 minutes and could drive back 
home and it would idle all day long.

John, sound like you guys have covered almost everything....the one last 
thing is the gas....get some long fuel hose and run straight out of
a gas can....with the line from the regulator going back into the gas can.

Maybe the gas has some sort of contaminate in it that is not readily 
visible or testable.

Only other thing I can think of is something wrong with the 
auto-trans...check fluid?


Cheers, dave
