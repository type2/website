Zach,

I agree. I gained 3-4 mpg, much better and easier starts, much more 
power, and cooler running. I drove from Wisconsin to South Dakota, 
Wyoming (Yellowstone), and Glacier and back through Montana and North 
Dakota this summer with it with no problems with it. I can't recommend 
it enough. And John C. does do an excellent job of standing behind what 
he sells. Make sure you also have the right plug wires and coil, and 
make sure you open up the gap in the plugs as John C. recommends.
