Subject: alternator for '72-'79 buses

I see that the AL75X fits the '72-'79 VW Buses.  Is there any other vehicles 
where I could find this alternator??  I plan to hit the yards tomorrow, 
because I recently saw a '73 WV bus there (with the three passenger middle 
seat!) and it looks like an original bus (dual PDSIT solex, with the dashpot 
and and the hoses and the air pump - but no air pump belt!!)


Guess I will pick up the distributor while I am there, along with another 
regulator...

AL75X  Rebuilt Alternator, Bosch 55 Amp, Bus & Pickup 1972 to 1979


Thank you.   Barry
