Alice,

Whoa!  I don't know where your friend lives in Germany, but parts are not 
hard to come by....they do have parts that are hard for us to come by 
though.

When I was over there last year about this time, I visited several places 
that specialized in A/C vw's and one of my business contacts' father in 
law had just finished restoring a 66 bug.

Your friend needs to go to the bookstand and look for a magazine called

"oldtimer"  MARKT

Yes, the "old Timer" part is in English.  Full of resources for all sort 
of VW places.  

Also, here http://www.hoffmann-speedster.de/uskarm/prodframe_karm.htm

This was the karman ghia page in english, for german, just back up to the 
root part of the URI....http://www.hoffmann-speedster.de

Admittedly, a KG might be hard to find in Germany, but the A/C VW scene
in Europe is *very* alive and well.

One of our posters(and the M-code king) is Vincent Molenar who lives in 
the Netherlands and has more than a few buses...I have seen 
pictures of "club" events  that he has been to, just for VW buses....and 
there were a lot of them there.


Cheers, dave
