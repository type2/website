Subject: Re: [T2] What causees a pilot bearing to go bad

Oh my goodness! I've got to see if this is in my edition of Muir. I have a 
72 bus with a 78 or 79 2.0 in it that just ate the pilot bearing!

Within a day of buying my 75 and 78 buses, I came across an addendum
entry in the Muir book about a 78 motor chewing up pilot bearings on 75
tranny.
