So, it follows that the commutator is well worn as well, as well as the 
bearings and diodes. A different set of brushes, new or used, are not going 
to mate very well, so will over heat, so may well not resolve your problem. 
How many times do you want to do the R&R before it works??? How long do you 
want it to work before you do it again??? How many times do you want to do 
it until you get it right??
