 Barndoors! shoot Steve still remembers buying Model T's new off the lot.
 ;- ) Actually this cuts both ways, some of the old stuff is machined pretty
 crude especially when you see some of the tolerances the new stuff is made
 too. Other side of the coin is its easier to change plastic molds then
steel
 stamps so stuff gets made of plastic. That way you can change stuff around
 for the fickle puplic who have a one minute attention span and always have
 to have new. The only plastic on my 64 Dodge pu is the armrests, hell you
 can even sit on the hood without it oilcanning. Steve is right of course,
 every generation bitches about the good old days. Anybody remember the
 country song that bitched about wanting a ford or chevy that would still
 last 10 years like it should, songs gotta be what 20 years or more older.
