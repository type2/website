So, take it apart. Turn the armature on a lathe and true up the commutator. 
Verify resulting diameter is not too much less than the curve of the new 
brushes and they should wear in just fine. Use a broken hacksaw blade to 
scrape the groves between the segments. Resolder each wire end on the 
armature. Install new bearings and regulator/diode/brush set. The Bosch 
price list has thousands of part no.s that I'm certain contain all these 
parts, but I have never seen a catalog giving applications so can't find 
the right no's to order. The regulator/brush sets are available and the 
bearings can be ordered by int. and ext. diameters and width from any FLAPS 
or bearings jobber. You may even be able to read the universal bearing no. 
on them with a hand glass. Be sure to specify a permanently lubed and 
sealed type.

Same for most all alternators I have seen, although some of the Bosch 
alternators on Euro marks do have a female hex in the end of the shaft, so 
you can be pissed at the whole world of alternator manufacturers. Zipping 
the nut off and on with an air impact socket gun makes it easy. If you have 
a manual impact socket driver, the kind you hit with a hammer, that would 
probably work as well, but know that the low cost import types just do not 
hold up well at all. The first time you get a tough nut, they will just 
come apart. I got a nice Snap-On item on eBay for $35, about 1/3 the cost 
of new. I've never needed more than a 2 lb bronze hammer to loosen anything 
up to 100 lbs torque or so. They are particularly nice on the big phillips 
head screws on the door latches and such, or the cooling tin screws that 
doesn't want to budge.
