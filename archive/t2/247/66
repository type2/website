Seems like we tried this one once. You insert the cables through the guide 
tube and then stick a grease gun up to the guide tube. Fill the tube with 
grease until it comes out the other end. Reinstall the little rubber dust 
covers on both ends and go about your life.

You may want to take it to the local gas station/mechanic where they can 
put it up on the rack and do it with their gun as it will go much faster, 
require no pumping and will cost you $10 MAYBE.

Less would be fine too I'm sure but I doubt more would hurt here either.
