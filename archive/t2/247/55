OK Boys and Girls,

My new heater cables arrived and they carry this instruction on the =
packaging: ""For the correct operation of the cable please always =
lubricate the inner wire with silicone grease at the time of fitting."

OK.  How?=20

Cables are about 13 feet long and though it may be possible to work a =
little grease a few inches into the ends but it would be a real bear to =
work it all the way through, nor is there anyway to remove the inner =
cable from its outer sheathing.

The cables came packaged in non-product specific "Cofle Control and =
Speedometer Cables" plastic bags. Perhaps the instruction are general in =
nature and more specific to speedometer cables?

Bentley I'm afraid is silent on this one.

Anyone with insight, or even a good or whimsical guess, is asked to come =
forward.

Thanks,

John=20
