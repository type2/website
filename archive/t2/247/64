I really have no idea what the sump plate is for. I haven't exactly
read the entire Bentley cover to cover, but don't recall ever reading
something to the effect of "remove sump plate cover to check yadda
yadda yadda". It sure is a good place for a oil temp sender :)

If it's leaking I would replace it. It should be a simple o-ring that
does the sealing.
