Hi Darren,

Cut the seal with a carpet knife. Use a new blade, and bring a couple 
spare blades in case they break. Once the seal is split all the way 
around you simply push gently from the inside and the window pops right 
out. Be sure to have a helper there to catch it!!!

Unless the seal is VERY new, I wouldn't try to keep it intact. Wrecking 
a $200 windsheild to preserve a $30 seal just doesn't make sense to me, 
and the older rubber will just make it all the more difficult to 
reinstall.

Happy trails,
