The problem is that everyone wants their bus to be worth $200 for tax
purposes and $20,000 for insurance purposes!

It's really too bad that some states won't accept actual purchase price
for tax purposes, but the fact is that most folks low-balled the numbers
on private party sales.

It seems  that in this case some bureaucrat has siezed upon the NADA book
as his single reference for value, to the detriment of folks who are
trying to resurrect vehicles.  As UJ has said, the NADA book is not valid
for buses in less than original condition.
