Subject: transport of a bench seat

Hi all,
     I'm trying to find a way to get a 2/3 bay seat from Beaver Dam, WI to
Lawrence, KS.  I don't suppose there's anyone out there coming through this
part of the country in the next month or 2?  I'd be glad to throw some gas
money your way!  Thanks,

Bryant
