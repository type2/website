The general case here is that your condensor is going south.  Bad
condensors burn points and material transfer is a good sign of this.

Gee, Richard, where did you learn this? :-)  Yeah, I am tighter than
Bentley when I give advice.  It may well take a few more trial-and-error
adjustments, but 49-51 performs better than the Bentley/VW spec.  I don't
know why the FI buses are so sensitive, but it is certain that they are!

If you *can* file the points flat, then it is the same as new points, yes.
But if you can file the points flat without damaging the file, I want the
name of the company that made the file!!!!  Most points since the 60s are
made of tungsten and are HARD!!!!  Filing is difficult and you will wear
out $10 files filing $3 points.  Can be done, not worth doing.
