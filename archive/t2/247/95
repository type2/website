Subject: Re: [T2] strange note on master cylinderr

I suspect what you got were master cylinders that were rejected by VW, then 
ground, then sold as scrap, then redirected to the market. Note that if the 
VW inspector finds one problem with one randomly inspected part, the whole 
pallet load is rejected. It doesn't mean they were all bad, but sometimes 
those $20 per tons scrap parts are worth that and no more. This is where 
the bad right out of the box parts come from. You got to know your 
suppliers very well to avoid this crap. Guess who is most likely to end up 
with these parts??? Could it be those who search the world for the cheapest 
price???? Remember what I've been saying about cheap attitude??? Measure 
the attitude of the PO BEFORE you make an offer on any used bus. You can 
always tell by the assemblage of non-spec parts and procedures everywhere. 
That's why when I'm looking for a used Bus, I keep looking until I find 
STOCK throughout with documentation that says the PO's cared for it rightly.
