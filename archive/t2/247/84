Hi Darren,

In a word: Carefully.

The trick is to get a brand new seal.  Warm it up in the sun, or throw 
it in an old pillowcase and tumble it in your clothes dryer for a while. 
Then limber up your fingers and fit the seal onto the windsheild. It's 
easier if you have a helper.

Once the seal is on the window, get a peice of strong nylon cord and 
loop it around the inner groove of the windshield. Lube it up with 
dish-soap  (I'm told you can also use glycerine if you have a 
sympathetic pharmacist handy.) Tie the cord tight and leave a loop 
hanging down you can reach.

Carefullly place the windshield in place on the van, with a helper to 
keep it from dropping. Climb inside the van and you'll see that the 
inner lip of the seal will be sitting flush against the windowframe. 
What you do now is you reach into the groove in the seal and carefully 
pull the cord out while your friend gently leans against the glass. This 
will allow the rubber seal to slip INSIDE the lip of the window frame. 
As the pair of you work your way around the window the seal will 
continue to fall inside until the whole thing is in place.

That's all there is to it, really. Do it ASAP, it's a lot easier in 
August than it is in October. I wouldn't even consider doing one from 
October - March unless I had a heated workspace available. YMMV.

Happy trails,
