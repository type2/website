Tim,

The newly rebuilt one is what gets installed, no doubt about that, but
then the question becomes "What do I do with the old one?"  I could toss
it or I could take a whack at rebuilding it myself.  If I can figure out
what bits to use, I will rebuild it and down in the basement it will go.
That way, when this new bosch rebuilt gives up on me, I have one in the
basement to throw in until I get another rebuild (if rebuilt ones are
still available).  I doubt I will do all that Bosch would do, but I can
get it in shape to keep me on the road for a week or two.

So far this has been way easier than I thought it would be, tho I am
pissed that VW did not put a slot in the pulley to hold it, as they did in
the T1 generator pulleys.
