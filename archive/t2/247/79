Steve,

Just think how those of us who are in our mid 20's and share your "do-it-myself" ethic feel. How do you think we fit in with our generation?

The days you guys reminisce about were gone decades before I got my first bus. You have first hand knowledge of barndoors. I hope someday I'll be able to find a nice T1 bus of any year.

Some of today's youth IS smarter, and will have to have our busses pried out of our hands as well.

Thanks to all of you who pass the wisdom on to the next crowd. We are listening.

Billy
wishing I had something to be nostalgic about

The "plastic crap" cliche gets truer and truer with every passing day. On a Barndoor, you could (back in the day) get a rebuild kit for the shock absorbers!!!
