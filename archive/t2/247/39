Robb, I am not talking about the filter losing its prime, but rather the
pump.  Yes, the filter will still be full of oil, but when you start the
bus, the oil light will stay on for 3-10 seconds or more while the pump
sucks oil up from the sump.  I find that some brands of filters allow this
and others do not.  I also find that "extending" the oil change interval
(yeah, yeah, I oughta change it but... maybe next weekend...) will allow
this to happen even on good filters

I agree.  Every once in a while, tho, I will get lifter clatter
unexpectedly and I blame it on the lifter hole pointing down.  I *said* I
was weaseling, didn't i? :-)
