Subject: second  lp tank

was doing an inspection under my 82 westy and suddenly realized that i 
was looking at what looked like mounting points for the lp tank.  slid 
over to the other side and confirmed that is what the bolts  were.   
has anybody ever mounted a second lp tank  to their vanagon type 
westy??    thinking to put one of the two  tank connectors used  on 
some  RVs on the low pressure sides.
