The oil pressure sender mounts in the same location on either a bus or 914 
engine.  The 914 plate is for an oil temperature sender, which the bus 
never received.  I have a 914 plate in my bus engine that I found after 
YEARS of searching the wrecking yards and I use it for it's designed 
purpose, an oil temp sender.  For pressure I use the dual sender at the end 
of the VDO adapter hose that is in the stock location near the 
distributor.  BTW, the 914 plate is more than just "predrilled".  The 
sender mount is predrilled *and* recessed so that the sender protrudes into 
the main crankcase.  The sender ends up at the same spot as a dipstick 
sender would (as evidenced by the fact that I had to cut 1" off of the end 
of the dipstick for clearance after installing the sender).

I don't know, but the type2 library would be a good place to start.  If 
it's not there, maybe you could write it?  :)
