Billy,

You are on the right track!  The only way to get nostalgic
is after you get "character" and experience<VBG>.

I once wanted those things when I was young...all it takes
is time.  LOL

Cheers, dave

The "plastic crap" cliche gets truer and truer with every passing day. On a Barndoor, you could (back in the day) get a rebuild kit for the shock absorbers!!!
