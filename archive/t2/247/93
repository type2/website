Nobody has mentioned liberal use of a lubricant that the paint and rubber 
will be happy with. I have used silicone spray with excellent results but 
some will tell you this will cause fisheye problems on future paint jobs 
and I have used liquid dishwashing detergent (lots of water) with good 
results.

Use lots of this stuff and apply it right before you set the seal into the 
window opening.

We popped all of our windows in at about 10 minutes per window.
