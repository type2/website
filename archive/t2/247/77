if it is a rubber windshield gasket with no glue it is simple. simple 
take a strong but very sharp knife and cut around the rubber gasket.  
the older the rubber the easier to cut.  when the glass is fully 
exposed either use suction cups or have some one on inside gently push 
the glass out to  you..  do not try to pry the glass up from  the 
edges.   it breaks very easy from  those points if it binds up.
