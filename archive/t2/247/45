What book? The Muir book? That is good for reading when you are on the john!
But if that is all you have then stop and read it again. Forget all the crap
in the beginning of the timing section, all he wants you to do is dump the
correct dizzy and put in a 009. Wrong! Not sure what edition you have, the one
in front of me was printed in 81. Read the Ignition Timing Chart in
Maintenance Chapter X. In mine it is page 110 and 111. Look at 1975 ED. After
5 ATDC there is a little 6. That is a footnote number that sends you to the
bottom of the page.
#6 SAYS: STROBE TIME, AT IDLE, VACUUM HOSES ON!!!!

>So does the retard vacum come from the dome side or the flat side?

NO, vacuum GOES to the flat side [inboard. It COMES from the carburetor.

>Do I need to take the advance vacuum hose off?

NO! Both hoses STAY on. You should vacuum at the retard side. No vacuum at the
advance side.

>Should I feel vacuum coming though the hose to the flat side at idle? (I
don't but there is vacuum to the domed side).

YES!  If you have vacuum to the domed side, you have the hoses reversed.
PORTED vacuum = no vacuum at idle goes to the outer [domed] nipple.
MANIFOLD vacuum = vacuum at idle goes to the inner [flat side] nipple.

Here is more info about timing a dual vacuum dist:

[sorry, it concerns the 71 1600, but the info is still correct]

And from the www.type.com archives:
"The port on the outside of the vacuum canister (vacuum advance) goes to the
port on the left or right carb that is near the center (vertically) of the
carb, facing the outside.  The port on the inside of the vacuum canister
(vacuum retard) goes to the slightly larger port near the base of the left
carb."

There is lots of info about this on the www.type2.com website, in the Library
and Archives.
And buy a real manual!  Get the Bentley....
