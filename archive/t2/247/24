I am wondering if this might not be the bus I found North of Houston a few 
years ago that was parked at an old tire store. Some travellers who broke 
down had to sell/abandon the bus and move on  as their vacation was running 
out.
After finding the bus and talking to the old man who had bought it from the 
people, as I recall, he and I settled on a sales price that he would 
accept, and I posted it's existence to the list.
I think the current owner may have bought the bus from the old man for the 
price I negotiated as being acceptable to him.
At that time, the bus was in pretty good shape; just needing some tender 
attention to rehab it.
