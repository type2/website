Subject: Reading plugs

Thanks to everyone for reading my plugs. I got responses from "they look
fine" to "lean but normal for a FI bus".

Bentley says gray deposits mean normal combustion.

I forgot to add I do prefer Chevron gas and I did put in a bottle of Techron
concentrate in a full tank last time I changed the oil.

Still wondering if a W7CC plug will go from grey deposits to tan...
