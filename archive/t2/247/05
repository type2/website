Subject: Followup on cross country drive and questions about engine running lean '78 T2

Hi all.
Well we made it across the US in the 78 T2 in more or
less one piece. I went ahead and put a oil temp guage
in using a kitched digital thermometer in the dipstick
tube and running a wire up to the dash which works
fairly well by the way. The temps I'm getting from
that is somewhat scary. I can only cruis at 55-60 mph
in 85* F temps before the oil temp starts to hit 244
and continues to climb if I speed up. The cylinders
are running hot and from looking at the plugs it looks
like that is caused by the engine leaning out. the
plugs are almost white. I've already replaced one head
in Utah. (HUGE thanks to Richard out there, an AIRS
member who let us use his fully heated garage with a
lift and air tools!) Don't want to do that again. 
  So I guess the question is how do I richen the
mixture up. It's a fuel injected 2.0 ltr 1978 and has
been rebuilt once (not by me) I've checked for air
leacs and although I can hear some kind of hissing by
the manifold before it splits out to the 4 cylinders,
I have yet to find any leaking. I'm chalking the noise
up to air flow through the monifold vs air sucking
into it. What else could I look for or do? Any help is
appreciated. 
Thanks 
Giles,
1978 T2 "Anya"
