Subject: Electrical esoterica (flasher relay)

Replaced a turn signal relay on a '71 Beetle today and now suspect the 
switch is bad because one side is erratic - but hold the turn sig lever in 
the right place and she works fine. Surely the buzz buzz buzz from the new 
relay means the switch fried the old one?

Better question here: There is a mystery wire from #8 fuse (Eighth from the 
left inside the car, eighth from the right under the hood). It's factory red 
and short, 5 inches or so, a jumper wire. It is not connected to anything at 
the moment. Best I can tell from the wiring diagram, there should be a wire 
from that fuse to the ignition switch and I do not see one. Is this little 
wire with a female spade supposed to clip to an ignition lead? If so, where 
shall I connect it?

Always grateful for informed opinion ...
