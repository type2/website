just finished some checking of vehicles on the nada sight when i saw 
your note.  It appears that on the classic look up zip code is not 
used.  I also would like to know where the values come from.  Two local 
dealers of old VW that i do stuff with both would like to get half of 
some of those prices on their front row vehicles which in some cases a 
fantastic vehicles.  A very clean and well set up 75 westy in fantastic 
condition got $6300 with new brakes tuneup and emissions. a few months 
earlier a consigned 72 in "used condition" but very nice, wouldnt move 
at $2500 with a new engine and a warrentee that went with the engine.
