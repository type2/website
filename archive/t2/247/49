Subject: Further '80 alternator questions

OK, so I pulled the old alternator.  Pulled the voltage regulator (VR) off
the back of it and the VR is *SHOT* The carbon brushes are worn way past
the bentley limits.  I have a spare Alt in the basement, and I actually
managed to locate the SOB!!!!  But...

                Old part #               New\
Alternator      (0 or 1) 120 489 992     AL 114X

VR              1 197 311 010            1 197 311 021

Now, the form factor looks fine and I am sure my spare will drop in, but I
am curious!  Ron (www.busdepot.com) lists two replacement VRs with part
numbers 0 192 052 005 (for '80 V'gon) and 0 192 052 004 (for '81-83
V''gon)

Now, per Bentley, I seem to have the '81-83 Alternator (65A, round VR) so
I *think* I need the 0 192 052 004 VR, but I am confused... I should need
either the 1 197 311 010 or 021 VR from my past examples.  Does anyone
know what the heck is going on?
