I'm somewhat confused by your question. the VDO oil sump sender is
usually installed in the sump plate. This is located at the rear
passenger side of the engine. It's a metal plate held on by 2 small
bolts and about 80mm dia. A hole is drilled & the sender unit
installed in this hole. this leaves the drain hole functional. It's
not exactly what you're asking, but I think this is what you are
wanting to know.
