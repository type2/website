I've got some spotty electrical connection but a new condenser so I'll check
the wiring. I know some wiring is corroded and exposed and needs attention.

I didn't realize how wet it can get inside the engine compartment. I used to
live in a wet area which probably did a lot of damage.  Because of the air
intake vents the moisture in the air can condense all over the engine like
dew. One big rain storm we had a month back, the engine got into this
condition even though I was protected under a carport.

It's a magic number.

I found you have to be careful not to file the nylon rider. I used a metal
double sided fingernail file (Jonel fine/medium) from the cosmetics section
of the grocery store.  Because it was so thin and flat I was able to use a
sawing action.  A really big pit would take a long time to file but with the
small pit I had, the file evenly did both sides pinched by the spring action
of the points. I use Bosch points if there is any doubt.
