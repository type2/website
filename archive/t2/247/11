Take WD-40 (use the little red straw) and squirt all of the vacuum 
connectors and gaskets. Any rise on idle means you found a leak. Things I 
found leaking on mine and others? Injector seals, EGR valve stuck open, the 
little elbow on the warm up regulator (dunno real name - causes the engine 
to idle fast for the first minute or so), the little hoses that connect the 
air box to the individual intake manifold pipes, gas tank vent system, main 
pipe running from the AFM to throttle body.

The mixture adjustment is in the top of the AFM. I do not know if CW or CCW 
is richer.
