Oh, yes... the mice. You had to remind me, didn't you? And this is true.. If
you have a blanket, folded twice, a mice will go straight through it and you
will have four holes, exactly the same place.. the rodent version of
paperdolls.
There are only two animals that I know of that will #1&2 in their beds with
no concern..one is a drunk and the other is a rat.  Jan B
