Subject: pump up lifters

Continuing my thread of the personality of my bus...

I think I've observed an oddity with my hydraulic lifters. My parking space is on an incline and if I park with the nose pointing downhill the hydraulic lifters don't chatter for a few seconds at startup.  If I park the other way around it will happen the next morning whereas the first way I won't hear them unless I let it sit for several days.

Am I smoking crack or does the oil pool up in the sump facing downhill and help to keep the lifters from airing out?

(I sometimes back-into my spot so I can access the engine away from the flow of traffic which is how I discovered this).
