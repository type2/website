Oh that sucks Mark.  That is a dismally undersized bolt I always thought, but
didn't need to be bigger as it doesn't really hold much of course as the
hub taper does the work,.  But one always tosses a wrench on it to check
timing and adjust valves.  I've always been amazed I've never broken one off
over the years.  If you pop the hub off, will there be a bit sticking out,
could tack a bar on it if there is?  Otherwise time for a good, hard, hard
drill (cobalt or otherwise of good make) but that is going to be a PITA.

Oh well. It's the bolt that holds the fan to the crankshaft (2.0 L). It may be
time to drop the engine and split the case.
