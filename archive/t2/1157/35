Has anyone used this kit?
http://www.vellemanusa.com/us/enu/product/view/?id=350487

I don't know about
the claims of "feel of an expensive luxury car", performance, 
and mileage.
However it does look like a nice Belgian-designed DIY ignition project.

I've
been searching some of the UK VW forums and many folks swear by them.  Some
folks had Pertronix modules and ditched them in favor of this.

Google
Shopping shows they can be had for about $15.00. (also about #15.00 here)

As
mentioned before, it's a bit of a DIY job:  you'll need to solder it up and
get a housing for it.
However, the assembly instructions (linked to in the
link above) are for real 
electronics novices.
They even list the components
you can substitute for 6V systems.

What's really cool about it is that you
still keep your points, but they act as 
low-voltage trigger.
That means it
should work with any distributor.
All the high-voltage goes through the kit so
your points will pretty much see 
only mechanical erosion (i.e. they will last
a long time)
Also cool is you just need to swap wires and you're back to the
stock ignition 
system.

I'm going to ask for one for xmas.  But I get
terribly excited by electronics 
DIY projects (I lust for Megasquirt) so I may
not be able to wait until then.

Anyone in the US ever used one?  I'm looking
for more feedback before I make the 
fifteen-quid plunge.

Thanks,

Josh
