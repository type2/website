For a points fired CDI just grab an MSD 6A or 6AL if you want "new and
not used/old". 

http://www.msdignition.com/info.aspx?taxid=4&taxid2=835

The MSD units use a multiple spark discharge to keep the plug lit up a
bit longer. 

If you want "new but old school" single spark discharge then build one
from this article.

I plan to eventually go CDI. I have all the parts except a lightweight
transformer to build the CDI that Bill Noble designed. I came across a
couple of MSD 7 series boxes REALLY cheap and sold them with plans to
get a 6 series but the money found other places to go before the
purchase.

there's an article out there about building a multi-spark CDI as well
but I was looking for the simplest design if I decide to build.

If you're going to set up CDI then also plan to buy a set of
spiral-wound plug wires to knock out cross-spark.
