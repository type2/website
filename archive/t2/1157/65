Subject: intake manifold removal difficulties

I'm having some trouble getting the intake manifolds off of a 74 bus.
These are two to one manifolds with a vacuum take off that were
running Kadrons.
I got everything disconnected, carbs off, crossover off, all four
manifold nuts off. The manifold is quite loose now, but something on
the bottom is preventing removal.

I crawled under the bus, and do not see any EGR pipes or such
connecting to the manifolds. It is just hanging up on the tins? What
is the best way forward?

Also, it looks like the crossover pipe had a branch going to brake
vacuum. Now that the crossover is gone, what do I do with the brake
vacuum?

Thanks,
