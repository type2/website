Subject: re:Fresh Air Flap Seals

I used something just like what you linked to. I picked it up at home depot.
I don't think this seal is available anymore. Based on the site you linked
to, you don't have home depot near you-basically any decent hardware store
should have some basic peel and stick foam seal. 

 

I put it in mine sometime in the last year or so, and it is still holding
up. I left the original seals in place-they had not crumbled apart, but were
so hard as to be useless.
