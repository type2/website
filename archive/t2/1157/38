Subject: Re: [T2] Semi-electronic Ignition

Several manufactures used such products back in the seventies and 
eighties.  I retrofitted one onto an earlier Toyota I had.  You get 
virtually no point wear, and if you lube the cam well you timing will be 
stable  for tens of thousands of miles.  I had heard that you can get an 
oxidation problem on your points that will cause problems over time due 
to the low current flow, but never experienced it myself.  With the 
Toyota system at least, you could leave the condenser attached but not 
electrically hooked up, so if the electronic unit failed you could 
switch back to points in a few minutes with minimal tools.

I would worry about the reliability of any unit, especially if you have 
a bad plug or wire.  The early Ford units where known for burning up 
when something blocked current flow through the high tension wiring.  
$15 isn't a bad price to pay though, not much at risk.
