Type 4 dizzies can pull a full 40 degrees of advance at cruise, but
it's tough to replicate that at tune up time. That's why timing is set
with vacuum disconnected and capped on the manifold side. 27 degrees
at 3500 rpm and mechanical advance maxed out should set you around 7.5
degrees of advance at idle. Timing to 40 degrees will run great and
give a short engine life.
