Subject: Travelling California by bus

Hi all,
I'm Timo from Germany and in May 2010 I spent two weeks in Alaska and
some guys on the list were so kind to give me advice and tips where to
go and what to do. It really was great up there and I'm hoping to get
some good advice for the last trip during my PhD career that'll take
me to San Francisco, California at the end of September. I'll be
attending a robotics conference and me and my girlfriend are planning
to travel around California for three weeks afterwards, that is the
first three weeks in October. Since for the last 15 years, we have
been camping around Europe in our 78 westy, I'd prefer camping to any
kind of motel or hotel accomodation if possible and reasonable. So is
it a good idea to travel California by RV/bus or will the rental cost
and camping fees (and the hassle of finding a camping site) be as high
as renting a smaller car and staying in hotels/motels? Not really a
friend of these huge RVs, I checked for classic bus rentals and
stumbled upon http://www.vwsurfari.com. Since the prices are quite
high I was wondering if there are any other rental companies
specialized in our beloved buses. If someone on the list can point me
to places I'd definitely should visit, or is willing to share some
information about travel/camping/bus rentals/bus events in California
please contact me off-list: timo.schairer(-at-)googlemail.com
I'm looking forward to hearing from you guys!
Cheers,
Timo
