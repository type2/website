Bill also has schematics for the MK10 and MK10b on the same page I
linked

One could rebuild copies of them from scratch.

The streetfire probably won't trigger the L-Jet either without some
sort of filtering circuit added as mentioned by Mike S. Having looked
inside a few MSD's they are essentially all the same unit with only a
few altered resistors or caps to change the firing curve or spark
strength. And the "OffRoad" units are the standard units with most
parts potted in epoxy for shock (vibration) resistance.
