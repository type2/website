Subject: body panels and photos of right side behind the rear wheel.

Hi all,

 

I'm trying to decide how to weld in the replacement panels. I would like to
flange the panels and tack them in, but I'm not too sure if flanging would
be practical on the rear quarters. Also I'm looking for photos of the area
just in front of the right side battery tray and behind of the right rear
wheel. Are there any sources for metal gas lines and stainless brake lines>

 

Thanks once again for the advice.

 

Bob
