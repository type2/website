Hi Joe,

Another common failure point is old brake fluid clogging the switches
on the master cylinder.

Some have reported success with soaking them in solvent a few days,
but if not, the switches are only about $3 each anyway.

Test for this condition by jumping across the wires or across the
terminals with the wires still connected to see if the lights come on.
Check for 12 volts while you are under there.

John
