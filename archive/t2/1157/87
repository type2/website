Subject: Re: [T2] Another broken-off easy-out

The bolt sheered off inside the cone a few months ago. Since then  
I've been "thinking about it."

I drilled the bolt out over the weekend with reverse bits. The hole  
isn't perfectly centered, so that there's just a bit more meat on one  
side than on the other. That's when I tried a 5/16" easy out, which  
broke off inside. I hope that the easy out will come out with a bit  
of tapping.
