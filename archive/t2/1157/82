You were right, John. Its was the lip of the tin under the intake
manifold hanging things up.

I cut an aluminum vacuum nub off of another manifold from my scrap
heap, and I'll send it to the welder so I can have it drilled, tapped
and welded to the new manifold (dual throat DRLA, IDF type).

Similar welded nub in this pic: http://www.calpoly.edu/~sbusby/manifold.jpg
