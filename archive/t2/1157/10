Something to consider would be a compressor from a late 90s VW. They are 
variable displacement compressors and they don't cycle like other a/c 
compressors.

Helps take care of the surging caused by a compressor when it engages 
and disengages - especially while climbing a hill. Over the weekend I 
used our Brenderup 1205S to haul 600 lbs of sandblasting grit to my 
parent's place over the TN mountains. Our CR-V is HP challenged anyhow 
(but we love it) on the mtn roads so the a/c, loaded trailer plus a 
family of four with a dog used up all of the power. I'd be climbing a 
hill and then the compressor would kick in and really slow the 'V down 
so I began pre-emptively turning off the a/c button until I conquered a 
hill. We never dropped below ~45 mph so it isn't like I was in a 40 HP 
Beetle though.

Anyhow a variable displacement compressor would still require the same 
HP but it wouldn't nail the vehicle's slow progress up a hill quite so 
badly... When the freon pressure gets up to a point where the clutch 
would disengage on other types of compressors, something internally like 
a bypass valve opens and lets the pressure bleed off the right amount. I 
really enough the a/c on our VW Cabrio. Just a refinement thing.

Compressors like this look the same as a normal compressor. Cost is 
about the same too. Once upon a time 1stVWParts had them on sale for 
about $300.
