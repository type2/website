Oh yeah Mark, I probably would have tried to cave in the thin side (better
that it ended up  drilled off center) with a small good quality punch or
chisel, then they tend to peel right out.  Course now there is that EZ out in
there.  Good luck, we've all been there.

I drilled the bolt out over the weekend with reverse bits. The hole isn't
perfectly centered, so that there's just a bit more meat on one side than on
the other. That's when I tried a 5/16" easy out, which broke off inside. I
hope that the easy out will come out with a bit of tapping.
