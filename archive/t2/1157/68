Well, Chris, you asked, I'll tell my story.

I've been driving around the country more or less for two years, living in
my bus. Toward the end of June I was up in Northern New Mexico in the
Taos/Santa Fe area and I noticed the bus didn't seem to have the old spirit.
BTW, 1970 Westy, dual port engine.

On a hot day, July 1, 95 degrees, I drove the 300 miles from north of Taos
to Lake Caballo, south of Truth or Consequences.  The last 50 miles or so I
was really struggling up grades. Finally she overheated and wouldn't run. I
let her cool down for an hour and then limped the last 50 miles on two
cylinders to my camp site, sure that I had cooked the engine in the heat.

The heads are more than 10 years old with more than 60,000 miles on them, so
I decided it was time for a top end rebuild.  I ordered new heads, pistons
and jugs, gaskets -- all the stuff I thought I needed to do the job.

But while I waited for the parts to arrive I got thinking.  And the more I
thought about it the more I thought it sounded like a timing issue.  So, a
few days ago I, opened the distributer, checked the points (in there for 3
years) and, just as you found, the rubber had worn down. I put in new
points, gapped them, fiddled with the timing. Presto! The bus runs fine.
Plenty of power. All 4 cylinders.

I was too embarrassed before to admit jumping to such expensive conclusions.
But I figure, ah, well. Might as well share.  Now I've got $800 worth of
parts arriving next week. Gonna have to figure out what to do with them, but
the good news I don't have to pull the engine.

Cheers,

John Rogers
