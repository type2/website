Subject: RE: [T2] Brake switches

Has anybody 'on list' retrofitted a modern brake-light switch to their bus?  I
was thinking of doing so.  I need to fabricate a mount under the floorboard
near the pedal that is triggered when depressed.  I have an extra switch from
my Passat that should work quite nicely, but if anybody has already
accomplished this it would be interesting to see.Eron
