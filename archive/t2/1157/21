Subject: Fresh Air Flap Seals

It's summer now so I'm going to take the duct tap off the inside of the fresh 
air grille to get some added ventilation.
I had them taped up for winter and spring driving because the seals for the 
fresh air flap had crumbled to bits.

Where can I find new seals?  I remember reading that these are rare.  Is that 
still the case?

What are the alternatives?

I used a roll of self-adhesive foam strip to help seal up my louvered windows.

Has anyone used something like this for the air flaps?

Thanks,

Josh
