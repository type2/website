Because they are so very very hard (which they have to be) and hard equals
brittle.  Nothing quite as hard in daily use except a good tap, reamer, or EZ
out.
 
I'll give you though, nothing quite as dismal as breaking off an EZ out you
were trying to use to remove something that was already broken off.  If it is
big enough (over 8mm or so) you can always tack weld something to it.
