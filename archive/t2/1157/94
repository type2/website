 Mark, what type of easy-out was it? The square-tapered  drive it in type?
 Those suck, because they literally force the edges of the broken bolt
 tighter against the hole it's in. I found some reverse direction easy outs
 that actually screw in to your drilled hole and bite into the bolt. As
 you're applying downward pressure and screwing the easy out into the 
drilled
 hole, it's trying to turn the bolt out. I actually got an exhaust stud out
 with these type, and was really amazed. Of course I tried the old paraffin
 wax and propane torch trick first to get some lube down in the head/stud
 area.
