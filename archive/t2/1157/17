Subject: Travelling California by bus

Just returned from California with my daughter. Had a great time in
the rented vanagon from California campers. Cost was about 115.00 per
day. Campground fees were between 26 and 38 per night, The state parts
were beautiful. We went from San Fransisco to Hombolt and went 200
miles over the 100 mile per day limit for the week. I HIGHLY recommend
the trip and the camper rental. Remember to carry a bunch of quarters
to use for the state park showers! I might write up a trip report.
