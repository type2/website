Subject: R12 prices down, WAS [T2] AC for 69 kombi

Chris, this brings up a real interesting point I've been meaning to mention on
the list.  Has anyone noticed that R12 is getting relatively dirt cheap
compared to the ridiculous levels it was at 10 years ago?
 
In fact as R134A is getting expensive (to be replaced by some new nonsense BS)
R12 has quietly crept down to about $20-25/can on ebay where R134A has crept
up to a price in AK of $16-18 (though cheaper in the 48) but is supposed to
head over $20/can.  So if you know an AC tech, and you want real cooling
capacity, if you scarf more than the interior unit, consider good ole R12,
anyone who passes the test can buy it.  In fact you can buy it if you are
reselling to someone who can legally install it.  Odd this one, truely a case
where now once again supply has outstripped demand and prices have fallen in
suit.  Anyway for anyone who installs a complete system sized and designed for
R12 (dealer VW system) if it don't leak (which it better not) consider filling
it with the real stuff.

Check with the VW Bus parts guys and the hot rod/street rod magazines. I
hunted down the interior portion of an OEM style A/C system. Will pair it with
new parts to create the rest of the system. Local FLAPS can make the hoses for
me. Corvair driving friend is a licensed a/c tech so he can help me charge
it.
