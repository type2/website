Hey Timo!

The California State Park system is going through some changes and 70 parks
are slated to close. When, I don't know, and can't find any information on
the web other than it's either already been across Governor Brown's desk or
it's still in discussion. So something must have happened last week, or is
going to happen this week. Keep your eyes open for news on that.

Most State Park camping fees are about $35 per night. I stopped going
car-camping when the fees hit $20 - I used to car-camp up and down the coast
a lot when the fees were $12 and $13 a night - not really all that long ago
...

September and October are the best months for road tripping around
California. Just like in Europe, the weather is still nice (October is one
of the nicest months of the year - usually!) and because the kids are back
in school the campgrounds and roads are less crowded. I've never made a
reservation at a campground when traveling the coast between October and
April. But things may have changed.

Personally, I would not want to travel in a huge RV down any part of the CA
coast. The Escape Pod (a '71 transporter) is exactly the right size for
Highway One and the other scenic roads along the way.

The one thing about traveling in a VW (at least between SF and SLO) is that
you can't just pull off the road and camp.San Francisco has had problems
with people cooking meth in their vans, along with the homeless "problem",
so in certain parts of the city it is really difficult to car camp. Santa
Cruz is the same. In both places you can sleep in your van, but you can't be
obvious about it. It's a fairly steep fine if the police choose to harass
you. Around SF the GG Recreation Area park rangers are ruthless.

Along the Big Sur coast the road gets patrolled throughout the night and if
you are camped on a turnout on the side of the road, they will harass you.
But my favorite coastal State Parks are there, spaced at a convenient
distance apart: Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park and Limekiln State Park.

Places I would definitely hit on a California road trip: Mendocino (town
of), backroads of Sonoma and Marin County, Point Reyes/Bolinas, SF, Santa
Cruz, Carmel, Big Sur, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Yosemite. A lot of
others too, but those are my must sees.
