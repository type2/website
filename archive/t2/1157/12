So a little bit of proven superiority again.
 
Yesterday we put the '77 Westy and the '66 TR4A in the 4th of July parade (up
here if you got $25 you can put anything you want in the parade) with some
banners for my wifes clinic.  Anyway, no more than 1/2 way through, I had to
ditch in the TR4A with its mighty antifreeze filled pressurized cooling system
due to overheating.  Never blew off water but gage got red, and without a real
rear main seal the oil got thin and would sling out the rear  slinger then
dump over the exhaust causing a smoke screen.  Now Triumphs had dismally
underengineered cooling systems unless you can find a "Tropical Service" fan
for them, but still the bus soldiered right along without any issue.
 
Made me realize why I love the T4 engined bus.
 
Now the wife (driving the Westy) did NOT run the A/C.
 
Not to fully knock the TR4A, it does fine in regular driving, but parades are
hell, stop and go, no speed, no airflow, course the Westy was under the exact
same conditions and proved superior.  Time to install an aux pusher fan in the
TR4A I guess.
