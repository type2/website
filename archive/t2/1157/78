	Don't they have to be exceedingly hard, for their intended 
function?  If so, don't we then run into a strong (if not unbreakable 
;-) ) correlation between hardness and brittleness?  Can you get one 
without the other (within a given type of metal, e.g. steel)?
	An Australian brand of what I take to be the same device is: 
Unbreakos.  I have known them to break.
