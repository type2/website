Make sure the engine is "right" - no cooling problems or missing parts. 
Plenty of aftermarket kits. Add some temp indicators - head temps and 
oil temps.

Check with the VW Bus parts guys and the hot rod/street rod magazines. I 
hunted down the interior portion of an OEM style A/C system. Will pair 
it with new parts to create the rest of the system. Local FLAPS can make 
the hoses for me. Corvair driving friend is a licensed a/c tech so he 
can help me charge it.
