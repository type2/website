Subject: Distributor Advance was OK here is a post

This thread has been bothering me for a couple days....

You realize, of course, that due to the Subject of this thread it will  
be near impossible to recover this valuable discussion from the  
archives?

Perhaps we give it a title that somewhat reflects the content?
