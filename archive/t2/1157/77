is there any other reason to drop the engine??

I've been able to essentially destroy the EZout by hitting it with very 
hard sharp pointed chisel on the end.

I've also have had good results chucking the EZout into an impact driver. 
must be perfectly straight but the impact seems to help get it out.

of course lots of blaster or other solvent will help.


good luck
Bob
