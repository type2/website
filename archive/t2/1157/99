Subject: stereo solution .... 

I was having trouble with my old bus re stereo. I had a newish CD/mp3 player
installed under the parcel tray for a while. I never liked it and it was
always in the way ... but it worked. I considered installing an old radio in
the dash but I kinda like my block off plate and I figured it wouldn't work
all that great anyway (being old and all). For a time I had a satellite
radio in the front and a cd player in the back. That kinda worked but I had
to work it with the remote and it did look kind of stupid ..... I also had a
NOS 8-track player/fm radio installed for a time. It worked OK but I really
only had room for 5 or 6 8-tracks. 

I just bought this thing on ebay .... it is sort of an iphone/mp3 player
amp. I is very small ... like 3 x 2 1/2 x 1 or so ... you can plug your mp3
player into it and it works just like an amp ... its small so it hides right
under the dash ... all that is exposed is ipod jack - and a tiny on/off
switch ... for me its perfect. I might try and plug my satellite radio in
and see how that goes ...
