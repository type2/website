Subject: Mail archive access

I finally got around to making the new archive search engine more useful. It
now shows results with the subject line instead of the message number. I know,
I know... the number was sooo cool though. But functionality prevails. A
preview of the message is also available in the search results. Though you can
sort by title (aka subject,) it doesn't work exactly as expected since "My bus
problem" doesn't land immediately before "RE: My bus problem"  All the RE's to
a message will be grouped together but the original message will be on the
some other page in a dark corner. For now, you can get around this by
searching a known subject line with quotes around it like "My bus problem".
You're still likely to bet results from other messages though. When I get time
to implement sorting while indexing, you'll be able to search by things like
sender, date, subject, etc.

Also, the current browsing page at http://type2.com/ezmlm-archives is linked
to from the new'er type2.com website, as is the search engine. Search engine
archives are current to 2011 July 16.

Check for the links in the top menu bar at http://type2.com/s  ... and tell
your friends.

Development continues. Feedback/criticism welcomed.
