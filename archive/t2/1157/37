Yuck!  The whole purpose of using electric points is to get rid of them! 
  So what if your coil is triggered by a transistor if the points are 
still dictating the timing.  That means you just added another 
intermediate level of complexity which means there's potentially 
something else to fail.

Get yourself a pertronix or compufire and never adjust your points 
again, have more stable and consistent timing, and reap all the benefits 
of whatever this module may give you with a tiny unit that sits inside 
your distributor.

If you want real electronic ignition, go with the megasquirt and the 
computer actually controls the coil directly - that is electronic 
ignition - but that's a whole other level of complexity ;)
