Subject: Re: [T2] Semi-electronic Ignition

On one hand I agree with Mike, however I have an old capacitive discharge 
ignition with a transistorized input that reduces the load on the points to 
a level that allows me to run a set of point 20,000 miles or more with 
little to no adjustments. All the other good gushy stuff they advertize is 
simply not true. If you can find yourself a CDI, then you will have some of 
the benefits. My engine starts on the first cylinder that comes to TDC.
