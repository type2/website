You don't need the aux fan at all, it does little to improve the heater 
air flow and probably does nothing at all to cool the heat exchangers.  
The main air flow for the heater boxes comes from the engine cooling 
fan, not the aux fan.  Just make sure all the joints are tight, 
especially the joints between the fan shroud and the heater boxes (are 
your little covers in place and sealed well?), and that both ports in 
the top of the heater boxes where the aux fan connected are closed off 
completely, and you will be fine.
