Subject: Re: [T2] Another broken-off easy-out

Courtney,

This was from Sears, and it was a tapered reverse-screw. One of my  
fears is that I've drilled into the threads in the shaft, and part of  
the easy-out was biting into that. A little misdirected torque from  
me and - snap.

I'm going to soak the thing in Blaster for a few days and then pick  
at it. One good thing is that it's easy to move the thing 360 degrees  
for better angles!
