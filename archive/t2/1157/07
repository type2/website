I really, really like that! I proposed to my bride in our bus 14 years 
ago and she accepted. We camped in Cades Cove in the Smokey Mountains (a 
favorite of ours when we can go and miss the crowds). We camped, cooked 
some simple fare on the Westy stove and then she found her ring in the 
bottom of a rigged Cracker Jack box.

She's the best decision thing that ever happened to me. GRIN! We'll 
probably never get rid of that old Westy.
