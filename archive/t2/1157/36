No I had not. I don't currently own an R-12 system. Only 134a. 
Apparently 134a is on the way out, replaced with yet another Freon 
starting in 2012? Once upon a time I bought a 30LB canister of R-12 back 
before you needed a license. Went back a year or so later and found that 
all the R-12 had leaked out of the still sealed canister. $200+ down the 
drain... ;)

I bought a case of R-134A last year. Still no license requirements for 
it here? A case of 1lb cans. I did have to replace a compressor clutch 
bearing, a dryer (a given when you open the system) and an expansion 
valve on the VW Cabrio. Didn't get something right so I have to go back 
and recheck everything. Still have the system charged so no leaks. Am 
worried I might have a paper shop towel stuck in a line somewhere. I was 
using them to keep dirt out of the compressor. Maybe I did not get all 
the scraps out and I plugged the expansion valve.
