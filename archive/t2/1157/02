I have found this concern to be highly overrated. I told the president
of the Thai VW club that in the US people are concerned about adding
something to the vehicle which is not original German. He said that if
you actually want to drive your VW in Thailand, you have to have AC.

Rare is the VW in Thailand without an AC, and they all seem to be
doing fine. Regarding the occasional horror story we hear about
engines being cooked by AC, I'd say they were killed by some other
engine problem, just like the stories we hear about type 1 engines
snapping a valve by driving in the mountains in the heat of summer.
