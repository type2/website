Uhh, bit of an issue.  I love the 6Ax, but...
 
They won't trigger L-jet more than 50/50 even with their tach adapter. 
Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.  I once knew why, has to do with the
trigger slope they generate and what L-jet expects, one could delve on Pelican
Parts site and recall why.  Anyway fine for anyone non L-jet, may or may not
work for an L-jet.  I used to use the Universal Tigers till they got a bit
pricey for a home cobbled bit, then did a couple MSDs with vague results as
above, then went to a Mallory myself that is NLA, so....
 
I wonder if the MSD cheaper Streetfire 5520 unit would trigger L-jet.

For a points fired CDI just grab an MSD 6A or 6AL if you want "new and
not used/old".
