It's probably the filtering that they have inside the ljet computer. 
The points triggering system is pretty noisy and I initially had to do a 
lot of work to get my points to trigger my MegaSquirt... and the issue 
isn't really the points (I was using compufire), but something more 
having to do with the ringing of the coil, or something like that.  I'm 
not an EE so I don't know exactly what the issue was, other than I had 
to use a lot of capacitors and resistors to filter out the noise :)
