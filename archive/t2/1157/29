Subject: Re: [T2] Brake switches

I noticed my 78 Passat has this too. I thought the mounting bracket
would be easy to copy for a bus, but I haven't figured out the
electricals.

I wonder if it's a reverse switch that the circuit is broken when
depressed and closed when let free.

Otherwise a conventional switch would have to be constantly driving a
relay that breaks the circuit when depressed.
