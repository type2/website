after the first one breaking I've always used the alt bolt to turn the 
engine sometimes having to really forcing the fan belt tight to get it to 
turn right.

WEAR FACE PROTECTION cobalt drills are great but I had one shatter and 
thank god I was wearing safety glasses and a bit of  drill was imbedded 
into the lens, that could have been my eye which would have really ruined 
my day and maybe my life rather than a pair of safety glasses, (which I 
keep around to remind me how fast something like that can happen)

brittle stuff breakes and the energy being applied send bits every which 
where sometimes.  be carefull
