Timo, also remember/consider Walmart parking lot camping (which is likely not
very common in Europe.)  Not exactly beautiful, but in a pinch can be free and
convenient.  Now I recall from several years ago that CA has some/most of the
camping unfriendly Walmarts  probably for the reasons mentioned.  There is a
continually updated online list out there, google Walmart camping to find
where you can.  On the super cheap, it isn't bad.  Frankly when we made our
cross continent oddysey 4 years ago from WV to AK (took 18 days to do a 5 day
trip) about 1/3 nights we Walmart camped, 1/3 we national/state/city park
camped, and the other we split between occasional hotel or commercial
campgrounds.  I actually liked Walmart camping because you would have people
in junk ($3000 '87 25 foot RV like me) sitting right beside $200,000 RVs and
everyone was super pleasant, chatty, helpful to each other.  And some of the
locations actually were beautiful (Bozeman I
 seem to recall.)
 
Anyway not so common in CA, and certainly probably not on the coast, but worth
a look.  In AK you can do the same in Fred Meyers parking lots, which I think
are also in CA?

Cruz is the same. In both places you can sleep in your van, but you can't be
obvious about it. It's a fairly steep fine if the police choose to harass
you. Around SF the GG Recreation Area park rangers are ruthless.
