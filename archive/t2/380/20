no.

while the crankshafts are robust, the cams and lifters are very susceptible
to wear. if the heads are off you can find out. with a magnetic probe, pull
one of the lifters out of its bore (mark/keep track of the hole from which
you pulled it) and look for wear marks and signs of the lifter surface being
concave. if the lifter is bad, so is the cam lobe. if you pull all the
lifters (again mark them) you can shine a light into the lifter bores and
inspect the cam lobes. look for small depressions on the toe of the lobes.
