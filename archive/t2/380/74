I wonder why Bentley even specs the pressure without the vacuum hose connected?

Seems to me that the way the system works is that a constant pressure
differential must be maintained across the injectors over the span of
operating conditions. Under varying conditions, the vacuum hose is
responsible for establishing this differential.

With this logic, if one has 28 psi with the engine running and the
vacuum hose connected, then the system is ok. Of course, one should
check to be sure that 28 is maintained under load. How? I don't know.
I'm thinking about it.

I hope someone with more knowledge than I have comments on this.
