Subject: 2.0L Rebuild saga cont'd

volks,

firstly i cant thank all the listees who responded enough, your emails
have given me a much better understanding of what kind of situation i am
in.

just a few more questions...

is it reasonable to assume that the lower end is in decent shape? i have
heard that 2.0L lower ends are virtually indestructable so maybe GEX
couldnt have screwed up the lower end too bad or maybe they didnt rebuild
the lower end at all.
basically what it comes down to is the fact that im pretty broke and very
new to working on volks. i feel capeable enough to replace the heads, but
a bottom end rebuild seem way out of my league. could removing the heads,
taking them to a mcachinest to get checked out, and replacing what i need
to be an adequate solution to my problem. i bought this bus almost a year
ago and it has yet to see the open road. thanks in advance.
