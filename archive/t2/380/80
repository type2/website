Subject: Speaking of rebuilds...

I'm going to be looking for a core for a '78/'79 Westy alternator.. the big
alternator that put out 70 amps. I think the number is (Bosch) AL108. I think
the AL75X is the 55 amp model used for the transporter (bus). If I can get a
rebuildable core, there's a place near me that rebuilds starters, etc. If
anyone out there has one in their surplus pile, please let me know. I'll pay a
reasonable price, gladly. It's not something I need right away.. It's for a
future project. Thanks!
