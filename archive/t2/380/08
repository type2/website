Make sure that the heads aren't eroded from the bad gasket.

My take on it, it might be a poor rebuild, but you might be lucky.  If you
are comfortable with taking it all apart and reassembling it in a few hours
or days that is probably worth it, if you have a torque wrench, then go for
it.

But, an easy way to check that there is no imminent doom without cracking
the case, would be to pull the cylinders out halfway (leaving the piston
rings compressed in the cylinders, do this for the pistons that are at their
furthest extents, then rotate the crank 180), just check that there is no
play in the rod bearings and minimal side-to-side play.  Check end play as
well, that is probably most important.

Invest in AAA Plus (100 miles towing) and make sure you have the credit card
overhead when you DO need another long block, if it happens to crap out
somewhere out of town.

I don't buy the doomsayers argument.  Few people really need a brand new
engine--although while you have the heads off, get them checked by an
expert.  Even a GEX-er will get you to the show.  Have fun and drive it, and
take it easy in the summer heat.  In the words of St. Muir, "Kindly come to
terms with your ass, for it bears you."

Good luck,
