Subject: Re:brake booster repair

The Bentley Official Service Manual describes the overhaul on pages 10 and 
11 of the section on Brakes and Wheels. Repairs are limited to replacing 
the filter and dampening ring, rubber boot, and the sealing ring inside the 
air connection. Owners are cautioned not to attempt further disassembly. It 
is also suggested that the "O" ring between the master cylinder and the 
vacuum chamber be replaced when the other parts are serviced.

Check with "Old Volks of Arizona
aka Type2Parts.com
aka Ronnie's Garage"
for servo replacement.
Price is not listed in their on-line catalog. You should probably call first:

The part is described as follows:

Servo (Power Brake Booster), Type 2 1971-1979
Power Brake Booster for disc brake Type 2. Application: Type 2 1968-1979
The book lists 1968-1979, but disc brakes were not introduced until 1971.
