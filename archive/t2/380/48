Hey all,

It is time to bid a fond farewell to my 74 Deluxe Westy---
It has 32,000 original on it--and has bouqoix factory accesories.

Absolutley fantastic condition---no rust , no dent's anywhere--the
interior still smells new--the floorboards are as new and I waxed them
in a ritual fashion.

Perfect in ever sense of the word--

Comes with matching trailer--

Check out my web page for pictures of the Bus--

$13,000 

Drop me a ine for particuars--


Later,

            ______________
