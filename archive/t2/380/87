 Seems to me that the way the system works is that a constant pressure
differential must be maintained across the injectors over the span of
operating conditions. Under varying conditions, the vacuum hose is
responsible for establishing this differential.

 With this logic, if one has 28 psi with the engine running and the
vacuum hose connected, then the system is ok. Of course, one should
check to be sure that 28 is maintained under load. How? I don't know.
I'm thinking about it.

 I hope someone with more knowledge than I have comments on this.

Jack,
The system only opens the injecters for a set period of time. The volume of fuel that flows through the
injecter is controlled by pressure.

The reason the regulator is contolled by manifold vacuum and Bentley gives a spec for it:  Think of a
carburetor with an accelerator pump. When you step on the throttle, you get a shot of fuel. Same thing happens
with EFI. When you step on the throttle: manifold vacuum drops, fuel pressure rises, more fuel flows through
the injecters. You get a rich condition.
