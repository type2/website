Subject: thermostat

I am rebuilding our 2.0l bus engine and our thermo is shot, I hav called 
Rocky mountain and busboys and California imports for a new one but they say 
they are no longer available, does anyone have a good one, not stretched out 
or warping. I grabbed one from a bus in the junkyard but am afraid to use it 
because it is warping a little and did  not seem to open a lot. bentley says 
it should reach at least 46mm but where should it be to begin. If anyone has 
one I would appreciate it.
