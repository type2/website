Subject: '86 Vanagon Jump Seats $125

Just stopped by a recycle yard, looking for trunk lift struts for my 
daughter's 1994 Nissan 240SX CONVERTIBLE  [shameless cry for HELP ! ! ] 
since only dealer [$110] or junk yard has them. They are NOT the same as the 
hatchback struts, which are available at about $25 everywhere.  They ARE the 
same as the COUPE


While there, I looked at 3 bays, and 2 Vanagons.

The last look was on a GREY '87 (12/86) Vanagon with two rear-facing jump 
seats still in the vehicle.

These were the first jump seats in my life that I ever saw!!!  Anywhere.

They are grey, and very clean [some rain water] and I guess pretty complete; 
seats, two 'pipes holes' for the base, the rear bracket that attaches to the 
Vanagon pedestal, and seat belts.


They fold up, and you can lift them right out.  Probably weigh about 25 lbs 
+ 5 lbs brackets each.

I talked sweet to Richard (his first price was $200 for the pair) to get 
this price. [$125 + taxes]


Yes, there is an ulterior motive; I included something else in the 
negotiations, plus I hope to grab two black "HOLY SH^T!!" grab straps, to 
replace the white ones in my '78 Westy


So I am willing to work with anyone local.


As always, p-mail me off list.  I will not respond until MONDAY.

First choice goes to H Steven, or Karl, or Mike G [I owe all three].


The grey Vanagon also has a pair of very decent front seats, and the rear 
seat, but I would not want to guess the prices.  This is NOT a inexpensive 
yard, so I would not even ask...
