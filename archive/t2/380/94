I've been awaiting their new website and it's up.  Lots of interesting OE
items for sale (duh!).

This one caught my eye:

OEM retractable seat belts that largely were a Euro item. Looks like you
need to fashion your own mounting bracket or mount them to the bulkheads
like the factory did (if you have them). Not sure if the belt will expand
enough for you to mount them lower.
