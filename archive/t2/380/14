Take the coil out, lay it flat and allow hot sun (hair dryer) to warm all 
of the coils. As it was explained to me (and as I remember it) by Karl - 
there is ammonia and paraffin inside the coils and the paraffin solidifies 
after years of non-use.

It is blocking flow someplace the heater element is not warming.

Mine has the exact same problem. I did get mine to flow without removing it 
from the cabinet and it did get COLD but then quit again - as I assume a 
blockage reoccurred.

So gently warm the whole coil - and you should be in business.

Question to the list: what about 200 degrees in the oven for a short while? 
Would it cause a pressure buildup and rupture?

These ammonia absorption refrigerators are pretty neat stuff and could be 
quite useful in a house in a larger scale if a heat source was easy (pilot 
light?). Would be a lot quieter and less power consumption I'd guess.

If you feel sure that your coil is junk and plan to toss it - could I pay 
you shipping to send it to me? I'd like to have a second one to play with...
