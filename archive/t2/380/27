Hi Michael,

Have a look at the vaccuum and electric connections on the carbs .

Assuming you have the original dual solex's, you need good vacuum 
connections or you will get the symptoms you describe. It is also 
critical to make sure that the wiring on the carbs is all present, 
correct and getting power.

Yesterday afternoon I took a trip downtown to buy a 77 Sunroof 
Automatic bus, and all the way there my 1.8L engine was surging and 
stumbling. It was a true PITA to manage in traffic. It idled OK, but 
power was unsteady and the bus seemed to be always "hunting" for a 
different speed. When I got to my destination I checked the carbs for 
vacuum and electrical glitches and discovered the spade connector to 
the D/S carb solenoid had let go and the wire was just resting against 
the contact.

Other carbs I can't advise on, but I am getting pretty familiar with 
the more common solex issues.

Happy trails,
