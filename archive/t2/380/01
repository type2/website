Subject: schofield metal availability

hey list, i emailed alan schofield and didn't get a reply yet. i guess if
they're slow or out of biz i wonder about the availability, in the states,
to the list. i need a left side rocker, plus about 8-10 inches above that
seam. this is for a bay doublecab. in conversation with a parts place i got
told that there was interchangeability between the rocker on a DC and a
split bus. can anyone speak to these bewonderments?   - steve
