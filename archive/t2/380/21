David,

I had a friend with a similar  car/engine ...his results were very 
similar in terms of heat and oil temps.  When I bought a F**d
SVT we talked about it and he said he could probably keep up with my 
6cyl for about 3 miles at high speed and then would be so hot that
he would have to quit.

Last time I changed my oil after a 30mile 80mph interstate run, the oil
coming out of the oil pan was about 160 degrees(F**d)...didn't sit more 
than 3 minutes either....so go figure....

I gonna don my flame suit here also and say that if VW had wanted you to 
know what the oil temp was, they would have put one in.

THe best example I have seen of why to have one was Ben Huoit(sp?) who 
watched in horror as his temps climbed severly after sucking a plastic 
bag over his intake grill down in Mexico...probably saved his engine.

In that case, I want one!

Here is the real kicker though!  My new AVP came with heat oversensor
buttons glued to both heads(outside center top fins) and to the case.
From what I read, if they go over 260 degrees, then they turn color and 
the supplier says "sure it failed....you overheated it".

260 degrees?...hmmmmmm anyone have any insight on that one?

Low temps and hi pressure oil forever, dave
