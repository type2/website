Hmmm, there's a few spots in California that might
also be in the running:

1) Berkeley (cliche but true)
2) Venice (see above)
3) Joshua Tree on any given day - majority Vanagons
4) Highway 1/Central Coast - mostly Vanagons

My little artsy/hipster-cum-yuppie :-( neighborhood in
Echo Park (LA) has about 8 busses within a several
block area.  There are some common personality factors
that draw people to these areas, I think, that while
not causal, at least seem to correlate.  Factors such
as love for road travel, remnants of (or perhaps an
evolved) beat or hippie outlook (though obviously not
everyone), art, camping/outdoors, etc. 

Just some fun speculation on a Friday, ur, Saturday.
