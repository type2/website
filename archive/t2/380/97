Actually the opposite is true. The injectors pulse on time varies  as a 
function of throttle advance. The differential pressure at the  injector tip 
is fixed at the regulator value measured with the vacuum line removed from 
the regulator. The details can be found in  "Bosch Fuel Injection & Engine 
Management"  by Charles O. Probst,SAE.
