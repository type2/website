Do you remember the dimensions of the floor by chance? The old floor piece
which I kept for a pattern is like 51" and something by 50" and something.
Originally a german 5x5 sheet or whatever that would be in metric. Did you
use 4x8 sheets? How where you able to cover the gaps that would be on the
sides where the plywood only covers 4 feet across on the floor?? Thanks for
the info...
