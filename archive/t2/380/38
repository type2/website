You can set the timing with a static procedure to 70 BTDC. That will rule
out the starting issue as related to timing. And you can verify the dwell
with just the starter motor turning the engine, but if the feeler gauge gap
is in spec, dwell is not the issue, it's close enough to start and run. If
you are not very familiar with the firing order and such, check again very
carefully your HT wires and verify something isn't crossed out of order.
It's a very easy error to make. I've replaced hundreds of sets of HT wires
and still every once in a while get something crossed. If I don't get
instant start after ignition service, it's the first thing I check.
