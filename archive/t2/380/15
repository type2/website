Cool story. I've pulled several things with my bus and CR-V that was too 
heavy for the vehicle (big motorcycles, rocks, logs, lumber, Beetles). It 
can always be done if I accelerate slowly and stop slowly enough but not 
good for the vehicle, and most of all not good for my nerves! <grin> I've 
been a lucky SOB over the years.
