Subject: Busted CV???

The wife was driving my bus and busted a CV Joint, assuming that was the only 
prob.  Busted it right off the wheel, Broke the bolts (allen head screws???) 
right off in the wheel. OUCH!!!!!!  So, with that in mind, and Just 
happening.  The bus still moves (With one driveline), Oh I didn't mention 
this is the REAR CV, How do I attack this disaster.  I haven't consulted with 
my books yet.  It's seems to be just a  natural reaction to address the list 
and read my book while the feedback comes in.
                                              HELP
           SO ANY FEEDBACK WILL BE GREATLY APPRECIATED!!!!!!
