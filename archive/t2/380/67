Subject: Vaccume brake booster

Boy it's bad to get old, my bus and I need new parts,
I have a 1973 bus that is in dire need of a vaccume
brake booster. Is there anyone out there that has good
one one that would be willing to part with it for a
price  + postage. Or where I can get a rebuild kit for
it. Please let me know. Phil
