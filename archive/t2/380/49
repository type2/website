Subject: Re: [T2] Door buzzer idea

I received a few ideas from people re: activating the door buzzer when the
lights are left on. The simplest solution sent to me was simply to wire a 5
cent diode from terminal 58 of the headlight switch to terminal 85 of the
door buzzer relay. The diodes provides a current path when you pull the
light switch but prevents the lights from coming on when you insert the
ignition key. So simple!

In my searches I also found these suggestions on the web for adding a buzzer
to the oil pressure warning light and leaving the lights on:
