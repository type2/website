Subject: Installing Piston Rings & Juggs

Back again.  I was able to get the jugg that was fused to the piston off today
(after 4 saw-all blades and a little time.)  I still have not dropped the
motor out.  I was given a '82 Vanagon with 2.0L air cooled type 4 engine that
developed a hole in the head and has some fins damaged on two juggs.

I am going to try to install one new piston, two sets of rings and two new
juggs tommarrow (weather permitting.)  I have a piston ring installer and
compressor.  Any tips or tricks?

I am also looking for good references on the heads and especially checking the
valves to make sure they don't leak by.  Although I haven't quite gotten that
far yet.

This van is begining to be a very fun experiance, however I have never been
this deep into an engine before.  I would appriciate any words of wisdom! :)

Thanks!
Jeremy
