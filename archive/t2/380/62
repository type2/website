Been there, sort of. A week or so after doing cv work I lost it on the
road to work. Turned out the cv bolts had backed out and I guess the last
one holding sheared. Got AAA to tow me to home so I didnt have to fix it
on the street.
The bolt that sheared messed up the threads in the stub axle. Got a
matching tap from the good tool supply, got a whole new set of triple
squares from the flaps (old ones were allen). Tapped and reassembled all
good.
The stub axle bad to come out and it was all a PITA but not too horrible.
