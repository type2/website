Subject: Rockford  CV Boots

definitely the way to go!!

Rockford 339 - 4A for VW Transporter/Vanagon ('A' just means with the flange 
is attached).

As solid as originals, same size as original, with FOUR ribs.

I took four CV boots off my '72, and they look 'original'; they have the VW 
mark [VW JURID 64,5] on the band and a VW part number [VW 211 501 151A  H/S  
  13]   on the rubber under the band.  The Rockford boots look and feel the 
same.


Well, they came with the   flange/boot   and   grease    and   a metal tie 
strap for the small end.  Each cost = $10 + taxes.  And all the CV ball 
bearings you can fit in your pocket!!!

Nice people.  Worth driving 70 miles R/T to Fredericksburg  VA, but look up  
  RockfordCV.com   for the dealer nearest you.
