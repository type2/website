This is why I say no always to aftermarket oil coolers for VW's. Everyone 
ever in my shop what there for a new motor due to lubrication failure.

All REAL racers of modified stock motors dump the oil after every race for 
this reason. It cooks the oil. If they don't, they soon cook enough motors 
they got no more money for racing. That's why real racers by oil in drums, 
they use a lot of it to keep the motors hot and humming.

When the oil gets overheated it looses it's viscosity. You can feel this 
with your fingers. If it thins out, change it, as often as your special use 
requires. If you keep the oil fresh you won't hurt your bearings.

Don't fear high oil temps. Just change the oil before it thins out. All 
special uses must have special maintenance. And it really is folly to 
compare a water cooled V-8 Ford with an air cooled VW. There is very little 
difference in HP/cc between a stock 2.0L VW and a stock 5.0L Ford. The big 
difference is that you can't modify the cooling system of the VW like you 
can the Ford to cool the hot modifications.
