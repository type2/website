Glad to see your post on the list, Chris. Worried that you had been picked 
up by a tornado and lifted off with Toto, to Oz.

I liked your advice to Jesper. Tow as light as possible and as low to the 
ground as you can get, and do it slow. 1000 pounds sounds right, with 
around 110 pounds on the hitch.

Many years ago, I pulled a small Swedish hard side trailer over the Alps 
three times, and all around Europe for 2 years....with an early type 4 
engine in a new squareback sedan.  It got scary when roads iced up night, 
at about 5000 feet. I just parked it and waited for daylight.
Another memorable moment was coming into Paris on Sunday night, from 
Normandy. All the Paresians were coming back to the city, and roads were 
bumper-to-bumper. All the highways end up in a big 12 lane circle around 
the Arc de Triumph, and then you get in the outside lane and shoot off to 
whatever part of the city you want. Excepts, with the trailer back there, I 
couldn't get into the lanes I wanted. So, I just went around and around for 
half an hour. Finally, I got in a cUrb lane but had lost track of which 
street took me to the park, where there was camping by the Seine. I just 
swerved off on the first street that was possible, and it took me back out 
of the city in another direction. I drove away from Paris, parked along the 
road, and took a big swig of scotch to calm me down. I just rested there, 
in the trailer, until about 2 am. Then, I turned around and went back into 
the city. Traffic had calmed down, and I found the campground and we spent 
the rest of the week in Paris. End of story. So, what is the point? I don't 
know....just a story about trailers and towing with an air-cooled type 4 
engine. Have a good Friday.

 >Howdy. I've got a '71 Westphalia and I want to tow a geo metro 
.....snip......
You've got a few options here:
1st: a V-8 engine conversion with a Porsche 915 tranny. Use the Rover V-8
b/c it is all aluminum and weighs less. ...........snip........
4rd: drive the bus. Learn camp bonzai setup and teardown methods.
Have fun... Let us know what you decide.
