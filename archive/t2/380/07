If you can supply a good candidate for full resto, I would contract to make 
it fine and functional as new for about $10,000, plus extra cost for extra 
lots of rust removal or extra fixing of poor compromise repairs, missing 
hinges. This would include a quality reman motor (NW Con Rod), a reman 
tranny (AA Transaxel) and full dissassembly and paint of choice, new wiring 
harness, new brakes, new upholstery. Suspension and steering links and 
bushings as needed.

Otherwise, you should go the VW club meets to see the many poor and the few 
good restored single cabs. If you find one that looks and drives as new, 
start your offers at $10,000 up to your wife's limit. I doesn't have to 
have a for sale sign on it. All of them are for sale at the right price. 
Only the owner knows that price, and you have to pry it out of them without 
annoying them. You will see some in thesamba.com classified ads so check 
there.
