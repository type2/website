Bob,

" Spark energy is reduced greatly as engine revs rise. The problem becomes 
even worse in multicylinder installations having smaller points dwell 
times."

from here http://users.mrbean.net.au/~rover/ketterin.htm

Excellent description of a Kettering Ignition System.

Basically, worse at high rpm's cause the coil doesn't have as
much time to build up a nice hot fat spark.


Cheers, dave
