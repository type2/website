Platinum plugs (small electrodes) are suitable for cars with high-energy
ignition systems where the plugs are changed at extended intervals.  Our
buses, with conventionsl points ignitions work better with the standard
non-platinum plugs.

My personal preference is for NGK plugs.  VW seems to have the same
attitude, since that is how they come from south o' the border these
days.
