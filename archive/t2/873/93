Reading that ad carefully, he is selling a used reproducion of the
OEM tin.  Since he is unwilling to post pictures of the repro tin (the tin
pictured is OEM, only the rear half, and the fine print says that it
is already sold) I'd be _very_ suspicious of the quality of the repro.

1600s came in a lot of late bays in Europe and the UK.  I wonder if used
OEM tin can be had from sources there?
