i have a 1978 bus.   the sliding door is in good shape but the track on the
bottom is completely rusted after the half way point.  the track on the
outside is in much better shape. harldly any rust.    i am looking for the
right part  or parts to replace the track and the part it is mounted too.

documentation on how it is done wold be greatly appreciated.
