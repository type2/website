Subject: spark plugs

Hello, quick question (hopefully)
I just did a tuneup a bit ago and
part of the process was changing the plugs.
The motor is a 1700 fuel injected beast.
Old plug Bosch W8CC
New plug is WR8CP (Bosch)
It was on Bosch's website

This info was in the finder there:
WR8CP   PLATINUM PLUG CJ, GE; Gap=.028
W8CC   O.E. SPARK PLUG CJ, GE; Gap=.028

Does this mean I have the right plug? Just oem vs
whatever?

I've changed plugs, new air filter in, valves adjusted,
and tuned.
It's running alright however the tailpipes are showing
some carbon.  There is no usage of oil whatsoever,
runs great, great power.. recent total rebuild.
Should I be concerned about a little carbon on the inside
of the tailpipe?

Another question:
I didn't have a temp gauge installed when the motor was
rebuilt. What are my options for monitoring heat and should
I bother doing it?

74 westie, automatic
1700 fi, 914 heads
obviously not the original motor in it :)
