To add...within the same size (2L, 1.8L, 1.7L) all AMC heads are the  
same.

AMC makes castings in Spain. The US importer installs the valves etc  
and grinds the seats. The quality of that work varies as they use  
parts from various suppliers but no one is reporting widespread  
premature failure of these heads.

He's selling $8000+ engines and can't risk having an $800 part fail  
on him before 100k miles so he upgrades the heads. However, he is  
constantly giving the impression that unless you follow his advice  
and buy from him you will experience early catastrophic failure which  
I would classify slightly as FUD.

It would be unfair of me to say that he sells anything less than an  
improved product for the extra money charged but not everyone needs it.
