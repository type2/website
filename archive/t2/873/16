WHAT Bosch website??

It frosts me when I see spark plug listings that say platinum or resistor 
plugs are "recommended by the
manufacturer".



I searched the web just now for any Bosch factory website that tells me what 
plugs I should use and none of
them did. They all sent me to retailers.

Then I searched for websites that sold Bosch plugs and the 1st 20 of them 
said to Plus4 and this and that
resistor/platinum crap without even asking what vehicle I had!

Then the 21st one at least wanted to know make year and model, and lo and 
behold, ONLY the correct plug came
back:
