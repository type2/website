Subject: Zero ohm distributor rotors

Since I am running an MSD CDI ignition I need to use a zero ohm rotor. 
Stock is either 1K or 5K, which will apparently burn out with the MSD.  
Alternatives were to modify an existing one, or buy an altered one from 
aircooled.net.

Much to my surprise the cheap aftermarket ones I found are zero ohm, and 
therefore not to spec!  Niehoff WA307 (narrow nose) or WA315 (wide nose) 
are two examples (...and made in the USA). I bought another cheap one 
which crossed to the Niehoff WA315 # and same thing. 
Moral:  Buy Bosch for 'to-spec' parts, buy no name if you NEED the 
manufacturing cheap-out shortcut!

Also watch out for the distributor cap quality as well. The 
spring-loaded carbon button center contact which touches the rotor was 
recessed on one I had been using and would not come out of its hole!  
Spark still flowed, but would have had to jump at that point.
