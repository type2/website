From Frank Biffath III:

Some things I noticed.. I could not find the VIN tag on the dash, of any of them???

The 75 had a trip meter, is this rare on a 75 VDO?

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The vin-thru-the-windshield is a USA mandate.  You don't see them on non USA Mercedes either. When gray market
MB's are brought in, one of the DOT requirements is to pop rivet the vin to the top of the dash.

Was that trip speedo in KM??  Bet it was......
