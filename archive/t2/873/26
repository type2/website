Marcus,

See if you can talk this guy into a "group buy" rate.  I'm interested.  
we can also split the cost of shipping.

Maybe we can purchase the conversion parts while sourcing 944 calipers 
stateside. . . ?
(BTW I'm interested in P 5x130 bolt pattern not wide5)
I also have a spare set of 911 M calipers and rotors so that would work too.
