Subject: Re: [T2] spark plugs

Just curious. What's considered stock now-a-days?
My points are gone for a pertronix.
The 1700 fi is mated to a 74 auto tranny (should be carbs)
914 heads..
But I see what you mean. Originally I was simply wondering
exactly that.. did I buy the wrong ones and what was the number for
the correct ones.
Since I am using email space to reply, any easy place to pick up some of the
rubbers that seal the spark plugs from the tin? I am missing 2, actually 3 
since
one is hard as rock and could use being renewed.

Use stock Bosch coppers with stock Bosch ignitions on stock air cooled VW's, 
always, and have no worries as best function is ensured thereby. All else is 
testimony, hearsay and subjective compared to the objective proof applied by 
the engineers who designed the machine.
