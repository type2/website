Buy wizbang, justify wizbang, sell wizbang, in that order.

Superb, that's the nut shell, folks. This is the foundation of 
wizbang economy.  If it makes you feel great, it's justified. Pass me 
the pipe, I want to feel high. Is it any wonder whatsoever that 12 
year olds are emulating this "ethic"? As far as I'm concerned, if 
that is the majority view, damn the law, that 12 year old is just as 
justified in moving up the ladder to the needle before he quits high 
school 'cause he's not having fun in class. And the pusher is 
justified 'cause he is the source of good feelings, and he deserves 
to make a profit and succeed. And if feelgood=value then 
feelbetter=morevalue. And subjective/objective does not get taught. 
And the people that put nose to the grindstone and succeed in 
accomplishing objective goals creating earned value are a lesser form 
of life than those who sell subjective ideas in the form of wizbang 
and make big bucks and are therefore perceived as having higher 
value, for the majority pursues money which makes us feel good which is value.

Everyone knows platinum is more noble than copper. Sell the idea. 
Seems right, must be longer lasting, quicker starts, better mileage, 
cleaner burning, and every spark sends a prayer to heaven. Here's my 
money, you sold me. Don't confuse me with the facts before I buy, and 
make darned sure you don't pop my wisdom bubble after I have spent my 
money by reporting independent test results. Don't confuse me with 
the facts 'cause that makes me feel bad, ergo, facts=negative value. 
Damn you Doktor Tim, your attacking the foundations of the fastest 
growing economic expansion the world has ever known. It's a 
foundation of sand, and the further we push it, the greater the risk 
of a new Dark Age of death and misery for the masses.

Objective economics is the scientific proof of less energy/effort in, 
more BTU's out. It has become a subjective economics with less effort 
put out, more illusion sold and it can only lead to a chill in the 
absence of sufficient BTU's.

The method of objective proof developed and demonstrated by DeCarte 
was the means to closing the last Dark Age and the foundation of the 
industrial revolution and the DM itself. There has always been snake 
oyl to buy, the South Sea Bubble et al. But you used to have to spent 
several weeks feeding the horses and traveling from village to 
village to find enough fools to sell out the stock. Now with a push 
of the button, every fool in every village is obtainable at the speed 
of light with the only overhead a computer costing one months wages 
for a HS dropout at a fast food restaurant.

Anyone who wants more of this kind of tripe, p-mail me. To the relief 
of the majority, I will not burdon you with more discussion of this 
type with submittals to the list general. Always appreciate feedback, 
good, bad or ugly.

T.P. Stephens aka Doktor Tim
