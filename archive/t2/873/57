Subject: Engine tins for a PO's engine swap

I have just purchased a '78 bus that has had the FI powerplant swapped for a
1600 Dual port. It looks pretty good, but as you can see from the attached
photo, the engine tins are not fitted properly, and I don't see a gasket
anywhere. I have followed earlier threads about the importance of properly
fitted tins to keep the engine from overheating. Will the earlier '70's
engine tins fit? Should I just start from scratch fitting metal? It would
help if someone could forward a pic of a properly fitted cooling tins on a
1600 so I could see what I need to do to get it right. Thanks to all for the
valuable lessons and shared experience!
