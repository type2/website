Subject: Re: [T2] spark plugs

Umm
I am sorry I opened up a hornet's nest.
In the future can people just say straight up
what I should use (in this case) for a plug.
I don't care if it's not used in space shuttle's before 87'
If the irish rovers didn't stir their whiskey with 'that'
specific stir stick cause it's the wrong color.
Kind of makes a person not want to ask any
questions whatsoever!

example ...' I prefer this plug X, there has been
some varied results with others'

I'm not trying to save a buck, just wanting the
bus to run good. Which is why I asked. I didn't fall
into any trap of advertising. Just couldn't find a plug
in the city except those that would work with the
bus.

Buy wizbang, justify wizbang, sell wizbang, in that order.

Superb, that's the nut shell, folks. This is the foundation of wizbang 
economy.  If it makes you feel great, it's justified. Pass me the pipe, I 
want to feel high. Is it any wonder whatsoever that 12 year olds are 
emulating this "ethic"? As far as I'm concerned, if that is the majority 
view, damn the law, that 12 year old is just as justified in moving up the 
ladder to the needle before he quits high school .......
