While I'm not one of the "technical folks" and this isn't exactly a 
tech posting ..

I've been using ethanol-oxygenated gas in all of my aircooled VWs for 
years,
FI and carburated.  I also switched back-and-forth between the 
oxygenated-with-ethanol and the oxygenated-with-MTBE variants when I 
still lived in California.  I was not, and am not, terribly picky about 
what the "brand" on the gas pump is.

I have had zero, zilch, nada problems like the ones described in the 
posting.  Not a
single one.  No "black goo", no varnishing of gas, no clogged carbs or 
injectors.  And since I don't have any fancy-pants coatings in my 
tanks, no problems with those peeling loose either.
