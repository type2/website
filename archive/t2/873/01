Subject: Re: [T2] weird miss at part throttle.

Along with Dave's answer:
-Bob, is this miss only as you are accelerating to 2/3 throttle, or will 
it happen at any point you HOLD the throttle up to 2/3? For me 2/3 would 
be normal driving- when do you ever go flat out (full throttle) except 
getting onto the freeway or up a hill?  Did you put a timing light on 
each wire one at a time and then watch it as you increase the throttle? 
A miss due to a plug/wire not always firing all the time would be 
obvious. If you find it, switch the wire and then the cap and see if it 
goes away.  If you get no missing with the timing light, also consider 
an intermittant vac leak- for the list- can Pertronics fail 
intermittantly, or is it all or none??????
