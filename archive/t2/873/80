Subject: Buses By The Falls, June 23-25th, Niagara Falls Canada

Hi Volks,

BBTF is coming up soon... if you're planning on coming you had better  
book a campsite soon as the campground ALWAYS sells out on that weekend.

What is BBTF you ask? Buses By the Falls is a de-organized bus  
campout that is held the weekend of the June Jitterbug VW Show in  
Niagara Falls Canada. It's not an official camp-out, it's more of an  
agreed on meeting place for the people who are coming in for the show  
to camp and hang out. It's held at the CAMPARK resort on Lundy's  
Lane. But despite the disorganization it has become a popular non- 
event on the local schedule.

I'm not in charge of this event, (and no-one is) but I have thrown  
together a website to help people find their way there. The website  
has a map that outlines where the buses tend to gather, and a Google  
Earth place-mark you can download for a satellite view of the  
campground. You need to have the Google Earth app installed to use  
this file, but that's a free download.

Call 1-877-CAMPARK to book a reservation, and visit www.campark.com  
for info on the facilities.

Happy trails,
