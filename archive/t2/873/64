Hello David,

    Click reply, and add " type2(-at-)type2.com " to the "TO" line, or you can Cc
it, either way it will get there! If you only want to post to the list,
delete the senders name, and just use Type2(-at-)type2.com .
    There should be a Subject: heading at the top of each E-mail, and they
should follow the previous posting, more or less. The rules say "more" but
that seems to fade somewhat as the posts multiply.
    Sorry can't help with volcanic questions, I live in Louisiana, just
Hurricane questions.
    Anyway welcome, questions a encouraged!

Howard
