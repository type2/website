 There are differences in boiling temps?  I thought
 it was a change to lower
 the absorbtion of H2O into the fluid.  Out of
 curiousity, what is the change
 in the Mercedes 4+ over regular 4?

Type Wet Boiling Point Dry Boiling Point
DOT 3..... 284F.......... 401F
DOT 4..... 311F.......... 446F
DOT 4+.....356F
DOT 5..... 356F.......... 500F
DOT 5.1... 375F.......... 518F

There are other brands out there that say they are
super this and super that, i.e.
http://www.hotrodsusa.com/store/brakefluid.html , that
throws out the dry boiling point figure when most
fluids use the truer wet temp for advertising.

Dry boiling point is the value of brand new fluid in a
unopened can.....

Wet boiling point is fluid that has been exposed to
the air, as in your vehicle.

Yes, to a point, the more moisture the fluid has
absorbed the lower the wet boiling point. That is why
a 2 year replacement is recommended.

DOT 3 starts out at 400F dry and after about absorbing
1% water it drops to 300F. At about 2 years it absorbs
close to 2% and drops below 250F.
