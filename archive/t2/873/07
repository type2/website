Here's the part. It will have to be welded in, of course.

Here's a page that shows all of the Bus sheet metal diagrams and part
numbers. (Scroll down; rocker panels are toward the bottom of the page.)
You'll probably want to replace the rest of the passenger side rocker panel
area while you're at it, as the whole area is likely rotting out.

A word of advice:  If the right rocker is that bad off, you may want to
check out other crucial rust prone areas of your bus (i.e. axle beam, etc.)
before focusing just on that one area. Often if there is rust in one area,
there is rust in many.  Hopefully that's not the case on your bus. But on
the other hand, if this is just the tip of the iceberg, you may want to know
that going into it...
