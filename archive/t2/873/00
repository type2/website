Subject: Exaust Studs

Hi

I have just failed the local test on a leaking exhaust manifold (and 
other things but I fixed them - don't mention the 009).
I have changed it twice - still leaks - read the archive, its the file 
it flat thing so I will pull it again at the wekend and do it right this 
time.

While the heater box was off I noticed the studs were kind of loose, so 
I tightned them up, then they were to short, so I had to let them out 
again.  Is this OK or do I need to go in search of new longer studs??

Thanks
John
