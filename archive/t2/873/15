Subject: Re: [T2] brake lights or lack

From Jeremiah Stutte:


 very quickly, me not you,  i noticed tonight that my brake lights only come
on when the pedal is almost fully depressed.  this might help explain some
dirty looks and tailgaiters.  is this normal?  if not any quick easy fixes?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

1) they work on pressure.

2) there are 2 of them on the master cylinder

3) if you do not flush your brake system every 2 years [like everyone should but never does!!!] then crap in
the fluid settles into the bottom of the master. This plugs the holes in the switches.

Buy 2 new switches. Remove the 2 old ones and admire the crap in the holes!
Flush the master and the reservoirs with clean brake fluid. Install the 2 new switches. Bleed all 4 wheels
until clean fluid appears.
