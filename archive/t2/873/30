From Dave C. Bolen:

Karl,

Lordy, I just love the way that you get directly to the point!!!!

"> Buy 2 new switches. Remove the 2 old ones and admire the crap in the
 holes!"

 What would we do without you!!!

 -------------------------------------------------------------------

Well it's the truth:)

I just saved the list a lot of bandwidth use because he would have written back "What is all this crap in the
holes of my switches and master cylinder?" and then we would have a long disertation about the hygroscopic
properties of mineral brake fluid and boiling temps of DOT 3 and DOT 4 and the silicone DOT 5 and why I like
Mercedes DOT 4+ fluid [because I get it for free] yada yada yada :)
