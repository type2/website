Subject: So I brought a bullet on the airplane...

Troy gave me a keychain with the guac keys on it that has a .44 Remm bullet
on it. I forgot completely.

Wanna see a bunch of TSA's flip out when you try to get on a plane?
Bwahahahah!!!

(It was cool once I said it came with my VW Bus. It seemed to mellow the
TSAs out. Obviously they'd never seen Back to the Future! And, yes, I'm
typing this from the gate waiting to board for Cali...)
