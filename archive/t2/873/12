Subject: Re: [T2] spark plugs

From James Jackson:


 Hello, quick question (hopefully)
I just did a tuneup a bit ago and
part of the process was changing the plugs.
The motor is a 1700 fuel injected beast.
Old plug Bosch W8CC
New plug is WR8CP (Bosch)
It was on Bosch's website

This info was in the finder there:
 WR8CP   PLATINUM PLUG CJ, GE; Gap=.028
 W8CC   O.E. SPARK PLUG CJ, GE; Gap=.028

 Does this mean I have the right plug? Just oem vs whatever?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT Bosch website??

It frosts me when I see spark plug listings that say platinum or resistor plugs are "recommended by the
manufacturer".

Total BS..... they are recommended by the PLUG manufacturer, NOT the VEHICLE manufacturer. The plug maker is
reaping the $$ off you. I see it all the time on Mercedes-Benz. People go to Kragens, Pep Boys, or Smucks and
get sold crap and then they bring it to the dealership because it won't run right or accelerate. "I just put
new plugs in it and pimply-faced said they were the correct ones....."

I searched the web just now for any Bosch factory website that tells me what plugs I should use and none of
them did. They all sent me to retailers.

Then I searched for websites that sold Bosch plugs and the 1st 20 of them said to Plus4 and this and that
resistor/platinum crap without even asking what vehicle I had!

Then the 21st one at least wanted to know make year and model, and lo and behold, ONLY the correct plug came
back:
