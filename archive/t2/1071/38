Subject: Re: [T2] Side Tents

Michael,

You need to decide what you want to use the tent for.  This will help  
you determine what is right for you.  It sounds like you may only be  
interested in a vintage setup.  Vintage tents are still available in  
good shape and can be found on The Samba or Ebay.

If you are looking at the awning style that mounts to the van with  
screwed in brackets, then you will need to take it down every time  
you want to move your van.  You could also consider a modern type  
awning like the F45 with the optional Privacy Room:

The F45 will clamp to your raingutter and does not require drilling  
unless you want to install the wall mounted brackets for the legs.

You also didn't mention the tent we offer:

This type of free standing tent often referred to as a "drive-away"  
tent, allows you to leave the tent up and drive your bus away.

We have been importing side tents for the past 13 years.  We sold  
thousands of tents and I can only imagine that there are some of  
these available out there used.  Most were the original style cabin  
type tents.  We no longer carry these, though similar tents are still  
available.  Side tents have come a long way since the early 60's.   
New designs that handle wind & rain better, and new materials that  
are stronger and lighter are available.  We can special order any of  
the Reimo tents found at http://www.reimo.com

The side tents that we currently stock must meet certain criteria.   
They must pack up small, they must have good ventilation for hot and  
muggy conditions.  They must shed rain well and be easy to setup.   
They must also be reasonably priced, and made to last for years.

We used to supply GoWesty with side tents.  They only wanted the  
original style tents and they sold very well.  The issues they  
mention on their website are overall accurate, but the number of  
returns were very small.  If they had considered some of the newer  
styles, they may have changed their minds and still be offering  
tents.  They also mention "German made" tents, which isn't correct.   
The tents we sell are of German design, but most all tents are now  
made in China.  I know of only one company that makes a modern type  
of awning tent that sews the fabric in Germany.

If you have one of our older tents, or need parts for your side tent,  
we have a web page devoted to older parts:
