I wouldn't doubt that it might get the injectors somewhat clean, but you 
still don't know how much they're flowing.  Remember that the injectors 
all open and stay open the exact same amount of time every time the 
spark fires.  If you have one injector that flows less than the others, 
that could cause that particular cylinder to run lean, overheat and 
wreak all sorts of havoc on an aircooled engine.  In the case of a carb 
or throttle body injection, you have one source feeding all the 
cylinders so you don't run into the same kinds of issues.
