Quite often I use the orange gojo hand cleaner to clean parts.  Works 
great with a brush.  Otherwise I use brake cleaner and a brush.

Wouldn't be a bad idea, especially if it originally had grease on it.

If you're cleaning the innards, the last thing I'd want on there is old, 
hardened grease.  If you're doing the lock, I'd get some lubricant that 
is specific for locks.
