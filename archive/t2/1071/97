Subject: Re: [T2] Please help solve our Vanagon alloy wheel mounting

I can confirm that baywindow studs will fit in a vanagon rear drum; but
I can't tell you if they are long enough to work with Vanagon alloys.

Happy Trails,

Greg, as I currently understand it, Porsche studs are a popular choice but
must create their new home in the hub with force, they are supposedlyB 45mm
long, the Bay Front is supposedly 46mm.B Just sharing what I am finding out in
case it can help somebody else.B
