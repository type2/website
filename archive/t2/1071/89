Subject: Powder Coating the Transmission

Will the 091 transmission, removed from VW - obviously, be able to take

(1) bead blasting and

(2) powder coating (-at-) 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 minutes?

(1) What should my concerns be on bead blasting and separation/masking of
parts?

(2) Anything RUBBER, LEAD or other heat sensitive material?
TIA
