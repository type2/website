Subject: Removing the fanshroud on my 77 2.0L

I looked in my Bentley and I think it's assuming I have the engine out. No
mention of sheetmetal or engine seal to body etc.??? Am I missing something?
I'm hunting for an oil leak that could be the oil sender, the oil dipstick
boot, or oil cooler, so decided it's probably best to strip the back off the
engine to see these. Anyone got a blow by blow description for engine still in
van? I'm also thinking that maybe I should just cut the engine seal on each
side of the engine rather than pull it all out. Kind of a shame, because it's
new.
Thanks,
Courtney
