Subject: J Tubes/Pipes for square port exhaust

Hey folks,

I'm looking for some new exhaust options for my '74 transporter.  This past
summer, I replaced the stock-ish engine with a 2.0ltr out of an '80 Vanagon
- square port exhaust just like the '79 Federal Bay.  In fact, that is the
exhaust currently on the bus - heater boxes from a '79 Federal.  My question
is, has anyone heard of or seen J tubes available for this exhaust system?
I would like to replace the heater boxes and I'm not concerned with getting
heat into the van.

Thanks,
Andrew
