It's easy to get that "hat" fitting off with a dremel tool, and unless 
you are a complete and total klutz it would be almost difficult to 
damage the injector in the process. Go slow and gentle and don't cut any 
deeper than required... it helps to know that there's a rubber hose 
between the "hat" and the injector body so once you get through the 
metal "hat" you do have a margin for error.

Seriously; the risk of injector damage in removal of the "hat" is FAR, 
FAR LESS than the risk of hose failure (and the subsequent total loss of 
the van) if you don't do it.

Give it a try. If you pooch an injector in the process I will send you 
one from my own spare parts stash, with the "hat" already removed before 
shipping. Free to a good home,m as it were.

Replace the "hat" with an FI hose clamp and you're good to go.

Happy Trails,
