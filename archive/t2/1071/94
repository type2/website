Ok, so you have the bolt with the D-shaped head that goes through the 
starter and into the engine compartment (towards the back).  Then 
there's another bolt with a normal-shaped head that goes from the tranny 
side into the engine compartment as well.  Both of those bolts have nuts 
inside the engine compartment.

As far as the studs mounted on the bottom of the engine casing, I 
couldn't tell you off-hand how far they stick out from the casing, but 
enough to pass through tranny mount holes, allow the nut to screw on, 
and still have a mm or two to spare.  Should be easy enough to measure 
the width of the tranny mounts and nuts to see what's appropriate.
