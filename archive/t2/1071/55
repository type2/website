If you have an extra harness, you can chop it up and wire it to a 
battery and manually pulse them.  You also need to set up the pump, 
pressure regulator, etc.  The MegaSquirt also has a test mode that 
allows you to tell it to pulse a certain number of times but I've never 
had a need to use it.  I'm sure it would come in handy for just this 
type of thing.

Then you'd want to get four (or more) graduated cylinders in which to 
spray the injectors into.  Then you can pulse all the injectors at the 
same time and see if their spray patterns are good and they all flow the 
same amount.  The test shops don't use gasoline, but use some other 
(probably less flammable) liquid that has the same characteristics as 
gasoline.

For those that are curious, here are the results that you get back when 
you send 'em off to get cleaned:

These injectors were taken from a running 1980 Vanagon.

I will soon send off the set of injectors that the above injectors 
replaced.  It's going to be really interesting to see their flow rates; 
I'd be interested to see if the injector that's on my dying cylinder is 
flowing less than the rest.
