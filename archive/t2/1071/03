A crimped ferrule holds that end onto the injector.  Cut across it with a
dremel tool with cutoff wheel (or hacksaw if you want) most of the way across,
you can cut into the hose you are replacing it, but not into the barb you will
find inside.  Then merely take some side cutters and peel the ferrule off,
remove hose, replace with your favorite (but appropriate) hose clamps on both
ends.  Cut the length VERY carefully of the new hose, getting it correct has
surprising effects on how everything fits.
 
Consider of course, very carefully on a new engine replacing the injectors
instead.  New are probably still only $200-250 for a set?  Running a cylinder
lean on a bad injector is a great way to spend another $2000 on a rebuild in
short order.

line. The end which is at the fuel rail, is held on by a hose clamp, but the
other end of this short piece, which attaches to the injector, doesn't have
such a clamp.

As I stare at it, I would like to know how it is connected, before I start
pulling and prying, or cutting the old hose off.
