Subject: some noise up front

lately when i'm driving around town in stl i've noticed that something
is moving around and making a rattling noise up front on or around the
front axle.  i think it is the bracket for the e-brake assembly just
after the skid plate thingy.  the noise and rattle are not consistent
with road bumps and can occur when driving on a straight smooth
street.  i vaguely remember two or so years ago when i changed the
front shocks that there where spacer sleeves on the studs that hold
the shocks.  when i looked under the bus, a 77, today i noticed no
spacers and it looks like the shock bushings can slide along the 1/2
inch or so bit of stud exposed.   would this cause the rattle?  i tend
to think it is not the shocks since the rattle is not consistent with
hitting bumps or holes in the road.  should i find spacers and put
them on anyway?

any thoughts or insights appreciated.
