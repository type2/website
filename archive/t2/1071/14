Subject: Where to go?

Tires and brakes are new, oil leaks cured, 2nd battery installed, most off the
P.O.'s abuses have been addressed now my S.O.'s Boss wants her to pick some
days off, any suggestions for a 4-5 day weekend in May on the East coast out
of NJ. It's about time to go camping and enjoy this puppy.
