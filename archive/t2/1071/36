Subject: Side Tents

OK...  I'm going to finally bite the bullet and buy me a side tent for
Feelmore, my 1971 Westfalia (http://picasaweb.google.com/T2Wagen/Feelmore#).

I want a high quality tent and would like something that is multipurpose in
style.  I want something that will work for camping with the family and
provide shade at the cruise-ins and shows.  (My EZ-Up just ain't cutting it
anymore.)

I like the idea of the tent that GoWesty use to carry...

But, GoWesty don't carry it anymore.

I like the BusDepot side tent...

But it is a bit too non-nastaligic for me.

I love the BBT tent...

But I can't find them in the US, can't find a price, and would want a bottom
and side to the tent.

Ideas?  Suggestions?

I'm not above spending a few dollars for the kind of tent a need and want but
would like to do a little research first to make sure it is something that is
functional, good quality, useful for the whole family, etc...

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Michael in Montevallo
