Subject: Re: [T2] Side Tents

We had a large drive away tunnel style side tent until last summer.  They
are great for just spreading out and cooking in, especially if you have a
family and you are camping in the rain.  It did feel a little flimsy though
and not good in high winds.  Photo here:

This year I would like to get a Khyam tent because they are very quick to
put up and really good quality.
