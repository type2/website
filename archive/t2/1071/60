Subject: [Q] Cleaning Metal

Group-

I have started cleaning the metal that needs to be re-installed after
painting my bus.  What are the recommended chemicals and/or process?  I had
a friend suggest carburetor cleaner for small parts.

Thoughts?

Also, after cleaning, what about re-greasing?

-David

P.S.  A first part I'm working on is the latch for the back hatch.  Maybe
instead of carburetor cleaner I should just use some polish and an old
toothbrush, leaving the grease that's been on there for years?
