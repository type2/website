Subject: [Q] Diaphragms Under Front Grill ('71)

Group-

Underneath the front grill on my '71, there are a couple of diaphragms (one
on each side).  I think these are for fresh air, but one of them has a
split.  I thought as long as I'm in "restoration mode", I'd replace both.

So, are these important, worth replacing, and inexpensive?  I'm guessing
so, but what are they called?  (O.K., I'm gettin' lazy and realizing that
asking this group is a *bunch* easier than looking it up in my repair
manual.)

P.S.  There are other (screw?) holes on the back side of the box behind the
grill.  I'm not sure what these are for, if anything.  Thoughts?

P.P.S.  As I need 6 rectangular pads, but only have 3 to go between the
front grill and the metal mounting tabs on my bus, I made 3 more.  I used
rubber I cut from a bicycle inner tube.  I just happened to have the inner
tube available, but found it to be an inexpensive and workable solution.
Maybe that tidbit will help someone else.
