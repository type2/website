Like I mentioned in my other email, that part is not pressed on there. 
Just cut the fuel line with a sharp knife and pull it off.  Then when 
you are ready to reinstall the hose, put the cap back on and press on 
your fuel hose.

This was the message that Rich sent to me:

"The injectors with the "barbed" inlets don't need a clamp. Once the 
hose is fully pressed on, it's virtually impossible to remove without 
cutting it off. The ferrules are positioned with the wide end toward the 
hose and the hose is pressed on to the inlet until the ferrule does not 
rotate. A few drops of oil will make the hose much easier to press on."

I was skeptical about not using a clamp, but I figure he works with 
injectors all day so he'd know what's up.
