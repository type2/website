Please set me straight - I was of the impression that the aircooled Vanagon 2L's had the alternator mounted up top of the engine and out in the open air. Is this what you're planning to do? I wondered if the fan housing on the Vanagon engine is interchangeable on the '78 & '79's (I am assuming that the brackets are on the fan housing - may be wrong here also.) It's the 65A output you're seeking, but I question whether you will be able to modify it to mount in the stock '78 position and whether the cooling air ducting will bolt up - and even if it does, it seems barely adequate for the stock alternators. Once I found one that had not had the bearings seize up and been M-M'd by a previous "repair" shop, it lasted for years and got pulled and bearings replaced at first sign of wear to avoid damage... Hard to find that good core, though! That was a stocker, though - not addressing your desire for more power! -BaH

 I saw this alternator in a 1983 (production 8/82) Vanagon (-at-)
 the yards
 yesterday.  It had these markings on the label, and it may
 be a 65 amp
 alternator.  For some $25, is it worth picking up,
 untested, to put in my
 Phoenix '78 Westy (after testing at home, of course)
 and do I need the
 regulator (where the heck is it on the Vanagon - things are
 all mixed up
 from my '78)?
