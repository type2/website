Definitely the way to go if you've got the parts & know-how to make  
it happen.  Even non-stock systems that take some tinkering are a  
better way to go than worn-out carbs, and possibly better than like- 
new carbs .. though that's a matter for debate, and it all depends on  
your comfort level.

I re-fitted fuel injection to my '75 in January 2008, but used a CIS  
(K-Jetronic) system instead of the stock L-Jetronic.  Someone had  
installed a pair of 34ICT Weber carbs years before I bought the Bus,  
and they were pretty worn out around teh throttle shafts .. and I  
never liked the way it ran with those carbs anyway.

So .. there was this pile of parts in my garage.  Some stock Bus EFI  
manifold pieces, and a bunch of leftovers from helping a buddy scrap  
his wrecked '83 Rabbit GTI.  I had to build a few things -- adapters  
to mount the injectors on the stock T-IV intake runners, fuel lines  
to the 3/4 side of the engine, air plumbing from the fuel distributor  
to the throttle body, a bit of wiring and a few other odds & ends I  
don't exactly remember right now.  It took a bit of tuning to get it  
dialed in to the engine (2.0L aircooled instead of a 1.8L  
watercooled), but it runs great, the mileage is better than it should  
be (22-24MPG highway, 18-20 in-town), and the power is excellent.    
So I'm happy.
