get a couple folks to help you, or I used a shop jack when I did it
solo.  help is better if you can get it, door is heavy and awkward.

when I go to the pick n pull I grab every loose nut and bolt etc I can
find around the bus I'm pulling stuff from, and any I see nearby,
don't take the machinery for stuff still in the bus, think of the next
person, but if they are left behind or I pull the part I take em all..

think the most I was ever charged was $1 for a big bunch, usually take
a big 5gal bucket to carry my tools and what I pull and just throw the
stuff in the bottom, they always check but rarely charge.
