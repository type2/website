Subject: [Q] Engine Compartment Insulation

Group-

I'm thinking about replacing the insulation above the engine compartment.
This includes the stiff retaining board that holds the insulation in place.
Any group thoughts as to "definitely do it", "definitely don't do it", etc.?

I'm guessing it's simply another call to one of the parts houses to get a
replacement.
