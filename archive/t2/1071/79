Following up on Bob's post, it's simple to look for a leak if you 
have a Mityvac with gauge.
Pump on the advance port of the dizzy vacuum can with  the Mityvac 
until the reading on the gauge stabilizes.
Stop pumping and watch the gauge. For the best of my cans, this value 
has held steady for minutes. For cans with big leaks, the value will 
never stabilize. For cans with small leaks, the value decreases to 
zero within seconds.
