Distributor questions.

Symptoms:
Runs shitty, no power and drinks gas. Obviously not a daily driver,
she takes me camping.

1969  camper

Setup:
1600 SP
Solex H30/31 PICT

SVDA from Air cooled.net. Installed 2000 miles ago.

Instructions say set 7.5 degrees before TDC at idle 900 rpm. Did that.

I understand that readings in the driveway with no load are different
than real driving conditions. These are in the driveway.
__________
Readings from vacuum port left side of carb:
0 at idle
2 inches at 2500 rpm
4 inches at 3500rpm

Advance at 3500 rpm = 17 Total advance from idle = 25.5
___________
_____
Readings from vacuum port rear of carb pointing slightly up.

0 at idle
10 inches at 2500
15 inches at 3500
Advance at 3500 rpm = 25 Total 32.5
_________

Both vacuum readings drop to zero upon reduction of engine speed.

Took on test drives. Result was runs much better down the mountain
than up the mountain. J

Actually seems to have more power with the vac line on the higher
(rear) vac port.

Prior to this, adjusted the valves all were a bit loose 0.008

Also has a compufire ignition.

What do you think?

Gonna sent this to aircooled tech as well.
