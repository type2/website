Subject: Vanagon Alternator into a Baywindow as a replacement

I saw this alternator in a 1983 (production 8/82) Vanagon (-at-) the yards
yesterday.  It had these markings on the label, and it may be a 65 amp
alternator.  For some $25, is it worth picking up, untested, to put in my
Phoenix '78 Westy (after testing at home, of course) and do I need the
regulator (where the heck is it on the Vanagon - things are all mixed up
from my '78)?

Oh, I have at least two other backup (stash) alternators, plus a recent
rebuilt alternator from the Phoenix.
