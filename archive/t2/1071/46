I hear ya on that part, its easy to destroy an injector if your not 
careful.
If you have a junk yard anywhere near by, pick up a few spares to 
practice on first.

I can confirm that without the worlds most patient person doing it, you 
will destroy your injector if you try and remove that ring without a 
cutoff tool of some kind.

with a little cutoff wheel, ideally a small one like a dremel, it looks 
like it *could* be pretty easy.
I have 3 good used ones still in my garage waiting for me to test that 
theory on (the first I tried to do manually, but no matter how careful I 
was, I couldn't get enough of the old hose out of the little ring to be 
able to get it off. I eventually got so pissed I tried to just get it 
off by any means I could and it still didn't come off. I broke it into 
half a dozen pieces eventually, but that ring was still firmly in place. 
(doh)
