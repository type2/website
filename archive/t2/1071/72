Thanks! That is the only one I've heard that works. 

If I ever go back to four cylinder power I'm going to go with a five speed. 

I'm excited about my Corvair powerpack but sooner or later we're going to get 
smog checks I worry and that will be the end of that... 

Regardless of what engine I run I'd really like to put modern fuel injection 
of it and a catalytic converter.
