Subject: Please help solve our Vanagon alloy wheel mounting issue so we

We are in Portland, Oregon, we are working on a 1983 Vanagon, my friend has
bought used Vanagon alloy wheels and has brand new tires mounted up, but we
have stud issues because the studs B are too short to get through the thicker
wheels.



We would like to adapt the vehicle to studs and nuts front and back.

We need to buy longer studs and install them in the rear.



Questions-

Where can we buy the parts we need, Halsey Imports doesn't have them?



Do we need special tools to R&R the rear hubs to swap out the studs?



Can anybody confirm that the front studs from a Bay Window work perfectly in
the back of a Vanagon for our situation?
