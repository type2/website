Folks,

I am moving back to Germany in summer and there are a few parts that  
I do not necessarily want to take with me, so I'll offer them here  
before posting them on the samba.

One of two motors:
- 2L type 4 motor build by Kummetat in Germnany, approx. 100K miles  
since build, never any problems at all. High compression (8.5 or  
9:1), dual 36-40 PDSIT carb on short intakes (the same one Oettinger  
used for their performance engines), 296 degree cam, large valve  
heads, CJ case. Approx. 100hp.  It is still in my bus and can be test  
driven. Needs new heater boxes and pushrod seals. Has 215mm flywheel  
to fit 002 transmission.
- 1.9 type 4 long block build by Peek Perfomance in Maryland, very  
few miles out of a wrecked bus. 1.8 lower end with Keith Black 94mm  
P&Cs. Large valve heads, mild cam. I have most of the parts needed  
for completion.

- 2 transmissions: 091 (2L) and 002 (1.8L) both work fine, but I only  
have one 002 bellhousing. I swapped transmissions for better highway  
gearing. Now I am going for a 5-speed. 091 trans can be test driven.

- complete D-jet FI system off a running 914.

- BN4 heater with ducting set up for a Thing.

- Master Tow tow-dolly with new D-rated tires, new straps, and new  
wiring.

- Audi 5 cyl engine out of a '82 Audi coupe. New timing belt, ran  
fine when pulled. K jet (CIS) system is pretty gummed up, needs cleaned.

Please make me serious offers for these parts. Everything is located  
in Portland, OR.

Marcus
