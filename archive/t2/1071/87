That was because on the GWB the rear apron was pushed in. Remember the
fun we had pulling the engine?

The shroud can be removed fairly easily in the bus. Let's see if I can
remember what's needed:

1. Pull (CAREFULLY!) the seal.
2. Remove the alternator.
3. Remover the upper alt bracket.
4. Remove lower tin between shroud and muffler.
5. Remove fan.
6. Remove thermostat cable.
7. Remove coil.
8. Remove upper pulley (if smog pump equipped.. Not for your 77.)
9. Remove shroud to case bolts from fan opening.
10. Remove shroud lifting it up and tilting forward to clear (front is front).

You may need to do other finangling like the breather box and
loosening upper tin and such. Depends on your particular bus. The
hardest part is the alternator. If you are careful, you can use a wire
or coathanger to hang it out of the way so you don't have to mess with
the wiring and such.
