Subject: 7th Annual Bus Benefit in Grand Rapids, MI

Hello Type 2 List friends!



Join us for a great weekend all to raise money for the Phoenix Society for
Burn Survivors.



7th Annual Bus Benefit 2009 will be held May 14th -17th in Grand Rapids, MI.


For full details go to: HYPERLINK
"http://www.busesbythebeach.com/"www.busesbythebeach.com


Weekend's activities include:

*	Burn Survivor Car Show with over 600 cars. All makes and models.
*	Fire Department and law enforcement escort to the car show. Very
similar to a Presidential Motorcade.
*	Live music on Friday and Saturday.
*	Fund Raising Raffle. We will be giving away thousands of dollars of
VW related merchandise.
*	Beer Tasting. A local Micro Brewery will be joining us for a
sampling of some of the best beers being brewed in Michigan today.
*	Blessing of the Buses. Have your bus blessed with a spot of 30
weight motor oil under the front bumper in the hope of your safe travel this
camping season. This optional blessing will be offered while everyone is
lined up for the car show caravan and is up for your own spiritual
interpretation, what ever your belief may be.
*	Lots of really cool buses from all over the Midwest and Canada.
*	Spend time with great friends and have some memorable campfire
conversations.
*	This event is designed for families, kids and bus VW Enthusiasts of
all ages.
*	Pets are allowed. Please no Chimpanzees or Orangutans. Their big,
hairy and they scare us.  (Sorry Todd Duell) :-)
