Subject: AMC headers 

  If I buy Brand New AMC Headers (from oeveedub.com) do I need to do anything
else to them? Other then make sure they are ok? These should come ready to
install right?
Also I currently have solid cam followers (lifters) if I want to upgrade to
hydraulic lifters, do they just drop in? other then preloading them? I will
upgrade to steel push rods!!!

I am rebuilding my own type 4 engine (code GD). Also is ok to just replace the
Pistons/Cylniners, Lifters, Rings, push rods??? I do not think the cam or any
parts inside the engine are bad...they all look good and I have never had a
problem with them.
