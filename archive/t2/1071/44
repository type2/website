I would, if anyone had convinced me that I can get the lines off and replace
them without destroying the injector housing. One suggestion was a cutoff
wheel to grind off the little "hat" thing that is pressed around the
injector end of the hose. I am always happy for help, but that sounds like a
great way to ruin the injector, and then I am into it for money I don't
have..

Obviously, its easy to get the old hose off, but lacking the information I
need as to how to put the new hose on, I can't just start cutting, and
hacking <shrug>

>I can totally relate to no money.

Yea. sadly, it seems a lot of us are heading that way. Not a matter of
political commentary, just that things are tanking all over, and it looks
pretty ugly out there.

Thanks Chris,

John
