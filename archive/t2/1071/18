Greg, I did that on my '76 Toyota Liftback. I actually took it to a speedometer shop and they put it on the rollers and gave me a printout showing what the actual speed and the given speed were at 10mph intervals. With tha info, it was quite easy to design the new faceplate. This was before digital printing on vinyl, so I had to either screen print mine or - since I had to create a film positive anyway to burn the screen, I just adhesive-backed the film positive and mounted it to the gauge. It was unique in appearance, easy to read and totally accurate.

Dave Meister used to (maybe still) make unique gauge faceplates for popular performance cars. He used to come into my shop for this and that in his early years before he got successful!

 Hi Volks,
 
 I am in the process of recalibrating vanagon speedometer;
 though not exactly in the way that you describe, I think it
 will be very accurate.
 
 Step 1. Document the true speed of the vehicle; to build a
 table with
 the indicated speeds vs GPS verified speeds at 10 KM/H
 intervals.
 
 Step 2. Calculate the new position of the number
 increments.
 (ie, 30 moves to 23, 40 moves to 28, 50 moves to 38, etc.)
 
 Step 3. Create a new faceplate graphic with the numbers
 moved to new positions to match the true road speed. This
 graphic will be printed on matt black adhesive vinyl with
 white ink using equipment that can be found at most local
 sign shops.
 
 Step 4:  Install it in the speedometer.
 
 It's not a perfect solution, but it will work for me.
 
 Happy Trails,
 
 Greg Potts
