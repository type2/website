Hi Sid,

There are many reasons... Here are just a few that come to mind:

  - The German Mark rose against the dollar in the late 70's early 80s.

  - Increased standards of living raised the cost of manufacture.

  - The cost of improving the vehicle to keep it competitive in a 
demanding marketplace.

In 1975 an entry level car like a beetle or hyundai pony cost about $6,000.

in 1990 that was a dodge shadow VW Fox for about $12,000.

in 2009 a Chevy Cavalier is about $18,000.

(I could be wrong; I don't shop new cars much)

The increase is not inflation so much as the cost of On-Star, Air 
Conditioning, Airbags, Auto transmissions power steering and tiptronic 
transmissions.

No, I know that many/most of those items are not included on a current 
base model vehicle, but when the VW bus was first manufactured NONE of 
them were.


Happy Trails,
