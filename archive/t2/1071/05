Troy: Great work-around.
I have a question about the clamps that are shown in your photos.
I'm rebuilding a type 1 engine and just yesterday came to the step of 
modifying the fuel delivery lines from the fuel pump to the dual 
carbs.
I have two sets of hose clamps in my stash. One set looks just like 
yours; the other is the usual perforated ones that gouge the hose. I 
would have preferred to use the first set, but I found that none of 
them is large enough to fit 5.5mm hose pushed on a barb.  When I 
ordered these many years ago, I remember not being able to locate the 
larger ones.
Do you happen to know a source of the ones you used?
