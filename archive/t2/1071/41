Subject: RE: [T2] Side Tents

I didn't realize this was going to be such a challenge.  I can't find very
many vendors with options.

The primary thing I want to do is have a place to put all my stuff and add a
little room for living when camping.  Something you can drive away from and
leave would be a plus.  As I mentioned before, the Bus Depot "Space Maker
Tunnel" (http://www.busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=J14331) would work,
especially with the optional side tent mounting channel
(http://www.busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=J12016), since you wouldn't
have to mount the pole in the rain gutter.  But I would really like something
with an integrated awning design, in that you could use the awning component
when at shows and such.  In fact, Bus Depot (and I believe Go Westy, as well)
use to have something that worked well and used the jack points on the bus (I
think they even had an optional component that had a metal plate that you
could place under the tire to mount the poles to as well).

The main issue with my 71 Westy, Feelmore
(http://picasaweb.google.com/T2Wagen/Feelmore#), is that I pack the kids and
stuff up in the bus and go somewhere and when I get there I need to remove
most of the stuff so that I can pull out the bed and/or table to sleep and/or
eat.  Also, if it is raining, the primary cooking area location on a 71 is a
table that pops out at the sliding door where you setup your cook stove.
Plus, although I have outfitted the pop top in my bus with a twin size bed
using the continental bed design, I may eventually need a place for the kids
to sleep and my portable air conditioner would easily cool an attached tent
and the vehicle.

What are all you other bus folks doing out there when you camp and/or go to
shows?

Thanks,

Michael in Montevallo
