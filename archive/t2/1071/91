Subject: Something from another list - vent windows

    Though it's not mentioned often...one of the great aspects of T-3s  
is The Wing Vent Window.  Who'd ever buy a car without one?   Hard to  
comprehend.

   With the wing-vents, you can smoke without overwhelming the  
interior, or passengers, with smoke. You get a perfect way to adjust  
ventilation without blowing everyone around in the wind. You can get  
air even when it's pouring rain.  The car can be nicely aired if you  
or passenger(s) haven't bathed that week...or whatever other similar  
problem.   You can hear what's going on outside.  And it substitutes  
greatly for the wasteful use of air-conditioning and defrost etc.

  New-Age cars are designed by those who are patently inconsiderate.   
There's no way to get any of those benefits by cracking open the big,  
vent-free windows at the top. Well, you do get to blow the hats off of  
rear seat passengers if you want.

  But...a historical question for which no answers have yet to be  
found by searching:
  WHY, exactly, did automakers bag the Wing Vents despite their clear  
and multiple benefits?   I can't imagine the public demanding their  
removal.  Maybe it was the Insurance Industry, our real government,  
that did the deed.

  Guesses might include:
* They are too tempting as break-in points.
* They add weight, and thereby decrease fuel efficiency.  (As if the  
big auto makers, in bed w/ big oil, care about that.)
* Open vents (may) create drag...another fuel efficiency detail.
* The metal post, as insubstantial as it may be, between vent window  
and the main door window present an object to bump into in accidents.
* Eliminating them just cut costs...and added profits.
* Or, most consumers were happy to use wasteful air conditioning etc,  
and to silently isolate themselves from surroundings....and the neo- 
Taliban anti-smoking thing meant that fewer people needed smoke  
ventilation.

  All possibilities...but...what was the Official Excuse...if anyone  
knows?

My guess is that eliminating the vent windows simply eliminated a lot
of parts and saved a lot of money. Once this is done, it becomes (or
is sold as) fashion, leading people to think it's something they
want. Hence we now get the phenomenon of people paying extra to
replace those pesky vent windows with one-piece glass door lights.

Fashion is a terribly fickle mistress.

When I'd first built my Notch, I went with 1 piece windows.
After I got t-boned by an 81 year old lady on meds, I went
back to the vents. Looks better & cools better (inside).
I know I'll not be doing THAT again.
