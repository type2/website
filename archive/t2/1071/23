Subject: [Q] Fuel Tank Removal

Group-

Before I re-install my engine I wanted to clean the fuel tank, replace fuel
line, etc.  I see the flat panel screwed into the rear "wall" of the engine
compartment.  Is it necessary to remove this to get the fuel tank out?
Even if not necessary, it appears that it would ease access to the tank.

I didn't want to jump in and try, as I just had my bus painted, including
the engine compartment.  I'm avoiding removing screws, panels, etc., in
painted areas unless necessary -- it'll help minimize dings and scratches.
