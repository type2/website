He he he. I remember as a kid when everybody was tearing off FI in favor of 
carbs... How times have changed. I too prefer fuel injection. 

Still surprising now how much the scent of gasoline hangs around a carb 
vehicle or how noticable the exhaust is in traffic from a carb vehicle 
running a little rich. Noticed a pair of Harley's a couple days ago. Wondered 
if they shouldn't have a sign that reads "No smoking within 50 feet"... VBG!
