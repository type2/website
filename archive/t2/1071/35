Subject: Installing the engine, 81 Vanagon

Got most of the work done on my engine, just need to fill out the tin, and a
few other details, so I am thinking ahead to the installation.

Anyone done it, and wish to offer an suggestion as to whether the engine
seal should be one when I put the engine up and in, or should I wait until
its bolted up, and wrestle the seal into place after the fact? Perhaps
somewhere in between, when it almost in, but not quite?

I just like to step through the work ahead of time, and think it through
before actually going at it. Helps me avoid too many suprises, and is better
than counting sheep to make me fall asleep <g>.

No, not buying a new seal. The old one is in pretty fair shape, and it will
have to do.

Thanks for comments, as always.

John
