Awning and side tent-the green surround with closable front we made just
for stuff like shows or camping where bugs were not a great issue.  The
awning can even be set up on blacktop with the poles bungeed/tied at the
bottom around the tires. Did away with the heavy set of poles and can
still hang the stock fully closable tent but cannot drive away.
We went around thre country for 6 weeks with this.
