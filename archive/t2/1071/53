Subject: Cleaning Injectors - Just an idea 

Once read an story about a young guy who had a 75 Eldorado with Fuel
Injection (It was an option).   I think it was his aunt's car or mom's
car, I don't remember, but it had sat.  He put the GM injectors in a
commercial size pickle jar, and soaked them in a solvent.  They were not
working, but after a day of sitting (maybe it was gas ?  carb cleaner or
CCL4, who knows?)  The jar was completely black, but the injectors were
clean and usable.  He did get the car running again.    Just an idea.
