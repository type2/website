buy yourself an LC-1 and adjust your mixture any way you want - then 
you'll save having to go to the state-approved shop to adjust your own 
mixture.  That, or rent one and adjust it yourself.  I adjust the 
megasquirt so that my AFR stays around stoich under load and it's passed 
emissions every time.  I don't have a cat (out of state bus) and I don't 
think my EGR was working at the time.
