Subject: RE: [T2] 'Remanufactured by Bosch' Alternator

My experience: *three* rebuilt-by-Bosch generators failed within about half a
year.  One one had a bearing failure after 2-3 months, one failed a day after
installation with some kind of an electrical defect, and one stopped charging
after a month or so of driving.  I did the first generator swap and Mike
Schmitt, a very well respected Seattle VW mechanic, did the other two, so that
pretty well rules out some kind of installation error on my part.  We also
installed a new regulator after the second failure, just in case, but of
course the third failure still happened.

At this point I wouldn't trust Bosch to rebuild my electric tea kettle, much
less a critical part of my vehicle's electrical system.  Their standards and
quality control for rebuilt units seem to be *extraordinarily* poor.
Seriously: if GEX were in the generator rebuilding business, I'd be no worse
off with them.

I finally replaced the generator with a new alternator (also Bosch, of course,
but I haven't heard of any quality problems with their new units) and have had
no problems since.

p.s. If anyone would like a dead Bosch generator and a couple of perfectly
good used voltage regulators, let me know.  I won't be using them.
