Subject: WTB - EGR valvle + plumbing for 81

like the subject says, I need aeverything that makes the EGR system work.

im trying like heck to track down an actual EGR filter and may have to suck 
it up and get the one from vanagain for $260 or whatever it costs.

but I cannot find any of the rest of the parts I need and im hoping someone 
out there can help me out.

from what I can tell from the diagrams, the egr filter connects to the 
crossover pipe directly, then connects to the engine compartment where it 
connects to a pipe that then connects to the EGR valvle.

best,
cr
