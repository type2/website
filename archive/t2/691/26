Well.. especially since a generator/alternator failure isn't a disabling
breakdown!  To need a tow truck, one would have to be foolish enough to keep
driving and driving and driving and driving and driving until the battery
died....

All of the numerous failures that I experienced in 2003 went like this:

1. Gen light comes on.
2. Miles pulls over, gets out, opens the engine compartment, and verifies that
the fan belt hasn't broken.
3. I let out a big sigh, lose a few more hairs on top, get back in, and then
continue driving normally.
4. When I get home, I put the battery on a charger and start making
arrangements to fix the generator.

Needless to say, the notion of calling a tow truck never even came close to
crossing my mind.

Admittedly, all of these failures occurred relatively close to home... but if
I were on a long trip, I surely would have had enough battery power to make it
to a suitable repair site.  I'd bet that a Bus can drive 100 miles without a
working charging system.  I think I recall a trip report that someone posted a
couple of years ago, wherein one member of a Carabus had a generator failure,
but they were able to proceed by driving with unnecessary electrical stuff
turned off and occasionally stopping to swap batteries with another Bus that
had a working generator.
