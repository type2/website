When you replace the alternator you should replace the regulator as well and 
have a good battery, all of the above rely on each other and one bad apple 
can spoil the bunch.

The bosch warranty is saying, that if it is a bad alt it will go bad in a 
year, so after a year of service you should be good for a 5-10 years 
depending on use.

Also doesn't Bosch have 24 hr road side assistance with there warranty?

Bottom line you get what you pay for.
