One thing that's worth having when sleeping in a cold bus is an 
insulated "bumper pad." (A bumper pad is a vinyl or cloth-covered piece 
of foam that goes around the inside of an infant's crib.) The bed of a 
camper is pretty poorly insulated, especially at the hatch. One of 
these, which you have to make up yourself out of an insulating foam 
backpacking mattress, cuts down on all those killer drafts.

A reasonably good sleeping bag can be had (from REI, for instance) for 
around $150; worth its weight in gold.

When I am camping in winter, I use two propane devices when I am awake. 
The first is a radiant heater that just screws onto a bottle of 
propane. Really unsafe, but I only use it for those first hideous ten 
minutes in the morning when I get out of the sleeping bag and get 
dressed. The rest of the time I use a Coleman cat. (I like the looks of 
"heater buddy," though). Someday I'm going to get that Force 10 "cozy 
cabin heater" I recommended a couple of days ago. That should raise 
temps in the camper to about 90 degrees.

But not at night. You should provide your own heat at night.
