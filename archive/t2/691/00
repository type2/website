Subject: Good Replacement Panel's

Hello,

I am about to replace the floors in the cab area of my 72 westy. Rather than 
simply weld in a patch of sheet metal. I would like to get an authentic or 
as original as possible looking replacement panel. I have heard of A.H. 
Schofield (overseas) that has very original and good quality panels. Are 
there any such suppliers of "the pond" that has the same quality replacement 
panels?

Thanks in Advance, Phil.
