Subject: Camping aux heat

Dear Volks~~~
After doing some lengthy research, I've found that if I continue to refuse to
cut vent holes for a BN4 I have two options for heat while sleeping:
  a.. electric hookups
  b.. Santana CD to transport me to Cuba
Any other ideas that won't cause me to wake up dead?
