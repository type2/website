correct, looking at the 3/4 side
while roating the engine as it would normally turn, the valve in the front
(E) opens and closes first, then immediately after the (I) opens and closes.
(the valve in the middle-front)
Karl, you mentioned that the Intake would open first, that is not what I am
seeing, do you agree? or do I have my (I)'s and (E)'s mixed up.

You are correct. I was half asleep last night when I wrote the reply.
Normally the exhaust opens and closes just before the intake opens and closes. :)
I am awake now.

> This does check out, and all marks line up, so I guess this is not my
problem.  After doing this and confirming TDC, I adjusted the valves
(hydraulic) I know but there was so much slack that compression does not
seem to be building up as the valves are not moving IN/OUT like they should
be.

Try adjusting the valves again, but NOT by where the rotor is pointing.
Get a remote starter button. Remove the valve covers. Watch any pair of rockers.
Rotate engine in direction of rotation. When the exhaust just starts to OPEN, adjust the intake
valve. Loosen locknut, unscrew adjuster, tighten til you feel it touch, then go 1 turn in.
Rotate engine, exhaust will open and close, intake will open and close. When the intake is
completely CLOSED, adjust the exhaust. Loosen locknut, unscrew adjuster, tighten til you feel it touch, then
go 1 turn in. Go to next cylinder. Same procedure. After a while of doing them this way,
you can do whole job in 2 revolutions of the engine and never get off your back but once,
when you are done.

Exhaust valve just starts to OPEN = adjust that cylinders intake.
Intake valve just completely CLOSES = adjust that cylinders exhaust.

The lifter for the valve you are adjusting will always be on the heel of the cam.

> I now have some popping going on, so I think a running engine is not far off.
All I need to know is will it start, will it run, and what else is wrong, If
I can get it started and idleing for a while, I can make all the need
adjustments and determind if anything else is wrong.

Popping can be a couple of things. It can be a retarded distributor. Where is your base timing
set at? It should be around 8 before TDC. This can be at #1 or #3 to fire. Either one will show
timing mark correctly. Or it can be 2 crossed plug wires. Are you plug wires on correctly?
1-4-3-2, clockwise from the index point.
