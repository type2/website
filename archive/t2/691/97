Could be your air breather valve (PCV) is clogged. Take it off the 
breather on top of your engine, wipe off the bottom, and try blowing 
through it . If you can't, it's clogged. Soak it in kerosene, shake, 
and bang against solid object taking care not  to break it. Soak some 
more. Repeat until restriction is gone.
