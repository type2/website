Subject: cleaning fuel injectors

Hi guys,
I got my engine/transmission down and try to rebuild it now !!!
It is urgent because I don't think my wife will accept the mess very 
long !;-)
I got a  2000cc california aircool engine .
I am wondering if I could rebuild the fuel injectors myself , they must 
be a way since you can buy rebuild ones.
I see no info over internet about that !! ;-)
Thanks
Chris
