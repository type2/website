I'm not going to tell you much about the chemistry behind paint (I too am an amateur) but I will remind you to consider the economics of the situation. Rattle cans have a hard time putting out enough paint material to cover large surfaces. Low pressure, very thin mixtures in order to get the paint out of the can, cost of 28 rattle cans or 1 quart of paint +thinner or reducer). 

Can you borrow or rent a compressor and gun? I have a decent gun and can borrow a compressor so that is an easy choice for me. 

Also consider whether you want high end paint with a novice ability or basic paint to go with your early attempts. 

Finally consider what safety gear you might need with various versions. Some versions are pretty toxic and require different masks or hoods. 

FWIW I sprayed the body with a gun and did the engine with rattle cans and powder coated the wheels, propane tank, hitch, and whatever I had ready at the time. My powdercoater prices based on how much they can coat in an hour (each new color restarts the clock). 16 wheels = 1 hour...
