Subject: RE: [T2] Roof Racks

>>Will a roof rack for a Type 1 (aka Bug) fit on a bus without major mods?<<

it depends on what you consider 'major'. the distance between the rain
gutters & the top of the roof is greater on a bus, but this can usually be
solved by getting long legs for the roof rack.

of course, this may or may not be the solution for you, depending on
manufacturer of the rack & other concerns like budget.

good luck,
