Hi List,
 
I had a turnkey 1600 SP engine put into my 69' bus.  My engine idle's fine when I start it up, but after it warms up I just can't keep it at idle unless I keep it rev'd up.  I seem to recall on my old engine I had a vacuum canister connected to my distributor, on my new engine I don't.  And I seem to have had this problem in the past with a distributor without the vacuum canister, it's been over 10 years since I've had my bus running.
 
I think I'm on the right track, the distributor being the cause of my idling problem, my question is should I swap out my distributor with one that has a vacuum canister or should I try to make the 009 work ?
 
I've read the library on type2.com about distributors without much help to me, so please don't send me there.
 
thx, rudy
