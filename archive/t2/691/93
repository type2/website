Subject: [T2]Blowby From Dipstick *(saga continues)

ok brand spanking new case here 1800.........tottally rebuilt....
everything is new except for the pistons which are new to me from my last problems out of my engine and pistons....
 
so scracth the idea of my engine this is all new setup....
got the engine and all put in friday night and drove home had bad weather and havent had time to play around yet,...
the bus wasnt driving right...
i would pul out and had not much power at all and when i got up some speed then i could cruise as long as i didnt hit another hill then i had to go from like 4th to 2nd sometimes first cause the power wasnt there....
 
ok so today i finally had a chance to look it over...
i have oil everywhere in the same spots i had with my engine and case,,,,
under the fan houseing and round dipstick so right off the bat today i adjusted the points and fitted a gas line attached to 18 oz peanut butter jar to the dipstick tuibe after removing the dipstick...
 
drove around the block not even but like 1 mile and came back home opened hood and there was my peanut butter jar 1/4 full of oil (BLOWBY FROM DIPSTCK HOLE).
also to noe thee was oil found anywhere reason cause it was coming from the dipstick tube...and was caught in the peanut butter jar instead...
 
ok so question is why do i keep havig the same problem...?
this is tottally new engine and a whole diffrent set of pistons...
 
i just really need to get this fixed this is like costing a bundle and i havent been able to drive my bus..nowhere...
 
what to do what to do... someone help me please??????????????????
if i left anythign out please tell me...?
 
76 bus running weber defv 32-36 carb with 1800 pistons and heads...tottally rebuilt top and bottom just used pistons with new rings
 
the engine runs so smooth but so did mine...??
my engine that i was having proiblems with was 2ltr pistons and heads...tottally rebuilt top and bottom just used pistons with new rings
 
also the pistons and liners were both honed and measured correctly
 
peace and love
Chris
