Hooooonnnkkkk...

I thought so too until today cause they have generally been very good for 
me....however,

They don't have non-wormgear clamps in the size for VW fuel line.

Go figure...

And, one of the owners behind the counter admitted that he didn't like the 
work gear clamps for fuel line either....I just wasn't fast enough on the 
come-back to ask what he *did* use...

Cheers, dave
