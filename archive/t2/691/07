Subject: Fuel Injection Pump wiring problem - Fixed

THANKS, for all the advice and help.
It is always a pleasure to know folks like you are out there!
Ok, now that the FI is fixed, it did turn out to be a wiring problem in the
harness by the way.

Now I am somewhat perplexed with another problem, here it is...

Finding #1 watching the #1 intake valve go in and back out to find TDC.
Ok I am fine with that, but when the timing marks don't line up ??

As soon as the #1 intake valve is out all the way, should I be looking at
the timimg lines being lined up with the rotor in the dist, right away...
because
I am having to rotate it another 3 inches to get the timing line to match
the
dist line and the rotor.  Is the Dist. out 90 or 180 degrees?

Mind you, this bus has not run since I have had it. And the prior work was
definately
sub-standard.  I am tryinh to get it to start so I can figure out what else
is wrong with it.

A little confused, but getting there.
