Subject: the painting process and headliners.

Two questions:

1. Does anyone have a handy link to good information on painting metal? 
Is the process different for steel and aluminum?
   I plan to refinish my engine compartment, cooling tin, and other 
sundry oxidized bits. During a recent visit to Napa, a display near the 
spray cans caught my eye showing bare metal, etching primer, sealing 
primer, paint, and cover coat. Other bits of data have wormed into my 
thought processes with regards to the oft neglected step of sealing the 
metal while painting it. 
   As with many other things, I'm moderately paint stupid. I would like 
to minimize the recurrence of repeat work on any pieces treated, am 
presently in no rush, and would like to do the job as correctly as 
possible.


2. During the deconstruction of the bus currently known as highly 
questionable structural integrity with some good parts, I started poking 
at the headliner. I plan to insulate the ceiling of my bus and would like 
to arm myself with information before I get myself into an uncomfortable 
corner without a headliner.  I'm looking for information on installing a 
stock type headliner and on doing birch panels for the roof -- I'm over 
30, but I still don't know what I want here.

Thanks much for any help in advance,

jack
