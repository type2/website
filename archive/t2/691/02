Subject: RE: [T2] 'Remanufactured by Bosch' Alternator

I know that it is probably cheesy to inquire, but with only a 1 year
waranty, why should one spend $100 or more for a Bosch rebuilt when thay
can get a rebuilt alt from Advance for $58 with a 1 year warranty?

I know some will say that it could be dead out of the box, but you can
just get them to take it out of the box and put it on the machine to test
it.
