You need to tell us whether this is for a Federal or California Vanagon.
They have different EGR components.

You've described the layout correctly for a Federal vehicle: EGR filter
connected to the crossover pipe at one end and to the bottom of the engine
tin at the other; then another pipe is connected to the top of the engine
tin on one end and the EGR valve on the other.  Have you determined if you
want/need working parts or parts that will simply satisfy a visual
inspection?
