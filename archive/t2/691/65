Once I have decided that you have a part I want, the very next thing I 
check to see where you are. Since I'm in California, it's perfect if 
you happen to be in Nevada or Arizona. Shipping won't take too long, 
and I won't have to pay sales tax. If you are in England, I probably 
won't order from you.

But if you don't put your address on your home page, I waste a lot of 
time hunting it down on whatever back-water page you've stuck it, if 
any.

Sometimes I can figure it out, like if you say I'll have to PA tax if 
I'm in PA. And I know that sometimes the item(s) won't be shipped from 
your location, so your address is irrelevant.

Even so, how much customer loyalty to you think you get from me when 
you make me work so hard?

It's easy: on your home page, at the bottom, stick this simple bit of 
text:

Bus and Bug Dump
914 Porsche Village Road
Westfalia, Iowa 55555
(Note that some shipments originate from alternative locations)

That's all I ask. Cheers,
