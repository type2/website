These photos don't do the final 100 yards justice. 
You climb to a bowl or box canyon with a switch back
straight up the bowl.  The roads is about 6 ft wide.
Cliff on the inside.  1000 ft drop on the outside.
Butt puckerer.  My wife was on the floor the whole way
up.  From  Lake City the road is good for about 20
miles.  Gradual climb past 
great views like a donnut falls,  Thoreau's cabin
attop a 12,000 peak, Red Mountain peak, etc.  We were
told on top the Ouray descent was closed by snow so we
went back to Lake City, but this is a road on my do
again list.
