Subject: Cleaning out EGR tubes in plenum

Decided to take a break and clean out EGR valve (full of rust chips) 
and the tubes inside the plenum. I ran a brush and some carb cleaner 
into the tubes, but stopped after a minute or so. That's more likely to 
be compacting the crud in there than cleaning it out.

I figure that what I need is a sort of roto-rooter, perhaps something 
as simple as a lightweight coathanger wire with its end mangled a 
little to scrape and cut through the crud. It has to be steered into 
both tubes, one at a time. I also plan to use the smallest drill bit I 
have to periodically open up the holes in the tubes (by hand, not with 
a drill).

Has anyone come up with a better solution they like?

Mark
