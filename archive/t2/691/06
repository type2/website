Several reasons, Mark, none of which may apply to you.

1. Some people simply prefer to keep their buses as "original" as 
possible. VW and Bosch parts, new, and Bosch rebuilts where a new Bosch 
part is very pricey or unavailable.

2. Price differentiation. Many people would rather pay a little more 
than a little less for exactly the same thing. All brand names versus 
generics work this way (whether they are the same thing is always an 
open question).

3. Assumption of higher quality and longer life, irrespective of 
warranty duration. Sometimes this is the case, sometimes it's not. Only 
people who work on dozens of VWs a year really know which is which. The 
rest of us depend on hearsay.

4. It probably actually costs Bosch more to rebuild their alternators 
than it costs whoever does the one at Advanced, because of unit cost.
