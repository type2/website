Subject: RE: [T2] 'Remanufactured by Bosch' Alternator

Look around town. Every town of any size has a shop that rebuilds starters and alternators. I live in a TN town of 25K and we have 3... Get it done locally, make some connections, and you'll have somebody to lean on if it fails prematurely. 

Also FWIW I rebuild my own. Requires basic tools and a little time. Bearings, brushes, and regualtors are the MOST common failures and EASY to fix. If the windings fail, get another one. Same for starters: bushings, brushes, and drives. Replace 'em yourself. A bit of grease, a bit of paint and you are moving again with a new pretty part. Best of all because it is SO cheap to do this you can pickup a 2nd used starter or generator or alternator and have 1 rebuilt and waiting on the shelf. 

I've done this with Moostangs, Fiats, VWs, Hondas, etc. They are ALL very, very similar.
