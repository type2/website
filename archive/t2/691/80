Subject: Re:Case sealing methods

Mark,

You said...There are some minor dings and flaws in the sealing
surface, but none
that cross the surface completely. It's steering the floss around
these
that makes me most uncomfortable about using the floss method.......I
am dubious
about my ability to lay the thing in flat and even, without twisting
it"

    Karl has given you some good advice about using the floss.  Let me
make a suggestion so you won't have the trouble of laying the floss in
flat, which makes it hard to bend and turn.  Go down to your local
fabric shop and get some thin silk thread.  Being round you don't have
to worry about how you lay it in and it makes turns and bends just
fine.

You also said..."The fact that the case doesn't need any sealer leads
me to suspect that the thinnest possible coating of sealer might be
best."

On the way home from the fabric shop stop at your local paint store, a
good hardware store, or some of the big box home improvement stores.
Pick up a small can of M.E.K. and use it sparingly to thin the sealant
to a consistancy that allows you to easily brush it on in a thin coat.
WARNING  that Methyl Ethyl Ketone is some harsh stuff so be careful
how you use it!

When using the "thread in a sealant" method I've always gone back and
retorqued the case bolts about 30 minutes after doing it the first
time.  My thought is that if the thread crushes the bolts may loose
some torque.
