I haven't used the floss method, but I hear it works well, especially useful
when the case has been rebuilt several times or has damage to the parting
line.

I know everyone has a different preference for the sealant to use for the
case halves. I recommend this:

Costs a bit more, but it really does work better than the avaiation selant.
Cleans up a ton easier as well, it is anerobic, so it only dries where there
is no air.
