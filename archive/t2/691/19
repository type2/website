You are. It's great when you can find a small local shop that knows what
they're doing with old VW electrics. A good local rebuilder who takes pride
in what he does can frankly do as good a job as Bosch for less money. Most
of the "U.S. rebuilt" alternators and starters on my website come from a
shop like this - a small specialist that rebuilds them in low volume (and in
my case has specialized in old VW electrics for years). He charges me a bit
more than the big guys (although still less the Bosch), but he's worth it.
By comparison, most rebuilts from auto parts stores come from huge
assembly-line operations that are nothing like this. A big auto parts chain
(or major wholesaler) doesn't want to deal with dozens of little mom-and-pop
specialists that can only build a few dozen units a week, even if they're
good. They want a single high-volume mass-rebuilder that can deliver
truckloads at a time, for every make and model, at the lowest bid. Quality
is secondary to quantity and price.
