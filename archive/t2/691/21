Subject: Setting up new AFM for initial startup?

I hope to be installing my rebuilt (AVP) engine next week if the weather
permits. I have a rebuilt AFM from B.D. I'll be putting on the fuel injection.
The original has dead spots all over the place. I'm wondering if there is a
standard initial setting for the air bypass screw like setting the idle jets
on a carb 2 turns from fully seated. There is a document that came with the
AFM saying that the unit was calibrated during the remanufacturing process.
Does this include the bypass screw? I know it will need to be fine tuned for
correct C.O. reading but I want to have things as close as possible until I
can get it on an exhaust analyzer.
Thanks,
Tom
