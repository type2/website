I agree.

If you were making a Gant Chart on MS Project it might show as a delay 
unless you change the relationships. The slight delay could be worth the 
relaxed case mating and getting it right. What else could you do in the time 
while waiting for delivery? I seem to remember that distributor needing some 
work. This could be looked at as extra time to do other components as 
opposed to a set back. But take the time to get it right. It is what it is. 
You could use what you have and drive on or you could rethink the process. 
Ultimately it is up to you.
