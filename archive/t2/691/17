Subject: RE: [T2] 'Remanufactured by Bosch' Alternator

We have a shop in town that rebuilds starters, gens, and alternators
starting at 25 dollars. Most I've paid so far is 60 dollars because some
bearings were toast on a Nissan alternator. He replaces the brushes,
polishes the armatures and checks the bearings, cleans them up and voila.
Done. If it's an alternator he checks the diodes etc, then replaces the
brushes and polishes the armature. Same for the starters. He guarantees them
for a year. I'd say that is one heck of a deal. I've had my Nissan, VW, and
Mazda starters and Alternators/gens done by him for years. I am lucky.
