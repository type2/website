Subject: Front Windshield for sale

I Just got my windshield installed, but prior to that i bought one with 
gasket from a friend who works in a auto body shop.  Anyway, being the 
procrastinater that I am, never got around to installing.  So now i need to 
off load it.  $100.00 with gasket.  I will not ship so if you're willing to 
pick it up it's a good deal...  I live in snohomish, Wa. and can be reached 
at:

          I also have 2 other gaskets. Not sure what type of VW windshield 
they're for
  but they do have stock #'s.   I definetly don't need these.  and they will 
just collect dust,  so please make offer..
