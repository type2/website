Not all Mexican/Brazilian bus seals are the same.

With regard to front door seals, there are at least five versions available
that I know of:

There are the OEM German ones. These have been discontinued for about 7
years, and I believe I am the only one who has any at all. I have about four
pair, at $199 a pair, part number 211 798 721D (for a pair).  Once these are
gone, they're gone forever (barring some incredibly fortunate N.O.S. find,
which is not out of the question but unlikely). These are unquestionable the
best fitting seal, identical to what came on your bus when new.

Then there are the OEM Mexican/Brazilian ones. These are the ones that
Volkswagen puts on the South American bus. They are definately not as good
as a fit as the German ones but definately acceptable.  As far as I know I'm
the only one who has these, too.  They're $19.95 each, part number 211 831
721D (left) or 211 831 722D (right).

Then there are the seals everyone else sells, which are one of three Mexican
or Brazilian aftermarket seals. These definately do not fit as well as the
OEM ones.  I ship them only as a last resort, if VW is backordered on the
OEM ones, which does happen periodically but not frequently. However, these
are the ones that pretty much every other VW parts vendor ships all the
time, from the big suppliers to the small ones. The other vendors typically
sell them for between $15 and $30 each (the latter being one heck of a
rip-off, as wholesale is under $10). Some of the vendors rebrand them with
their own name, some ship them in the South American packaging, or loose.
The fit varies greatly from one aftermarket brand to the next, but none is
quite comparable to OEM and some are downright awful.

The same situation applies to pretty much every other VW bus seal.  Whenever
possible, I ship either genuine VW, or European made aftermarket. This makes
up about 90% of all '68-79 seals I ship.  Many of these seals are exclusive
to the Bus Depot in the United States. Anywhere else you buy you will get
cheap aftermarket seals, even if you spend more. Not that you will _never_
get a South American aftermarket seal from the Depot. But if you do, you can
be pretty sure that in the case of that particular seal at that particular
time, absolutely nothing else could be had, and it wasn't for lack of
trying.

If it sounds like I'm proud of the seals I sell, it's because I am.  I can
safely say that no matter what you spend, as a whole you can't buy better
body seals than I sell, at any price. Which is something to be proud of,
especially because my prices are typically about the lowest on the market as
well.
