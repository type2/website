Subject: Don't hate me cause I'm cheap. :-)/ can't get the seal

So in an effort to keep costs down on this broken westy window, I tried to
reuse the original seal. Looked great, flexible, no breaking down, but when
I went to install it with a piece of 3/16" parachute cord, the cord cut
through the seal like butter. What is with that?? I even lubricated it with
silicone so it was nice and slick. Well, daughter wanted to go camping this
Tuesday, there is NO seal availabe in Western Canada, so time was of the
essence. The solution? I cut off the inner lip of the seal but left the rest
intact. I got out my ultra-black silicione sealant, and ran a bead all the
way around the metal lip, and pushed the modified seal into the window
frame. It was a tight fit in, and sealed up against the frame beautifully.
The silicone oozed up in a perfect bead all the way around on the inside, so
I'm going to let it set up 24hrs, then trim the excess (very little showing
maybe 1/16") and leave it for now. It's as well sealed as it was with the
inside rubber lip that I had cut off.
That's my story, and I'm sticking to it. Sorry to offend the resto-diehards,
but necessity can sometimes be the mother of invention.
Take care,
Courtney
