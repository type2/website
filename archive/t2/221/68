Subject: Re: [T2] Westy front Cot

I have an original child's cot (56 1/4", 3 sided, galvanized = 69 - 73) that
I retrieved from the boneyard.  It's in very good shape (one tiny little rip
in the original canvas otherwise nothing else is wrong with the bar or
stiching).

I'd like to trade it for an original "2 piece, collapsible, 3 sided,
galvanized = 76 - 79" set or just buy that from someone who doesn't need it.

If no one replies and I can't find anything on eBay in the next month I'll
offer the pair I have to a listmember next time someone posts on the
subject.  A friend of mine offered to extend the bars for my 78 but I
decided it would be a shame to do this to an original cot that would be
perfect for a 69-73 owner.
