I bought a set of the nice, heavy dansk ones from busdepot a few years back. Wasn't able to install them at the time. When I did finally get around to it, I wasn't able to get them to connect with... uhm... the part of the muffler that moves back and forth on the little tubes.... <grin> I know, that's terribly helpful, isn't it? Anyway, I don't want to beat up my heat exchangers, but I'd like them to fit together. I suspect the bus still won't run right, but I'd feel better about it. Any suggestions?
While I'm on this posting kick.... I've heard before that it's imprtant to have all the tin in place. I'm missing the little pieces that go between the front and back around the heat risers. I figured there had to be something that goes there, but didn't know what until I looked at my Bug, which has all her tin. I'm also wondering if the air comes in through the scoops and then goes right straight out the hole that I was always amazed the battery never fell out of. Could this have anything to do with my cooling problems? Also I've heard about making sure there's no gaps in the tin, how does one do this? I have read some stuff in the archives, but I haven't seen info about sealing the tin.

2.  Among the various parts Beetlemex sells they list "OEM Heaterboxes".  Does anyone have experience with these HEs?  The price [$45.25 each] is certainly attractive, but not if they're lighweight, poor quality junk...
