People will do lots to things to keep a bus on the road!

You might have a grey market import, as some late bays came with 1600
engine in europe.

It might be a Mexican or Brazilian bus.

If the engine tin looks "factory", snag it!  It's not easy to find and it
is in demand for folks who want to put a type 1 engine into their late
bays.
