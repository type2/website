Subject: Re: [T2] how do I install door seals??

If you don't find VW seals, be prepared for anything. The genuine door 
seals hold themselves in place when installed correctly and the factory 
only used a bit of adhesive at the corners. 3M Weatherstrip Adhesive is 
hard to beat for this application.

Genuine seals come powdered. Clean off the powder at the corners where you 
use adhesive.

I have yet to see any aftermarket door seal that both fits correctly and 
seals properly.
