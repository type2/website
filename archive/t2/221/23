Hey you parts vendors who are on the list-

Do any of you have a cylinder head temp gauge and sender in stock? Please
ping me offline if you'd like to make a sale. I'm also looking for an oil
temp sender for my VDO gauge. Seems to be the season of back orders or NLA
for me lately.

Anybody put one of those "new" mex engines in their bus? I'm looking at the
1600 for my '71.

Thanks,

Pete
