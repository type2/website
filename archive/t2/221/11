Subject: Re: [T2]if not the "parts place auto parts" where???

I live in Toledo and from time to time I have driven up to the "parts place
auto parts"
for ...parts,
I agree they can dick you over from time to time....

But where in ( in the NW ohio SE michagen area)
can a poor bus driver find parts at a good price AND respect at the same
time???
