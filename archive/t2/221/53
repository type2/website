  Quote from VWoA on the new microbus

"Styling reminiscent of the 50's-60's Microbus designed to attract Phish
fans who've grown old enough to have their own families"

  Just makes me want to sell all my vintage buses for a new one, ya right

 I'd have to get BACK into drugs to want one of those!
