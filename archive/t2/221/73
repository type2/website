Subject: Re: [T2] remanufactured by vw/audi

There is a possibility it will have an engine designation on it that 
says that your  are actually a 1600  and the date that it was 
refurbished.  When digging up info on refurb engines  I found that the 
refurbs that  went into 1300 and 1500 apps were mostly 1600.  Was the 
engine code restamped or covered with a rivetted plate with a new code?

I tearing my old muffler off, i discovered an orange
sticker on my block, partially hidden by the camshaft
pulley. It says remanufactured VW and Audi. It has
some numbers that are hard to see.

Would the no. tell me anything interesting?
