Subject: Help! Oil filler Tube

The oil filler tube has slipped off my engine (1980 air 
cooled), spraying oil around the fan area. 

Bently is not too clear on how to reconnect it, but I think 
it is basically a slot with a bolt for tension (is this 
right?). The slot at the end of the tube appears slightly 
damaged, and that may complicate reconnecting it. What am I 
better off doing?

1) Pulling the tube out entirely and stuffing a rag in there 
until I can get a replacement part?

2) Reconnecting the filler tube and watching the gauges like 
a hawk.

3) Not driving it at all and screwing up my weekend plans.

Any ETKA gurus have a part number?

Thanks,
Chris
