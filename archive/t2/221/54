Yep, some folks manage to find the tin they used in Europe to seal the engine 
bay up with a 1600 installed.  I ran across a 79 westie here in Portland with 
the "euro" tin and a fuel injected 1600 from a late beetle installed.

I would imagine with almost 20 less horsepower and the taller gearing in the 
later 091 trans it was a_bit_slow up the hills.  : )

I also have seen the tin for sale at the "Spring Meet" in Puyallup, WA.
