Subject: fan hub spacer removal

Hello my fine feathered type 4 friends,

I finally finished dismantling my old engine from my vanagon.
I got the fan off, and the fan housing, but there is a funky
thing with the three holes for bolts and a little dowel sticking
out.  This was what the fan was screwed in to.  I'm guessing it
is some kind of circlip thing, but I am not able to remove it.

Am I just not seeing something?

thanks,
Ed Knuth
