Sam, 
To install a factory in-dash unit would be a real chore--
A hang on under the dash unit would be a breeze---not difficult at all--

Check out--- Vintageair.com

for a Baywindow request for pictures 
I am thinking of putting AC in my 70 westy I understand about the
compressor in the engine compartment. Does anyone have a good set of
pictures for the inside where the cold might come out. 
It is best to post a link to a website. 
I can out up a page on bay window AC in my westy pages, if you have the
pictures & no site. 
I have looked at a couple of later bays with factory air and wonder
whether I should scrounge some junkyard for that?
