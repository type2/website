Starz Cinemateque
Monday, August 4
11:45 PM EASTERN (10:45 central) on Starz
Greatful Dawg
Story of Jerry Garcia and the Greatful Dead

unlike most other movies on Starz, they do NOT (usually) repeat ther
cinemateque movies, so if you want to see this, watch it monday or ask
someone to record it for you. if anyone wants ME to, just let me know
this weekend so i can get a tape ready for it.

(talk about bus sightings! i bet there are a MILLION of em in there!)
