Subject: [T2] A/C for a Baywindow request for pictures

I am thinking of putting AC in my 70 westy
I understand about the compressor in the engine compartment.
Does anyone have a good set of pictures for the inside where the cold might 
come out.
It is best to post a link to a website.
I can out up a page on bay window AC in my westy pages, if you have the 
pictures & no site.
I have looked at a couple of later bays with factory air and wonder whether I 
should scrounge some junkyard for that?
