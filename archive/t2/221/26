Hi Michael,

There is a 3M adhesive that does a good job.

If the front door seals didn't cost $100 each (or come from a donor car) 
be prepared for some grief. I put a $30 Brazilian seal on my drivers 
door and had to trim 1/4" of rubber from it with a razor before I could 
shut the door without it bouncing open again. And it still takes a firm 
hand to seal the door properly.

Don't want to rain on your parade, but the brazilian seals are simply a 
huge PITA. I'd LOVE to see what they've done to the doors in Brazil that 
allow these seals to fit properly.

Happy trails,
