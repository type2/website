Subject: Puller recommendation

I popped out my drag link in 5 seconds using this tie-rod puller.  Save
yourself a ton of trouble and get this tool before trying to remove your
tie-rods.

Fear of this tool leads to Anger. Anger leads to Hate. Hate leads to
Suffering. :-)

I bought it from Pelican Parts. California Imports was back ordered over a
month but they have 7 now.

My close-ups:
