Lady Magoo and I will be pulling our Eriba Puck to the two VW Shows in the
Denver area--On August 10 & 11th.

We will have some "Bus Stuff" for sale including some small 6 volt parts.
like 6 volt Halogen Bulbs from Europe, 12 volt Halogen bulbs--and VW Bus
Toys--

I am in need of a set of rear bumper splash guards for my 1965
Highroof--also the 4 screws that hold in the taillights--Buy or Trade?--We
hope to see many of our VW friends there.  Look for a Puck with a large VW
Logo in the back window--Please say hello--Please P-Mail us if you can be of
help--, TWWM, uj
