Not much in the way of buses in the grateful dawg movie. In fact I don't
remember seeing any. I was more focused on the music and the men though. It
relates to Jerry and David's collaborations more than GD projects and the
whole hippie buses on tour thing. Lots of folk/blue grass(they did touch on
other things they did together as well). I highly recommend it in spite of
the absence of busage.
