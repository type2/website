            Ok, the plan is to move from western North Carolina to Boise
Idaho in about 2 weeks.  We only have one mode of transportation and
that is our famous baby delivery bus.  However its not to happy at the
moment.  Over the last couple of weeks I have begun to have starting
problems.  This does not happen just in the mornings.  If the bus stays
parked for more than about 3 hours, it will crank with no problems but I
cannot get it to turn over.  I have found a way to make it start which
may lead to the answer of the question.  If I floor it while trying to
start it and let it crank over for about 5 revolutions and then let it
sit for about 5 minutes..it will start with one more crank and no gas
pedal action.  I have replaced the fuel filter as of about 1500 miles
ago and the fuel lines are new all the way around.  Another issue that
has developed at the same time is that if I come to a stop at a rapid
rate, then engine will practically die on me once the bus stops.  I have
checked for vacuum leaks and there is a small one around the S tube
going to the throttle body. However it is rather minimal.  I took all
the plugs out and number three is very oily and black.  Number three, as
many may remember, as been the culprit to a lot of my engine problems.
The used I that I replaced the old one with while at FasterLaster's is
still fine as far as I can tell.  Compression shows:
1-80
2-100
3-90
4-120
 
Dwell- 48.9
Idle (-at-) 850rpm
 
Other changes recently include and oil temperature sender via the sump
plate.  Temps show about 240 on a 90 degree day at idle.  I recently
replaced my points with ones that were not California spec.  Ibroke down
about two weeks ago due to the screw allowing the points gap to slip and
throw my timing way off.  The points I got were rated for a 78 though.
Other than that no changes or alterations have been made to the bus.
Any ideas on why I would be having such a problem starting?  It will
jump start fine.

Thanks for the help everyone and thanks for all the replies on our
newborn son.  He and my girl friend are doing fine.
