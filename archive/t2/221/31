Subject: Re: [T2] how do I install door seals??

>>You know, I bought, like 5 $20 window seals from
Busdepot. They ARE gonna seal, right? Is it the same
thing with window seals, too? Now I'm paranoid.<<

i wouldnt be too concerned. the rear window seal
i got from BD fit perfectly & IIRC it was a mexican
seal, not sure tho.

good luck,
