I just installed a PERTRONIX in my vacuum advance distributor yesterday and
it made a WORLD of difference in the way my van idles, shifts. runs, etc.

 I have also heard people who seem to not be happy with them.

Make sure if you install it that your whole ignition system is up to snuff.
If you have old spark cables, distributor cap, rotor and a worn out coil,
you are just wasting your money on a PERTRONIX. After you install your
Pertronix, MAKE SURE YOU RETIME YOUR ENGINE. most people I have talked to,
never retimed their engines after the install and got crappy results,
(mainly because the Pertronix is so stable and the points and condensor are
not. You will notice the differance when you shine your timing light on your
marks.)

I was running with all new stuff and points and condensor, my Van ran well,
I slapped a PERTRONIX in, in 5 minutes and my van is running better than it
ever has in 15 years.
