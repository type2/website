Subject: RE: [T2] POR-15 & fiberglass

Somebody else on this list said to use Penetrol. I have ordered it and it
just came in yesterday. I have not had a chance to use it, but will in the
next few weeks. The website says that it restores luster to faded
fiberglass. It is used on boats, so I think it will do the job. For
cleaning, I clean mine with Simple Green and a brush. It does a great job
except for some black stuff on the side. I am going to try goo gone on that.
The Penetrol was $9.00 a quart from

You may be able to find it cheaper, locally.

In New Bern, NC, there is a boatbuilder called Hatteras--named after the
home of man-eating sharks. They make seagoing yachts (the smallest boat in
their line is 50 feet long), and they paint all of them with urethane paint.

Your Bus's poptop deserves no less. You deserve no less.
