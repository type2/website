No way to know if it's a good deal without a proper compression test. Just 
cause it runs doesn't mean it has long life left. Same goes for the 
injection pump. If you don't test it's current pressures, you don't know if 
it will last a few hundred or another 100k miles. If it's been sitting for 
more than a year, the pump could well be gummed up and you won't be able to 
start it. If you can drive it before pulling, well, at least you can tell 
if it's putting out good torque or sluggish. If either the motor or pump 
have to be replaced soon, it's not a bargain. If both are weak, they have 
core value for rebuilding only. Certainly not a bargain. Add to it you 
don't get the many Westy only parts, it's risky without verifing the motor 
and pump before handing over the money. If the tests show good strength in 
reserve, it would be a very fair price.

Without proper testing, there is no way to put a rational value on it 
except assume and hope for the best. It leaves the doors open to good, bad 
and ugly value, depending upon quality of the ACTUAL results founded upon 
the ACTUAL unknown ACTUAL condition. So, it's verify reality or cross your 
fingers, always.
