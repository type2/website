BTW, for carabusses, FRS is the only way to go.  We used FRS for our
carabus to BBB from SoCal and the radios worked flawlessly.  No
interference, perfect FM audio, and no installation at all.  At the event
you can carry them around and stay in touch with your friends.  Range is
about a half mile reliably and up to two miles in open country.

I just bought a pair of Uniden "Ecotrek" FRS radios at Wallyworld for $10
each, and they even have a "carabiner" hook built in to hang from your
belt loop or whatever.

If you go this route, forget the bells and whistles.  Just get basic 14
channel FRS radios.  Look for ones that use 3 AA batteries.  Some of them
use 4 AAA batteries that are a lot more expensive to replace.
