Subject: Re: [T2] '71 seat belts

Look at the 'press' seat belts for the white label sewn on the belt with the
part # on it. It will show the date. It will more than likely be 1974 and
later.
The ones with the little white knob should be dated 1973 and older.
The 'press' ones are from a later bus......
