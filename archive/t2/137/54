Hi Volks,

Just a note to let volks know that the first wave of Canadians is now on
their way to EveryBus 2002. We're making for Niagara Falls tonight, then
Round Hill VA for Wednesday night; arriving at Hagan Stone Park to set up
"The Canadian Pavilion" on Thursday afternoon. We're not so sure of our
destinations/dates on the return leg,

The Carabus will be chattering away on CB channel 14, so if you see us on
our travels feel free to give us a holler. If not, just wave!

Hope to see people soon at EveryBus!!!
