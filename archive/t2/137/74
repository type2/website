Subject: Found a vacuum leak but...

I think I may have found the source of my hot running bus. Been looking
for days trying to find a leak, finally found in my zeal to prevent
leaks when I assembled everything I broke the hose clamp that keeps the
S tube attached to the throttle assembly. Replaced the clamp and gained
2.5 PSI on the vacuum gauge. I now have some control over the idle speed
and can lean out the mix. After Idling in the driveway for a while the
temps maxed at 180 and hiop was 20 psi.

Tonight's question is what should my manifold vacuum be at idle? I am
getting 14 PSI on my gauge connected with a T into the vacuum port that
supplies the fuel regulator. This 2000cc only has 50 miles on it so it's
probably not completely broke in yet. It would be great to have
something to compare to.

Question 2 is my distributor vacuum connected to the correct port on the
throttle? It's connected to the port facing the rear of the bus on the
throttle body. There is another facing the front that is capped off.
This is a 75 FI setup
