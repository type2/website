Subject: Re: [T2] '71 seat belts

The ones with the white lever are the original '71 belts.  The orange
buttons came later on.

Unless you are trying for a "10+" restoration, don't bother with the
original belts.  They are rather hard to use and I'd be rather worried
about being trapped in them in the event of an accident.  Imagine some
random citizen trying how to unlatch the belt while the fire is growing!

Inertia reel belts from late model bugs are a nice replacement for the
front seats of early Bays.  You have to modify the brackets slightly to
allow the reel to be rotated 90 degrees.  The same belts and reels are
also found in Audis and watercooled VWs.
