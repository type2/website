Hi,

I will be selling a few odds and ends at EB. Here is a heads up for 
those interested.

BN4 heater, ductwork to go into interior, fire-wall tin, dash switch. 
I have not used it. The PO said it needed points for the fuel pump 
but it did work. Mark told me that you can bypass that with a blinker 
relay. The whole pile can be yours for $300.

68 to 71 rear bumper splash pans, NOS, really NOS, A little rust from 
sitting somewhere but still in primer. $50

63-67 Bentley in decent shape $50

68-72 Westy camp stool cover$25

73 Westy side tent Side tent SOLD!!!!!!!
