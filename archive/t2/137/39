i'd say go for it, that is the best darn stuff in the
world.  it does need to be topcoated though and would
use their top coating that way you wouldn't need to
use the tie coat between the two and it would be that
much tougher.  if you don't top coat it it turns
colors on you.  my silver under the bug turned slight
brown in some locations and would only be worse if
left in the direct sunlight.
