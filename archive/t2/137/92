Subject: Re: re: por-15 on pop tops

Is POR15 less effective if it is not topcoated? I used it last year on some
carefully prepped rust spots and it is just coming right through. These
spots are exposed to the sun. It isn't clear in the directions about whether
it is damaged by UV or not, just that it changes color (it does). What has
been your experience on this?
