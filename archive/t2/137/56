Look on the side of the tool and on the side of the compressor. The
compressor will list a maximum air pressure and CFM rating. The tool will
list how much PSI and CFM it needs to run. If the rating on the tool is
equal or less (preferably less) than the rating on the compressor, it will
work.

Given this, which is true so far, I would not hook a spray gun to a 5-gallon
compressor. You will drain the tank in a heartbeat with that combination,
and when the air pressure drops it screws up the paint job. Rent an HVLP
system from the local Taylor Rental or Cat Rental or wherever.
