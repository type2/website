Subject: Battery tray welding question

This evening, I mentioned to a friend that the battery 
tray in my new 72 westy was severly rusted through. He 
said that he has an arc welder and that wouldn't be a 
super hard job to weld in a replacement.
Is he right ie-is an arc welder suitable for such a task?
(please forgive my near complete ignorance on the 
subject of welding. I was forced to take college-prep 
classes in high school)

TIA--
