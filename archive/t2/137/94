> because I'm rebuilding the engine of my 78 Westy I'm thinking of replacing the standard muffler with a stainless steel one. Does anyone know where to get one and how much such a muffler is?

now before I give up,  I put a SS muffler on my 78 about 2 years ago or
so, now to do it easily I put an older 72-74 exhaust header on it which
fits perfectly, then a Bus Depot SS muffler fit pretty much straight bolt
on, had a problem with the little tailpipe but I think it was just mine
and not all of em.

   still looks almost new

I thought about it, buy  the one from Bus Depot
