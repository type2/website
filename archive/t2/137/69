I received this picture in the mail today, I have no Idea where it originated,
but I find the temperature numbers interesting.

http://www.globalserve.net/~jrivers/hotengine.jpg

I would have thought the numbers for the hottest part of the engine to be closer
to 100 deg C.
this is a Bug and will be different, but this seems too far off the data I have
with infrared 
I use an infrared thermometer when I
travel,,http://www.metermantesttools.com/products/IR610.asp especially when I
carabus, as I can take 10 temps when we all stop for gas,,, and I have found the
temps range from 85 - 110 deg C ,, and been as high as 120 deg C 
I always shoot the temp at the oil galley next to the dist on T1 engines and at
the oil pump for T4 engines,,
I get temps as high as 200 at the cylinder heads,, 
I traveled with 10 buses ,, one was way hot, one was way cool,, and all the rest
were the same... from that Data, I came to an unscientific conclusion that 95
deg C was an average running temp.. up a bit from the year before when the mean
temp was 82 deg C

any ideas ,,thoughts? why that bug engine is sooo much cooler?
