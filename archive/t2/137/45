Does anyone know the surrounding area at EB. I just want to know if there
are places to shop near by or if I should pack all my perishable stuff for
the  ride down from MA. Any help would be appreciated. See you there Woo
Hoo.

Jamie if you are coming from the Greensboro side, just off the interstate
where you exit there are 2 or 3 grocery stores.

Hope this helps some people..
