Subject: [T2] CB channels

Anybody have a list of the CB channels that the various carabusses will be using? I will be coming down from the Washington, DC area and will be trying to play "catch-up" to the other southward bound voyagers. With as many convoy's heading that way I would hope that I could catch one.

Happy trails,
Maui Haui '77 Westy the "Loveboat"
