Subject: Re: [T2] CB channels

I was under the impression that all the type 2 folks used channel 2, both
on CB and FRS.  I don't think that there would be interference between
multiple carabuses, and it might even be interesting if you got some skip
contacts between distant groups.  The sunspots are hot, so the skip is in,
like it or not!
