Hello everybody,

because I'm rebuilding the engine of my 78 Westy I'm thinking of =
replacing the standard muffler with a stainless steel one. Does anyone =
know where to get one and how much such a muffler is?
I also thought about building one by myself. Has anyone done this =
before?

Any help would be greatly appreciated,

Timo
