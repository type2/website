Nope.  It's more than likely that it's rusted in place.

Either your E-brake cable(s) are sticking, or the brakes are 
rusting/sticking to the places
where they contact the backing plate.  When you do your brake job, be sure 
to thoroughly
clean EVERYTHING that isn't being replaced.  Put anti-seize on the threads 
of the
adjusting bolts and the outside of the adjusting star where it fits into 
the little block where
it sleeps at night.  Lube the places where the shoes rub against the 
backing plate with a
wax-based lube--the kind for your window tracks, that NAPA sells, works 
great for this
(yes, there are other types of lube that will work great here 
also).  Otherwise, lube as per
The Bentley.

Personally, if it were my bus, I wouldn't drive it until I had dealt with 
this problem.
