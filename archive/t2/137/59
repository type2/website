Subject: Floaty tach

I hooked up my new VDO tach yesterday before driving from Ocala, FL to
Atlanta, GA today. I think something might not be right. First, let me
describe how it's wired:

Lights: plus wired in with plus on other dash lights and grounded with other
dash lights - to the metal on the back of the instrument panel.

Gauge:
Set for 8-cylinder Ignition Coil (4-cylinder seemed exactly 2X too high)
Negative tied to chassis
Postive tied to postive on the ignition switch (not accessory)
Sender tied to negative pin on the coil

The needle seems to 'float' and jump around. I haven't tried changing it
yet, but my suspicion is that by using the ignition switch + instead of
accessory, I'm getting a +12V that's getting pulled down as the ignition
draw more current - as the revs increase.

Anyone have any ideas? I'll probably try rewiring it tomorrow.

BTW, after rebuilding my Weber Prog and getting the timing nailed down, I
saw 24mpg between Ocala and Macon cruising at 65mph. I didn't believe it the
first time I filled up in Valdosta (6.95 gallons) so I stopped in Macon (5.5
gallons).
