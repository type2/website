John,

Only time I ever had a problem like that was when I adjusted brakes in 
20 degree weather, then it got to be 80 2 days later....a few stops later, 
I had the same problem.  Backed the adjusters off about 3 clicks and all 
was well.

This assumes an otherwise healthy set of brakes....no bad rubber hoses, no 
junk in the mc that blocks the "relief" valve.

Cheers, dave

My question is this: If the little metal latch clicker thingy (sorry for the technical terms) that keeps the adjusting star from moving is not seating in the cogs of the star, will the brakes shoes tighten up on that wheel with use? My assumption was that the shoes would loosen if anything. I backed the adjustment off enough to completely free the wheel, and I'm due for a brake job either way, so I'm really just curious.
