> ...the ZebraSafari is finally over, thanks to the Stuttgart cops.  >Indeed, Africa was a breeze compared to "more civilised" lands. But that >also shows the power of passion and purpose.

>Cape to Cairo in a vintage VW bus was my dream; getting to London was 
>just a nice idea.  I guess the universe was telling us, via our travails >since Cairo, that it was time to wrap things up and find something else >to do.

>We have spent the weekend in Paris visiting friends, and we catch a bus
>to London tonight, where we'll spend some time with my brother before >flying home.  In London I'll also be approaching some publishers about >the book I intend to write about this journey!
