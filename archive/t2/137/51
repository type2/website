There is a shopping center just a few miles away from EB. Otherwise 
we are out in the sticks.

After you get off the interstate and are heading down US 421 you come 
to the stop light that you turn right at to get to HST. If you were 
to take a left instead then you would arrive at a shopping center a 
few miles down the road.
