Subject: Westy ice chest

Does anyone have an extra Westy ice chest (I believe they came in the 76 or
so) they would sell at Everybus? The kind thats a cooler and not a fridge.

I would also like a nice 68-72 front fresh air grill in chrome to match my
new emblem. I have a rust free painted one I'll partially trade/sell if I
find a chrome one.

Thanks and see you all this weekend!!
