Subject: Stranded listee - update (long)

Hi Folks,

If you've just joined this thread, it was started by Chuck Notmeyer in 
response to a distress call that Mick McQuilton and I gave him yesterday.  A 
rocker shaft stud broke on my 2.0L Type 4 engine while we were on U.S. 50 at 
the Utah/Nevada border.  After a couple of hours on the phone, we finally 
got Sweet Pea into Ely, Nevada on the back of a ramp truck, and I contacted 
a mechanic who was willing to take a look at it.

Now for the update:
After getting into Ely and chatting with the wrecker driver, we decided to 
leave Sweet Pea at the mechanic's (Carney Brothers Automotive for those 
familiar with Ely) and continue on to Reno.  We camped outside of Fallon 
last night, and we made it to Reno today, where Chuck is hosting us while we 
do some scheduled work on Mick's 1971 Westy.

The rocker shaft studs are being sent to the shop, and they will take a look 
at it Tuesday and give me a yes/no and a quote.  If their price is 
reasonable, I'll have them do it and pick it up on Friday as I return.  If 
their price is too high, I'll just do it myself and try to get it running as 
best I can (i.e. perfectly) to get me back home.

Basically, the broken rocker shaft stud will have to be removed by being 
drilled and easy-outed.  The other stud that pulled out will have to be 
helicoiled and replaced.  If I can get out of this under 100 bucks, I'll 
consider myself lucky, despite the fact that I was stranded for a short 
while.

Now for some air-clearing:
I do not attribute this problem to my engine builder, Jake Raby.  My engine 
ran perfectly for 400 miles on Saturday, pulling me strongly and steadily up 
some serious grades on I-70 in Utah.  I also do not attribute this problem 
to poor driving or lack of attention to my engine.  Even on the longest 
climbs, the oil temperature never got above 240deg.  Even on the fastest 
runs, in 3rd or 4th gear, I never got the engine above 4300rpm.  Oil 
pressure stayed strong at 30-40psi all day long.

Perhaps this is just another rite of passage in my immersion into VW culture 
-- the roadside breakdown and its eventual on-the-fly repair.  Thanks again 
to all the listees who offered help and advice.  I'll be checking my E-mail 
at least once a day until Thursday, and I'll keep you all posted as the saga 
continues.

Take care and thanks again,

Jason Upper
