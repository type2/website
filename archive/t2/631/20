The Bus seat tracks were changed sometime in '76, if my memory serves me
correctly (which it doesn't always do... could be '75...).  The Vanagon
seats will fit directly into a Bus with the later style seat tracks.
However, if you use a Vanagon GL seat (which has armrests), you may have
trouble getting the outside armrest to clear the door (certainly on a Westy,
not sure about a passenger bus). Fortunately the armrest can be removed if
desired.
