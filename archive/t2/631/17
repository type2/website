Subject: Re: [T2] 72 fuel line diagram

On a stock mechanical fuel pump, on a 72, there should be three "lines" 
visible. One from the tank, one to the carb(s) and a small line about 2 
inches long. This is a  line to get air for the pump and should be there and 
not connected to anything.

If you are finding gas on the passenger side away from the tank I would 
check the filler tube. Take the round inspection cover off in the inside of 
the engine compartment and have a look. There is currently no aftermarket 
replacement...check the archives for solutions.
