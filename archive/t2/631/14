Subject: 72 fuel line diagram

If you've noticed from the past, I've had my '72 bus for a year now and still
haven't been able to drive it.  I fix one thing and then another thing is
screwed up.  I'm totally clueless so I'm learning as I go with help from
bentley and muir and you guys.

Anyhow, my question is this:  After filling my tank for the first time, I
notcied that I had a significant fuel leak.  When I got under the right side
of the bus, I noticed that one of the lines coming off of the fuel pump was
only about 4 inches long and not connected to anything.  I hadn't noticed it
because it ran through that 1' by 1' metal cover plate.  Any ideas what that
line should be connected to?  Like I said, I'm so clueless with all of this
and you guys are my teachers.  Also, does anybody have a detailed fuel line
diagram for a '72?

 Paul
