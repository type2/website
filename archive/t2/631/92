Listen to Greg. Although I did run a beetle muffler on my other 71 Westy for 
awhile and I did get it to clear the bumper with any hacking, exaust comes 
inside.

The bus muffler is needed for exaust to go out side. When it goes straight 
back it gets sucked into rear hatch.

I know it's temping to get a beetle one, they are cheaper.....and I don't 
believe about the engine "breathing better" with a beetle exaust. Get the 
right one.
