Subject: Re: [T2] engine tin bolt

if i am correct and am not sure that i am it is nothing more than a tin screw that goes there but it screws in from the bottom not the top...
there is a bolt already on the top of the tin where the seem is.... you have to screw the tin screw in from the bottom and it will thread... but then again this is if i am talking about the same place as you are...?

hey yall,

i am missing the bolt for the engine tin. i noticed this today and the belt 
is wearing the paint off the tin. the one that missing sits to right of 
middle between the pulleys. looking at the engine, it sits a little below 
the belt. anyone know what size of bolt this needs?

all help greatly appreciated,

patrick
