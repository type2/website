Subject: [T2]Vanagon  Seats on a spinner in a Late Bay

As I said before, I have had vanagon seats in my bus for years....

I just got a "spinner" last weekend..

Is this just a bolt in application???
Should I use "grade 8" bolts???
Do I need to "cut out" the stock rails????

Will I have "full spin" ( 360 deg) ?????

Thanks
