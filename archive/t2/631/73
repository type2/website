Just from looking at the wiring diagram I would bet the problem was in the
headlight switch.  This is the only common contact point for the
headlights and the instrument lights.  Download the appropriate wiring
diagram for your year from the library and check that the wires to the
switch match those on the diagram.

OOK!
