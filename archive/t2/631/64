Subject: Re: [T2] turning engine over w/o alternater

Hi Kyle,

Yes, and Yes. As I recall we're talking about a manual transmission 
late-bay, correct?

When the engine is in the bus, you can use the starter to turn it over.

When the engine is out of the bus, you can use a bell housing from a 
transmission, bolt up a starter and you're good to go,
...or you use a large screwdriver to turn the teeth of the flywheel 
using one of the engine studs as a pivot  for leverage.


Happy trails,
