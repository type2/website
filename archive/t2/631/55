Subject: Dash Lights

Hello All,

Last night for the first time since I bought my bus last spring, I had
occasion to use the high-beams. Lo and behold, my dash lights all came
on when the high-beams were on. Since buying the van, I assumed that the
bulbs were shot and hand not been replaced. Now I know that to not be
the case, but I am trying to figure out what's up. Has anyone else
encountered this, or have any ideas on how to fix it?
