Kyle, I know you were mismatching a lot of stuff, but when you pull the 
bellhousing back off to try and turn the engine by hand check the operation 
of the starter.

Also the starter needs to match the flywheel you are using. I think a '74 
starter with a '78 flywheel is a no go. Also vise versa. Automatic Bus 
starters will not do it either.
