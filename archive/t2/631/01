Subject: RE: [T2] Seats from Vanagon in Late Bay

I have '78 "westfakia" with '82 vanagon seats...

I LOVE THEM!!!!!

My bus was originally a "deluxe" so I have them there "air channels" on my
doors, so I had to remove the "out side" arm rest on each side...

I just got a "spinner" a little while ago, for the passenger seat, not
installed yet

As far as mods to get them to fit....
uhhh grease....
and a beer... bus work always goes better with a beer...

Anyone have experience putting vanagon (or any other) seats with armrests in
their late bay?
