Paul, the tube just 'drains' into the hole in the lower cover plate.  It does not connect to anything and does not carry fuel.
Fuel lines go from tank to pump- then pump through breast plate to carbs via tee and possible regulator.

Anyhow, my question is this: After filling my tank for the first time, I
notcied that I had a significant fuel leak. When I got under the right side
of the bus, I noticed that one of the lines coming off of the fuel pump was
only about 4 inches long and not connected to anything. I hadn't noticed it
because it ran through that 1' by 1' metal cover plate. Any ideas what that
line should be connected to? Like I said, I'm so clueless with all of this
and you guys are my teachers. Also, does anybody have a detailed fuel line
diagram for a '72?
