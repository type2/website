Subject: Part id help

I discovered a shed full of old parts while working on a old right away for the phone company. I did find a steering wheel with no cracks at all just a few chips for a split bus.
It appears to be a light gray color. I also found some other body panels and they had VW stickers on them still with part numbers. They may be bug,bus, or porsche parts. Not sure. Here are the number and any help would be great. If you need any of this stuff let me know.
801 821 301D -looks like a rear quarter of some kind
241 837 605A- a vent window of some kind was in a vw box
211 805 333 -looks like a bus inner panel for the nose
?18 809 021F looks like a bug inner panel
I also found a rear panel for a early bug that goes roofline including window frame to the door pillar all the way to the rear. It is also a vw panel never used. 
There is also some kind of nose piece from a porsche or ghia. Just the left half. Also never installed panel. 
Any help ID these parts would be great.
