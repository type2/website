Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust for Type 2's

Hi Brian,

Find another store.

The beetle exhaust will bolt up, but you will find that the pea-shooter 
pipes collide with your back bumper. If you cut or remove the bumper 
you will still have another problem... Exhaust fumes will not go into 
the slipstream of the bus and instead will linger in a low-pressure 
pocket of air that follows the bus. These fumes may then enter the cab 
through the rear hatch seal or through the heater box air inlets. The 
original bus muffler routes the exhaust to the side of the bus to 
ensure that the fumes are deposited into the slipstream and don't risk 
the health of the driver or passengers.


Happy trails,
