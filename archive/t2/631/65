Subject: Engine Wiring Harness

Hey guys,

    I apologize for a "double post", but I posted about 2 months back about needing a new engine compartment wiring harness. I had gotten some good responses but my computer crashed and I lost all the saved e-mails.

What I was looking for perhaps is a new or real good condition replacement. I couldn't find any retailer that would sell me a new one, but maybe I just wasn't looking in the right place. If I can't find a brand new one, I fully intend to get one from Busted Bus. Everything that I've ever gotten from there has always been of the best quality... but, if I can get one that's brand new, I would prefer it.

Does anyone know who I might be able to purchase one from?

My 1973 Bus originally came with a 1700 and dual carburetors (I think??)

Right now it's an 1800 with hydraulic lifters, 2-bbl webber progressive with electric choke, Bosch mechanical advance distributor, etc. 

I really would like to replace ALL the wiring in the Bus. The wiring is shot. The car sat for many many years. Actually, it was originally owned by some strange people that lived out in the country, and then was purchased by a local small airport and used to ferry passengers to and from their cars, and then it was used by an airplane mechanic, and then it sat behind a hanger for about 6-7 years. THEN my friend got it, and it sat in his back yard for another 2 years, THEN he finally painted it, did all the body work, installed the windshield... that cracked, so he got mad and then stored it in his garage for another 3-4 years. I finally bought it last year, and have slowly been replacing everything.

(Longest sentence in the world)

Any help would be.... helpful.


Thanks!

Todd
