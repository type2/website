Subject: Re: [T2] Seats from Vanagon in Late Bay

Mine came out of an '83 aircooled Vanagon I think. I think any of the Vanagon seats work though. Newer is nicer because they refined the seats a bit along the way. 

Alternatives: Anything out of a rear engined or midengined car. Many of those are low enough to the floor that thry should allow your legs under the wheel. 914, MR2, Fiero, Porsche, etc. etc. 

You will of course have to figure out a mounting system. May be as simple as drilling holes in the floor, maybe as complicated as transplanting the slider mechanism from your OEM seat to the junkyard seat. MIG welder is your friend...
