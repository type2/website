Subject: '70 camper available for parts in santa cruz

If you live near Santa Cruz, CA, this guy is selling his bus for parts (the
whole thing). See pics at bottom of page:

I feel for this person. I also feel for the fact that I can't pay towing for
that great a distance to my place, or I would snatch it. Damn.
