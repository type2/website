BTW, when I did my seats I could never find the sisal padding that went
between the cushion and the seat material so I reused it.  At the time, what I
located was always for carpets and too thick. I was at OSH the other day and
found some felt made from reclaimed fibres (like the original) in a suitably
thin size.
