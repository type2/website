Subject: Note to self: Phosphoric Acid

We all know how great products like Metal Ready and Prep & Prime and
other phosphoric acid based products stop rust and get the metal ready
for POR15 or whatever.

I used the Prep & Prime on the floor of my bus. Foamed up, turned the
rust black and all that good kind of stuff.

So I was getting ready to install the jumpseat and realized the nuts
and bolts were rusty as well as the brackets. I tossed them into a
baby food jar and filled with Prep & Prime just enough to cover the
pieces - about half way. I had my 13 year old with me to show how the
phosphoric acid reacts with iron oxide. Foamed up a bit and was cool.
We had a discussion about the chemistry involved and went our merry
way. Jar left out on patio.

I went back outside a few minutes later to smoke and the stuff had
foamed all over the toolchest it was setting on and creating a big
puddle. OOPS!!!

I cleaned it up with a rag, and folded up another rag to set the still
foaming jar on. I guess we'll get to see tomorrow just what Prep &
Prime does to a plastic tool chest.

NOTE TO SELF: Don't trust chemistry to do what you THINK it will do!
