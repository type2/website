Having a toggle switch in between would be nice.

Yes, and also with a toggle switch.

I missed the earlier thread...why do you need to run the alternator for the test the engine?

For the starter you need to provide postive to terminal 30 and negative to a very good ground like the transmission case. I used jumper cables. Then to activate the starter just bridge terminal 50 with 30 temporarily.

In my photo you can see the jumper cables and the remorte starter switch.
