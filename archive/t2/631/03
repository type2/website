Subject: RE: [T2] Seats from Vanagon in Late Bay

Yep bought a set on the web, had them shipped to me, and the slid right in. No tools, no cuss words. 

They sit a slight bit higher than the stock seats. Maybe 1/2". 

LOTS more comfortable. I always wondered WHY VW seats were SO bad for the first 30 years or so... I have driven alot of cheap European cars and none - not even the lowly Fiat 500 - had seats as bad as my VWs... 

But, once the 80's rolled around they go ALOT better.
