Thanks to all for the multiple responses!  Sounds like we have some
differences of opinion (or memory)  :-)

Gowesty - Says will fit 76 - 79 with no qualifiers (but that's just the web
site).
Ron - Tracks were changed mid 76 (could be 75).  Will fit later style...
Jason - ..... '78 seat rails are the same ....'76  are not.  I investigated
this option...my early 76 seat rails are visibly different from later busses.
Chris - Using them in a 78
Bob - Using them in a 78

Sooooooo... Sounds like a 76 mid-year change is likely but 78 is a definite
fit.

Anyone with a 78 willing to take a picture of the bottom of their seat &
tracks so I can compare to my 76?
It would be great to make sure they work before I bother to track some down.
Thanks again for all the imput.  This sounds like a good one for the library
once we nail it down.
Mike

Jason - What's your VIN?
