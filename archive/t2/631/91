Subject: Stars Wars DVD set, Curtains

The new DVD trilogy special edition of Star Wars has a Bonus disc of
documentary's and stuff.  On the documentary, when they talk about and
show the early workings of Industrial Light and Magic, there is a fairly
long shot of the parking lot.  Surprise! The lot is slam full of Busses
and Beetles, but more busses were visible.


I bought a 73 bus in CT and drove it back to Southwest Virginia a few
weeks ago (gasp! buying a bus unseen and trusting it to get 600 miles to
its new home safely, and for $1300!).  This bus has what looks like tracks
for sliders along all the side and rear windows.  I was wondering someone
has a set of plans or dimensions for each curtain?  I have the windshield
curtain with snaps, but I need all the others.  Any help would be
appreciated!

Thanks,
