Subject: RE: [T2] Exhaust for Type 2's

The P.O. of Freidrich put a bugpack muffler and bug exhaust header on my
bus.  Can't wait to get it off.  Sure it works great, but since I don't have
an apron, the exhaust setup is considerably lower than my rear bumper and
looks terrible.  Works great but no clearance.  Also makes it interesting
when backing into a parking spot.  When I first got Freidrich with his
nonstandard exhaust I was still used to Krista with her stock setup.
Whacked that muffler a few times backing up.  If going to a bug muffler and
exhaust header be aware that ground clearance may be an issue.  My exhausts
days are numbered as I have no intention of letting it fail before I replace
it.  I personally want to fully enjoy the nice clearance of a late bay.
Something to watch for anyway if you are considering putting a beetle
exhaust setup on your bus.
