Subject: Brake servo for a '71

Hi,

I have a 71 camper, and  I every time I step on the brake the engine races.  
I am assuming the there is a vacuum leak some where in the braking system.  I 
have replaced the tubling from the manifold to the brake servo and from the 
servo to somewhere into the inside of the wall?

I am still having the same problem.  I guesing the servo is bad?  Any 
thoughts?  Is the servo easy to rebuild if necessary?
