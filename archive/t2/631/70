Subject: fresh air tubes (was - cheap muffler)

When using the style of header shown in the link below, I have found that a
hole gets burned through the flexible aluminum fresh air tubes where the
tube passes close to the header. Is there a way of preventing this or do I
just plan on replacing the tubes on a regular basis?

Thanks,

| For type 1 engines, I recommend the Quiet One (header and muffler kit)
sold

| quiet, not too loud, good throaty sound. it is a single quiet pack design
