I bought a pair of captain's seats from a local RV'er who'd upgraded his RV
and didn't need the older seats.  I thought that they would be neat
replacements for the missing front passenger seat and completely shot
driver's seat in my bus.

One little problem.  They were too tall to fit. :O(

So, we went without for some time.  Then I took a long look at the seats and
realized that the sliding/rotating base came off of the captain's seats.
Hmm...

With the bases off, the seats fit without my hitting my head on the roof of
the bus.  I had to drill four holes to accept the hold down bolts, but the
holes all missed the original brackets on the seat bases.  I can retrofit to
vanagon or other VW seats later.

The new seats are a little high.  If I wasn't almost 6' tall, I might not be
able to get the clutch pedal down enough to shift.  But we now have almost
"new" seats, reclining and with adjustable lumbar support.  Have to duck
sometimes to see traffic lights and I have only a few inches between me and
the steering wheel, but at least my butt is happy.

I had to remove the outer arm rests because of the aforementioned air duct
along the doors.  I've though about removing the ducts to let me re-install
the arms.  I'd much rather replace these seats with vanagon seats, but
haven't found a set at a good price yet.
