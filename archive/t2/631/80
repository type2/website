Aluminum roof flashing from Home Despot. Or I can mail you a piece big
enough for this.

Just find a way to fit it between the header and air tube. Or wrap it
around the tube. I dunno if HiTemp RTV would be able to handle the
heat, JBWeld should work though...

I need to go buy some more so I can use a large piece to shield the
gap in my tin seal right above the muffler (can't get the foam seal in
there because the rear is pushed in 5" from the DPO backing into
something).
