Subject: Pirates of Silicone Valley

Since this is Friday, I thought I would mention that I watched Pirates of Silicone Valley (or is it Silicon?) a couple of nights ago. There isn't a single street or road scene that doesn't have at least one air-cooled Volkswagen in it. Specifically appropriate to this list, there is a scene when they are still in college at Berkley, and the police are searching their Westfalia camper van for drugs and other stuff. They find some "black" boxes or whatever they're called and toss them back into the van. 

Pretty cool. You can buy the movie on VHS or V-CD, but apparently they don't sell it on DVD?
