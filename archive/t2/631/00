Subject: Re: [T2] Bolt & Nut Sizes

Hi Folks,

Trying to "work smarter not harder," I removed the locknut on the one 
parking brake cable I have left and tested it on the first bolt I could 
find.  It turns out that the size & thread pitch is the same as that of 
engine tin screws -- metric M6x12mm.  So, I'm off to visit Homer DePot for 
some nuts & bolts that match.  I'm also going to replace the 1/2" SAE bolts 
& nuts I'm using for my muffler -- M8 or M10 bolts with 12mm heads seem to 
work fine...

To recap:
- parking brake locknuts are the same ones as your engine tin nuts, just a 
different shape.
- SAE hardware has NO REASON to be on your Bus, especially if you have no 
SAE tools!

Thanks to all who posted replies.
