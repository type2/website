Subject: RE: [T2] Rear Wheel Not Turning

They are weird. I bet the shoe assemply isn't right somehow, I had to play 
with mine forever to get it right. Maybe it's too far adjusted in and needs 
to come out a bit to clear? Is wheel bearing flush? Is your other one 
together to look and use as a reference? Can you post a pic of it?
