Subject: Re: [T2] Seats from Vanagon in Late Bay

My wife and I just finished re-stuffing our original seat bottoms.  

After I took the seat bottoms apart - we (she) first washed the seat bottoms
then she did some re-sewing on the seams of the seats then I reinforced a
couple of spots on the vinyl.

We purchased rubberized hair, cotton duck (to cover the hair), 1/2 inch foam
rubber and bonded polyester batting from Beacon Fabric - total cost of
stuffing (including shipping) was about $45. http://www.beaconfabric.com

We just finished rebuilding the seat bottoms and put them back in the bus -
boy are they comfortable.  Not sure how long the original fabric is going to
last though.
