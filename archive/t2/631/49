Subject: Re: [T2] Seats from Vanagon in Late Bay

Hi Michael,

There is one thing that hasn't been mentioned yet... Vanagon seats are 
almost an inch taller than the baywindow seats.

If you're real tall, it might be a problem. Or for that matter...if 
you're really short, you might not be able to reach the pedals. ;-)



Happy trails,
