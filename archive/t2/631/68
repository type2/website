Subject: updating my buses dash board........

Hi Volks,


On Monday I took apart the dash of my '89 Jetta GLI. I found, as with most
things in my VW's that it was surprisingly uncomplicated.

Al most every thing is self contained in the gauge cluster..

So here is my question: why can I NOT put this gauge cluster in to my
bus???? It seems to me I could just match up stuff and be good to go!!!

Notes: what each contain:

Key:
S:	Stock
NS:	not stock, but I have
Y:	Yes
N:	no

			BUS	Jetta
Speedometer		Y	Y
Tach			NS	S
Turn sig		Y	Y
Alt			Y	Y
Oil P light		Y	Y
High beam		Y	Y
Multi F Comput	N	Y	this is primary reason I want to do this.
Gas gauge		Y	Y
Clock			NS	Y (in MFC)


Thanks
