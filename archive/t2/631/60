baby food jar and filled with Prep & Prime just enough to cover the
pieces - about half way. I had my 13 year old with me to show how the
phosphoric acid reacts with iron oxide. Foamed up a bit and was cool.
We had a discussion about the chemistry involved and went our merry

Got a battery charger? Attach the positive lead to a scrap stain-
less steel fork and the negative lead to the object (nut, bolt, etc.)
Dip both in a mild solution of washing soda (Arm and Hammer, for
example) and watch the rust leave the object... 8-)
