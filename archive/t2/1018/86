It's mostly my fault for the low mpg, I can't keep my foot out of it!  I got
19 once, but it usually is 12-13.  Funny how you loose the desire to drive
the freeways when you have actual G-forces!  In a bus no less!

It's bug IRS with the early 901 5spd.  There will be some pics in the photo
section.

I am thinking more along the lines of 25 gallons and more.  I'd like to go
more than 325 miles when needed.

Hi Mark,

EB was a treat!  Not sure I can be in the area again this year, but  
look forward to it again now that I am on the Right coast a lot.

  Rennie, you running a small nut tranny w/ reduction boxes on that  
monster? grin
