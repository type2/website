You don't have to remove the alt stand nuts.

Be sure to carefully remove any shims from the front (FIF) side of the fan
before pulling the generator out.  Otherwise there is a chance that they
will be lost in the shroud

Replace the lower two shroud screws with hex head cap screws to make
future removal easier.  If you have trouble with them a tiny vise-grip
works wonders.
