OMG, can you imagine?!  How 'bout a mountainous region trans!

It's mostly my fault for the low mpg, I can't keep my foot out of it!  I got
19 once, but it usually is 12-13.  Funny how you loose the desire to drive
the freeways when you have actual G-forces!

It's bug IRS with the early 901 5spd.  There will be some pics up soon.

I am thinking more along the lines of 25 gallons and more.  I'd like to go
more than 325 miles when needed.
