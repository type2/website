Subject: Free Pop Top and Luggage Rack 

I have a Westy pop top and luggage rack for '68-'73, in good shape.
They are free to the first person to come pick them up. Located in PA,
zip is 18054.  Only catch is they need to be picked up on or before
Saturday 12/29.  If interested, please pmail me directly to make
arrangements (sheridan15(-at-)comcast.net).
