I looked farther on the site (Kyle Automotive). Looks like they can make a full repro with my core. 
Cool Beans!

Hi all,

Does anyone know where I can find and if I can find a
NEW wiring harness for a 76 engine? I just need the
engine compartment harness. If a new one is no longer
available is there any place I can find plans on how
to make one myself???

2 things:

1) Do you have an early or a late 76 engine?

Totally different harness's between them. An easy way to tell is to look at
your plug on the AFM.
6 terminals = early 76 and 75
7 terminals = late 76 and 77 and 78

2) The choices are good used or big bucks here:

IF you have your old harness to give them 1st. However, the page I sent is
for the late 76 engine.
