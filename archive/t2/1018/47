Only if you are spraying a concrete block IMNSHO.
   
  I have a Sharpe HVLP, one of their original SGF gravity feed guns (not the current Cobalt but I've sprayed it as well and it seems the same, just apparently cheaper from a manufacturing POV), and I too have a Binks 7.  I have written about both on the list for years, see my "color sanding" bit on type2.com.  I consistently spray a superior finish with the Sharpe and have relegated the Binks to primer duty (sad actually.)  I have sprayed a number of top end HVLP guns, Accuspray, a SATA of some sort, a number of turbine systems.  The turbines spray dry and with orange peel for me and for their owners that have tinkered with them for years in the case of one of my friends.  But I at least have no problem spraying to a smooth, glossy, no orange peel finish with my SGF, spraying primarilly PPG and Valspar catalyzed acryllic enamel or single stage urethanes.  YMMV of course.  And I did/do love my Binks BTW, I bought it in high school in the 80's when I did some part time at a
 local body shop.  BUT, I use less material and have less on the garage walls with the SGF, it is real and noticeable.  I did not think this would be the case when I bought it BTW, I was suspicious and pessimistic (me?) but got a great mispriced deal on it at the time.  It is hard to beat an old Binks or Sharpe suction gun off ebay for the price if condition looks OK, and rebuild stuff is still available for most top end guns, but the Sharpe Cobalt is I think under $200 and that would be my first choice.

Do yourself a favor and locate a Binks 7, a Devilbis , or Sharpe suction
gun.

HVLP are EPA friendly, but lay the paint on so it looks like concrete
block.
