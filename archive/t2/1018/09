Subject: Where is my I.D. tag on my 77 Westy?

I just spent half an hour hanging upside down under my dash looking for the id
tag. I couldn't see it anywhere. I have a Canadian market 77 Westy and want to
know what color orange I have. I THINK it's chrome yellow L20A but there seems
to be another orange color out there that is close.
Is that ID tag on the drivers or passengers side and just where abouts???
Thanks,
Courtney
