Subject: What type of paint is original on our Bays??

Just wondering what was the original type of paint on our westies? I'm
thinking it was single stage enamel? Anyone know for sure. Was it Spies Hecker
paint? Would appreciate any pro help on this, as I don't know if later paints
are compatible? I've been reading that spraying over lacquer paints can cause
all kinds of grief. I'm looking at the Sherwin Williams "Western" brand of
paint called HiGlo which is still available in L21H Chrome Yellow. It is a
single stage paint.
Thanks,
Courtney
