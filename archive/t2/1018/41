Subject: Engine\transmission

I drive a 1970 Bus with a 1600cc engine and well for my 44th birthday I received transmission that will not go into gearb&  

 

I am planning to pull the engine and take a look at the clutch \ transmission to see if I can fix it.  

 

Being a Computer tech not a mechanic I'm really hesitant.   Ibd like to ask a few questions of you all b

 

1.	I have the VW green service manual (Bus Bible) is this enough to get me through the process?  Chap 5 section 3
2.	I plan to take \ photograph \ label as much as I can remember b any other suggestions?
3.	What tools do I need b I have a basic took kit b Any special tools needed?
4.	I know I need a jack\lift to pull the engine out with b what will that coast and should the local shops have them?
5.	If itbs the clutch ( I pray) what am I looking for?  How hard is it to fix?
6.	If itbs the trans b what am I looking for? What should one run me to replace?
7.	And for moral support - do you think I can do it?

I've done everything on the Bus except work on the engine and transmission.   Brakes \ tie rods \ some interior - exterior work and so on...  I really appriciate and look forward to your input as I'm not to sure about this - 

 

I ask for your prayers

 

Much thanks - Michael
