Subject: Two months and counting... The True Canadian Winter Bus

Hi Volks,

It may be cold and dreary here in the frozen tundra, but even here in  
the frozen wastelands there are still some brave bus-owning souls who  
feel the need to camp.

YES, The TCWBC will be happening once again in 2008. The FIFTH ANNUAL  
is an event you just won't want to miss.

It'll be held at Valens Conservation Area on Saturday, February 16th,  
starting at noon. If you're completely incapable of camping outside  
in winter but still crave attention from other frozen bus-a-haulics  
then I might point out that there are several motels within 15  
minutes of the campground, and you will still be welcome at the  
campfire.

All the details you could ever want, including GPS coordinates and  
google earth bookmarks are available online at

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
