I've started my research on my issue and it was suggested to take a look at the throwout forks - they may be broken -
 
I've been looking online and in my manual and have not found a reference to it - could there be another name for it?  I've found references to throw out bearings...  is that the Clutch release bearing?
 
Sorry for my inexperience in the matter.
