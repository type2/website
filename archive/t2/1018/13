Subject: L20A and L21H are the same Chrome Yellow?? & HVLP guns.

Anyone figured out why these two numbers are the same? I just looked them up
and they are both called Chrome Yellow in English. Strange they'd have two
numbers for the same color? I also discoverd that Sherwin Williams Western
division still makes this color in a single stage paint called HiGlo or HiGlo
3.5 . Interesting. Now I know what I'll be using after I do the bodywork this
summer. I have purchased an HVLP gun from EPay that has gotten good reviews
from a couple of the hotrod sites. It's supposedly made by Cal-Hawk or CTT in
China, but is a Sata clone. It comes with both 2.0 and 1.4 tips to spray
primer and basecoat. Oh boy, now I get to learn another new thing, which is
what life is all about! Knowledge!
Regards,
Courtney
