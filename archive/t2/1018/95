Subject: 1970 Bus Turn Signal Wiring

Good Evening Everyone,

I'm a newbie to the Bus world, but have had a 1971 Beetle for a few years
now.  I recently got a 1970 Bus, and have been trying to get the signals and
lights put back in it, but I have run into a problem.  My driver's side turn
signal has only one brown and white wire with a big connector at the end and
a small connector halfway down, running down to the socket, the others
aren't there.  I've checked the wiring diagram and tried to look at the
harness under the dash to find the missing wires.  It looks like there
aren't any that are disconnected.  Is there a way to get just a turn signal
wiring loom, or an easy way to take the whole dash apart to find the missing
wires?
