Subject: Re: [T2] Removing stock "heat exchangers"

Hi Sid,

Porsche also used heat exchangers in the 914.

I think what you're looking for is a pair of 411/412 heat exchangers.  
Those are just metal boxes attatched to the header pipes; no fins  
were cast onto the pipes. Cut off the boxes and you are good to go.


Happy Trails,

Hi, On my '74 Westy, 1.8, I am going to remove the stock 'exhaust/

in their
914, granted, there is a lot more 'Cabin" area in the Westy, but small
increments from the "parent company", might be buildable upon, eh?
