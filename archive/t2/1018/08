Hi Mark,   


The 72 bus doesn't have the removable apron, so Irvin will be pulling the  
engine out from the bottom. But  that's OK, the PDSIT carbs will drop  down 
without being removed; though it's a good idea to unscrew the (NLA) fuel  shutoff 
solenoids from the carbs beforehand to prevent them from being  damaged.



Happy Trails,


Greg Potts

and even the late bays with a type 1 engine in there  as  europe would have , do 
have plenty of room to allow the carbs to stay on.and  remove the engine.  
later  mark d .
