Subject: Batteries that fit in the later Bay Bus

Looking at batteries with the Positive terminals on the right side,
largest that would fit in the tray-(11.6"long, 7" wide, up to 8.5" to 
the top...took a while to find listing of which side the Pos terminal 
is. The recc. stock Vanagon is group 41 at 552 cubic in.  A larger 
volume should allow more reserve capacity?

Of these, the 36R looks promising (615 cubic in) as does 63 and 98R 
(about 580 c in)-
Anyone know what "cars" the 36R, 63, and 98R fit?
