Subject: Happy Christmas

The Meyer family wants to wish all of you a very wonderful Christmas and New
Year. On a personal note, I would like to thank all of you who have been so
instrumental in putting up with my stupid questions and helping me on my
quest to keep my darling Zoey running smooth. Thank you to you all from the
sub-cockles of my heart.

Remember that the next time your little hut seems to be burning to the
ground.  It just may be a smoke signal that summons the help
you need.
