The part number would be more like 021 127 025 or 021 127 025 A.  They're
probably unavailable.  I think in the 24 years selling parts, I've not sold
more than 5 of those.

Wow. I just checked all the places I usually shop and a few I never
buy from, and I cannot locate a mechanical fuel pump for a type IV bus
engine.
Correct me if I'm wrong, folks, but I think the part number is 021 013
001A (http://tinyurl.com/27ovo5).
What are the symptoms? Sometimes if the pump just won't pump or won't
pump enough is is due to a worn push rod. I think you can still get
your hands on those. Also the wrong gasket (too thick) can cause the
same problem.
Good luck!
