Subject: early heat boxes/late heads--which gaskets?

I am installing earlier heater boxes/manifolds ('72-'74) on a '77 2.0 engine to get rid of all of those troublesome and leaking flanges.
Which copper gaskets should I use to mate the manifolds to the heads?? The '72-'74 style or the?'75-'78?
Thanks,
Greg

resurrecting them one at a time...?
