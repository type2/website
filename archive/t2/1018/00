For low revs the speed is smaller but the diameter is bigger and you  
send more fuel so you don't loose any power.
Boring the venturi is an efficient way to improve the 34 pict perfs.  
Such mods (29mm venturi+some other things) were sold in Europe under  
the name "Simcox" and they prooved to be efficient.
That said I'm far to be a carb guru, I've just started to read about  
it last week :)

In the mean time you have to increase the size of both jets. I tried  
to mount 160/60 jets on a stock carb with the choke blocked off and it  
works well on a very cold motor.
Of course 160 and 60 are far too big for a stock carb, even for an  
improved 34 pict it's too much (iirc 145/55 are a good compromise),   
but you get the idea: more fuel => no need for a choke => remove the  
choke plate => more flow

I completely agree with you, but it looks nicer. On the other hand  
smoothing the sharp angles around the plate should reduce the flow  
disturbance it causes.

My wife knows enough about the motor to notice it :)
