Subject: RE: [T2] Engine\transmission

I forgot to add...
when replacing an engine in my bus this summer, we ended up having to buy a
motorcycle  jack. this is the one we got, and it made the job so easy it was
embarrasing. It was 85 dollars then and I would strongly recommend it. (

)

 The dual port 1600 and transmission are both easily done with a rolling floor
jack ( http://www.harborfreight.com/cpi/ctaf/displayitem.taf?Itemnumber=91039
) you want the type with like a 5" or bigger jack point. not the small ones
they sell for like 50 bucks in auto parts stores with the 2" jacking point (so
much harder to balance the engine/tranny)
