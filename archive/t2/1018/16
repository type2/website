Subject: Front suspension snubber retainers

Anybody know of a source (or a replacement for) the front suspension snubber retaining clips?? The '77 I'm working on was missing all of the snubbers and retainers, and I haven't seen them available anywhere.? I bought new snubbers, but I have no clips to keep them on the bus.
I wouldn't mind replacing them with something non original.? Just need something that works.
Also, I have run across a sunroof bay that has some collision damage in the front, but is otherwise pretty decent.? How common were these buses?? I'm thinking of buying and repairing it.? 
Are the sunroofs a pain in the a$$, or are they pretty reliable as far as the cables, seals, and sliders go?
Thanks,
Greg
