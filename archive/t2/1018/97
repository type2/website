Hey Bob,
I'm looking at the diagram right now - there should be five wires going 
to the ignition - RED, BLACK, BLACK/YELLOW, GRAY/BLACK, and BLACK/RED.

If you look at the diagram, you'll see the RED wire that comes down from 
the top of S8, goes to S9, and then connects to a RED/WHITE wire that 
goes to the other terminal of the starter that connects to the battery. 
  This RED wire is the +12v feed to the ignition.

Now, on the far left side of the ignition wiring diagram, you'll see the 
BLACK/RED wire that goes from the momentary contact of the starter to 
the solenoid of the starter.

Connect the RED and BLACK/RED wires momentarily to start the engine.

Hope that helps!
Mike
