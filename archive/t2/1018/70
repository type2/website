Subject: Which year Bays had a fluorescent light??

My 77 Westy has a two position incandescent light assembly over the sink. I
remember my other 4 Westy's over the last 20 yrs. of having fluorescents (I
think). After hitting my 50's, I've come down with CRS I think, and can't
remember s***. Does anyone know the answer to this, and does anyone have one
kicking around they'd like to sell?
Thanks,
Courtney
