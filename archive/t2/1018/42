It should serve you well.  I like to have the Idiot book around for karma,
though!  :)

Always a good idea.  A roll of masking tape, a sharpie marker, and some
ziplock baggies for small parts is good.  Don't forget to pull the thottle
cable out before dropping the engine!

A floor jack or transmission jack makes removing the engine/transmission
easier.  You will want to remove them as a unit.  The only "special" tool
you will need is the triple-square driver for the CV joints.

will that coast and should the local shops have them?

I use a cheapo floor jack from Harbor Freight with a foot-square piece of
1" plywood attached.

Give us some symptoms before you start and we'll help diagnose.

Once the engine/trans if off, very easy.  Follow the book's instructions,
but be sure that you have the early or late style parts. They don't mix!
Don't depend upon the year of your bus to determine whether you have early
or late parts as engines/trannys get swapped between years.

Figure about $600 for a good rebuild, but cross that bridge when you come
to it.

> 7.	And for moral support - do you think I can do it?

Absolutely yes.  Nothing mysterious about the clutch, though I leave the
gearbox internals to the pros.
