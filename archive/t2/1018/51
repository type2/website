Subject: Re: [T2] Rebuild kits for 72-74 Type 4 mechanical fuel pumps ?

I agree that worn parts can cause trouble,,  it is amazing how about 5
thousands of an inch can make a difference...
When my carb engine stopped from low fuel pressure,, I took out a gasket,, put
it back together,, and found there was 5 psi  !

so I sanded the thickness off the intermediate block.. and put the gaskets
back in.

I assume there was some wear ,, maybe the camshaft,  and or the push rod,, and
or the fuel pump arm.... it all added up to no pressure.

  What are the symptoms? Sometimes if the pump just won't pump or won't
  pump enough is is due to a worn push rod. I think you can still get
  your hands on those. Also the wrong gasket (too thick) can cause the
  same problem.
