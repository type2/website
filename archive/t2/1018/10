Subject: Re: [T2] Where is my I.D. tag on my 77 Westy?

Courtney asked:


 I just spent half an hour hanging upside down under my dash looking for the
id tag. I couldn't see it anywhere. I have a Canadian market 77 Westy and
want to know what color orange I have. I THINK it's chrome yellow L20A but
there seems to be another orange color out there that is close.
Is that ID tag on the drivers or passengers side and just where abouts???
------------------------------------------------------------------

It is on the drivers side, mounted on the tube. Very hard to see.

From here: http://www.type2.com/m-codes/

1977-1979. The plate is fixed on the left side of the fresh air pipe under
the dashboard. It is quite hard to read. It may help to put a piece of paper
on the plate and then rub it with a pencil. A Flashlight might also work.
