Hi Karl,

I'm gona have to take a look to see, but I'm sure it's gotta be a late 76 since I bought the OEM harness used from a juck yard 7 years ago. I didn't ask when I bought it cause I'm a VW newbie. I just wanted FI on 2ltr. So that's what they gave me. If I have an early 76 I guess I'll have to make a wiring harness.

Hi all,

Does anyone know where I can find and if I can find a
NEW wiring harness for a 76 engine? I just need the
engine compartment harness. If a new one is no longer
available is there any place I can find plans on how
to make one myself???

2 things:

1) Do you have an early or a late 76 engine?

Totally different harness's between them. An easy way to tell is to look at
your plug on the AFM.
6 terminals = early 76 and 75
7 terminals = late 76 and 77 and 78

2) The choices are good used or big bucks here:

IF you have your old harness to give them 1st. However, the page I sent is
for the late 76 engine.
