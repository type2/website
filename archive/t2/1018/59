Hi Rennie,

The baywindow tank holds 15 gallons. At 12 MPG that almost doubles  
your range. Sounds like an easy decision to me.

The big question is... Why is a 61 truck getting a mere 12MPG?  
Shouldn't it be closer to 20 than 10?


Happy Trails,

Since my crew cab is back running again, this problem immediately  
popped up
about 'miles per tank.'  My mpg runs around 12 and that gives me  
about 100
mile range before I start getting nervous.  I stopped 5 times just  
from LA
to SF!  I should add that is w/o gauge.

Has anyone found a tank that holds a lot more?  I've used bay window  
tanks
before, but I was hoping someone had come across a big, long, flat  
tank that
fits.  On my Baja trips, we used to take along 2 splittie tanks on  
the roof
rack.  CHP kinda frowns on that in the US!
