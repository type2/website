Courtney,

Do yourself a favor and locate a Binks 7, a Devilbis , or Sharpe suction
gun.

HVLP are EPA friendly, but lay the paint on so it looks like concrete
block.

I have both---
A Sata HLVP, and my 35 year old Binks 7.

If I want slick--and less time consumption on the other end of the job,
I spray with my 7.

I can see my reflection like a mirror as I'm laying the paint on.

The HVLP gun make the paint look like your in Alladin's Castle--the
house of funky mirrors, and cause you a bunch of labor wet sanding the
finish smooth.

Another excellent gun is a Binks 2001.

I have one of these on my Binks 2 gallon pressure pot.

It has a two ft.fan on the end of it and blow's paint like there's no
tomorrow--and slick---

Merry Christmas
