Hmmm, ok Terry, I actually HAVE an old Devilblis gun but thought it was "old 
school". Come to think of it though, "old school" WAS when they were 
painting my bus. :-)
You have a merry xmas too!

 Courtney,

 Do yourself a favor and locate a Binks 7, a Devilbis , or Sharpe suction
 gun.

 HVLP are EPA friendly, but lay the paint on so it looks like concrete
 block.

 I have both---
 A Sata HLVP, and my 35 year old Binks 7.

 If I want slick--and less time consumption on the other end of the job,
 I spray with my 7.

 I can see my reflection like a mirror as I'm laying the paint on.

 The HVLP gun make the paint look like your in Alladin's Castle--the
house of funky mirrors, and cause you a bunch of labor wet sanding the
 finish smooth.

 Another excellent gun is a Binks 2001.

 I have one of these on my Binks 2 gallon pressure pot.

 It has a two ft.fan on the end of it and blow's paint like there's no
 tomorrow--and slick---

 Merry Christmas
