Subject: Need carb linkage part

I bought a bus a while ago with dual Dellorto DRLA40s.? 
The carb setup was missing one linkage rod, the one that goes from the crossbar linkage to the carburetor - the short linkage with the swivel joint on each end.
I haven't been able to find a place where I can buy one of these short pieces.? Does anyone know of a source for this part?? (new or used)
It won't be long before I put the motor back in I'll need the linkage to run it.
Any help appreciated.
Thanks,
Greg
