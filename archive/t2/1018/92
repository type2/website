I'm trying to find a supplier for the plastic tube that goes from the Y shaped
rubber fitting on the air plenum to the deceleration valve on the firewall.
This is for my 1980 Vanagon.

When I replaced the engine a couple of years ago, I replaced all the rubber
bits like the Y thing. That Y now has a split in it where the plastic tube
fits in. I am suspicious that the tube is not the right size to fit in the Y.
Anyone out there with an 80-83 Vanagon, could you measure the outside diameter
of the tube so I can compare?
Thanks,
Tom
