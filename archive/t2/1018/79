Subject: Re: [T2] Which year Bays had a fluorescent light??

My previous '73 did NOT have the florescent light over the sink (had a
light with the same bulbs as the dome light, but with 3 bulbs), my '74
does have it and my previous '75 did as well. I think they started
putting them in the westy for the '74 model year, along with the later
style pop-top.
