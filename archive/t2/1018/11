Subject: type 1 alternator

Please refresh my memory...

I am looking at R&R a type 1 alternator in a 71 Bus.

iirc...

reach around the front of the shroud,, undo the 36mm nut on the fan
take off the alt stand nuts,,
remove the alt strap
remove the carb mounting nuts
remove the 4 shroud screws to the alt tin.

lift up on the alt,, pull the stand out of the way,, slip the alt up and out,,
leaving the fan behind

assuming the batt neg terminal is off,, and the wiring to the alt is
removed... etc

am I forgetting anything,,?

Thanks
Jamie Rivers
