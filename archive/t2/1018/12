Thanks to all, I found it behind the drivers seat, it is marked L21H. Now I
need to find what that means. :-)

  I seem to remember something about it being behind one of the seats. But
it's been awhile since I had to find it.

  I just spent half an hour hanging upside down under my dash looking for the
id tag. I couldn't see it anywhere. I have a Canadian market 77 Westy and want
to know what color orange I have. I THINK it's chrome yellow L20A but there
seems to be another orange color out there that is close.
  Is that ID tag on the drivers or passengers side and just where abouts???
  Thanks,
  Courtney
