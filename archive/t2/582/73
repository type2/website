power from the battery (via ignition switch) to the + & the green wire
from the distributor are all that it needs to run, if the carb has a
fuel cutoff solenoid you will need that powered too. I have always
just used the visual spark test like you have done to test spark.

What about the points? are they adjusted correctly?

it could just be a low battery.

at least it's consistant :)

could be. I'd double check the spark plug wire routing. if it's off
the engine will either not start or run horrible.

hang in there, it's something simple. Especially if it was running
well before the engine pull. Aside from the spark, did you verify if
you are getting fuel?
