Subject: RE: [T2] 1971 Westfalia: Which muffler? & Advice for

Hi David,

I grew up in Mass and drove several old cars, which I "creatively enhanced" 
in order to pass inspection.  Those were the old days before rolling 
emissions tests, and before stricter testing in general.  I used to go to 
one of the seedier gas stations closer to Boston -- someplace in 
Allston/Brighton, Roxbury, or South Boston -- where they didn't do as 
thorough a job of checking for pinhole rust, fogged lenses, wheel bearing 
tightness, horn operation, parking brake operation, or other things that 
inspectors love to find wrong with our Buses.

Of course, that was years ago.  I moved out of Mass before the inspections 
got stricter, but there may still be the odd station here and there that is 
willing to look the other way for a cool old Bus, an extra twenty, and a 
conversation about how the Red Sox WILL win the World Series this year.

Good Luck!
