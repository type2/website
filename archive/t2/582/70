Subject: Help! Engine won't start :-(

Hi All,

I just reinstalled the engine in my '74 Bus.  I've been stuck in the engine
compartment for a week and have that not so happy feeling :-(

The engine was running fine when I removed it for restoring the bus six months
ago.  After reinstalling I found the starter, which was fine before removal,
now to be bad.  After a new starter the bus now turns over fine the engine
just does not fire.
I didn't mark the wires when I removed the engine and am now regretting not
doing so.  Here are some questions for the experts.

1) what wires are the bare nessesities to make a coil shoot a hot spark from
the coil to the distributor? What is the best method for testing the spark?

2) I have one wire from the distributor going to the negative side of the
coil.  On the positive I have the ignition switch (which is hot when turned
on), electronic choke to carb, fuel pump (I know that's dangerous), and one
that I think goes to the back-up lights.  This combination shoots a orange
spark with both a brand new coil and the coil that was on it when I removed
the engine.

3) I have tried a brand new distributor (009) that I had in the garage with
the same results, only an orange spark.

4) I have not tried new plug wires as they were good when I removed the
engine.  I have tried a wire from another old set and still just the same
orange spark.

5) Should the orange spark start the engine? Maybe there is something else
preventing the engine from starting?

I sincerely appreciate any advise, the bus has received too much verbal abuse
this week, and I feel like jumping off a building :-(

-Tom
