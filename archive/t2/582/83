As a former body shop owner, I don't see much alternative (after looking at the 
image) to some 'professional' metalwork.  If you were going to sell the car 
next week, you might put some Bondo here and there, then paint over it... but 
if you want the damage truly to disappear, you need to talk to a shop where 
they know how to use a small torch to re-shape/shrink the metal.  They may 
indeed use Bondo, but it won't be more than 1/16" thick -- just enough to 
provide a smooth paintable surface.  VWs are enamelled, which means that 
blending-in a spot repair is not generally possible.  Have you talked to your 
insurance carrier about a claim?  Before too much more time elapses, you should 
report the incident to police.

Can't help you much on the clutch.  For sourcing parts, you might try eBay... 
worked great for me on some older VW parts.  Think about pulling the flywheel 
and machining the surface facing the clutch disk, if there is any 
irregularity.  It adds cost, but guarantees a much better job... again assuming 
you plan to keep the vehicle for a good while.
