You may make more heat (heads) than you can shed. Very tough to get it just right AND make it last. I have been told turbo Corvairs (the only other aircooled engine I have exposure to) will overheat but that engineers expected the car to be going speeds in excess of the posted limites before the engine overheated but that drivers had to be careful in the mountains were the engine might stay in boosted mode for long periods of time. 

In the bus world this might be ALL the hills, anytime there is a head wind, and every acceleration. Might burn up an engine fast in a big bus. FWIW the Corvair guys do not put the boosted engines in the vans and trucks for these reasons. 

I do think you could make it work given enough patience and money but you would definitely need to watch your instruments with a careful eye. 

Lastly the boosted Corvairs had a different cam and crankshaft (nitrided) to make it last. What would be required for a Type IV to last? I would prob start with Bruce Anderson's Porsche Handbook and see what the factory did to those engines to make them turbo friendly. Did the Porsche change the crank, the heads, the cooling system, etc? 

Might indicate what you need to rework in a VW. 

Personally for the effort and expense I would prob give Raby or Boston Bob a call.
