Just curious...Anybody know the difference between Naval Jelly
and the various rust stabilizers... Is it just the percentage of
phosphoric acid that makes one more aggressive than the other,
or are there other acids/?? in the jelly...Enquiring mines want 2 
no... ?-)
BTW, Benjamin Moore makes a rust treatment that my local paint
store sells for $35 a gallon and seems to work better than the
various other brands in smaller and more expensive sizes...
Anybody know the optimum ratio of phosphoric acid to water
(I guess...) to make a rust treatment... ?
