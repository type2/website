Subject: RE: [T2] 2.0 FI timing way out?

Hey hey, I just had that problem like half a week ago. :) For me, I just
did the pencil trick (thanks Ratwell for that tip, I think it was you
anyway). Take out the dizzy, shove a NEW NOT SHARP pencil down in the
hole (eraser side up) and jam it in their really good. Turn it clockwise
one tooth worth, and slide it back down. I believe the propper alignment
of it was for the small half (look at it when you pull it up with the
pencil and it'll make sense) being on the left side, rotate just one
tooths worth or so counter clockwise. It's what worked for me, and now
it's idling good and strong! If you've been on the list for long, just
look for my posts, and you should be able to find everyones responces.
:)

Hope it helps, and thanks again for everyones help when I had this
problem, all the others, and what the heck, all the more to come!  :)

reset the distributor drive gear.
