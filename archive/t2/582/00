Subject: Re: [T2] Turn Signal Tale of Woe

Hiya Shelley (and Welcome!),

I had exactly the same situation with the turn signals switch on the Duck.  
When I went looking for a new replacement switch I was floored at the asking 
price (around $150 IIRC) for these things.  So I set out to build my own switch.

I went to the various swaps and shows in my area and accumulated 5 switches 
in various states of repair.  From these switches I was able to assemble one 
good working switch.  That was two years ago and the switch is still working 
fine.  Total cost for me was under $25.  And I am no electrical genius - if I 
could do this, practically anybody could.

This might be an alternative you'd want to consider.
