Subject: 1971 Westfalia: Which muffler? & Advice for Massachusetts

Just discovered type2.com - Excellent Stuff!!

Just moved to Arlington, Mass. with my '71 Westy, need
to pass inspection! Can anyone (local) give me advice
as to how strict MA is for rust (holes), tires, etc..

My bus has dual 34 carbs, 009 dist, and a single
quietpack with a 2" collector. The muffler's rusted
out, but headers are fine: Anywhere local I can buy a
muffler, or can someone recommend a shop who can weld
the old flange to a new/scrap muffler?? I'm told 2" is
no longer made, searched for one at NH show on
Sunday..

I also need a "quarter window" glass and window
channel for driver's side, my bus was broken into..

Please point me in the right direction, I have 7 days
to get the inspection done, want to work on her this
holiday weekend, and pass inspection on Tuesday!!

Thanks!
