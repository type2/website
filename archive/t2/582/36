Subject: RE: [T2] Change those fuel lines

That's about $3 cheaper a meter than I paid on Tuesday, ouuuch. I must say 
that I did get a good deal on all but one of the plastic vaccum lines I 
needed to complete my engine. The one we could not find the correct size of 
7mm he did not have on hand. He was more than willing to spend my money and 
order it from Porshe. No thanks.

I can't tell from the picture but is that hose braided on the outside or 
smooth rubber with the reinforcment on the inside?
