Yes, of course you're right.  

Now 

#1  120    #1   120
#4  130??? #2   120

ALL valves-- intake and exhaust-- were very
tight.  Like .002.  Weird.  I am slapping myself
for not checking this long, long ago.  It should
have been the first thing I did when I bought the
van.  

My last bus was a 74 1800- those valve covers
were a bear.  I must say that it's been enough
years that I forgot how easy it is to adjust the
valves on an upright engine.  

With a happy bus for now.  But the Captain will
be watching those valves.
