Subject: Free Bug/Ghia Haynes to good home 

Yesterday driving home up US1 in the bus. A guy in a pickup waves a Haynes
at me and asks if I want it. Says its been sitting in his truck and he
doesnt need it. "toss it over" I say, and he does. I dont need it.

Its a Haynes for Beetle / Ghia from 54 - 79.
Free to the first person that needs it.
