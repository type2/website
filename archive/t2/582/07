Subject: Distributor Teardown and Buildup

Last night I started tearing down my 205P so it will be nice and fresh for 
the engine I have been straightening out. I have various metal parts soaking 
so when I get home it will be ready to cleanup and reassemble. My question 
is:

What type of lubricant should I use on the inards?
White lithium, bearing grease, dab of oil, vasoline, dialectric, etc.

I know there is a Bosch brand out there made for this but I can't find my 
link for it. Plus I don't know that I will be able to find it anywhere here 
on the way home. So I am stuck with FLAPS.

Any help with equivilents and/or no-nos would be greatly appreciated.


Thanks,

Michael Knight
