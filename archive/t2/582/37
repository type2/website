Hi Andy,

Bus budget is tight
Rebuilding engine myself
Hope it runs when done

Thanks for the sympathy.  It just needs new heads, so I'm not too worried 
about the bottom end.  I just need to be meticulous and accurate when 
re-assembling it -- proper torque, proper assembly technique, proper 
cleanliness.
