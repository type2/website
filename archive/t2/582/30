Subject: Re: [T2] Whistly noise after replacing fan

I am assuming this is a Type IV motor. If so then it looks like a bi washer. 
About 1/8" thick. It has three holes in it for the bolts that hold the fan 
on the hub. It also has one smaller hole used to line up the three holes for 
the bolts. See part #Q in the link below.
