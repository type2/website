Subject: RE: Fuel Injector question

Sorry Ed,

Nothing clear about this one. One email said that they were important, but 
this was like secondary statement with no explanations to why. I still would 
like to know, too. I am going to try my injectors for now until I move at 
the end of the month so that I can get most of the other if bugs worked out. 
Then I am going to send them in the be cleaned and such, they do install new 
pintles and filter screens.
