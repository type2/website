Assuming your plug wires are installed correctly, the distributor can be
"off" by 1 tooth, 2 teeth, or more.  It's not the distributor per se that's
"off", it's really the distributor drive gear down in the engine.

Bring the #1 cylinder to TDC on the compression stroke.  Then look at the
rotor on the distributor and see if it's pointing at the "notch" in the rim
of the distributor.  If it's not, rotate the distributor until it is;
that'll be close enough until you can time it correctly with a timing light.
If you can't get the rotor pointing at the notch be cause you don't have
enough "swing" in the distributor, i.e., you can't rotate the distributor
enough, then you'll have to reset the distributor drive gear.
