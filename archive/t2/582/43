Subject: Gas Pedals. Got Pics? 

<< quick version for people who don't wanna read the whole post --- Got
any pictures of a Gas Pedal and linkage? '76 Bay, 2.0L, Manual tranny>>
 
Soooooo, todays projects are to go pawn shop hopping in hopes to find a
tach/dwell meter, and a timing light on the cheaps since we have several
pawn shops, and NO auto parts stores. And also to figure out how the
accelerator pedal works. See, the PO of my bus got it for parts, but it
was the wrong year. He didn't realize the parts didn't interchanger to a
'85 Vanagon from a '76 Bay untill he'd done lots of damage. :)   But now
that my first goal is done, getting the engine to idle, I need to start
on my second goal. Getting it driveable. Now ONE of the things missing
in the bus is the GAS PEDAL!  Can't really back it out of my steep
drive, up onto the street where I have better access to it without one.
It's like 100% gone and missing. Awol. De Nada. Nothing their. A hole in
the floor. Etc. etc. 
 
So, anybody got pictures of what the gas pedal and all it's linkages and
whatnot are supposed to look like? I have an assortment of odd bolts,
and pieces of metal from when I cleaned the bus out, but I don't think
any of 'em look like gas pedal parts, but then I've never seen a VW gas
pedal, SOoooo, who knows?  PM'ed pic's of 'em, websites with pics of
'em. Anything! I'll be happy with whatever info I can gather. :) 
 
Cheers
