Tim,

What kind of oil temps when you see 475-500???

I shoot my cheapie infared at the oil filter....so, if you really have 
head temps in the 500's, then what kind of oil temps?

WHat kind of extension wires did you use for the gauge...makes a 
difference.  

Pull the #3 plug, and test the cht sender in a pot of boiling water...or 
the oven, or both....ovens have been known to be off quite a bit...try a 
digital turkey type thermometer at the same time.

Cheers, dave
