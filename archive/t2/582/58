Subject: CHT Gauge Accuracy

I have a brand new (not rebuilt) set of heads on my stock '79 2.0L 
westy.  I took all precautions possible, setting compression ratio 
properly, sealing up cooling tin, new engine compartment seal etc, 
making sure there are no vacuum leaks, etc.  I also installed a VDO 
cylinder head temp gauge with the sender under the #3 spark plug.

On the road at 60 mph, 75 degree ambient temperature, my CHT reads 475. 
  If I increased speed to 65, the CHT would climb to over 500.  This 
seemed high to me and freaks me out.  I don't want to burn up this new 
set of heads.  Since the engine runs perfectly, hot or cold and 
everything should be in order with the engine, timing, etc., I began to 
question the validity/accuracy of the CHT gauge.

So yesterday I got my hands on one of those infrared laser pointed 
remote thermometer devices.  This is not a cheapie, but a $300 Raytek 
unit that is brand new.  When I point this at my head at the #3 spark 
plug, it consistently reads 75 to 90 degrees lower than the VDO CHT.  
Now I don't know whether these infrared devices are geometry dependent 
to the extent that the surface of the head is irregular with vertical 
fins and a spark plug sticking up, but I sure like the numbers that the 
Raytek is giving me as opposed to the VDO gauge.  The Raytek numbers 
seem normal (i.e. 400 - 425 F) as opposed to the VDO (475 to 500 F).

Can anyone think of any reasons that I shouldn't believe the Raytek 
numbers over the VDO CHT gauge?
