Subject: 2.0 FI timing way out?

Hi list, just tried to get my just finished rebuilt 2.0 started.  It 
sputtered and back fired and would only run with me holding the throttle 
wide open. At that it would only do about 1000 rpm, but occasionally 
burp and take off like wild and I'd have to back it off quickly to avoid 
blowing it up!  I tried moving the distributor around to get somewhere 
near the right timing. It ran 'best' with it pushed CCW right up against 
the cold start valve but it seemed to want to go further.

Assuming this is a timing issue, can the distributor be off by a tooth 
and produce this effect?  I thought it was either correct or 180 off. 
Would it run at all if it were 180 off?

I have good spark on all 4 cylinders, and I'll check fuel pressure and 
vacuum next if I can keep it running long enough...  Thanks.
