Subject: Pictures of my van as requested

A while back I recieved some requests for pictures of my '79 camper. I did not have any so I had to wait until I could get some. The pictures from the "No Show" in Dallas have been posted so I have pictures to offer. Was my first show and I even managed to walk away with a couple of awards and some new friends. They can be found at this site:
