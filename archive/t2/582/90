Subject: Need connecting pipe for heat

Hello, can anyone give me a part number or where I can get the 
connecting pipe/elbow which goes between the alternator fan outlet and 
the intake of the passenger side heat exchanger?

This is for an '82 2.0 California model, but I think the pipe is the 
same on federal models.  Thanks,
