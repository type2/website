That's how it is done.  What you are doing is adjusting the antenna to the
resonant length for the frequency you are on.

The problem is, you really need another instrument to do it.  You either
need an SWR analyzer (expensive, around $250) or a SWR bridge (cheaper,
but harder to use).

For someone who isn't doing this all the time, the best route is to track
down a ham radio operator.  He will probably be more than willing to show
off his expertise by tuning your antenna while simultaneously trying to
talk you into giving up "criminal band" for a Real Radio!
