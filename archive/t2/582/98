 My speedo is acting weird. When I am holding a rather constant cruising
 speed, my speedo is jumping around (about 3 mph of movement, bouncing back
 and forth). Its kind of annoying. Any ideas on why this might be happening.
 Thanks!

Eric---  This sounds like a speedo drive cable that needs lubrication.  Simple 
in principle, but a bit time consuming.  Remove the drive cable from the back 
of your speedo and dribble some graphite lubricant, like a liquid key/lock 
lube, so that it flows down into the cable.  Maybe you will prefer to pull the 
speedo so you can get to the upper cable end.  If that doesn't help (much) then 
a new cable is indicated.  You can replace the inside of the cable with a 
general purpose "card" item available at discount autoparts stores, or go first 
class and buy a whole new speedo cable assembly, including the outer sheath.  
Actually, before you start any of this, check out the condition of the outer 
sheath where it is emerges from the left front brake backing plate... often a 
fracture develops here.  Let us know what you find.  Glenn
