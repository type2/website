Subject: On my way out the door... headed south

Volks,

I'm on my way out the door from Atlanta thru Archdale NC (Metwiz' shop) to
Atlanta to pick up Nikki and return with her to Alexandria.  Wendelin is
still having problems and will remain in Atlanta (unless the shop where
she is gets a chance to look at/fix her today (doubtful, according to
Nikki) and other arrangements will have to be made to get Wendelin up to
Kelly's for her scheduled nose job.

Anyhow, if you see a beige '80 disassembled by the side of I-95 or I-85,
it's probably me fixing a flat :-)
