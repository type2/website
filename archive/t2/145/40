Subject: '73 Bus Engine Lid Discrepancy 

The replacement '73 Engine Lid that I received is clearly different from the
original one on my '73 Westy (see attached image link).

The new lid is considerably longer and has different license plate lamp
cutouts. It doesn't appear that the cutout for the lid handle on the new lid
will even up with the lock catch.  Does anyone know what the hec I received
here? The sticker on the replacement says that it is for a '73 - '79
Transporter, but something isn't kosher here.

Thanks for your help!
