Subject: Door locks

So I just bought my first VW (1971 westy in stunning condition) last week
and I've been running around all this week getting it in shape to move out
to Yosemite for a couple of months.  Currently, one of the only things
holding me back are the locks on the doors.  The key that I have manages to
open the drivers side door, but doesn't turn in any of the other locks...
It also starts the ignition.  This leads me to believe that it actually is
meant _only_ to start the ignition and that there is supposed to be another
key (which has been lost along the years) that opens the doors.  The
driver's side door lock is probably just so worn down that it works with the
wrong key anyway.

But before I go off and pay a lock smith to make me some new keys, I decided
it would be a good idea to check and make sure that this actually is the
case... in other words, do the old VWs use two different keys for unlocking
the doors and starting the ignition?  Also, I'm considering just taking it
to a VW shop and asking them to completely replace _all_ of the locks for me
so that I can feel just a little bit more safe about leaving my valuables in
the bus during the days in Yosemite when I'm out climbing.  Any ideas on how
much that would cost?  Are the parts to do that available such that I might
be able to do the work myself?

Thanks in advance for any help,
Dan

PS  Once I finish getting it ready to go, I'm going to take some pictures of
it and post them on the web.  This bus is in the most incredible
condition... its hard to believe that its more than 10 years old.  I'll let
you guys know once I've got them up.
