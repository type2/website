I saw some of what appeared to be good Westy's in the Oregonian.  Start
there and expand your search w/ the Auto Trader.  If you can find one
further out in Eastern Oregon the better, as conditions lead to less rust
problems.  You might also post a message at www.wetwesties.org a west coast
westy site.

Good luck!

Alright I have been without a westy long enough.  I am in the proccess of
selling my car in hopes of getting a westy.  If this is not acceptable use
of the forums, sorry.  I want to trade or sell my 96 Pontiac Grand Am for a
westy.  I am looking for a 77-82 westy.  If anyone is interested in my Grand
Am, p-mail me.  I am in Portland, OR.  Thanks.
