Subject: time to move?


OK, you guys on the left coast have it made.  Your
cars don't rust, the boneyards are full of VWs, there's
plenty of VW parts suppliers, mechanics, specialty shops
etc.  Now I hear there's a mechanic in Oregon that gives
AC VW owners discounts. =20

I love to "window shop" on thesamba.com, and once in awhile
I come across a VW that I really like, and may even be able
to afford, usually an original type I in need of some attention,
or a westy in the same shape.  Just when I begin to get excited, I
look at the seller's location and 95% of the time it's in Oregon,
California, or Washington, totally opposite side of the country
from me.

So here I sit (Wilmington, NC) dreaming of what I would do on a nice
spring day if there were AC VW's littering the bone yards, or
if there were part suppliers in close proximity, little old ladies
selling the car they've had garaged for 40 years, you get the idea.

But no, the bone yards in my area have very few AC VWs, and the
ones I do find are rusted out shells.  Most folks around here
have never seen a splittie.  There are very few VW shops, and
some of those I wouldn't go near.  Many of the VWs here that are
forsale are way overpriced, or rusted.   =20

I find myself thinking more and more about moving to Oregon, Eugene
seems nice.  Even though my entire family (wife's included) lives
here in NC, no matter, just a reason to throw the kids in the bus
and hit the road.  Now if I could just figure out how to convince
my wife that we need to move west, to the land of the VW, I'd be outta
here.  Of course I'd have to hide my real intentions, she'd probably
start divorce proceedings if she found out the real reason I want to
move.  She thinks I already have too many VWs (2 with 1 more on the =
way.)
Wonder how she'd react to a whole yard full of them?  Am I nutz?

Happy Friday,
