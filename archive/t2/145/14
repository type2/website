Volks,

I disagree!!!  Entirely!!!  (OK, I just hadda say that :-)  Actually, I've
been pushing vacuum gauges as useful diagnostic tools for ages on the
list, but getting anyone interested has been difficult.  Two hours at
Everybus interested more people than 7 years of preaching on the list ever
did.  I guess it is the sort of thing that you have to see in action to
appreciate.

The gauge that David found is an excellent one.  Especially if you run
carbs.  The limit is that the fuel pressure end of it is *only* useful for
carbs.  You *cannot* use it for FI, that requires a separate (and more
expensive) gauge.  Another limit that I only discovered at Everybus is
that there is *nowhere* on a 1500 SP manifold to measure manifold
vacuum!!!  I am both shocked and appalled by this, as I consider manifold
vacuum to be a basic diagnostic.  I want to see some more carbureted SP
engines, but if this is truly the case, I am going to have to modify the
engine in the '67 somehow, as I will not run an engine I can't check
vacuum on.
