Subject: new AVP 2.0 installed but....

Hi List,
My brother and I installed a new 2.0 avp engine into my 72 Westy over the last couple of days.  Now problems in the transfer, all old items fit right on to the new longblock (except the heat exchangers and muffler, but we'll take care of that).  Engine also went back in with no problems, didn't even have to wiggle too much.  Put the key in, and she turned over.

Problem:  no spark at the plugs.  I'm assuming this could be a number of problems, bad coil, distributor, points, etc.  I just used the old stuff off of the old engine. The bus had been sitting unused for 4 years.  Should I replace everything?  It is a vaccum advance distributor from the old 1800 engine, with no hose hooked up between it and the carb.  Should I replace with a 050 mechanical?  Or keep the old dist and replace the cap, points, plugs, coil etc (and attach vaccum?).  Thanks for all imput.  I just want to run the engine the for the best efficiency and longevity.

One other small problem, all lights work except the turn signals on the right hand side, and the blinkers and emg. flashers don't blink, they just turn on and stay on.  

Thanks for the help!
