Subject: Can anyone help?

Hi everyone,

I am looking for an engine stand somewhere near Modesto, CA for when I pull 
my engine on Sat. Preferrably as a loan, but if you want to trade I have 
stuff lying around. (Mostly computers and stuff) I am also a Systems 
Administrator, so I can trade computer work also.

TIA,

Tyler.
