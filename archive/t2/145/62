Subject: Re: [T2] Do you have bright headlights?

I missed Everybus too and I've had a pair of the H-4 upgrades on my
wishlist since I got my bus. I used to have an '86 Porsche 911 that had
DISMAL headlights. I blew $270 on the upgrade to H-4s and NEVER REGRETTED
it! It was like night and day.

I've delayed on the upgrade for the bus mostly because the bus is much
higher up and visibility is so much better than the 911. I believe the
current price at Bus Depot is $34 for the pair, including bulbs. Dirt cheap
by any standards.
