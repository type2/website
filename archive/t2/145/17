Subject: replacing rocker/sill panels

Before I start hacking in there, and pulling out all the cabinets can you
guys tell me how to remove the sills on my 79?

I'm presuming they're spot welded in, but if so how do I drill them out and
drill the sill rather than the panel it's attached to. What about on the
door side?
