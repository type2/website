While searching our archives today at work, I cameacross this really cool photo of a VW bus, which wasused to give tours at Daytona International Speedwayfor 25 cents! I have often contemplatedsneaking my 69 bus "Rudi" onto the track but fearedthe 32 degree angles. Anyhow, just thought I wouldshare it with you all! I am sure someone could let usknow what make it is.Here is the link to my website where I posted it:http://www.lesleyreedy.com/images/vwbustoursatdaytona.jpgHave a good weekend!Lesley
