To track down an exhaust leak on my 79 I hooked up a shop vac to the
exhaust tip & turned it on blow. With a nice cool engine & mucho air
moving from the vac into the engine backwards it was very easy to tell
where the leaks were comming from.

On most stereo units you will have 3 main wires other than any
control/speaker wires. 2 power wires which take +12v and one ground. I
never can remember which wire (red or yellow) gets the always on
power, but one will. This is the one that the memory/etc uses. The
other should provide power when the engine is running. I highly advise
putting an extra in-line fuse in if there isn't one. Take a VOM or
test light & see what terminals on your fuse block either stay on all
the time or only when the ignition is "on" & hook the proper wires to
those. I wouldn't trust that ground wire. Create your own. I don't see
a problem using the same location just make sure you have a good
ground.
