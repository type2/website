Brandt,

i used the torsion arm set from Bus Boys. unfortunately at the time they
weren't taking used ones back, so i had to eat the core charge. shipping was
steep since it was a pretty heavy package.

main reason i went with them was lack of press to get the old ones out.
also heard they can be a bugger to get out sometimes.

the bus drove like brand new...i would recommend the bus boys product if you
can't reuse your old ones.

HTH,
