Bob, Bob, Bob,!

  EVERYONE knows there isnt any gold in da UP of
Michigan... hence the term Copper Country! Geeeez!

AND.. EVERYONE knows that..
PONTIAC, chief of the Ottawas, born on Ottawa river
about 1720; died in Cahokia, Ill., in 1769. He was the
son of an Ojibway woman, and, as the Ottawas were in
alliance with the Ojibways and Pottawattamies, he
became the principal chief of the three tribes. 

Geeeez! That long ago he had to be driven a splitty!



> 
> What's a Pontiac ?-)

some Indian chief if I recall.  He has a 82 splitty
and is taking the
hubcap to the Upper Pennisula of Michigan and going to
use it to pan 
for
gold.
