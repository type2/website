Well, this undercoating-with-oil is something I do as
recommended in the wonderful "Rust and your Volkswagen"
piece posted here 98/2/5 by info-rust(-at-)vwtype3.org and it
is the bees knees as far as I am concerned.

I use an air-powered undercoating gun that is called in
the auto body trade a "Shultz Gun" and a relatively low
end Sears air compressor that wouldn't make much of a
sand blaster but is swell for this task, or inflating
tractor tires, or our other odd jobs here.

Shultz Gun was bought cash and carry at D&B in Everett,
Mass., for $22, and is, as retyped from the box,

        AES Industries #AES-620
        Air Undercoating Gun
        Made in Taiwan

        Air Consumption............11 CFM
        Operating Pressure......55-70 PSI
        Net Weight...............0.35 KGS
        Overall Length.............9 1/4"
        Air Inlet................1/4" NPT
        Hose Size................3/8" I.D.

I don't bother with a supply bottle but just run a couple
of yards of platic tubing from the intake siphon into a 
5gal paint pail with the tube duct-taped to the bail and
a piece of scrap iron holding the end down.

My drill is to drive the patient/vehicle around to warm
up the sump, change the oil, and while the waste oil is
still hot to do the undercoating job.  As always, how good
the job is is largely dependent on everything being dry
and you thinking like a droplet of salt water looking
for a place to hide.

YMMV,
