Subject: Re: [T2] Long Trip Worries

Hi Folks,

I tend to subscribe to the "fix anything questionable" school of thought, 
and check and fix anything before a long road trip.  That said, I just got 
back from a road trip where I got stranded because of a freak part breaking. 
  Given that most of these vehicles are at least 22 years old, there's bound 
to be something that will go wrong, unless all the major parts are fixed or 
replaced.

Fix what needs it immediately, bring whatever spares you think you'll need, 
and keep a copy of the AIRS list for whatever states you'll be going 
through.  Enjoy your Bus while it's running, and hope that it will get you 
all the way to your destination.

Good luck!
