Subject: Curtains

I'm currently having a local upholstery shop make me some new curtains for
my '71 Westy, and was wondering how one would go about removing and
replacing the curtains that are fixed in place behind the cabinet?  The
ratty old curtains that came with the bus when I bought it are already
different from the ones that are fixed behind the cabinet which leads me to
believe that they've been replaced in the past the PO decided it wasn't
worth the trouble to try and get at and change the ones stuck behind the
cabinet...  I personally would like to try and do this because the bus looks
great otherwise and I want to keep it that way.  Anybody with some past
experience replacing those curtains?

Thanks,
Dan
