Subject: Headlight Adjusters - help!

Hi Folks,

The thread about bright headlights got me thinking (always dangerous), and I 
came up with a question for the list.

Does anybody have unusual headlight adjusters?  Specifically, I have 
adjusting screws that are at about 2:00 and 7:00 on the circumference of the 
headlight bucket -- not at the usual 3:00/9:00 and 12:00/6:00 locations.  My 
Bentley manual is no help, as it displays the standard setup, and my owner's 
manual has no mention of adjusting headlights.

I've tried adjusting my lights and have gotten them close, but the 2 
adjusters seem to be working against each other.  Has anybody had success 
with these?  Has anybody figured out a system for working these?

Thanks for any help or suggestions.
