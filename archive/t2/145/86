Subject: Heating system photos

    HI!  I've been a list member for only a few days (I'm learning ALLOT
though), so forgive me if this is a bad post.  I waited till Friday, just in
case!  I saw somebody else ask for this earlier, but never saw any replies,
and I have searched on the type2 web site.
     Would somebody take a couple of pictures of all the heat ducting, any Y
pieces underneath their bus for me?  I have nothing beyond the heater boxes
underneath my car, so I either need to create, or find the correct pieces at
a swap meet.  Either way, I have to know what they look like.  Close-ups of
anything that isn't just a tube (any places were things merge or split)
would be VERY appreciated.
     Also, pictures inside the engine bay so I can see how the heater blower
and the air cleaner are situated would be helpful.

Thanks in Advance,
Jay Ollom

P.S. Bentley is on order an Amazon.  I just signed up for A.I.R.S., How cool
is that idea!  You people are awesome!
