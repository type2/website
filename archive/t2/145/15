Subject: Broken Nose

Dear List,

Thanks for the bus-boys ball joint advice. Now for much bigger questions.

Like I mentioned I am currently in the process of combining two green
westfalia's into one and hope to restore the body while I'm at it. However,
the new almost 100% rust free body (a 78 from Vegas) has a slightly dented
nose. Mainly the area between the wipers and above the grill has been pushed
in and is concave rather than convex. It appears that the PO pushed
something with the spare tire mounted on the nose. Duh.

For pictures of the broken nose from a newbie webpage designer. (I don't
know how to make thumbnails or much else, sorry)

I am wondering how well do the new (Brazil?) nose panels fit? Are they still
available? If so where? I think I saw a vendor discontinue selling them due
to a quality issue. Is this true? Does anyone have any experience with
these? Are they made from the same mold so to speak? I've searched the
archives but have had no luck.

For those who might be curious I've got three body/paint estimates so far
that are $4200, $5600, and $10,000. Interestingly enough the $4200 paint guy
deems the nose fixable without replacement while the other two say to
replace it. I'd be curious what the body experts out there in bus land think
(replace? or repair?). Maybe I'll just get a bra and deal with it later as
there are a host of front end, brake, and electrical issues to deal with.
The plan is to swap the engine-trans plus interior out of my 79. I don't
want a show bus, just a nice bus that can be driven as a daily driver if
need be.

Thanks for reading,
Brandt
