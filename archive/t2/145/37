deal with the mechanical issues first!  the paint doesn't stop the bus
when you stomp on the pedal.   my advice is use some rattle can color
close to the "Babyshit" green color to keep the rust down.  but do all the
mechanical work and get it running right, then worry about paint and
bodywork that is purely cosmetic.

especially if it is a daily driver, get it so it can be safely driven.

IMO, as always YMMV
