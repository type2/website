Subject: pop-top roof and spare tire mount

Hi all

I'm the proud new owner of a 1971 bus, that also came with all that's needed 
to convert it to a camper - everything from the sink/icebox to the pop-top 
roof.  I've been searching the digest archives and have been learning quite a 
lot.  As for my own bus, the rear portion of the interior is stripped, and 
there are a few rust holes that need to be repaired before doing anything 
else.  Runs strong, but could use a tune-up; according to the registration 
it's not been registered since '93.  I don't plan on using the pop-top roof, 
so once I get some pictures and decide on a price I'll try to sell it 
somewhere.

My main question here is about the spare tire mount on the nose.  From 
reading the archives, the general concensus seems to be (1) in event of a 
collision the front of the bus is very susceptible to damage, and (2) sheet 
metal alone is not really strong enough to support the weight.  I'm not 
overly concerned about the collision issue; my feeling is that in case of an 
accident, my only concern is with the safety of any people.  Since I'm not 
married and don't have kids, it's only me I have to worry about, (on a 
regular basis, anyway).

There's been a few different ideas about supporting the mount better.  What 
does the group think about this idea:  mounting it as indicated, then welding 
supports on each side down to the bumper.  My spare tire is currently beneath 
the front seats, and besides making it easier to get to, moving it would free 
up some interior space, maybe to make a nice center console.

Sorry to keep rambling, but the Type 2 list seems like the best place to go 
for advice.

Best wishes to everyone!
