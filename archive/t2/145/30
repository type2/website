Just prep as good as you can. Deliver it ready to paint if possible so all 
they have to do is spray it.

My bet is that they can spray it decently well - probably as good or better 
than most amateurs. If all they have to do is spray then maybe they'll 
spend a bit more time spraying your van and you'll get a better job.

Are you doing your own bodywork?

They're cheap, we can't make the material cost add up, but in the bulk they 
buy it, it is probably much less than what we buy it.

If it lasts 2 years, it is probably worth $200 IMHO.

If it was $800 or something I would probably prep it and take it to a 
better shop and spend the extra few hundred bucks to have a better spray 
job done on it. It'll look better and last longer.

I know what it is like to want or need a cheap paint job. Been there. 
Wait.. I'm still there now. Trying to put my bus back together after a 
cheap paint job (I tripped my bus out completely for this paint job).
