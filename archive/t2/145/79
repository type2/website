Subject: paging Steve Dolan...

I was just browsing the list on the web & saw Steve was on a rescue
mission to Atlanta...

If any of you talk to him (Raistrick or John Anderson, etc.) tell him to
give me a call.  I sent him an email, but he is probably on the road...

I wanted to offer assistance if I could.  At the very least, I could offer
a beer.
