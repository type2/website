Subject: hiccup..excuse me..

Vehicle: 1979 Westfalia
Engine: 2.0L FI with ~15,000km on rebuild
Tranny: AUTOMATIC

Problem: My bus has developed a bit of a hiccup in the last little while. It
started last summer (faintly) and has progressed slowly. The 3300 km trip to
Everybus and back really made this hiccup prominent. Anybody have any ideas?

 Symptoms: Only happens at idle. Only happens when in Drive (remember the
AUTO tranny). Engine idles and every few seconds it "hiccups" and causes the
engine to pulse.

I have checked the timing, dead on 7.5, idle is dead on at 950 RPM, points,
rotor, cap and wires all new and problem persists. I have found that is
worse in warmer temperatures and causes a slight bogging on low rpm (1st
gear) when engine is warmed up.

The funny part to this is the fact that it only happens when I have the van
in Drive or reverse. I have tons of power, runs perfect at high RPM and
idles perfect in Park or Neutral. Can anybody explain this situation before
I start replacing FI parts one-by-one?

AFM?

BTW...It was great to meet y'all at EBUS 2002 (my third one) and I look
forward to next year already.....

Ted, I missed your cherries......
