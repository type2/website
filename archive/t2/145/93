I was there but didn't get a chance to ask about it , but looking at it I
think its an air compressor, buy the cupler on the end there ,it looks like
an air hose would fit right up to it.

Hey all,
    I took this pic while at EB and wanted to know what it was for.  It
looks like a generator or something.  Anyone??
