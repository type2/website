Hi Dan,

One key is supposed to work on the ignition AND all the doors. Every bus
left the factory in that configuration.

Lots of buses (including my own) have had various doorhandles or locks
replaced over the years and may require more than one key to operate them.
This wasn't VW's design, it's just entropy acting in its own special way
upon our vehicles. After 30 years it's amazing the stories they can tell.

My Westfakia still has its original ignition lock, but it came with no door
handles whatsoever when I got it so they ALL came off my 73 parts westy. All
except for the sliding door lock; because the 73 sliding door lock is
different from the 79. The 79 slider lock I have on there now came off a
donor door that belonged to a friend of mine. So my westfakia winds up with
three keys in total. The cost to rekey the ignition and slider is not too
bad; but at the moment there are a long list of other improvements to better
spend my $$$ on. YMMV.


Happy trails,
