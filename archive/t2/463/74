Subject: Running problems with a 78 fuel injection Bus

I have a new to me 78 Riveria that I bought because the PO was having
problems keeping it running.  It starts up and runs for a few minutes
and then starts to run rough and then dies.  I search the archives and
found a similar problem so will test the cylinder head temp sensor as
this makes the most sense but I'm a little confused.  By grounding the
sensor it is simulating a warm head so will the bus run better or worse?
If you disconnect the sensor does that act like a cold head and will the
bus run better or worse?  I also read that you can check the resistance
at different levels at the ECU plug terminals 13 and 17.  So do you run
the engine to warm it up and then pull the plug to check resistance?  I
know very little about F.I. so any help would be appreciated.

Below is what I found in the archives,
Thanks,
Kevin

To me it sounds like the cylinder head temp sensor.  Once it dies after
starting to warm up simply connect a wire from the sensor connector
to ground, this will simulate a warm head signal, and try starting it up
again.  If it works, go get a new cylinder head temp sensor.  It's about
the only thing that changes as the engine warms up - the signal from the
temp sensor in the air flow meter should not change as the engine
warms up.

Good luck
