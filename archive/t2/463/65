Subject: Selling My 73 Westy 5-speed (Colorado)

I sit here in my office looking out the window at my 73 Westy and I realize
my old friend deserves better than I'm giving him these days.  I bought him
in Feb 1991 and have had so many good times with him on the road and at
campouts that I can't even count them all.  But these past few years my
lifestyle and my interests have changed to the point where the only thing I
use him for is an occasional commute to work or down to Home Depot to haul
stuff back to my house.  Not a fitting end for this 3-owner rock-solid bus.
He needs someone that can give him the care (and dare I say love?) that I
used to provide.  He's 100% functional, fast (914 2.0 motor and 5-speed
tranny!!), solid, and ready for anything from local camping to extended
cross-country driving.  So I've finally made up my mind to help him find a
new owner.

I'll take some pictures over the next several days and will try to get them
on the 'net by this weekend, but if you want to see any pics sooner, please
just ask...

Here's some of the basics:
73 Westy in Colorado Springs, CO:  $3900 and ready to drive anywhere!
Total mileage shown is around 150,000 and I believe this to be real mileage.
Rockers, doglegs, pan, body panels are nearly 100% rust-free (see below for
exceptions).
914 2.0 motor (rebuilt 25K miles ago) with Bosch D-Jet fuel injection.
Starts, idles, and runs perfect every time - no hassles.
901 5-sp tranny (rebuilt 25k miles ago).  Ask me for details if you like :)
Four New Michelin Agelis 185/14 LT tires (2000 miles ago).
KYB shocks front and rear (installed about 8 years ago and still 100% good).
Oversized front swaybar (installed last year).
Porsche 924 instrument cluster with oil temp, tach, 150mph speedo, fuel
gauge, etc.
(Original instrument cluster included and NO irreversible changes have been
made).
VDO Oil temp gauge.
Original gold CLOTH Westy interior in very good condition.
Original jump seat and child cot included.
Front seats have headrests and covers on them (original vinyl needs
replacing).
Sunbrella curtains (installed in 1996) are all in like-new condition.
Brand new (not installed) matching Sunbrella poptop canvas.
Matching Sunbrella 8x12 awning that attaches to the rain gutter.
Nice Pioneer AM/FM/cassette stereo w/12 cd changer.
4 new CV joints & boots (1000 miles ago).
Bentley, Haynes, and (very used) Muir manuals included.

Problem Areas:
ORIGINAL orange paint - faded and in need of repainting.
Slight dent on sliding door - should be an easy fix when the paint is done.
Minor rust spot (1") at drain to right of engine lid.
Wheels need painting.
Windshield was replaced in March 2003 and now it leaks in heavy rain - I'm
told this can be fixed quite easily, but I haven't had a chance to look into
it.
Minor rust under windshield seal, but was repaired in 1997.
Very minor engine oil leak - I haven't been able to identify it, maybe
you'll have better luck?

Extra Goodies available WITH PURCHASE OF BUS ONLY - any or all of them:
Original Drive-away Tent (excellent condition)      $450
Replacement Dash (excellent condition)              $50
Bn4 gas heater (excellent and ready to use)         $300
2 additional BN4 heaters (complete, but not tested) $150
New Rubber & Lenses (almost every seal/lens on the bus) $750
Underdash AC setup (complete except for compressor) $50
New Rear Wheel Bearings                             $75
New Rear Suspension Bushings                        $75
New Front Wheel Bearings                            $25
New Coil-over rear shocks                           $75
New Rear Sway Bar (won't fit due to 5-speed tranny) $50
Lots of other Misc parts - talk to me.  

Or take it all; lock, stock and barrel for only $5500.  That includes the
bus, the extras listed, and all the misc bus stuff I've collected over the
past 12 years.  If you add up just the bus and the listed extras, you'll
find that alone comes up to over $5800!  Add in the other stuff and you get
yourself one heck of a deal.
