To All,
Just my 23 cents worth on JC Whitney / Warshawsky automotive items.
Warshawsky?
Whats that?
This was the store front , walk in , buy your discount automotive,
located on State Street on the South side of Chicago, junk shop---big
place--which was recently razed for some more high rises.
JC Whitney was their catalog division, which recently moved out west on
I-80 around Morris IL.--the ground was cheap--
and selling the same stuff as the store---

Anyway, having been down to 

Warshawsky's in my youth a bunch---and seeing what they have / had in
stock,  what they sold,and who their main clientel was, there is only
one word that I could possibly think of to cover my thoughts on what
they purvey---JUNK---

Nothing they have is top of the line, except maybe the Hula Girls, curb
feeler's, static straps, studded vent visors, and maybe the chromed
chain license plate frames.

I now back to the sound deadening materials--

I used Dynamat in one spot in my Bus --and didn't care for it much--
Even in the sumer months, using my heat gun, and being careful--the
stuff cracked when going over irregularities.
Didn't impress me.
But it was under the back seat--so no big deal--
For the rest of the vehicle, in the doors and side panels, and under the
floor I used Q-pads.
They were real simple to use,didn't crack over the irregular surfaces,
and I like the concept of not having to deal with a big roll of sticky
stuff when attempting to apply it---the Q-pads are nice for this reason,
and quieted the Bus, as well as my 87 Westy down well.

This stuff is not cheap---either one of them--
But --one day in life you'll figure out that sometimes-- Cheap--is not
always the best--

There ya go--
And--
Avoid JC Wintowsky at all costs---  


  Later,
