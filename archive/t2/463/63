Just a thought about this

I sometimes wonder why
>companies brag about using NASA technology, I'd be embarrased most of the
>time!

Some of the bragging is silly but some of the technology is there for a 
reason.
Even though it may seem old there's more to it.  That little black XT in 
that interesting
looking case bolted down is more reliable then anything that was around for 
a long
long time.  In university we had this discussion, and what was found out was 
that
it would be the last thing to crash on that shuttle including the shuttle 
itself.

Why do you need more processing power when the tool at hand does the job
perfectly?  And pretty much guarentee's it won't have any down time.

Just a thought.

(now the computer in my home needs to go down now and then so I can update
my O/S ;)
