It "really" shouldn't matter where the parts are made (unless it's your
town that's losing the factory...), it's just that the continual search
for cheaper labor seems to lead to a two tier system for parts...
On another list, someone who worked for a major stereo equipment
manufacturer explained the difference between the "Elite" line and the
regular line of components...The "Elite" line had its bits and pieces
tested before manufacture; the regular line was just assembled...
Assuming that manufacturers don't want to do warranty work at
their expense, do they get the OK parts and the rest of us get the
maybe's... ?-(
