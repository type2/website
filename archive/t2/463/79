Subject: Re: [T2] Bus soundproofing - NASA technology

reminds me of the fact that during the Apollo program, NASA spent millions 
of dollars to develop an ink pen that would write in the zero gravity 
enviroment of space.  They ran tests (here on earth) trying to acheive a pen 
that would write upsidedown.

Meanwhile the Russian Space program decided not to spend the millions and 
had their cosmonauts use a lead pencil.

>><< Of course, the joke I always tell about "NASA Technology" is they
were still using 8088 IBM XT computers in the space shuttle up until about 4
years ago, when your home computer was able to do more processing than all
of the computers on the space shuttle combined! I sometimes wonder why
companies brag about using NASA technology, I'd be embarrased most of the
time!
