Subject: Re: [T2] Zamboni parts

The muffler I have on my 65 Kombi is a muffler that was kept as a spare for
a zamboni.................

It was a genuine VW muffler...   the only differences between it and a bus
muffler are......   the zamboni muffler didn't have the small heater
chambers on the upper pipes going into the muffler, and the small bracket
that is welded to the body of the muffler for supporting the tailpipe is on
the oposite side ( on the zamboni application the tail pipe shoots over to
the right side, where on a bus the tail pipe shoots off to the left.....)
