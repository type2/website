I think the original site was here:

http://www.bulley-hewlett.com/VWindex/intrir1.html

(which came up in a google search for "vw bus soundproofing heat nasa")

although that domain no longer resolves.  

Here's incomplete google cache:
http://216.239.57.104/search?q=cache:sEeSLG7gaKgJ:www.bulley-hewlett.com/VWindex/intrir1.html+vw+bus+soundproofing+heat+nasa&hl=en&ie=UTF-8

It would suck if the pages no longer exist.  I might check if i have a 
cached copy at home (doubt it, but...)

Anyone have any other leads?

cheers,
