Subject: Zamboni parts

Does anyone have good ideas on finding parts for air cooled Zambonis? For the
most part the part numbers are the same (points, rotor, etc) however I am
having a difficult time finding a muffler.

At first glance it looks like the traditional TypeI stock muffler with a
single exhaust pipe however the part number listed in the Zam manual is
126251053E, which I cannot find anywhere.

The rear plate that covers the muffler is wide like an older Porsche plate.
There are simple pipes running from the heads to the muffler (ie. no heater
boxes).

Any ideas would be appreciated.
