Subject: mexican thermostat

because the thermostats are getting hard to find i know you can use a fuel injected beetle thermostat with minimal fabricating (86 cel).  I now see those are getting tough to find.  I see these mexican upgrade thermostats for sale.  Can they be made to work as the regular fuel injected ones?
