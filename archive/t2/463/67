Subject: RE: [T2] Bus soundproofing - a long-lost URL

There are lots of great ideas out there for sound proofing. I think we, as
bus people, are at an advantage as weight isn't a major issue for our cars.
Heck my Westy already weighs a ton and is slower than sin. Because of this,
adding some extra weight onto the cars isn't a big deal. The more pricey the
sound proofing, doesn't really mean better. What it means (take this from a
guy who worked in PR for this area) is better for less amount of weight. The
sound proofing quality of the tar sheets or a rubberized/asphalt type
coating will be pretty darn close to what you'd get with a high-priced
Dynamat or Lydall, etc sound proofing sheet. But of course the coating will
weigh probably 20 lbs vs maybe 5lbs for the sheets. If you're doing a whole
car, this could be 100lbs of added weight and can affect performance... if
you're aiming for that. That's why the guys in the hopped up Civics and BMWs
spend the money on the sheets, they're aiming for the best of both worlds.
As a bus guy, am I going to notice 50lbs of soundproofing when my engine is
already underpowered and I've accepted that? Probably not, so that's why
we're lucky ;)
