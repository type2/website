I guess it depends on how you define "junk" and "top of the line
accessories."  JC Whitney sells Bosch, EMPI, Hella, Neuspeed, PIAA,
Pertronix, Scat, Sewfine, TMI, and West Coast Metric amongst many other
brands.  

Even though they are close, I don't go there often, but they DO have some
good stuff.
