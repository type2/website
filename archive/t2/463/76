FWIW, Home Depot sells Ridgid plumbing tools, but the Ridgid name is on
some made-in-China electric tools...The Klein electricians tools at my 
electric supply store are made in USA, the Klein tools at Home Depot are
not...I usta have faith in "brand names" but too many companies have 
followed Philip Knight's (CEO of Nike) lead... Once you've got a marketable
name; stick it on whatever you've got...They'll buy it...
