Does anyone have any experience with this stuff?

It's a 1/16'' thick asphalt sheet sound dampening material that seems  
like it might be able to take the place of the Q-Pads in the article  
(the JC Whitney ashphalt sheet seems like it's a lot less expensive).

Hm, interesting.  I guess the trade-off of this newer stuff is that  
it's thicker (~3/4'' vs ~3/8'' for the NASA insulation), and quite a  
bit more expensive ($79.20 [64x72] vs $26.95 [48x72] for the NASA  
insulation), though you do get a bit more material per roll with the  
LyTherm.

The thickness of the material is really the issue, for me.  I want a  
thermal and sound barrier for the floor of the Bus, but I also want to  
use my original Westy carpet (which is in *very* good shape - POs put  
plastic protective mats over it, which I got with the Bus), and there's  
probably not very much "spare" carpet at the edges.  Does the LyTherm  
compact well, and if so, does it maintain its functional properties?

Heh.  I worked at a NASA research center for 5 years.  We actually did  
develop some cool technology, honest!  But, yah, when it came to the  
space program (which, thankfully, I didn't work on ... pretty  
high-stakes/pressure job), stability and predictability was key.  Plus,  
by the time the technology transfer office gets around to licensing  
something, the patent is probably expired (and you thought your local  
building inspection department was slow... :-)
