Subject: Re: [T2] Pressing out balljoints at home

Yo Courtney---

Plans?

Not needed.

All you need is some heavy wall tubing--cut short---one of bigger
diameter to fit below the ball joint to let it fall out and support the
A-Arm, and one smaller to fit the top side just a coozie smaller
diameter than the ball joint to press it out---and pass through the
A-Arm.

Reverse the proceedure to install.

Easy Stuff----

BUT be sure the tubing is like schedule 40, with about 1/4 inch wall.

Have Fun---
