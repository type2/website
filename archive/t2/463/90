Subject: DIesel westy wanted (sorry this is off topic!)

Hi, I am sorry this message is off topic, someone recomended that I look here, I am sorry if I offended anyone...

Anyway, I am looking for a diesel westfalia. Any condition is ok, but 
preferably running or with bad head gasket/ or "smaller" repairs...

I live in N. Washington, but could travel for the right deal. 
Unfortunatley, I am on a college budget, so my price range is 
probably in the < 2000 range, but please let me know if you have 
anything avaliable in this area, as I have been searching for quite 
some time now. 
contact via email: porge(-at-)ziplip.com

Thank You!
Greg
