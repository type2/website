Subject: Bus soundproofing - a long-lost URL - Found and archived!

Ok, many thanks to Greg Potts for pointing out the Way Back Machine at 
www.archive.org.  It had basically the entire article sans one image, 
and I was able to archive it onto my server.  (wget's recursive mode 
didn't like the redirect hack that the WBM seems to use as a 
space-saving technique, but thankfully NetBSD's ftp/http client was 
able to handle them, and so the problem was easily solved with a little 
shell and awk :-)

You can find my archived copy here:

I encourage the www.type2.com admins to fix the broken link in the tech 
library to reference my archive.
