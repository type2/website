ok, finally got the shocks swapped out,  kyb gas
adjusts all around.  i have the hi roof so the extra
stiffness up front is a bit more necessary than in a
regular bus.  rides quite nice and lemme tell ya.  it
is quite a difference from the 30 year old shocks that
were on the bus.  anyway.  flushed the whole brake
system taking out the dark, dark brown old fluid and
replaced with synthetic fluid that said it was
compatible with the dino stuff.  braking didn't seem
to change much but i imagine the difference on the
hills would be noticable.  something i did notice is
that when i slammed on the brakes at speed (approx
40mph as i was in town) the bus would sort of fake
right a bit but stop in a straight line with my hands
off the wheel.  kinda scary and i was correcting for
it with my hands on the wheel until i decided to do
some investigation hence my flushing of the fluid.   

gurus please shine your great knowledge on my
humbleness.

sincerely,

paul k
