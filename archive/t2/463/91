Seems to me that spraying foam in the cavities, regardless of whether or not 
the cavity is designed to shed water or not, is going to trap moisture 
between the foam and the steel from condensation. If one was going to do 
this, it might be good to spray a cavity wax in the cavities you were going 
to spray your foam in before the foam. 3M makes such a cavity wax and they 
also make a pillar foam and a flexible foam. 3M foam is not too expensive but 
I think the applicator is like $50. Might be better off with the great stuff 
for the price. The cavity wax is only like $13 for a quart and you can get 
the applicator wand for around $11 and the applicator gun for $30. You can 
also modify a long brake line to spray this stuff way down in some cavities. 
Just make sure you never want to run some wires in whatever cavities your 
going to put your foam in. My 2 cents
