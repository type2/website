I have a '72 with Pertronix and a 009 dizzy.  (vacuum lines
disconnected/plugged)

My timing is set at about 24 degrees BTDC.   The bus runs great.  Really
really great.  People often comment on how well she runs.

I've driven 40,000 miles in the last year and average 21 MPG on the highway
and have never touched the Pertronix.

I have no idea why this setup works, but it does.  Go figure.

Try setting your timing around 20 BTDC, see if it works for you...
