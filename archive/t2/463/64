Okay, I'm throwing in my opinion on cheap yet effective sound-proofing
and even rust proofing

Go to page 3240 of the McMaster Carr Catalog http://www.mcmaster.com/
and scroll to the bottom. They sell 5 gallon buckets of Vibration
Damping Compound and 5 different types Adhesive-Back Damping Sheets at
very good prices. It looks like the Polymeric mastic sheet would do a
good job and its only $14.62 for a 32"X54" roll. Try to beat that
anywhere else.

I just did a search on Vibration Damping Compound. It turned up a ton of
stuff.

I also thought that some of the buckets of asphaltic and elastomeric
roofing that is sold at Home Depot would do a good job also.

There is also another product that I ran across that looks interesting.
Its not as low cost as inexpensive as the McMaster Carr stuff, but may
have a place in our buses. Sani-Tred http://www.sanitred.com/ makes a
product called LRB (Liquid Rubber Base) It can be applied to any
thickness. When mixed with TAV (Thickening Activator) it looks like it
could be rolled onto the underside of the roof. Looks like it would be
an excellent undercoating also.
