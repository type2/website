Hiya Seth,

       Along with the standard things you'll need:

Internal snap-ring pliers to get the wrist pins out.
One-half inch breaker bar or ratchet to get the flywheel off
(Also, if you don't have air tools a 3' pc. of 2" pipe for a snipe. That 
flywheel nut is about 80 lbs.)
Little yogurt or coffee containers to keep all your bolts and stuff labeled 
and safe.
Gear puller to get your dizzy gear and timing gear off. Or take to your mach. 
shop for inspection.
A long angled needle nose pliers to help get the push rod tubes off.

That will get it into enough pieces to get you in trouble :>)
