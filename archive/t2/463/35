Subject: Bus soundproofing - a long-lost URL

Hey folks...

A while ago, I ran across a web page that had a pretty complete 
description of a project to sound-proof a Bus.  The page discussed 
using expanding foam insulation to fill body panels, "NASA padding" 
lining the engine compartment, undercoating, vapor barriers, and other 
stuff.

I thought for sure a URL for the page had been posted to type2(-at-), but I 
can't find it, and Google is letting me down quite possibly for the 
first time in my life.

Anyone here remember this?  Even better, anyone have the URL?

Soundproofing (at least partial - I don't want to pull the entire 
interior apart right now) seems like a nice fall/winter project that 
isn't too disruptive of the drivability, that would also have some nice 
side-effects (most notably making it easier to listen to JGB while 
driving down Oak St. :-)
