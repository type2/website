Subject: I think my handle is opening backwards?

When you guys go to open up the commando door, which way do you pull the
handle in order for the sliding door to open? Do you pull it up? Or down?

Seems the indentations in the door would suggest that you would pull it
up. However, on my Bus, you pull the handle down. Just wanted to make
sure. I found a mint sliding interior door handle at the junkyard, and
when I attached it, it turns out that the handle seems to open backwards
(from the inside) at least. Like.. I have to pull it towards the front of
the bus, rather than pull it towards the rear of the bus? Am I just
crazy, or is this backwards?


Thanks!

Todd
