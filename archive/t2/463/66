Subject: 5 Speed? Tell me more!

I have a 1976 with the standard 4 speed tranny.  I
regularly drive my bus at 120KM an hour.  Another list
member mentioned having a 5 speed trany.  Is the 5th
gear higher than the 4th gear on my trany or is it
just an extra low?  Let me know because i'm constantly
driving at 4000+ RPM
