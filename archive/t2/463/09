well, i figured that since my 73 hadn't had the points
replaced since new i'd give her a petronix upgrade. 
she doesn't seem to like it too much though and is
coughing and spitting all over the place and when i
rev her up she misses and coughs and spits.  you'd
think she was protesting technology or something.  i
tried to time her but can't get it set to 5 degrees
atdc but she idles at about 10 degrees btdc.

gurus, rescue me.
