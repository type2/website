List,

   Thanks for all your help with the problem of not being able to go over 30 
mph....  it is getting better but i still have some problems.

I have so far

   1. gapped the points- new points
   2. checked and found a vacume leak
   3. checked and changed the timing from 12 to 10
   4. replaced spark plugs and wires
   5. new cap and rotor

The car is still running kinda off.  It has a continuous bah, bah, sound 
from the exhaust kind of like a rythmic small backfire.  I checked the coil 
and it has a strong yellow spark.  i put another coil in and the same strong 
yellow spark.  I am pretty sure the second coil is brand new..... is there 
another reason why the spark isn't bright blue besides a bad coil?

The bus now is still hesitating at high rpms. and it isn't running as smooth 
as it should...

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated
