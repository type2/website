Subject: Front door reassemble sequence?

Greetings list,

Well I'm busy putting back together my 78 Westy after last summers paint 
job. So far I have the doors and seals on and almost all the glass in 
(windshield a joy). Next is the pop top paint project. Its amazing how easy 
the slider door closes when it is clean/lubed and the worn nylon block is 
replaced. Really easy to do.  I can't believe how many buses I've had that 
the slider was hard to close. Can't believe I lived with it for so long. I'd 
encourage everybody to give that rear hinge/support some love.

Anyway, for a question.

Its been a year since I took apart the front doors. I have another bus that 
I am currently driving to look at to see what goes where. That's the easy 
part. I managed to reassemble the drivers side door today. Turned out decent 
but added some words to my vocabulary. I'd rather do CV joints or grind my 
own face into a brick wall than these doors. In an effort to have the pass. 
side go better what's the sequence? I'm not talking door 
handles/locks/latches/armrests/panels just the glass and seals. This is for 
a '78 Westy.

for installation is it?

1. install window roller mechanism (that the window crank attaches to), big 
"U" shaped.
2. Install outer scraper and "chrome"
3. place large window insde door
4. install vent/wing widow assembly (glass, frame, seals, felt channel)
5. install inside scraper
6. install "L" shaper felt channel
7. bolt large window to window roller mechanism

Or is it some other order?

Thanks,
Brandt Hart
