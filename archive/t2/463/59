Jason,

Yeah I used that stuff too on my Econoline. One word of advice, you have to
apply in very warm weather or using some form of heat gun. I tried doing it
in November in CT and the stuff was really tough to work with. Also, the
adhesive sucked. I used it to cover the floor of my truck but where I tried
to apply it vertically (in the door, front of truck (like a bus bulkhead))
and after about a month it fell off. It's about 1/4"-1/8" thick, but it's
like working with small sheets of tar!
