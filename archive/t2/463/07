Subject: Double Cab FS: Midwest

I realize that you guys prefer the newer busses, but if anyone is interested
in a NICE split Doublecab(1960), see a couple pics at the link below.  A
description will be forthcoming soon. $9200. Fun, fun vehicle if you'd
consider trying an oldie! This truck seats six and hauls your plywood at the
same time. Needs nothing.
68-79 content: Check the pics and see the original late 70's westy camp
stools I am selling.  (NON-repro!) One is on ebay now along with the early
ladder and hazet kit.  The stool is NO RESERVE and just fifty bucks...WOW.
Of all VW parts/accessories I have searched for over the years, a late 70's
westy stool was hands down the most difficult item to find.  It took years
to get these 2!
