Andy,

Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problems described by the two posters.  As
I read it:

Zack says that when he turns the key to the start position he gets no
response.  After he crawls under the bus and jumps the solenoid then
operates the key it starts normally.

Vincent writes that when he turns the key the bus, "It just keeps trying
to start, but it won`t until after about five attempts." I am interpreting
this as the starter motor is operating and the engine is cranking but not
starting.

In the first instance I believe that the solenoid is sticking and that
with line losses there is insufficient amperage to unstick it.  By
crawling under the bus and shorting the terminals Zack is unsticking the
solenoid and it works fine from the key until the next time he gets the
bus hot and it sticks again.  The WR-1 relay will increase the amperage to
the solenoid and will help him not to have to crawl or push so much.  You
are correct that eventually a new starter and a thorough cleaning of
contacts will also make this problem go away but the WR-1 kit is a lot
cheaper.

In the second case, since the starter motor is already spinning (as I read
his post) a relay won't help.  I didn't respond to him because I would
need to look at his bus to tell.  He could have vapor lock, he could have
a weak coil, or any of half a dozen fuel or electrical problems and will
need to run a fairly long diagnostic to figure out which of them it is. If
what Vincent means by "trying to start" is that the starter motor is not
spinning and that working the key in the ignition 4-5 times does break the
solenoid free after which it starts normally, then the relay would help
him, too.
