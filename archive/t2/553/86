Subject: SR17 automatic starter interchange

Will the SR17 starter fit all 12v years ?

I mean auto and manual?

I know you can put the SR17 in a 002 trans with the 210mm flywheel
specifically , can you put the SR17 on the 091 bellhousing with the 228mm flywheel?
I think the starter doesn't go in far enough to engage the flywheel,,, but I could
be wrong...
