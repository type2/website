Subject: URGENT--Color code, Green & Orange?

Hey guys, i am getting ready to paint my bus, i need the color code for 
that nice "78 Sage Green" (i think) and the famous "burned orange" (i 
think), am sure that the orange was a 74 color, but is there another 
Orange????

Thanks a million, please e-mail me if you have any answer!
