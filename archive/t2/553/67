Scott,

Just one question-

What's the benefit of dropping in a oil temp gauge that you can't keep
an eye on when your driving the vehicle?

Or any gauge for that matter?

What--ya gotta stop every 5 minutes to run out back to check and see
what's going on?

This for sure doesn't sound like an efficient way of keeping an eye on
what's happening while your driving---

I'm not concerned whats going on while I'm parked--

I know--I'll take out my tach, engine oil temp, trans oil temp, head
temp, and ammmeter's and mount them on the rear engine cover.

"Excuse me honey-- I have to stop and go check my gauges"

Crazy Stuff---
