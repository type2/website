One answer--

Get rid of the Hippy, Mountain William wiring and get it done right. --

Why does anyone do this kinda stuff to a vehicle ??

L A Z Y---

I for one wanna know whats going on, when I want to--right in front of
me as I motor about.

I know about any "Funky Symptoms" before they become a problem--right in
front of me--from the dash board display, at which time I can take
evasive, precautionary procedures.

Running back to the engine when you want to know how hot the oil temp is
on a long pull, or on a high end run is insane--

A bit too cave man style.

It is 2004 isn't it ?--:>)

I'm getting rid of my battery--and going back to a hand crank-- tubed
tires, and maybe kerosine headlamps too--

Cheap?--  Yes

Easy?--Yes

Convenient?--No

Readable on the roll?--No

Problems detectable in an instant?--No

If ya wanna check you oil temperature while your parked in your
driveway--sitting still-- this would be the way to go--

Nuts---

Well, oil maintains it's temperature for a pretty long time. If you're
getting funky symptoms or just want to know what the oil is like after a
long drive, you can head back and drop this thing in for a minute.
I know it's just a snapshot, and can't provide any trending information,
but it also forces us all to check our oil more frequently than we
probably would otherwise... ;-)
My bus is loaded with "hippie wiring" (lots of mickey-mouse jobs,
shorts, etc) and adding more wiring is not appealing to me. But I'm
still curious how my temps are... This is a cheap and easy way to get
one of the temps...
