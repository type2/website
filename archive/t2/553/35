I have one on my camper. It's not plug and play - Westfalia modified the
front frame rail and put in a sturdy box construction in which the spare
sits. The bumper is supported by two brackets and the space in between the
bumper and body has plastic covers. What you see on the pictures is the
fiberglass cover that hides it all. You have to undo two huge "thumb" screws
from the inside to remove the cover.
