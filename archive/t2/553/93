I installed a relay in my 74 Camper to give power to the Radio[s] when the key is in
the ignition.

The key doesn't have to be on,, just in far enough to have the buzzer work

I used the WR-1 style bosch relay ,, the ones I find near the starter and pull out
and throw away :-)

any small SPST relay will work  431.951.253G  or the ones from the stereo store or
surplus place for $1 to $5

term
30 - fused power from fuse panel
87 - connect to radio[s]
85 - jumper to term 30
86 - terminal SU on ignition switch H6

It appears this won't work on the 76 and later buses...
