Subject: gas mileage

Just before EveryBus, I was tinkering and tinkering in an effort to improve
the terrible 12mpg I was getting. A thorough cleaning of the upper *and* lower
parts of the oil bath air cleaner improved it to 19.4 mpg on the first reading
to EveryBus!
Oh, ga$ just went to $2.05 for the high test, but I smugly quipped to the gas
station cashier, "I'm getting 17.3 mpg."
I meant that as good, but the guy shrugged and said, "It could be worse."
Sheesh....
What are you other listees getting on your mileage?
