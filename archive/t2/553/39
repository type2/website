Subject: RE: [T2] Starter Question

Well when I got in to drive to work on Fri, I got nothin when I turned
the key. I had juice, but nothing when I turned the key. So I thanked my
stars that I parked facing downhill and started off. When it was time to
come home, I had to push start.

Here's where I am right now:
1)When I bridge connections on solenoid, starter spins and sound great
2)When I bridge solenoid to ignition, starter turns fine.

So after this I climbed back in and it started right up. So whats up? I
don't want to always have to park on a hill.

Thanks
