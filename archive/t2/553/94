I did post a
description of my digital meat thermometer, which is small and can be
left on all the time- you would be amazed how long it takes the engine
to cool to ambient!
The kind George Lyle mentions I have seen with a bent sender that could
be straightened.
--------------------------------------------------------
Shop Rite or other food stores sell $10-$20 straight meat thermometers
which are digital- I unhooked the metal tube that holds the sensor and
extended it with a standard 12" long brass tube from a hobby shop (take
the therm. with you to determing closest covering diameter).   At least
the last 1.5" of the sender must be exposed, and the total brass tube I
used was 10".  The sender cannot rest on the bottom or you might get
false readings from the heat sink action.  Use any stiff rod (bike
spoke?) to determine the total length vs your dipstick length.   To
prevent the tube from bottoming out, I took some brass plate (the 3/4"
wide stuff at the hobby shop) with a hole for the brass tube drilled
into it and  soldered it at the right distance.   To prevent it from
bouncing out, I took a narrow width piece (3/16") cut from the plate)
about 2" long and soldered each end along the tube just under the stop
plate with a slight bulge in the center.  I used telephone wiring to
bridge the distance from the cab (where the readout is) back to the
sender.   You can use either 4 wire round cable or one of those 25 ft
"extensions" that may have 2 wire inside.  You can reserve the other 2
wires of a 4-wire for a RPM gauge I suppose.  Poke the sheathed wire
through the brass tube, and then strip 2 wires so as to solder their
ends to the wires coming from the sensor tube- the sensor sits at the
bottom of the pointy tube.  Be sure to stagger the soldered joints so
they cannot short the sensor.  Can't remember how I covered them so they
don't short on the brass tube- but I did use epoxy
to immobilise them within the tube- fill the brass tube with epoxy,
slide it over the epoxy covered sender tube so at least the last inch is
exposed.  Slower set epoxy is quite resistant to heat so don't worry
about it melting.  I used a few turns of platic tape around the part
sticking out beyond the upper plate to provide a strain relif against
kinking at the end.  Works fine.  A small button battery in the readout
runs for many months nonstop, and there is a shutoff switch.   In the
Westy, it's easy to run the wire through the spare tire well (in the
closet), behind the cabinet, under the mat by your seat, and then under
the dash for the small readout.    MB
