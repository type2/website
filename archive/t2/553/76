Subject: FI wiring order

I was performing some electrical tests on my FI wiring harness and I noticed
the injector wiring doesn't match the wiring diagram. The diagram shows:

N30 #1, N31 #2, N32 #3, N34 #4

...but I see:

N30 #2, N31 #1, N32 #4, N34 #3

Did anyone else notice this? I labeled the wires before I removed the
harness so I'm sure which injector connectors are which.
