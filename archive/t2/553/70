Again we're comparing a $3 version to a $50 version. Could the standard
Porsche markup be that high? ;-) I would bet the expensive one come from a
reputable gauge company instead of China.

I contacted them in Jan about making a Type 4 version. The current versions
they have are 7", 9" and 14" in length and the bus dipstick is about 11.4".
Bob said, "If the length is close to one we already make, we can machine a
different collar to fit yours". I didn't pursue it further based on the
usefulness of it but contact Bob Futterrer if you are interested.

With the even increasing price of the Sir Tools P201 engine yoke they
recently started to offer just the support brace so you can hook up to a
generic engine stand. P201WR.
