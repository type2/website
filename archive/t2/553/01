Subject: Hi/Lo Beams + Wipers Stopped Working

Hello, I need some help w/ my 1973 Campmobile please!

My High / Low beams stopped working at the same time as my wipers.  The first
look at the fuses seems ok.

Does anyone know what could cause all of these to go out at once?

I'd like to take the van out tonight and would much appreciate any quick ideas
on what to look for.

Thanks in advance,
Shawn.
