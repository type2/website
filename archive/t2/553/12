Subject: rebuilding a type IV 2 liter

Hay listers.



Ok I now have 2 2.0 liter type IV engines; my stock '78 with a weber pro.
Carb. (this is motor for my daily driver '78 bus). and the second motor I
bought from a friend a couple of weeks ago, (vary dirty but good for what I
want), I found out on Monday that this (the second motor) motor has the
friken square port heads making it a '79 motor (of course my original motor
has OVAL ports).



Ok this morning I found out that one of my heads (as one of my preveiouse
posts mentioned sucked the intake valve into it's self) is not rebuildabel ,
and as the square port heads will not work with my '72-'74 exhaust I am
buying another head for the second time in five years :-(.



Now that I have a second motor I'm thinking of rebuilding it, and after
reading the post from Jake Raby (RE: [T2] Head problems again/911 engine?) I
want to replace the hydraulic cam/lifters with solid lifters, ok here are my
questions:

has any done this?

Where do I get the cam shaft?

Where do I get the lifters?

Are their any manufactures I should avoid?

What else should I change (from stock) while I have the case cracked?



Thanks
