Folks,


If ya want the really really hi temp stuff, you want to visit someplace
where they carry airplane parts....and it is "silver".

I have a buddy(A&P mechanic) that gave me a whole bottle of the 
stuff...says good to 2500 degrees right on the bottle.

Don't remember who made it, but can look if anyone is really interested.


Cheers, dave
