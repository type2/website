Ok--Good--

Real good PPG web page--and it has the prices on the paint--
I don't think it's current because Deltron was discontinued 2 years
ago--

But just for grins check out the price on a gallon of Concept Bright
Orange--or any of the Reds--

And these prices do not include hardner, or reducer--


Hold onto yuor shorts---



Colour code - Orange

Hi Ben....I just looked the colour codes up for my "new" 74 Kombi and
mine is L-20B Bright orange. Check out

www.autocolorlibrary.com/scripts/depot.exe?pgm=aclgate.bbx   to see
yours.
