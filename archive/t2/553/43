Forget about using the Dutch Boy Farm & 
Barn Paint Anthony-- 

You have one word in your message correct-- 

Belly up to the counter with some "Bens" in hand and unload-- 

The last red Mack tandem dump truck I did in Concept--the paint alone
was $2400.00--no hardner--no reducer--n sandpaper--no tape, no primer. 

Yeowza !! 

So how much will it cost to get a whole Bus or Van done ??
