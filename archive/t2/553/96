Subject: RE: Shipping a bus

i bought my '79 bus on ebay...it was in CA and I was in TX...solution...flew out and drove it back...pheonix was scary due to the fact that I drove through in the height of last summer;s fuel shortage...cost me about $400...plus all the miles on the bus
 
if you don;t want to drive it off the bat...you could always get a pal with a truck to drive you out there...then get an auto-transport trailer from UHAUL...then tow it back home...roughly $500
 
there are also companies that can transport a vehicle for you...i looked into this last summer when i bought my van. it will run you at least $1000.
