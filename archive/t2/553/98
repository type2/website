So she's cranking over---no fire in the hole--

Only when she's hot?

I would have to say that the Bus is Vapor locking--

No juice Bruce----

Start from the top---

Full Tune up, Timing, fuel filter---


When's the last time the vehicle has had all of this?


Sounds like the gas could be boiling in the carb---and turning into a
vapor---hence the lock--no go Joe--

Is there any bakeolite spacer's under the carb to isolate it from the
engine heat??

If not try that--
