Subject: Power for Timing Light?

Is there a better spot in the engine bay to get power for a timing light?  
I've been using my jumper cables to connect to the battery under the front 
passenger seat and it's really annoying me.

Can I pick 12v off the coil? then ground to the engine?

Thanks

Kevin
