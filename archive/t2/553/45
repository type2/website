I think that would be a dandy idea there Stan--

Take inventory prior to ordering.

Then buy the grinder,  weld through primer, then the welder--the
sheild--

Here ya go--spending them Ben''s again--:>)

Just "purchased" a 74 Kombi with a few problems, among them a badly
rusted sliding door channel (bottom). Anyone restored one of those
lately? How many pieces are we talking about, 3? I guess it's a weldemin
job. CIP1 has the parts but the pics in their catalog look kind of
ambiguous. Does one have to tear the whole thing apart before ordering?
