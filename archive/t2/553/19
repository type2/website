Subject: Re: [T2] Composite Drum on '71 rear?

The silver aluminum anti seize has a preponderance of disappearing much
faster than the gold high temp anti seize--

Why?

Can't say--except if used on the brake hardware and the center of the
drums, that fit onto the hub, the stuff will still be there when your
ready to yank them again--

Both distributed by Permatex--

George--I ain't trying to put out your fire--
I just have found and used, a better, long lasting product--that's all.

Love and Kisses,

TK
