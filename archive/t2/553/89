Subject: CD player wiring question

So ... I had a CD player installed (damn - I'm so full of BS - I was committed
to keeping the old cassette deck.)  Anyway - it was installed and with the new
infinity speakers in the doors - whoa - its like driving around with Johnny
Cash sitting on the Z-bed (me and Johnny share a birth day.)

Anyway - when the key is completely off (1) - CD player is off - when you turn
the key there is sort of position where nothing happens but it kinda feels
like a spot to leave the key (2) - then turn the key again and the oil and gen
lights come on and CD player comes on (3) - then turn the key more and bus
starts (4).

My question - is there really a position 2 - is there a point at which, while
turning the key, the CD player or radio or whatever should get power prior to
the oil and gen lights getting power?

TIA
