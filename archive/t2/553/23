Josh
I didn't see a reply to this,,

sorry, I can't help you with the answer , I have the "WESTFALIA" decals on my
74, which I placed there, before this list existed,, so I didn't know I did
something "wrong" :-)
Here is a few photos that show the same place I put my decals..

Very scenic shots!

The "Horse" Decals were on the side of my 74 luggage rack originally


I wanted to know if you meant the "Horse" decals on the side, or the "Westfalia"
Decals on the front/rear ?
