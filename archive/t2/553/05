Subject: Re: [T2] Bus getting harder and harder to start!

You might want to talk about the symptoms further.  When you go for that
"first start" I'm assuming the engine turns over OK, it just doesn't start
quickly?  When it does start, does it "run" fairly slowly, going "chug,
chug, chug", threatening to die all the time, or is it more an issue that
it'll start up, idle OK (very briefly) and then just quit?

The fact that you floored the accelerator pedal (I'm assuming this is
sitting in the driveway) and got the engine running would suggest to me you
might have a "too rich" situation on startup; holding the pedal to the floor
gives the engine lots more air which will allow it to burn off the excess
gas, typically accompanied by quite a bit of smoke out the exhaust pipe.

If it's fairly warm now where you're at a faulty thermo-time switch might be
triggering the cold start valve even though it's not needed.

>    I have been blessed with a relatively trouble free Bus for a while now,
so I really can't complain too much.  We made it to EveryBus 2004 and back
without a a scratch, and the little puppy we adopted there (we named her
Every!) has almost doubled in size. (Still working on that housebreaking
thing...) Anyway, my '78 Bus has been getting more and more difficult to
start, and then when it does start it wants to die out right away.  This
only happens with the first start of the day after sitting all night (or
day); if I go drive around, shut her off and then come back after I'm done
whatever I'm doing, she starts fine.  My mechanic has told me the spark
plugs are good, the points are set fine, the cold start valve is not it.  I
can't say that I've personally checked all these things, but I trust this
guy, especially since he never charges me a dime unless he can find out
what's wrong and fix it.  But I sense that the collective knowledge of the
List might be greater than his on this, and certainly greater than mine,
since I know next to nothing.  What is another likely culprit for the hard
starts?  I was able to get it going yesterday by just flooring the gas and
revving the engine, which I know is NOT GOOD, but I had to get my kids to
school.  Help!  Thanks, Beth in NJ
