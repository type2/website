Subject: Diesel Clarification

Just to clarify my previous post, I'm absolutely not interested in
converting a gasoline engine to burn diesel, not even really sure if that
could be done although I'll never say never.

I'm looking to throw a diesel engine into my bus which is currently gas
powered. Does that make sense?

Thanks,

Giles
