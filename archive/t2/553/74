Hello Guys and jamie     I agree whole heartly with jamie on this  I know it 
sounds like the Herr Dr Tim But it is the correct way One of the biggest 
problems nowadays is getting good quality parts. I wish I had a nickel for 
everytime someone brings me a car saying I just put such and such in so that cant be 
the problem just to find they bought the cheapest  POC     that they could find 
and sure enough it is the problem. Saw a brand new bosch blue coil from 
mexico that the bracket that came with it wouldn't even fit the coil, how hard can 
that be!!   On starters I wish again for a nickel for everyone that was 
changed but not the tranny  bushing which was causing the starter to drag.  The 
worse was where the guy took his door bell button and front  door light switch to 
use as a starter switch and ingnition  right out of West by god Virginia  I 
bet he missed the front stoop light  LOL    : Later and have fun  mark dearing
