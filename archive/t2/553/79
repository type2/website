That sounds like a find!

The dipstick is a friction fit in the tube, so you might have to figure
out a way to stop the thermometer from blowing out if it is a looser fit.

I found a digital thermometer marketed by Pyrex at Sears.  it has a thin
metal proble on the end of a 4 foot wire with a plug to go into the
display. My intent is to make a longer "extension" wire to connect the
display with the thermocouple.  The plugs look like mini headphone plugs,
but are smaller, so I need to dig around to make an approprate
extension.

I had the intent of putting it into my bus, but other
interesting uses intervened and I need to go buy another one.  :)

One neat feature of this thermometer is that you can set an alarm
temperature and the thing will beep when your engine is "done."  The
display has a magnet on its back designed to stick to a handy metal
surface.
