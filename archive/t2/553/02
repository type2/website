Subject: [T2]bank teller doesnt like my bus

ok so this freaky thing...?
i went through the bank teller line in the bus while back and my battery just quit out of nowhere...?was the battery drained to much to crank????????
well now hmmmm few weeeks later and brand new battery been running fine and well lets try this again...
have had no problems whatsoever.... and also crunk right up before the trip to the bank.~!~
 
well back at the bank first time since that day it died before and in the same place in line where you grab the thingy to send back to them through the air shoot...
well got it sent back and tried to start the bus and just a un hunh.... thats it.. just like before...
now this is to wierd..?
my question is there maybe a magnet or something in the concrete there that could be doing something to my battery while i am sitting there waiting for my cash back...?
 
just to freaky for me man... battery test that it was drained also... when i got home.}}}}}..
thank goodness i carry a spare battery... each time i had to use it to get home...
just is really confusing what could be doing this at the bank... or well is it very coincidental that is all i think///
thanks for the laughs and comments...
peace
Cha
