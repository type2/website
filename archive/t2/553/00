It is Friday and I think I'll just comment on something that I think is 
incredible, wonderful and almost unique.  I have finished reading today on 
this list a series of well-written messages in English, sent by Joco Nuno 
Ribeiro from Portugal.

He is talking to a group of people in a country on the other side of his 
ocean, mostly about finding sources of metal to repair his inherited 1968 
European bus, but other things also. And he has discovered the archives and 
a whole list of US suppliers.

I didn't see any answers that included parts suppliers in Europe. Maybe I 
missed them.  And, maybe all the people on the list haven't had time to 
send him those sources, which surely must exist.

I hope some of the listers in The Netherlands, Spain, France, Germany and 
England, etc, read his messages and suggest sources closer to Portugal.

Maybe the guys at The Bus Depot will share with him a few sources they know 
about in Europe.

I'd be in trouble, if all the people on this list lived on another 
continent and spoke another language in all their messages, and talked 
about places nearly half way around the globe.

The distance Joco Nuno Ribeiro has gone today in bridging that gap is 
amazing, in my humble opinion. I'd just like to welcome him.
