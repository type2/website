I have never looked at the numbers on the harness,, I just connect them what ever
way looks good,,, it doesn't matter which one goes where,, you can interchange all 4
any way you want.
Obviously you would have a hard time connecting the #1 or #2  to #3 or #4 as the
harness wire length doesn't work

I was performing some electrical tests on my FI wiring harness and I noticed the
injector wiring doesn't match the wiring diagram. The diagram shows:

N30 #1, N31 #2, N32 #3, N34 #4

...but I see:

N30 #2, N31 #1, N32 #4, N34 #3
 Did anyone else notice this? I labeled the wires before I removed the harness so
I'm sure which injector connectors are which.
