Here's the deal George--

It wasn't #72182 Mack Standard red--

The customer wanted to match his 99 Chevy pickup---
GM Victory red.

Now listen to this---

This rock headed Deutschlander refused to pay attention to his truck's
doctor--

The Mack red is maybe, at the most a half shade more orange--barely
noticable--and it's a quarter of the price .

Just for the added red pigment in the color's is the reason for the
price difference--that's all--

Most all of the pigment's in paint come from China--somebodies getting
rich on this deal--and it ain't me--:>)

JD green is pretty pricey but red's are the worst--

Porsche Red is way on top of the list--

Paint it Black---:>)


Adios,
