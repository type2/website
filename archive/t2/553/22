Subject: Bay Bus trannys in or near Cicninnati

I have tried to send this email with John Baker's post (only) twice, 
but it keeps bouncing back stating that there is too much quoted 
material.

John was asking about any trannys near where he lives and I was trying 
to tell him that our friend Todd Hill's last known location was in 
Cincinnati.  I know he has (had) a lot of bus trannies.
