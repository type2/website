They can be very tight!  If your drums had the retaining screws, they are
composite drums.

More penetrating oil, perhaps some heat, and persistant tapping and
wiggling.

You could remove the axle nut and take the hub off with the drum for more
vigorous massage.

Once the drum is off the hub, clean the mating surfaces with fine
sandpaper and apply a film of anti-sieze to prevent future corrosion.
Make sure the drum slides on and off easily before you reinstall it.
