Subject: Hard start

When The weather gets hot, the bus is hard to start. When I turn the key all 
the way to start the bus. It just keeps trying to start, but it won`t until 
after about five attempts.
This only happens when the temperature outside is hot or if the bus has been 
running and the bus is hot. In the morning when the temp and bus are cool, the 
bus starts immediately. Any answer will be appreciated

Thank You Very Much
