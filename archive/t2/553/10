No adapter will turn a gasoline fueled pancake VW aircooler engine into a 
diesel.

You will need to remove the existing engine and adapt an existing diesel 
engine to fit your vehicle.

I am privately sending some information about doing that. You probably 
would be better off buying an existing diesel powered bus. They do exist, 
stock from the factory. Vanagons....in the 1980's. Very underpowered in the 
opinion of many bus enthusiasts.

Here is a reference:

and another:

If the type 2 list server strips these references, browse to ebaymotors.com 
and search passenger cars for VW, then bus/vanagon, and finally sort for 
diesels.
