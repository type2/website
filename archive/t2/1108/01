Subject: What have you done for your bus lately?

I recently purchased the Hella H4 upgrade kit and two new bulbs from Bus Depot.  I installed them the very day they showed up and they fit perfectly and work well.  While I was at it, I buffed the headlight rings with fine steel wool as they had a thin coating of oxidation that had built up over the past few years.  I'm keeping the old Sylvania sealed beam headlights just in case, as there is nothing wrong with them.  Up to the attic to add to the huge pile of old/spare parts I have been accumulating for 20+ years.

This got me thinking about my original 37 year old wiring and how much brighter the headlights might look if I installed a new, heavier-gauge wire to the fuse panel.  I bought 20 feet of 8-gauge wire and some connectors but haven't installed it yet.

I also bought two new side window seals - I'm removing the jalousie windows (anyone need a set, with ultra-rare inside rubber trim?) and installing sliders.  Hopefully in time for some late-Spring camping.
