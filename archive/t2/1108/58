Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for a Riviera Camper Bus .::Salem, Oregon::.

is it a sportsmobile...?   I have never heard of a sportswagen camper?
the sportsmobile had a "penthouse" that popped straight up, like a riviera
.. but they didn't have the front fibreglass luggage rack, it was more like
a boat with a chrome rail to strap stuff to above the driver.
