Who has some they want to get rid of really cheap.

I've only found them at Wolfsburg West and their price is $0.75 EACH
and I need about 50 or 60 of them.

I'm preserving the interior of my '70 Campmobile by removing the
original panels. I'm doing birch door panels and they have 21 clips
each. 

I have most (maybe all) of the clips from the slider door panel but the
rear hatch panel is gone and so are the clips. So I need replacement
clips for the doors and rear hatch and possibly a few for the slider
panel.

I'm hoping someone has a bag of spares pulled from old buses they'll
sell for about half of new cost but if not I'll spend the $50 to get a
bag from WW.
