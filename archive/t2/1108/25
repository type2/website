Subject: Compression

Greetings,

Not trying to start a new compression thread here, just can't seem to get past
the mailer-daemon.
In addition to everything that's been mentioned, one thing that I do to give
each cylinder a "fair shake" is to hook up my battery charger & flip it to the
60 amp "boost" setting during cranking, to rule out declining battery voltage
as a factor. I suppose that might inflate the readings a bit, but I'm mostly
interested in the relative numbers.
