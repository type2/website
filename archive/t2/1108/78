Subject: What have you done for your bus lately?

Got it back together and running after a long time at the curb during
which I cleaned the engine, installed a Mexi thermostat to replace the
blown original, knocked a half pound of coal from the intake heat
risers, cleaned the carb, scraped clean and conductive greased the
ground straps and starter wires, discovered that the spare
transmission it came with had the wrong throwout bearing and
bellhousing so I couldn't swap it in to replace the one that howls
when it is warm, experienced why the Bentley says its best to remove
and replace the engine together with the transmission once I tried to
get the engine mated up to the trans by myself in the street with the
trans mounted, and killed the aftermarket oil temp gauge in such a way
that it is pegged at the high off the scale end even parked for hours,
everything off key in my pocket. Mostly real good, just the gauge
baffles me. But its just a gauge...
