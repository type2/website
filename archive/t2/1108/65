My Sportsmobile has the front fiberglass luggage rack. Looks just like
a Riviera. I've often wondered if they bought their tops from the same
supplier or if they made them in house.

 the sportsmobile had a "penthouse" that popped straight up, like a riviera
 .. but they didn't have the front fibreglass luggage rack, it was more like
 a boat with a chrome rail to strap stuff to above the driver.
