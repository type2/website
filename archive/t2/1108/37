Subject: Re: [T2] What have you done for your bus lately?

Karl used to always wince and give me a hard time about using my Weber 
progressive and especially the 009 distributor.  But it always worked so 
well for me that I just couldn't bring myself to rip it out and try to 
get FI and a new distributor working.  I've always been enamored with 
the thought of Megasquirt as I'm a bit of a tech-head and would love to 
be able to monitor things with my laptop.  But that is for a time when I 
have plenty time and don't need to drive the bus.  It was my daily 
driver for a few years and I needed it to drive daily.  (Redundant, I 
know.)  I believe you guys when you say performance will improve but I 
always have to balance that against the money and especially the time to 
install a new system and get it up and running.  It's probably a 
significant investment for a relatively minor increase in performance.  
(Oh oh, I think I heard Karl moaning again....)  Like I said, mine 
always ran like a top with my current set-up.  And it is simple enough 
that I can understand it and work on it.  Well, most of it.  But I'm 
still considering it.  Especially if I determine that this carburetor is 
toast.  Cheerio....
