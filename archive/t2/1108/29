Although I have welded and brazed on gas tanks, as a general thought, without,
very, VERY, careful preparation I wouldn't.  AND even if you don't blow
yourself to kingdom come, your talent with whatever you choose to weld with
better be damn good.  I recall Hoover describing his attempts to weld up leak
free tanks back in the day for the "Top of the World Tour" and I bet he welds
better than most, better than me for sure.  Perhaps when my TIG skills are a
bit better, I could do it with MIG but...  If you boil the tank out and think
your skills are up to it, by all means go for it.  For 99/100 people I'd try
the T or the little return accumulator first.
 
Chris's other question (although I don't know the answer) though makes
something occur to me for Timo, I don't know what the venting system on a carb
Euro tank is, but in some other applications I have simply used one of two
vent connections as a return connection on a FI retrofit (a Megasquirt on
something entirely different.)  If the Euro carb tank has 2 vents, this is a
potential alternative as well, and functionally probably won't cause many
issues except perhaps on a super full tank, parked on a big side angle, etc,
etc.

I'd go to a junkyard and find another VW new or old and cut out the fuel line
connection plus a few centimeters of steel around it. Weld this into your gas
tank and check for leaks by pressurizing the tank with air. Beware of gasoline
fumes when cutting or welding the tank.

My question for anyone that cares to comment is how different is the carbon
canister system from carb to fuel injection? My '78 VW van has an elaborate
stock series of vent tubes and check valves. I like their function and have
chosen to keep them intact.
