Okay. I'm game. After the CHT / GAMI thread, I decided I'm not happy
with stock dual Solex on my 74 bus. I don't like FI either, and
searching my memories, I decided my happiest busing times were on a
Weber progressive. Plus it keeps the engine compartment looking clean
and elegant like the early buses.

With the carbs out, I decided to clean up the engine compartment too.
Today I gave it its second scrub. Next will be rust treatment and
paint.

Since I couldn't go any further with everything wet, I decided to
continue my cleaning with the cab. I pulled the seats out and removed
the spare. Filled it with air and checked the specs and production
date (1999). Cleaned out all the dirt under the seats. Got too dark to
reinstall, so I just left them sitting for the night.

Intake manifolds have been cleaned and painted. Carb gone through. New
fuel hose and vacuum hose installed. New accelerator cable installed.
Throttle linkages lubed. Next step after finishing the engine
compartment will be to install the carb. Looking for a new mesh/gauze
type rectangular air cleaner. Can't believe they are $17 on ebarf, or
$10 for just the element. Found an element at dealparts.com for $5.60,
but if I go that route, that means I should take inventory and figure
out what else I need -- sigh -- Never enough time!
