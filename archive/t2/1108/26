Not a carb expert, but my understanding is that timing advance needs
to know manifold pressure. On early Type 1 motors (single port), the
advance nipple is actually on the manifold. My stock dual Solex on the
Type 4 motor also has it at the base of the carb. I think on the later
Solex single carbs it is up high, but taps into the idle bypass
circuit which bypasses the throttle plate and is actually exposed to
manifold vacuum.

The Weber document is good.
