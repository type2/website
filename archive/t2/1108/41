Subject: RE: [T2] What have you done for your bus lately?

Well I bought it (the single cab.)  And I titled it yesterday afternoon, and
ordered an SVDA (you all conned me into the real Bosch unit from CB
Performance) and rebuilt the 34 PICT 3 a couple nights ago.  And this weekend
I'll try to drag the tire machine out of my trailer (if I can get it past the
snow) and I'm going to put those '97 date code Conti's on it if my old Atlas
machine can do a wide 5 (which I think it will without an adapter.)   But I'll
probably have to make an adapter plate for my spin balancer anyway so we'll
see, maybe I'll cheap out and take it to a tire place cause the balancer is 3
phase and I'd have to drag the Rotophase out of the shop room to the garage to
run it.  My old bubble balancer did wide 5's quite adequately but it got
killed in the move up alas, oh well.  Then next week I hope to be driving it,
though it is hardly spring up here yet.  I did take some pictures of the 3
year old "driving" it as well.  Still got
 that pesky steering box issue but I got to see how bad that really is for
more than "around the block."
