Bob said  these things have an amazing limp home ability,

I agree... I put on over 5500 km .. valve seat dropped 3 days into the
vacation heading for Tall Ships in Halifax
so we continued on like nothing was wrong,, Cabot trail and everything,, adj
that valve every morning for the next 10 days.  it eventually sunk in 0.250"

Phil dropped a seat just north of Round Hill Va... we discussed the issue,,
and continued on to Greensboro NC, then all the way back to London On...
that has to be about 1600 km

Dave s engine fell off the trans and it drove for at least 900km... but that
has nothing to do with compression..
My fuel pump quit in chicago.. and I was able to drive to Albque and then to
Denver as long as the tank was over half full.....

they do have an amazing limp home mode!
