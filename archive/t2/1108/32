Subject: Normal voltage of a battery at rest?

So after thinking I had a slow battery drain, I'm not so sure. I bought a voltmeter that plugs into the cig lighter and charged my system right up. It topped out charging at 14.18 volts, then maintained at 13.40. I unplugged the charger and watched it over the next 48 hours. It continued to drop over the first 36 hours to a final stop at 12.38. Over the next 12 hours it stayed put there and seemed to have finally stopped dropping. The battery is a sealed battery that is 8 years old, so pretty old I think. So the question to the wizards is,
1) What is a "healthy" battery voltage at rest??
2) Is that too low a voltage to get my 33 yr old to crank reliably, so time for a hard start relay? It seems that if I crank it over when it's still dropping down right after a charge and showing 13+ volts it will fire quickly. At 12.38 very hesitant??? As per usual, thanks for the info,
Courtney
