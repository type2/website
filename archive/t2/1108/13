Typically, when cranking a cold engine with the starter, you can hear 
the flux of the starter working against compression, or not. That is 
enough to address other issues to get it started. Pull the plugs, 
then run the starter. Note how it just whirs when not working against 
compression. As well, with all plugs removed and the compression 
guage in one cylinder, note the difference in sound with the starter 
running and working against compression in only one cylinder. I can 
tell a lot generally about the engine just by listening to the starter.

A cold compression test will disclose if you have enough compression 
to start and run. If you have not less than around 85 lbs cold, then 
the starting issue is ignition or fuel related. Once running and 
warmed up, that 85 cold might improve a little or a lot.

The full compression test is primarily designed for monitoring over 
time the rate of wear and to identify long before failure the need to 
budget repair or rebuild for further service.
