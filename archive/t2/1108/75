I put a hole in my piston in bakersfield and had to drive over the 
grapevine to LA.  It wasn't pretty, but I made it.

If you had a dead injector, I would leave the plug in there as the 
pressure would help balance the engine.  If you take it out, then it's 
just letting that piston fly towards the heads putting things even more 
out of balance.
