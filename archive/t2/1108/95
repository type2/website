Subject: Re: [T2] Smokin' New Engine (literally :-(

Hi John -

I did 5k+ miles before the engine guy would consider following up, so I'm pretty sure it's not ring wear. I'll take a look and see if I can detect any stem wiggle before I take it in. Anyone know for sure whether these '78 type 4 motors had stem seals?

M

Mine freshly built engine had blowby with a consequence of oil mist
condensation on the deck lid for a really, really long time, maybe
2000 miles. I had about given up when it stopped. I think I had chrome
rings which take longer to seal.  I wouldn't count on "daily driving"
to break in your rings. I would guess long periods at operating
temperature are needed.

I'm not savvy to the specifics of the Type 4 head, but I know that the
mechanism he described of oil seeping past the valve stem is
legitimate. Doesn't explain why it wasn't taken care of in the
rebuild. Valve stem clearances should have been checked at that time
as well. It sounds like you've got a straight-shooter engine builder
though as he has stood behind his work and disassembled your motor to
see what's going on. I think if he thought you had excessive valve
guide/stem wear, he would rather take care of that than try to deceive
you with oil seals.

The engine-builder first said the rings needed to wear in - but that didn't
help (I drive the bus daily, so they must be well worn in by now). Then he
pulled the engine and checked the pistons/cylinders/rings/heads, and says they
look fine. His latest theory is that, when the bus stands for a while, oil is
seeping down the valve stems into the cylinder, and that is what gets burned
off when it starts. Does this sound far-fetched?

Don't forget that 44psi difference at cranking rpm is likely to be much 
less than at operating RPM, even idle.

I have also in the past run engines with 90psi compression that went 
many trouble-free miles and even passed California emissions.

More anecdotal evidence - when I moved into this house in 2001 there was 
an old (70's era) John Deere garden tractor left behind by the previous 
owner.  It was a 1-cylinder, air cooled 10hp engine.  Started and ran 
fine although it did burn oil.  Mowed with it for a few years before 
finally trading up.  Before I sold it I gave it a compression test, just 
for fun.  Would you believe 50psi?

I'm with you on the spread though. Being taught in auto shop that 10%
variance is allowed, 44psi variance makes me uncomfortable, but I
agree, the numbers are only something to make you feel bad because as
long as the engine runs passably, I'm not pulling it for a rebuild.

All efforts to resurrect it including wiping clean the hard drive failed.
I am using a borrowed computer to send this message.

Wonder what could be the trouble. If it works well enough to wipe the
drive, you ought to be able to reinstall.

Quite a lot of play in the steering.  When I look below the bus while
someone moves steering wheel - I first focus on the center pin and swing
lever.  Neither the swing lever nor the pin show any up and down movement.
It appears to me (keyboard player whose brave to get in and do good work on
the bus but NOT experienced mechanic) that the swing lever and center pin
bushings are doing just what they should.  I do have a center pin kit I can
replace sometime down the road...

Now that I have the pan underneath the pedals removed, viewing the drag link
is clear.  When the steering wheel is moved - the bushing(?) where the drag
link meets the swing lever raises up and down a good bit before motion is
transferred to back and forth movement of the swing lever.

Suggestions?  Seems I should replace the drag link.  They are $40 something,
right?  Any suggestions or suggested tools needed to do the job?  Always
feel better the more info I have before jumping in.  Going back to bentley
for drag link removal procedure info now.

Thanks,

Not certain if my terminology was correct.  Reading Bentley looks like my
term "swing lever" should be referred to as "relay arm", yes?

Off of steering box - the drop arm goes down - connects to drag link which
moves front to back - connects to relay arm which moves horizontally pivoted
by center pin - connects to tie rods.  Is that the right way to describe the
deal?

Thanks again,

Just replaced the drag link in my '70. Get it from Bus Depot.

You need a "thick" pickle fork to get it loose. Look for one with a
fairly steep ramp. Sometimes your FLAPS will let you "rent" such tools
for free or at a very low cost.

Get your wheels pointed straight and block them. After you remove the
old drag link make sure you have the new one adjusted to the same
length.

DO NOT bump that steering arm while you have the drag link off. Slide
out and go look at your steering wheel. Adjust it until it is
"straight" *ONLY* if it needs just couple inches one way or he other to
get it straight. If it's turned halfway 'round then you need to pull
the steering wheel later and put it back on right.

Attach the rear of the drag link. Then readjust the length at the front
until it lines up with your (now straight) steering arm hole. Tighten
down the lock nut and attach the front.

Get it seated and tightened down good then take the bus to a nearby
parking lot and drive some low speed figure-eights for a while. Then
crawl back under and check that everything is still tight.

Who has some they want to get rid of really cheap.

I've only found them at Wolfsburg West and their price is $0.75 EACH
and I need about 50 or 60 of them.

I'm preserving the interior of my '70 Campmobile by removing the
original panels. I'm doing birch door panels and they have 21 clips
each. 

I have most (maybe all) of the clips from the slider door panel but the
rear hatch panel is gone and so are the clips. So I need replacement
clips for the doors and rear hatch and possibly a few for the slider
panel.

I'm hoping someone has a bag of spares pulled from old buses they'll
sell for about half of new cost but if not I'll spend the $50 to get a
bag from WW.
