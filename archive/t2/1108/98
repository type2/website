Subject: 1970 camper - steering slop

In reading archives, Bentley and all I can find online it seems there are
varying opinions on best method to remove drag link.  There is consensus to
not hammer them out, - use a pickle fork, rent pullers, the Bentley
illustration shows a puller I don't recognize...  My question is - is this
tool pictured reasonable to remove the drag link from pitman arm and swing
lever?
