I can understand that.  Is it a character count limit?  Sometimes I get 
things by that I don't expect to and sometimes things get kicked that I 
think are short enough to go.  I don't mind it but I wish I knew how to 
limit it.  Sometimes it's hard to know what somebody is talking about 
without referring to the original material.  And I appreciate your 
service to the list.  Cheers...KR
