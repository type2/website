Why not use the whole tank (if it's a good one)?

 canister system from carb to fuel injection? My '78 VW van has an elaborate
 stock series of vent tubes and check valves. I like their function and have
 chosen to keep them intact.

My 74 has the two breather tubes that exit the tank to the left and
right and join in the engine compartment at the cannister. I've had
others with the filler neck return hose to the middle of the tank, but
this one doesn't have it. Check valves sound nice. I wonder about fuel
expansion and exit through the vent lines. Does fuel expand that much?
