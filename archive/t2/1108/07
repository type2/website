I've got the original windows with wind wings - yuk! Too stuffy on a
hot day! Been looking for jalousies. Also tempted by the new Bus Depot
offer on sliders and weighing that against the budget. Could take
yours, but I imagine shipping would be a hassle and expensive to boot!

sliders.  Hopefully in time for some late-Spring camping.
