Just replaced the drag link in my '70. Get it from Bus Depot.

You need a "thick" pickle fork to get it loose. Look for one with a
fairly steep ramp. Sometimes your FLAPS will let you "rent" such tools
for free or at a very low cost.

Get your wheels pointed straight and block them. After you remove the
old drag link make sure you have the new one adjusted to the same
length.

DO NOT bump that steering arm while you have the drag link off. Slide
out and go look at your steering wheel. Adjust it until it is
"straight" *ONLY* if it needs just couple inches one way or he other to
get it straight. If it's turned halfway 'round then you need to pull
the steering wheel later and put it back on right.

Attach the rear of the drag link. Then readjust the length at the front
until it lines up with your (now straight) steering arm hole. Tighten
down the lock nut and attach the front.

Get it seated and tightened down good then take the bus to a nearby
parking lot and drive some low speed figure-eights for a while. Then
crawl back under and check that everything is still tight.
