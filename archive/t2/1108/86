Not certain if my terminology was correct.  Reading Bentley looks like my
term "swing lever" should be referred to as "relay arm", yes?

Off of steering box - the drop arm goes down - connects to drag link which
moves front to back - connects to relay arm which moves horizontally pivoted
by center pin - connects to tie rods.  Is that the right way to describe the
deal?

Thanks again,
