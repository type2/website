these things have an amazing limp home ability,  I was in maine and lost a 
valve, drove all the way back to Baltimore, slow on the hills but just 
kept going.

some years later the valves gave up on one side, got most of the way back 
from North Carolina to Maryland on two cyl. slow and anemic but got me 
within the 100mile AAA radius and could get a ride the rest of the way. 
that was when I bit the bullet and bought the Bob Donalds engine that is 
now giving me trouble........
