I was on my way to vacation in SoCal in my 73 Westy. First went east
to visit in Bieber, then planned to follow the highway west to the
coast.

Very fortunately I decided instead to go back to Red Bluff to pick up
something I had forgotten because the engine blew just about 15 miles
from home. Later autopsy revealed a snapped valve on # 1 and blown
cylinder on #4. Drove home on 2 cylinders. Couldn't make it up a short
but steep hill to the road home. Luckily a passerby in a pickup pulled
me up the hill so I could finish the drive home. Didn't really shake
badly. Just gutless. Engine was fine after I fixed the two failures
(didn't do a full rebuild - just changed the cylinder on # 4 and took
the head into the shop to have the valve fixed).
