I've seen two different carbon cannisters in the '70s buses.  I think
'75 and newer the can is shaped like a cylinder and attaches in front
of the right rear taillamp. My '73 has a 'flattened' cylinder can
attached to the roof of the engine compartment.

Carbon canister connections:
The large hose goes to the fan shroud, two smaller hoses go one to the
air filter box and the other to fuel tank vent plumbing in the rear
pillars/air scoops.  IIRC.

When I swapped a '78 engine into my '73 chassis,  I kept the
'73 can.  It's held to the roof of the engine room with plumber's
pipe strapping and stainless hardware.  I did the engine swap
from 1.7L+carbs to 2.0+FI in late 1995.        

TGIF!
