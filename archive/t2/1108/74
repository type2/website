Subject: Re: [T2] Compression

Thanks, makes sense - how bad is the disparity between cylinder compression
for this to be noticeable?  I've seen a couple numbers between reading here
(TP said 18psi I think, read 28 or 30psi somewhere as acceptable) regarding
max difference between cylinders...

And a hypothetical - say a cylinder quits (dead injector, bad valve/lifter
etc) - how do you run to the next stop without shaking the bejeezus outta
the engine?  Loosen the sparkplug to relieve pressure, or...?
