Those of us who power parts of our home with lead acid batteries have some
experience with this. If you want your car battery to last its longest,
maintain it at 12.6V.  You can go to Harbor Frieght and for $5 and even less
on sale, you can get a cute little device that will hold your battery at
12.6V. I will not charge it up to that, but it will maintain it. I have a
number of batteries with these things on them, along with desktop meters,
and every day, 12.6V

Each cell should be held at 2.1 Volts = 12.6V. I have seen some of the HF
cheepies keep my batts at as much as 13.5v, so I throw those out. Most of
them are pretty accurate at 12.6V. If you maintain anything higher, like
13.5V, you will eventually begin to boil away the acid. Takes a long time,
since we all know the charge voltage when running will exceed that, but I am
talking about all winter long. Over a few years this takes a toll on
battery.

There is no need to cycle them, if you maintain the 12.6V. In fact, every
batttery has a given number of discharge/charge cycles, so don't waste em
:-) Just hold them at 12.6V and they will be ready when you need them.

Put em on the concrete if you like. It won't make any difference at all. <g>
