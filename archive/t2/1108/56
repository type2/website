Subject: needed torque convertor bolts.

have done a good job of messing up my jesus bolts that hold the torque 
convertor to the flex plate,  anyone got a couple extra rolling around.
these are the special shouldered 13mm short bolts that go thru the hole in 
the engine to attach the torque convertor to the flexplate.

Bentley
section 5
pg 55
fig 16-2
part 39 drive plate.
there are three holes around the edges that a bolt goes thru to affix the 
torque convertor

instruction on removing engine
section 5
pg 9
fig none
instruction 12

other than that instruction #12 I don't believe I have seen these bolts 
mentioned anywhere in VW manuals, and no drawings or part numbers,  I am 
sure they are on the fiche but I haven't found them.  I don't believe any 
other bolt can be used....

thanks
Bob
