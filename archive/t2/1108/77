Well read it here, and the books if you don't believe me.  Since a lot of crap
info has been disseminated rudely by the usual sources...
 
I will speak as Bentley ACTUALLY speaks, not as my random opinon does.
 
Bentley Bus:
 
page 5-79
 
1800, 2000 engine 85-135 psi nominal, minimum 71 psi, permissible difference
28psi
 
Or more recent information
 
Vanagon manual (back cover)
 
2000 engine 85-131 psi nominal, minimum 73 psi, permissible difference 44psi
 
THOSE are the REAL facts boys and girls, look em up.
 
Now these are opinion, mine... (after all everyone has one and all just
like...)
 
Do I personally think I'd feel good with 3 at 110-120 psi and one at say 85,
hell no but by the most recent book (Vanagon) it would still be spec FOR A NEW
ENGINE EVEN!!!  Probably VW trying to get out of warantee work on VWoC
rebuilds, but the FACTS regardless.  Myself all engines I've ever built have
pumped 120-125 evenly after routine breakin when built to a static CR of
7-7.5:1.
 
And to put it another way as well, although I tend to do leak down tests with
an aircraft gage myself except for quick purchase inspections in the field,
I'm damn impressed Kevin or whoever first asked the question even put a gage
on it in any manner at all.  He verified what he wanted to verify that he had
enough compression on all four to run, even if he did it cold, throttle
closed, valves poorly adjusted, plugs in, with a dying battery.  Give the guy
a break, he tried, he got the information he wanted/needed to know, he has
compression.
 
I've put 50k miles on engines pumping only 90 on one and 110-120 on the other
three, and then sold the bus not representing it as anything but worn and it
went another 50k or more.  And I've done it several times.
 
Them is the facts and the opinion.  Disseminating INCORRECT information like
it is factory, and rudely, is moronic.  .

for this to be noticeable?  I've seen a couple numbers between reading here
(TP said 18psi I think, read 28 or 30psi somewhere as acceptable) regarding
max difference between cylinders...
