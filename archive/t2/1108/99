If you do find that the issue is rings, I'd recommend heating it up and 
driving it hard.  This is how I broke in my engine and you can feel the 
power come in as the rings seat.  These are the methods that people like 
John Connolly and Jake Raby are using to break in their engines and 
those are people I'd trust.  There are also other articles on the web 
that advocate that you need to drive the engine hard to get it to break 
in the rings quickly.  According to those various sources, if you baby 
your engine around town, it will glaze the cylinders and the rings will 
never fully seat.

I've done this on the last 3 rebuilds and never had problems with oil 
leaking past the rings.  I just take it to the local hill (500ft) and go 
up and down a bunch of times to load the engine and get it nice and hot. 
  And if you're worried about breaking something, then it's better to 
break it now than later :)
