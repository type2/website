Mine freshly built engine had blowby with a consequence of oil mist
condensation on the deck lid for a really, really long time, maybe
2000 miles. I had about given up when it stopped. I think I had chrome
rings which take longer to seal.  I wouldn't count on "daily driving"
to break in your rings. I would guess long periods at operating
temperature are needed.

I'm not savvy to the specifics of the Type 4 head, but I know that the
mechanism he described of oil seeping past the valve stem is
legitimate. Doesn't explain why it wasn't taken care of in the
rebuild. Valve stem clearances should have been checked at that time
as well. It sounds like you've got a straight-shooter engine builder
though as he has stood behind his work and disassembled your motor to
see what's going on. I think if he thought you had excessive valve
guide/stem wear, he would rather take care of that than try to deceive
you with oil seals.

pulled the engine and checked the pistons/cylinders/rings/heads, and says they
look fine. His latest theory is that, when the bus stands for a while, oil is
seeping down the valve stems into the cylinder, and that is what gets burned
off when it starts. Does this sound far-fetched?
