The illustration of the Webber 32/36 progressive carb at
http://www.cjclub.co.il/files/Weber3236adjust.pdf indicates the lower
vacuum port for vacuum advance. It has always been my understanding
that vacuum for timing advance is always ported above the throttle
plate. Is the throttle plate at the very bottom of these carbs? Can
anyone comment on the accuracy of the illustration?

I really could go out and take the carb off my engine but as they say
"if it ain't broke..."
