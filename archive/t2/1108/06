Hey Kevin - is that the "Pinto carb"? I never had much luck with that 
carb. Lots of freezing problems b/c it was centermounted.

I worked with it for a long time and came to believe that I needed to 
create a plate that fit between it and the manifold so that hot oil 
would circulate through it and keep the carb warm.

The carb I had exhibited alot of flat spots.

I would recommend stock carbs, Megasquirt or dual Dellorto 36mm DRLAs. 
None of those options are cheap of course! GRIN!

I have the dual Dells on my Type IV Beetle and it ran great (barn queen 
for some time now, awaiting total restoration) and got a solid 25 mpg no 
matter what. I used an equation in a Porsche Performance book (available 
in the Google library) to size the venturi. I aspire to put MegaSquirt 
on my Westy's Corvair engine someday.

There is a Weber book that CB Performance (and many others) sells that 
is worth the $. Has all the diagrams and adjusting procedures I think.

Good luck.
