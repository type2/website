Subject: Re: [T2] '71 fuel tank line replacement

Thanks to everyone for all of the great replies,

When I get my engine out and replace the fuel tank lines I will be sure to
take pictures and post a follow up to this thread. I will make sure to use
fuel hose for the filler neck connection.

Again, thank you,

Max
'71 Westy "KK-Louise"
