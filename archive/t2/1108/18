I'd go to a junkyard and find another VW new or old and cut out the fuel 
line connection plus a few centimeters of steel around it. Weld this 
into your gas tank and check for leaks by pressurizing the tank with 
air. Beware of gasoline fumes when cutting or welding the tank.

My question for anyone that cares to comment is how different is the 
carbon canister system from carb to fuel injection? My '78 VW van has an 
elaborate stock series of vent tubes and check valves. I like their 
function and have chosen to keep them intact.
