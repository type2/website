Testing the new MegaSquirt 3 module.  Hopefully they'll come out with 
the MS3X expansion board soon so that I can run semi-sequential 
injection and adjust each injector flow separately.  I am also looking 
to purchase the I/O board that will allow me to bring in 4 EGT sensors 
so I can monitor exhaust temps at all four cylinders and then do some 
LOP testing per the GAMI article.  In addition I'm going to eventually 
install my second WBO2 sensor so I can monitor the other side of the engine.

I'm really looking forward to seeing my cylinder EGTs as all the 
reputable tuners and head-builders say EGT is what really matters.  It 
should be interesting to see how the CHT and EGT correlate.  Hopefully 
I'll have those numbers in the somewhat near future.

Other than that, I have a new pop-top canvas to install, but I don't 
plan on doing that until I bring the bus in to get painted, which 
doesn't happen until after I finish my heli private license - ahhh.. too 
much stuff to do!

Mike
