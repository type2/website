it's out, had to pull engine and tranny together. never again if I can 
help it much much more work.  is totally stripped down ready to go to Gary 
which I will do next week. but still has torque convertor attached, ground 
down a wrench this evening so I might be able to get it appart but not 
looking good, may have to split the case to get to the #{(-at-)%F#<{ bolts.

thanks for the help
