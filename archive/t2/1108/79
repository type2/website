Subject: Smokin' New Engine (literally :-(

Hi all -

Around 9 months ago, I shelled out many dollars for an engine rebuild - my mechanic took it to a guy he's been using for many years. Ever since then, when it's been standing for a couple of hours, the tailpipe kicks out a significant cloud of oil smoke after I start it and rev it a little. By experimented with pulling different plug leads before I started it, I narrowed it down to #1 cylinder as the culprit.

The engine-builder first said the rings needed to wear in - but that didn't help (I drive the bus daily, so they must be well worn in by now). Then he pulled the engine and checked the pistons/cylinders/rings/heads, and says they look fine. His latest theory is that, when the bus stands for a while, oil is seeping down the valve stems into the cylinder, and that is what gets burned off when it starts. Does this sound far-fetched? 

I'm taking it in on Monday so he can fit valve-stem oil seals; does anyone know if the 1978 Type 4 FI engine (G-series serial #) originally had those seals? Or is he doing something that would cover up a more sinister problem - e.g. valve guides being wider than spec, and therefore too sloppy?

And can anyone think of any other possible explanation for the oil?

Thanks for any advice and solace you can offer...:-)

Matthew
