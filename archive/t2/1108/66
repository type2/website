	Joe Lucas inflicted inferior electrics on car & motorcycle 
owners for decades, earning the title The Prince of Darkness.  But a 
battery remanufacturing plant around the other side of the world, run 
by a Kiwi, was a different thing.  I dare say Joe provided the 
capital for that factory; but it was run to standards far higher than 
his lousy Pommie-made voltage regulators etc. ever glimpsed.

	search me bub; I may know more about them than most Yanks (my 
father was a Pom), but that's not saying much.  Us Kiwis certainly 
don't practise that peculiar perversity 8-)
