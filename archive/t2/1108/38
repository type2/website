Subject: RE: [T2] What have you done for your bus lately?

Lets see...  I bought the green machine a new set of tires (General Altimax
HP's) from Tire Rack.  Put new Tie-rods and ends on the steering system.
Checked the vertical play on the swingarm while I was down there.  Looked
good.  Added a third brakelight to the rear glass and wired it to the pressure
switch on the master cyl. (I need to relay it, I know).  Put a newer stereo
and CD changer in the cab (mine's a non-walkthrough '70).  Bought a set of new
wing-window seals.  Picked up a set of Ron's Bosch H$ headlamps and a battery
tray (in the mail as we speak).  I grabbed the last set of Bugpack
(Sway-A-Way) swaybars from Bow Wow Auto Parts here in Boise.  I guess they're
pretty unobtainable now.  I've read Richard Atwell's writeup and I plan on
doing the Koni install at the same time.  Bought a Shumacher
trickle/leave-in-place charger in the fall.  I sleep better nowing the bus is
going to start after months of winter sleep.  I replaced the antenna (broke
off in a car-wash) and some rubber seals here and there (floor/pedal seals).
I'm looking at Ron's sliders as we speak.  I've been bugging him for a few
years now about them, and I need to find a way to make it happen.  Ciao for
now.
