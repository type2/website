Leaving aside everything else ;oP

As a matter of interest, was the "adaption" you had to do, open up the 
centre hole by 2-3mm? 

Several years ago I aquired a nice set of 15" A4 mags, but I found for 
the front hubs at least I needed to massage the inner edges with a small 
grinding wheel to get it to clear the front hub centre.

Oh, and for what I'VE done to Tigger, my bus, SFA, did get new slave 
cylinders. pads etc in the rear brakes, as one developed a leak, and 
finally replaced the bung rear shocks and got her properly tuned up, 
she's done more ks in the last couple of months than she did in the 
previous 2-3 years, she was parked in the garage while I was down and 
out, only came out once a year for roadworthy checks to re-register her, 
now she's out and being used again, best thing in the world for her.

FWIW
