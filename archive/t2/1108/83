Don't forget that 44psi difference at cranking rpm is likely to be much 
less than at operating RPM, even idle.

I have also in the past run engines with 90psi compression that went 
many trouble-free miles and even passed California emissions.

More anecdotal evidence - when I moved into this house in 2001 there was 
an old (70's era) John Deere garden tractor left behind by the previous 
owner.  It was a 1-cylinder, air cooled 10hp engine.  Started and ran 
fine although it did burn oil.  Mowed with it for a few years before 
finally trading up.  Before I sold it I gave it a compression test, just 
for fun.  Would you believe 50psi?
