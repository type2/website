 Lots of freezing problems b/c it was centermounted.

Same story as with early VW centermounted carbs - if you live in a
cold area, you need manifold heat. In northern California the electric
choke was sufficient (this was a daily driver I took to work everyday,
even on freezing mornings). Here is it so hot that half the VWs I have
seen have the choke disabled.

Possibly set up wrong? My happiest bus driving experiences were with the Weber.

I'm just removing mine. Too complex - I prefer the elegance of the
early VW carbs or Weber.

 of those options are cheap of course! GRIN!

Right. I had the dual Dellorto 36mm DRLAs on a 72 with an oversize
Porsche motor with the Mallory dizzie. Now that bus was the first one
that had the power you'd expect from a modern vehicle. Gas guzzler
though! Speed costs thermal energy - how fast do you want to go?!?!
Surprised you got 25mpg. Maybe because Beetle is lighter?

A worthy project for anyone up to its challenges.
