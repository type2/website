	normally said to be lead sulfate; that you, John, spell 'f' 
in the old way 'ph', which even we in the Brit Empah abandoned a 
half-century ago, suggests to me that you're even more old-fangled 
than I am!

	So many myths of this form occur that one is automatically 
sceptical.  But I suspect this one is pretty right.  Certainly those 
batteries were advertised in Pop Mech  &/or Pop Sc, my favourite 
mags, in the early '50s.

	I've not heard that queried.  All I was querying was whether 
keeping it constantly up at, say, 13.5V is as good as cycling it.

	Were the submarine batteries by any chance made of the Edison 
(i.e.  nickel/iron, NiFe) cell?  It has a poorer energy/weight ratio 
than the lead-acid, and a seriously lower voltage so one needs more 
cells to compile 12V; but it has no known limit in number of cycles 
and is I believe the only accumulator of that indefinite-life status. 
An elec eng'r friend found some in a muddy creekbed, hosed them down, 
charged them, and used them for years.
