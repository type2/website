Subject: Info on putting in-line battery charger into van

A number of people have asked for a how-to on putting an inline charger into a
Westy that has the 120volt city hookup system. I will get some pics and a
quickie howto together in the next few days, but please bear with me. I'm hot
in the middle of writing Report Cards for 27 lovely little munchkins, and it's
killing me. Definitely NOT a teacher's favorite thing to do. :-)
