One other way to gauge an engine's condition is the vibration level.  I 
had dying heads and the engine ran gradually worse and worse, with 
increasing vibration levels.  That, in turn, wreaked all sorts of havoc 
on the metal parts.  So while it doesn't matter much for the heads and 
cylinders (because you'll eventually replace them), a bunch of ancillary 
parts broke or wore out, many of them being hard-to find parts, which 
caused a few headaches at rebuild time...
