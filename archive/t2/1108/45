	These plurry lead-acid accumulators are a substantial cost to 
us; I think making them last as long as they can is a neglected issue.
	I have no special knowledge of batteries, but a friend of 
mine (one of NZ's best-known scientists) actually ran the Lucas 
battery factory in Auckland straight after he finished his doctorate, 
and has been my guru on the things.
	He contrasts 'keep it charged' (which is straightforwardly 
feasible, either with automatic devices or manually) with 'cycle it'. 
He strongly recommends the latter.  One corollary of this principle 
is that a small battery is not necessarily worse than a big one, 
because it will cycle more deeply, all else being equal.
	So an automatic device that merely charges the battery up to 
(x + y) V  (perhaps 13.5 V ?) when it has dropped to x (perhaps 11.5 
V ?) is not so good for battery longevity as one which actually 
discharges it to some predetermined low voltage and then immediately 
takes it back up to whatever has been set (by the charger mfr, I 
assume  -  these things aren't adjustable, are they?).
	Something to do with minimising sulfation in the plates  ...

Opinions wanted; dogmatism will be effortlessly filtered out by
