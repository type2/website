Subject: Re: gentling your battery

Fwiw, I have a Sunbeam Tiger that only gets driven a few miles in the summer
months. The rest of the time it's in the garage
with a "Battery Tender" brand charger on it. I had a Sears Diehard size 27
battery in it that lasted 11 years with no problems
with it with the Battery Tender in place. On the 12th summer it was dead.
Needless to say I replaced it with another Diehard and the Battery Tender is
in place.   My 71 bus gets driven fairly frequently so it never has a charger
on it but it seems to go through
a battery about every 3-5 years....
