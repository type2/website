I recently purchased an air compressor. Finally... Now I can paint my 
own cars and do a little sandblasting for those places with a little 
rust bubbling up.

FWIW look around for a remanufactured one. Mine is a 60 gallon 10-11 CFM 
upright. My Dad has always had the hot dog compressors but they were on 
the smallish size and run pretty hard for 
painting/sandblasting/grinding. He says the portable factor is important 
to him though I have never seen him take his anywhere. I've never had 
occasion to take a compressor anywhere. I wanted big and upright so it 
is out of my way and so it doesn't run long and hard when I grind or 
paint. Mine is a remanufactured "famous-brand" (Kobalt) compressor that 
shares parts with several other brands. The "Morgan" brand is just the 
company that remanufactured it and who sprayed it black. Got the two 
year warranty as well and have already seen parts are easy to get should 
I need them.

The cost was about $300 plus $50 for the warranty at Northern Tool and 
other places. Retail at other places was $399 plus tax. You can skip the 
freight by sending it to the store and picking it up there.

Hope this helps somebody here. Disclaimer - I have no interest in the 
retailer or the brand. Just an excited guy waiting for his compressor to 
arrive in Chattanooga so I can drive down and get it.
