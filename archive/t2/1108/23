Hey Kevin run over to Red Bank and Mill&Mine ought to have them. I love 
that place... They are closed on Saturdays and open on Weekdays/Sundays. 
A church thing I've heard. Anyhow fits my family visiting schedule well. 
M&M has all sorts of off bits put away in the back and they will let you 
snoop around. Lots of surplus industrial stuff and cheap tools too. If 
they still sell the cheap $6 - 39 piece screwdriver sets stay away. Some 
of them are one use only! GRIN! I have maybe one or two now years later 
after 2-3 sets. I don't think the tips are hardened very much and the 
handles tolerate no abuse whatsoever. GRIN!

The torch cleaners in my toolbox has these little rods where the first 
little bit is smooth and then followed by a section made to file the 
hole. Beware of that b/c you don't want to open up the jet any further 
than it is stock - unless you need to permanently alter the jet for hot 
rod purposes. It is the perfect tool for cleaning jets.
