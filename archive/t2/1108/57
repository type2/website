Bob I "might" have 2 (don't know where the 3rd went) in the spare drawer at
home, will look.
 
FWIW, Lowes of all places, used to have 10.9 grade shouldered bolts in the
specialty hardware (4-5 years ago in WV at least.)  Not quite up to snuff (I
feel they are 12.9 no?) but better than nothing, and I've used em fine in the
past many times.  Could also use a socket head 12.9, the head surface is not a
lot smaller, but if you F'd one up later, would be a real friggin PITA like
always with a screwed up socket head.
 
I've actually bought many a van with good ole 8.8's holding just fine, until
they don't presumeably.  The 10.9s are essentially a grade 8 US and probably
OK.
 
How has it gone with the engine pull?

other than that instruction #12 I don't believe I have seen these bolts
mentioned anywhere in VW manuals, and no drawings or part numbers,  I am sure
they are on the fiche but I haven't found them.  I don't believe any other
bolt can be used....
