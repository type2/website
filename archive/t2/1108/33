compression: 1: 100 2:  90 3: 110 4: 114 acceptable
Well, those numbers are way out of spec., if you did the compression
test properly. 108 is minimum spec and not more than 18 variance
between cylinders is spec. Time for rebuild, bud. That's reality. If
being way out of spec is acceptable to you, do as you will.


While those compression reading are out of spec, I wouldn't park that bus
behind the barn.
keep driving it until you have money for a new head. My buddy has been
driving his vanagon
with 90 pounds in one cylinder for 5 years through the mountains of new york
state. Life is
messy and usually out of spec, but if you stay on top of it, you can keep
driving it while you save your pennies.
