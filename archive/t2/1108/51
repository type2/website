Robt, I think that the cupro sulphate (to go old school) electrolyte, becomes
lead sulphite actually and reversing the sulphite/fite back into solution to
copper sulphate is the issue that needs addressed, I think some of it is
nonrecoverable, which leads to the mechanical breakdown.  I have forgotten
every single bit of chemistry (organic and otherwise) I once knew, but I'm
pretty sure that is the gist of it, any smart high school kid would probably
know.  Whitney and local auto parts stores around me used to sell additives
claiming to do same, don't know if the worked or not, I think by the time
people tried them the mechanical damage was done, and merely
de-sulphiting/fiting (not likely a word anyway) the plates likely wasn't going
to help anything.  Dad told me AT&T did use an additive for the same, plus
changed out electrolyte every few years.
