I installed a permanent battery charger that charges the system if I'm plugged in at night. I was so impressed on how slick it was. (installed it in a 77 deluxe Westy that has the fridge on the driver side) I put it in the same compartment as the 12V-120V switch where the extension cord also resides. It almost looks factory. I then added another 12 volt outlet just below the cabinet/closet door where the spare tire used to reside on non-westies. Now I can plug in my solar/crank/12V lantern right there for night reading, or any other 12V appliance. :-)
