Search for "AMSKEPTIC". His real name is Colin
Send him a private message describing the timing of your trip and
route you plan on taking

Colin's coming up from FL right now and should be in NC in the next
day or two. If you can meet him, for $275 he'll spend an entire day
with you going over your bus and fixing anything that needs fixed.

If you can't arrange something (or even if you do), go to the AIRS
link on the type 2 website (http://www.type2.com) and print out the
lists for the states you'll be driving in. That way if you break down
you'll have a list of other bussers who can help. (I'm on the list
too, but a bit out of your way in Cali..heh)

When you pick up the bus:

Change oil & filter (Mahle if you can find one... Bus Depot sells 'em)
Adjust valves
Adjust and lubricate points
Time
Check tires
Check lights
Check fuel guage

Those are the "off the top of my head" items. I'm sure others can
suggest more. But they're things you can do yourself without a
mechanic.

Good luck and enjoy your trip!
