Subject: More EGR Questions

I have cleaned up 2 Egr valves for possible use on my 80 Westy. One is the
original from the 80 and the other is from a 78 engine. I did not disassemble
the valves due to the fact that both valves seem to have the stopper welded or
press fit to the shaft so I can't get the housing apart. I think I got both
quite clean though.

The suspected problem is I think both leak air. If the actuating lever is left
in the relaxed position and light air pressure is applied I can feel air
leaking where the lever enters the case. but if the lever is moved to the full
throttle position It doesn't seem to leak.

Is this normal?
