got mine mounted right behind the front drivers seat, can reach it from
the drivers seat and because I use the sliding door to get in and out all
the time it is right there for me to grab.

only time I needed it for this bus is once when I put my spare engine in I
was driving and stopped and this black oily smoke was coming out from
under the van.,appears a mouse had built a nest in the air exhaust duct
from the cooling system and it caught fire from the heat and there was
some leaked oil on the site...used one of the powder fire ext on the
fire, put it right out but boy what a mess to clean up...still have a
powder ext, figure better to clean up mess than lose bus but still looking
around for a decent sized CO2 as a first line of defense, will keep the
powder as backup

Bob
PS-never did find the mouse
