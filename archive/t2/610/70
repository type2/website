Subject: Re: [T2] Mahle Oil Filter

i'll give this one a go.  german "black" filters are suggested to be the
best because they tend to conform to factory specifications the closest.
particularly in the case of the wasserboxer and i would assume the same is
true of aircooled with oil filters, the german filters have the correct
anti-drain back valve.  this helps keep the lifters from clacking.  also
the parts in the german filter tend be made out of metal where the frams
that i have taken apart have their parts made from cardboard and rubber.

the word is that the black bosch filters are made by champion in the
united states but i could very well be wrong about that.  i use them on
the golf engine in my van and cut them apart on a semi regular basis and
they seem to be of decent construction to me.
