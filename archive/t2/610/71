Subject: just purchased a 70 Bus...

Welcome, Blake!
I read your list of things you are taking, and I suggest one more important
thing --- bring an extra belt!! No belt = no cooling fan, and that sucks when
the belt breaks in the middle of nowhere.

I just drove my 71 Westy from Wilmington NC to NYC and back, and I highly
recommend picking up US 17 in SC to US 13 in VA, then hitting the Jersey
Turnpike. If you decide to take the ferry from Lewes to Cape May, it's an
hour. Go around -- it's faster and cheaper. Also take plenty of quarters and
singles for tolls. The Chesapeke Bay Bridge- Tunnel is $12.
Along the way are lots of places to stop and gas up, cool off, soak up
scenery.
If you are lucky, you'll be getting 20 mpg, so you'll be gassing up every 200
miles or so. Bring lots of gas money! Don't push it past 65. I get my best
mileage at 60 mph.

Good luck, Blake!
