Subject: true Porsche engine vs Type IV

> a similar Porsche engine has three bolts on each true superior Porsche head
>  to hold on the intake manifold whereas the inferior ordinary VW head has 4
>  bolts.

> This is ONLY true on the 914 2,0 engine.

> The 914 1.7 and 1.8 are 4 bolts. Same as the bay bus and 411/412.

okay thanks for the info.

so with lots of people calling the Type IV engine a Porsche engine, when it
really isn't, how do you easily tell if you really have a Porsche engine vs a
Type IV engine
