Subject: Undercoating?

Since I got a straight splash pan setting in front of me right now, I
need to get it ready to install. I don't like driving the bus without
it, so it needs to go on ASAP.

I have 3 options for prepping it:

Paint (Primer, color, clear - in rattle cans)
Rubberized undercoating
Dupli-Color's spray on bedliner

I'd prefer POR-15 but that isn't an option ($$) at the moment. I'm
thinking a few coats of primer then the bedliner stuff would be the
best bet out of them all.

Opinions?
