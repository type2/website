Subject: Gas gauge woes

Dear volks,

Our '77 Westy's gas gauge is kaput. We're following the procedure, and get 
infinite ohms from the wire going to the gauge to ground. That suggests the 
sender or the wiring to the sender is bad.

Since it's so hard to access the sender I thought to look at the wiring 
first. The Bently book shows the sender's wire going through two terminals 
before hitting the gauge. One is under the dash and is fine. Where is the 
other? How does the wire make it to the sender? Is the sender grounded 
where it is, or does a ground wire snake out of the gas tank region somewhere?

Thanks much,

Jack
