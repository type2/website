Subject: on truck bed spray on liner..

My Son is doing an 83 rabbit (92 passat 2l 16v
conversion).. I get to do the rewire.;-)
  Anyway, working with the watercooled kidz has been
fun and educational. The bunny is almost complete now
but
back to the liner spray. He decided that he wanted to
keep the interior as spartin as possible. As we had
stripped it completely we had a clean slate. Brushed
alum. door cards, and some new paneling in the hatch
area. He sprayed out the rest with bedliner instead
of the conventional headliner and such.. lookes great!
  As every summer I pull all of the mats from the cab
floor in my bus and do touch up I decided to try this
stuff this year. I killed any rust I found and have
sprayed out the floor with the bedliner.. I replaced
the ratty wheel well rubber covering with the same...
it looks very clean and is easy to keep that way I
also
used some left over alum sheet to make new kick
panels.
the alum reflects the black from the front mat an
looks
very clean also. and moisture wont affect it. I had
to put some foam strip (the tape stuff) around the
holes where the air vents come through the kick panel
so there wasnt a rattle... sounds like it could be
noisey but it isnt.
  Reader's digest version..
the truck bed liner you can get in a rattle can is
pretty tough stuff... I like it.. the "bumper paint"
is also pretty thick stuff an works great for
recovering things like plastic grillwork (radiator)..
i have only found both of these in black so far.
