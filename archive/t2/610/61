Before I would say, "Jump on it with both feet," I would need a few more 
details, such as model year, any rusting on body, paint condition, total 
elapsed miles on chassis, etc..... and then some more specifics on to the 
Porsche engine.  Where is this bus located?  Where did it spend its life?  Was 
it driven in snow/salt?  Or in a salt-air environment?

Fill us in!!

One of my daughter's friend's father works with a guy who as a like new 
VW bus outfitted with a Porsche engine. He took the engine out had 
someone to work on it. The engine now works but he doesn't want the bus 
anymore. He is asking $3500 for the bus and engine (engine out of bus). 
The father who told me about it said the inside of the bus looks 
showroom new.

If I pursue this, is the price right? And, is the Porsche engine any 
better or worse than the stock that FI I have in my current westy?
