Subject: Ok, I coated the splash pan...

Comparing the one that was on my bus with the one I got today:

After hitting it with the wirewheel on my beater drill (note to self:
find goggles with anti-fog vents):

After first coat of the truck bedliner spray:

My (#Y%(&#$ goggles would fog up in 2 seconds flat. Too warm and I was
sweaty. I gave up, took the friggin things off, got my plastic
sunglasses, and went back to work.

Light dusting of the primer means I get it dry in 20 minutes. Totally
dry. Just enough primer to give an alternative surface for the
bedliner to bite into. The stuff says it works fine on bare metal, so
I didn't need much primer. Then I hit it with the first bedliner coat.
I'll go out in a few minutes and put on the top bedliner coat.

I love projects I can work on in my backyard instead of out in the sun
on the street under my bus. heh
