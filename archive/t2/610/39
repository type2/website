Subject: Porsche engine in bus

be careful about what you think of the extra value of a Porsche engine is
over the value of a "ordinary" Type IV engine.

too many people call the Type IV engine a Porsche engine when it really isn't

there are some expensive to replace differences

a similar Porsche engine has three bolts on each true superior Porsche head
to hold on the intake manifold whereas the inferior ordinary VW head has 4
bolts.
