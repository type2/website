Subject: Re: [T2] Bad Coil and Pertronix?

Lemme see... You changed the oil and installed the Pertronix and now it 
won't start?

Must have done something wrong on the oil change... You DID use the 
correct weight oil and the list approved Mann/Mahle filter, didn't you? 
  If you didn't, that may be why it won't start. <tongue firmly planted 
in cheek.>

The Pertronix isn't working.  Could be mis-wired or it could have 
suffered infant mortality. Either way, the solution, Grasshopper, is to 
put the points and condenser back in. There's likely nothing wrong with 
your coil.

Sermonette:  When your bus is running and you change something and it 
won't run, the problem is much more likely to be the change you made 
than some unrelated part mysteriously failing.
