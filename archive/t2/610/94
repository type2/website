Subject: rubber plugs for brake backing plate

Thanks
Could you be a bit more specific about these plugs.
I tried my local 'old time' hardware store, no rubber
plugs.
Have also just returned from the big city, tried a
Home Depot, electrical dept, no joy. 
What might these plugs be commonly used for, which
dept in a mega store?
------------------------
Denny,  good luck...
they don't stay in very well anyway (as you know).
Go to the hardware store and get the tapered rubber
plugs.  Slice the 
end off so it doesn't stick in there too much.
