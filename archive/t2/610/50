Subject: oil light won't turn off 

hows it going i was driving home today and the oil light came on i pulled over checked the oil it was at the right level and the dip stick wasnt scolding hot. every thing seamed normal.i got home let it sit to cool off.I drive a 83 wesy air cooled 2 liter engine.i start the engine when its cool thinking the light should go off but it stays on i know the engine isnt hot enough for it to go on . so i put a test light on the oil temp switchthinking it will go on and that means the switch is bad but the test light dosnt go on. how can i tell if i have a bad switch?
