Subject: Re: [T2] just purchased a 70 Bus and have some questions

I live about 20 min above Trenton, p-mailed that I can check out the bus
for him; do my own work.  I bought a 70 bus in Philly about '98, hope it
isn't the same one- opened the slider too far and it fell off due to a
hole in the track.  Sold it to a college student with a nail in the
track so it could be opened only 3/4 of the way! The tranny locked a
gear in 6 mo, and a rear wheel bearing failed.
