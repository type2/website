On the Type 4 engine, I don't think Porsche used any better metals, 
except perhaps for the valves (didn't the Porsche Type 4s have 
sodium-filled valves for better heat dissipation?)

Besides cam differences, the Porsche heads also used larger valves than 
the VW heads.  Not sure about stroke/piston shape.

In any case, while the Porsche flavor of Type 4 is a great little 
engine, they're not as advanced as the similar vintage 911 engine.  It 
really is a VW engine with some performance tweaks.
