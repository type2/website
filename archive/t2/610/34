Subject: Another Exhausting Question!

Hi all:

I was unable to rotate my catalytic converter to get the O2 sensor bung
pointed downward where I could use it as an exhaust snifter port (previous
thread: "Question for the catalytic converter experts") so now I need to
actually add a port in the crossover pipe.  None of the auto parts stores
around here have a weld-on O2 sensor bung (usual reaction when I ask for
such a thing: uncomprehending blank stare).  So, since I don't really intend
to put an O2 sensor in this port, what would be wrong with just welding a
nice big nut on the crossover pipe, and plugging it when not in use with a
short bolt?  Anything?

TIA.
