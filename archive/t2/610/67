Subject: Re: [T2] Saggy front suspension

Hehehe,
Yes, it must sound strange to some I'm sure!
As Andy see's regular service as a 9 seater bus, camper van and as a van
shifting lots of heavy stuff, he regularly is loaded to the GVM. As soon as
I put any weight in him he sits on the bump stops which is not good!!

No other thoughts???

Cheers,
Richard
