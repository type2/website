Hello Everyone,

One of my daughter's friend's father works with a guy who as a like new 
VW bus outfitted with a Porsche engine. He took the engine out had 
someone to work on it. The engine now works but he doesn't want the bus 
anymore. He is asking $3500 for the bus and engine (engine out of bus). 
The father who told me about it said the inside of the bus looks 
showroom new.

If I pursue this, is the price right? And, is the Porsche engine any 
better or worse than the stock that FI I have in my current westy?

Thanks,

--kevin--
