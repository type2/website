Subject: Re: [T2] Pinging or knocking?

It's hard to say exactly *what* you're hearing here; I've never heard
pinging described as a "snoring" sound.  The best description I can give for
the sound of mild pinging is that it's similar to the sound you'd hear if
someone was dropping marbles into a one-pound coffee can.

Pinging (or knocking) comes from the fuel starting to combust *before* it's
supposed to.  It's typically caused by over-high compression due to carbon
build up, or by running gas that's too low in octane rating.  If pinging is
occurring, it's almost always when the engine is working very hard, such as
when accelerating quickly or laboring up a hill.  The fact that you're
hearing it when you let up slightly on the accelerator suggests that maybe
what you're hearing *isn't* pinging, but it's impossible to say.  Maybe try
to find a nice level stretch of road and bring the car gently up to a bit
less than cruising speed.  Then, floor the gas and see if you hear the sound
*while accelerating.*

Heavy pinging can certainly hurt an engine.
