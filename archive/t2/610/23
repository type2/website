Subject: Just got back with lots of free goodies!!

A couple months ago one of the list members advertised a free kitchen
from a 77  westy. I guess I was the first (or only) one to respond so
I got dibs on it. Problem is that the logistics got messed up and we
weren't able to hook up until today (he was in Utah..)

It was an awesome score. I got:

Kitchen from a 77 (some mods necessary in my 73 to make it work, but
not bad at all). It's in PRISTINE condition, pale gray.
Middle front seat/box thing that needs some love.
All the under-bus heater pipes/hoses and the metal Y connector.
The mains power system including battery charger and such.
Miscellaneous pads.
Front door armrests (YES!)
Splash pan for under the pedals (YES!!)
2 full sets of carbs with linkage and 2 rebuild kits(YES!!!)
Excellent hubcaps, great since mine were stolen. 

I'm completely stoked and want to give a big thanks to Bill who saved
them for months and even moved them to his new place. He's in splitty
land now, having a beautiful lots'o'windows (darn near completely
original) in addition to his Eurovan Westy.

I now have 4 sets of old Solex PDSIT-3 dual carbs besides the ones in
my bus. I'm going to go through them and pick out the best pair (ones
with the least throttle shaft play) but the rest are up for grabs if
anybody wants 'em. I'll probably have some linkage pieces too. Come
get 'em in Anaheim, CA. Sharing the wealth!
