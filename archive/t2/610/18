Very nice, but one question...

You state on the page "I used a small radial cutter blade and a Dremel
tool."  I have a Dremel, but don't recognize the bit, the "small radial
cutter blade".  Which tool is it?

This doesn't lower the plate like
http://www.specialpatrolgroup.co.uk/spooky/access/access.html, but it seems
to be an easier installation.

I'm going to go by the local marine store and look up one of those plates...
