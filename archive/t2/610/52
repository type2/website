Subject: Re: [T2] oil light won't turn off

Matt,
You didn't describe how you used the test light. If you connect the wire lead
of the test light to the positive battery terminal and connect the probe end
of the test light to the terminal on the oil pressure sensor you have it
correct. With the engine off (no oil pressure) the test light should be on.
With the engine running the test light should be off, if you have over a few
pounds of oil pressure.  Think of the oil pressure sensor as a light switch
controlled by oil pressure. With no pressure, the switch is on, connecting the
terminal on top to the pipe that threads into the case. With a few pounds of
pressure, the switch is off. If the switch passes these tests, start
inspecting the wire that connects to the sensor. If the insulation has been
scraped off anywhere and the bare wire is touching metal the oil light will
come on.

Hope this helps,
Tom

means the switch is bad but the test light dosnt go on. how can i tell if i
