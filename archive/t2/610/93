Subject: signal woes etc, plz help....

Listees,

I need help getting my turn signals  to work. With the lights on both front 
and rear lights work fine. Hazzard get them all to flash like they should. 
But when you activate the turn singla on the dash the two lights light up 
but do not flash and outside nothing happens at all.

I think the switch thingy or whatever that connects to the signal lever is 
bad. You can't pull it up and make it switch for the high beams at all. I 
looked on busdepot.com and I can't figure out the part I need, all I saw was 
like this relay thing which I don't think is the problem.

My local VW flaps couldn't help either. What part do I need or how do I 
troubleshoot this? I'm not-so-patiently waiting for my ebayed Bentley.

My other unrelated question:

Tranny, it makes this cool sounding howling sound, I know it's bad but what 
exactly causes this. It has NOT popped out of gear and feels pretty tight 
and easy to shift.
