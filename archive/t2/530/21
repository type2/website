Good ideas there.  The problem with recirculating heat is that any
contaminants that get into the air (CO, smells, etc) stay in the system.
This could make the system more dangerous.  I think that is why VW stuck
so stubbornly with outside-air systems.

If your system is clean and tight, I'd be tempted to just recirculate all
the air.  You're right in that the recirculation will result in the air
getting warmer and warmer which is a good thing when the mercury drops
below freezing.

The other plus to recirculation is that you don't get humid road spray in
the air when the weather is wet, which will keep the windshield clear.

A good place to take air in is behind the spare tire.  Very hard to block
an inlet in this area, and I believe that gas heaters used this same area
for their air inlet.
