Subject: Re: [T2] melted bilge blower fan

  It seems like a bilge blower fan would have to be pretty strong to 
out-perform the engine fan, and yet my fairly leak free heater system puts 
out about as much force at the defrost vents as the squirrel fan does at its 
outputs in the engine compartment.  Maybe I have a restriction.  At any 
rate, wouldnt all that engine air to be heated in the heat exchangers be 
better utilized cooling off the cylinders and heads?  It seems like the heat 
exchangers would be like two big tin leaks (except that that hot air would 
not be getting blown over the cylinders and heads again).  Plugging those 
ports out of the engine fan seems like a good idea.  What would it hurt to 
have the exhaust pipes too hot?
  I am planning on running a bilge blower recalculating air from inside the 
cabin, using the rear heater hole in the floor as my return line.  If it 
gets melted there, everything in the cabin will be melted too, so the melted 
fan wont seem like such a big deal in the big picture.
