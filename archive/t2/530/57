there is one trick I know of. the star adjusters do not have a stop at
the end. What this means is you can use a long bolt of the same thread
pitch and dia to screw it in. with some liberal use of pb blaster or
the like you should be able to just turn the new bolt and it will back
the star adjuster out of it's home.
