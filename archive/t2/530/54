Subject: Everybus parts request

I need a few items and thought that maybe someone else coming to Everybus
could help me with these:

- European-style portable propane tank. These are usually red or
gray-and-red - I need the small (5 kg?) size. When I shipped my 74 Camper
from Germany I forgot to bring my gas tanks along and the US propane bottles
do not fit into my gas cabinet. Does anyone have one of these sitting
around? I'd love to use my stove and fridge again ...

- 74 or later Camper table top. Same story as with the gas bottles - forgot
it in Germany. I have the leg, but not the top.

- 76-79 brake booster. Condition does not really matter. I need a
rebuildable core to send it to the rebuilders in Texas.

- metal fresh air duct covers. These go underneath the dash next to the
doors where the plastic ducts lead up to the outlets in the dash. A camper
we just picked up for my girlfriend used to have fresh air (ambulance) fans
that are missing now. I just need the covers from a plain bus to have at
least have some ventilation.

Please let me know if you can help me with any of these.

Thanks,
Marcus
