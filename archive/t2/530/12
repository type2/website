Why not just use a more efficient (effective) squirrel cage fan, since it 
isn't being mounted in-line with the heater duct?

The bilge blower would go as far forward as possible, to get the air 
moving, after traveling all the way from the rear of the bus.
Yes, it will be noisy.  If the heater duct is pressurized (by the squirrel 
cage fan(s), "bad news" will not be sucked into the system.
With enough fan in the engine compartment, the front bilge blower may not 
be necessary.

The fan in the engine compartment must be on (at least "low") whenever the 
engine is running, or the heater boxes
will overheat.  In the summer, reconnect the stock heat set-up.
