The nosecones are the same size, the 091 one will work. It's also much
better than the early ones, I just put one on my 70 transmission.

Hello Steve    Change the nosecone also, I don't remember if they are
different but it is always a good idea to check the bracket and front
bearings in
there before swapping trannys  later and have fun  mark dearing  salem
