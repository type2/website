Giles, I concur with Paul. Skip the desktop, invest in a notebook. If you
keep an eye on www.techbargains.com you should be able to find a new or
refurbished one for well under $800. Although video editing will bring all
but the most powerful notebook PCs to their knees, there's enough horsepower
available even on the lowest-price modern notebooks for still image editing
purposes.

Sprint will cut you off if you try to pull more than around 50 MB/month
through your USB-tethered Vision phone connection; they've revised the
customer terms and conditions to explicitly state that the Vision network is
intended for access by phones and phone-inclusive PDAs only, not
phones-as-modems. For more on this, monitor the alt.cellular.sprintpcs
newsgroup. Alternatively, you can get a PCS Connection Card and sign up for
$80/mo unlimited data upload/download service through a Sprint reseller such
as www.sprintpcsrocks.com. I've been using it in conjunction with Sierra
Wireless's card for about a year now and am quite pleased both with the
coverage and the speed. It's usable both on PCMCIA-inclusive Windows and Mac
OS machines....note that Apple iBooks do NOT have PCMCIA slots, nor does the
12" Powerbook. Larry at RoadHaus is using Verizon's equivalent service
(which, like Sprint, employs CDMA 1XRTT technology).
