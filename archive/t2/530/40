Just get a cheap G3 Powerbook on Ebay, they use a lot less power than
any pre-centrino Intel heater and with Mac OS X you don't have viruses.
I have one and I love it (almost) as much as I love my bus :)
To use a desktop you should get a second battery or you'll always be
afraid your bus won't start after some internet browsing: 100W power
means almost 10A (ten times more than a Danfoss compressor fridge), 3
hours browsing with a not new 60Ah battery.
