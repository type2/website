Sorry, didn't save the original message...

This site: http://www.opussolutions.com/ carries products specifically 
designed for use in a vehicle.

My Camper bus is getting a complete entertainment center, with the possible 
inclusion of a HTPC/Carputer/MAME machine. Plus, using a 15" LCD monitor is 
cheaper than a 7" or larger TV display.

Don't think you absolutely have to use a laptop in your bus. After all, 
you've got room to spare. Built into one of the cabinets in my bus, we can 
lay down in the bed and watch DVDs, the kids can play PS2 or emulator games 
on the MAME box, etc. Plus with wireless, just pull up near a hotspot and 
get free internet access!

Now, I'm concerned about the low amps my alt puts out. I was spoiled with my 
truck that put out 150amps. What's the stock alt in a '73, like 50amps? Then 
there's the drop due to 30 year old wiring and we're talking problems.
