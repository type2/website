Increasing the stroke (the distance the piston travels between Top Dead 
Center and Bottom Dead Center -- done to increase the displacement and, 
as I recall, increase the torque) is really just a matter of using a 
differently-spec'd crankshaft and connecting rods, yes?  If I am 
remembering correctly, then it's not really so much of a "procedure", 
more like "ordering different parts" :-)

Again, my thought process here may be a little rusty, but what does the 
stroke have to do with the rocker arms?  I could imagine you need to be 
concerned about this if you have a taller cam, but as far as I am 
aware, it's certainly possible to use a stock'ish cam with a stroked 
crankshaft.

This I can't comment on.
