Subject: melted bilge blower fan

I'm curious as to where in the ducting you
mounted your fan when it melted. The
first time I installed a fan I put it in at the
back where the system dumps hot air into the belly
tube.
Was not good.
On my bus the connections for the engine compartment
fan
are closed off with sheet metal. Not air tight but a
good
seal.
My heater boxes are in very good shape (not perfect)
and were cleaned out a while ago.
The air control flaps work well (for 30 years old).
The ducting from the control flaps are all in good
shape
and all of the connections along the way are tight.
My fan has been going for a couple of years now. I
guess
I am trying to understand what the difference could be
between my overall heat sys. and yours that would
cause
a meltdown like that.. My fan is as far forward as i
could get it.
