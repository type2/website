Hi Peter,

The transmission swap you're looking at is a VERY big job.

Since you do not know what condition the auto tranny is in I would not 
recommend going any further... There are a myriad of small details to 
resolve in order to create a proper shift linkage and the hangers 
required to mount an auto transmission in a 72 bus.

And without the upper engine hatch it would be impossible to check the 
transmission fluid level.

It's been done before, but it is NOT an easy thing to accomplish.

Happy trails,
