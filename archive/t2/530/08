Do your heads have the smog-pump ports (either blocked off or functional)?
One of these leaking will make really interesting and load sounds without
noticeably affecting your power.

About 10 years ago my 73 with original heads started sounding like the
muffler was gone.  A previous owner had blocked off the smog pump ports by
cutting/crimping the tubes and one of them had come loose.  It wasn't
noticeable at idle, but when the revs came up the pressure in the cylinders
was pushing the tube out of its hole and making quite a racket.
