I had a three speed Blazer blower mounted in the spare tire well of a '71.
I capped off the heater outlets in the fan shroud and let the engine fan
just cool the engine. The air from inside the Bus was blown through some
hi-temp flexible hosing, thru' the heat exchangers and out from the heat
and defroster vents...Noisy? You bet, but hot, hot, hot eventually... ;-)
