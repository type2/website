Hi Kevin,

Your local electronics or automotive electric supplier should stock  
"piggyback" spade connectors. These little critters work just like  
regular female spade connectors except they have a male connector that  
allows a second female spade to be connected to the same post.

Here's a line drawing of one:

You can see one in use here:
