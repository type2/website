Subject: So, I have a 71 after all, eh? Rebuild or swap motors

This 'new' bus was built 07/71. It has what I'm told is a type 1 engine, 
complete with fan shroud like the K. Ghia I am familiar with.

Here's a question for the list:

If #3 cylinder broke an Exhaust Valve (Driver's side, closest to the 
front) AND the passenger's side was found to have a snapped off head 
bolt AND some procedure was performed during the last rebuild to [quote] 
Increase the Stroke [/quote] causing the rocker arms to be clearanced on 
the 'underside' (the surface facing the crank) then what are the chances 
that a new piston (#3), and new exhaust valve and some new heads (maybe 
just the driver's side) would be enough to get it back to a running state.

OTOH is there a decent chance something like the crank is bent or some 
other such nastiness?

I have a decent set of tools and experience with water cooled VWs but 
don't have hands on with bottom end rebuilding.


btw- Sure was fun driving this thing  (well, Steering) the few blocks it 
took to get it from point A to point B. Locomotion was handled by a Saab 
motor, wrapped in a Saab 900.  ;])
