I put it at the front end (front is front) of the belly tube under the bus
right before the distribution box for the outlet behind the front seats.

BTW, mine was pretty loud as well.

I'm curious as to where in the ducting you
mounted your fan when it melted. The
first time I installed a fan I put it in at the
back where the system dumps hot air into the belly
tube.
Was not good.
