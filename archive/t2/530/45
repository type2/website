Subject: Oil Galley Plug

I had to take my 78 2.0L FI in because it was leaking oil and after having
the main seal replaced, clutch repaired, re-tapping and replacing broken
exhaust studs, new push-rod tubes and engine mounts, etc.  The bus is still
leaking oil.  Now the engine is out for the second time and luckily the
mechanic isn't going to charge me got part of the work as the leak is due to
one of the oil passage plugs that has been blown.  Does anyone know if a
machinist can fix this?  I'm having a very hard time finding the correct OEM
part.  My mechanic seems to think that his machinist will be able to fix it
without any problems.

Any opinions or advice would be greatly appreciated,
