Sounds like a springbreak girlie video... <grin!>

Adjust your clutch first, test. 

Adjust you shifter linkage. Test. 

Most tranny failures are accompanied with growling bearings or popping out of gear. May leak if a seal has gone out and not come home. <grin>

Most flywheel problems are rattles (Corvair, but who cares? <grin>), starter won't engage (missing teeth) or shimmies and shakes on take off.

Clutch failures: slips, shimmies, noises with clutch engagement (broken springs).
