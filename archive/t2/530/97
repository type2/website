Hi Don,,

A 15" LCD may draw less power, but there is no way that it is cheaper 
than a 13" color TV Set. I picked up a 13" TV at Walmart last fall for 
$89 CDN. I have yet to see a new LCD monitor sell for less than $400 
CDN.

Another factor to consider is visibility. LCD's have improved immensely 
in the past few years, but even the newest models can still be very 
difficult to view in direct sunlight. And that $89 television includes 
a tuner and a speaker, features that are not typically built in to most 
LCD displays.

Being concerned about power consumption is EXACTLY why you should be 
looking at a laptop for your bus. Get a PC-Card or USB TV tuner and 
you've got the best of both worlds.

Happy trails,
