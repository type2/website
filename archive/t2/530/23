The blowers are pushing/pulling a column of air, so in a closed system it
doesn't make much difference where they are.

The only reason for putting the blower way forward is to put in at a lower
temperature as bilge blowers aren't made to blow hot air.  The air will
lose heat to the duct and perhaps be a bit cooler by the time it gets to
the front.  If the duct is properly insulated, the air won't be all that
much cooler at the front, which is a good thing.

Better to put a big blower in the engine bay, have it pull air from the
cabin and blow it into the heat exchangers.  Less noise, contamination,
and longer fan life that way.
