Jason, you are correct.  The engine fan takes over at anything over idle.
You could leave the squirrel cage running over idle and it does absolutely
no good. Whichever fan is more powerful is the one that pumps hot air up
front.  And no you can't put a fan above engine that is more powerful than
the engine fan without  major modifications, if even possible then.

Hope this helps,
