George,
  Already wrote to Stevie... I first went the route of
recirculating the air useing the existing stock fan in
the engine compartment. I saw little or no
improvement. Given that the stock fan is pretty
gutless you may get more out of a bilge fan. I have to
say it was annoyingly loud. Based on what I have
tried.. pulling the air from the front just gives a
higher volume. Creation of a negative air pressure in
the duct
and sucking more contaminates from the exhaust is IMHO
not any more of a concern than it would be in the
stock system. If you are concerned about that then you
should address the problems in your exhaust system.
Negative
pressure around the heater box probably isnt that high
as your engine's fan is pushing air through
those channels at a pretty good rate anyway. the fan
in the tube located further up the ducting is
assisting the flow that is already there.
  There is validity in going through your whole heat
duct system and making sure everything is in
good working order. I did go through mine at one time
and everything appeared to be working as designed..
Again I have been useing the in line fan for a long
time with no real problems.
  The only problem I have with moisture from the
heater is when it is raining hard and there is deep
(>3")
standing water in spots on the road. I have never
gotten that bottom tube completly water proofed.. I
got it to the point of calling it good and moved on.
:-)
  having said all this.. I would say go for the recirc
style system and let us know how it went!
