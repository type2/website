Karl
cracked. I have 3 cracked ones now. 68 only. The damn things seem to crack
around the base on the skinny part above the threads.


...For which bus?   [the 68 is one-year-only, I thought I sent you one?]
I really don't think there is a way to patch them. Usually they become
very
brittle...

Karl,
I would just like to thank you for everyone, in public,
for youre extreme generosity.
