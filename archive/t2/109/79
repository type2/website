Subject: Propane shutoff handle-packing?

If your shutoff valve leaks upon opening (mine has this problem); it's
likely the packing around the valve handle stem- these are designed to
seal when fully open (true of water faucets also)- put a towel over the
handle and OPEN IT QUICKLY ALL THE WAY- if the "fizzing" stops, it is
the packing and you can use the stove until the gas is used up.  Use the
towel to prevent freezing your hand from the escaping gas.
