Hiya Brian,

I think I may have an answer (and a seat/bed) for you.  There's a company not 
far from me that makes a Z-Bed.  This particular bed looks absolutely stock 
when folded up as a seat.  Folded out you have your bed.  And I do not 
believe that it interferes with the second seat whatsoever.

The only hitch is that the company will not start another production run on 
the beds until they have 30 folks signed up for it.

In any event, try looking over the product at:
