Subject: Filling the throttle plate hole and the 009


I realize we're beating the 009 issue to death but....
I read about a fix on the Boston Engine site about filling the hole in the PICT 34 throttle plate to resolve problems with this distributor.  Has anyone done this and with what results.

Thanks
