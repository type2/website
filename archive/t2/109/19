Better just let them know you did a little reading and fixed it yourself.
Let's come up with something interesting for that. ( like reversed plug wires ).

Relevent info would include something like 74 1.8L non-Cal bus with dual PDSIT 3/4
carbs and dual vacuum advance distributor # X-XXX-XXX, mileage since last rebuild,
compression test #'s, and whatever it was you accidently touched  that caused the
engine to regain all that horsepower ! ( Keep reading those manuals:)
