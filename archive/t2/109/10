Subject: Re: [T2] type 4 case


Thanks for your detailed reply!
As long as I have had the engine, it hasnt had
any overheating problems.  Now, the thermostat had
been removed and the engine spent some time
in Minneapolis and South Dakota, which was probably
not too good for it, but thats all I
know (it was my first VW and
I didnt know what to ask about back then).

It has always felt strong and oil
temperatures, when I started measuring them, were
always around 180-190 degrees.  It never caused the
Gene Berg dipstick to turn on even on long hills out
here in the desert in the heat.
I had to pull the heads off for some sparkplug hole
inserts and a stripped exhaust stud, and just
thought I would keep going and check things out.

thanks again
