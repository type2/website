Subject: Points 'wore' out

Hi.

The rubbing 'leg' on my ignition points 'wore' down in just a few thousand 
miles and in just a few months.  They were installed in June 2001 on a '78 
Westy FI 2.0l by yours truly, and have about 6K miles on them.

But the closing of the points was within a single month, and less than 1K 
miles.  During this single month period, I read the points at 50, then 60, 
then 70+ and then the Westy became unreliable.  Chug-a, chug-a.  I could not 
see ANY gap on them.

My previous two sets of points show NO perceptible wear on the fiber leg; I 
still have them (one set at 40K miles, next set at more than 12K miles. All 
three sets of points have the brown fiber 'leg'.  My new points are 
Brazilian and have a white fiber 'leg')

I replaced the points and set my new Brazilian points at 46.5 degrees and 
noticed my timing was 4 degrees off.  Close enough...

I ran the '78 Westy for a week, trying to read up on how to do the timing, 
when I took new readings.

The dwell went to a solid 50 degrees and the timing went to within  a half 
degree of specs. (specs = the red dot on the timing gauge)

What caused the 'leg' to wear?  It looked like it was ripped flat with 
ragged edges.  Was it faulty??    Am I faulty???  Or was it 'their' 
fault????
