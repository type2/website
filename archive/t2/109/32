Andy,

I totally agree with Rich, this is a *not* part to skimp on.
Your life depends on it....

As my sons were getting ready to get "into" paintball, my buddy asked them
if they wanted a $10 face mask or a $40 face mask...he added "what are
your eyes and face worth to you?"

They choose wisely<grin>...I was really proud of them that day.

I don't want to read about you in the paper.

Cheers, dave
