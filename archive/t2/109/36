So I took my bus to Bugformance of Sacramento, and asked them to replace
the EGR valve, and make it pass SMOG. So I took it into the SMOG check
station, and it failed by an order of magnitude. They mechanic said he had
tuned it to where it "runs best", and that it should pass smog. So I
dialed the CO mixture screw as lean as it would go, and saw absolutely NO
change on the retest.

So my thinking is that they somehow screwed up the AFM. Any other
suggestions on what might cause the problem, and does anybody on the list
in the Sacramento area have a sniffer I could use?

Thanks List!
