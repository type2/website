Hiya All,

In following this thread along I am inclined to agree with others who have 
already mentioned the dangers of "experimenting" with any of the brake system 
components.  But something else has occured to me also.  As I understand 
brake fluid (Dot whatever) it is extremely corrosive stuff.  If you go ahead 
with this I hope you make sure that whatever you use will stand up to brake 
fluid.
