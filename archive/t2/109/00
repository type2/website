Subject: custom interior setup

Hello everyone,

You guys are awesome!  I've posted two questions in the last two days and
both times I received 6+ responses in the first half hour followed by a
handful more throughout the day.  I really appreciate everyone's help and
hopefully I'll be able to help out someone else one of these days.

Now to my question.  My 73 is a non-camping transporter with both standard
seats installed.  I want to replace the rear seat with a camping fold-down
bed/seat (preferrably a full-width bed/seat), but I don't want to have to
remove my middle seat.  That may sound strange, but that's what I want to
do.  My question is: Will the rear seat be able to unfold into a bed with
the middle seat in place or is there not enough space for the bed to work
with the middle seat?

Thanks,
Brian
