Subject: Test stand queston

TGIF and hello everybody.

    I am thinking of making a test stand so as to be able to run engines out
of the bus.  I have available to me a transaxle from a 77 bus and wonder if
the bellhousing from that would work to run the 1600 from my '71.
    Come to think of it, would that same bellhousing accomodate waterboxer
engines from vanagons?  You see our local bus club members own a variety of
buses and it would be nice if I could build a "one size fits all" stand that
we all could use.
  As usual, any and all information is appreciated.
