Subject: Bay Area sale White '72 Westy w/ replacement motor

Oh Well....,

I have a White 1972 camper..the motor is shot, but the heads are o.k., it 
has a new starter, new distributor 20k ago, clutch was replaced 20K ago, 
transmission is fine, it was a good bus, and i would do the work myself,but 
i don't have the time to work on it...

the bus is going to be given to any serious offer and very SOON i hope.

the bus is in alameeda,CA (Oakland) and a AAA tow away from anywhere in the 
bay area.

if you are interested, i can connect you with a motor, complete with exhaust 
and muffler that has just had the top end rebuilt by a reputable shop. the 
motor will be only like $500 or 600 so...a great deal..

overall, it's an " average" condition bus..not tattered, or harshly 
weathered, but it's not pristine, or worthy of a full restoration ..if you 
just wan't a nice old bus to travel in, it's good. the interior is not 
tattered, but faded and scratched here and there. the front is dented (and 
pulled out as best i could manage).

existing problems..
cracked winshield, but i drove around country for 2 years without a problem, 
crack is on the side.
it may need brakes soon..i'll have to check on that.
tires are drivable and holding air well.
turn signals only for rear lights, and must be operated manually.
key doesnt work for front doors, just for ignition,side, and rear
top doesn't pop-it's been bolted in place after a 150mph wind gust on mt. 
washington,n.h. toyed with it. ever seen 4" of fresh powder carpeting the 
inside of Your bus??

it has surface rust spots here and there
the paint is white and oxidized...i ground out alot of little surface rust 
spots and painted over (sprayed) and it came out well. as it is, i think one 
could keep tabs on the rust for a few years with a little rustoleum. the 
white color does not look terrible oxidized.
the frame and floor is solid, no rust
there is a stainless steel panel on the driver side, about 5" x8" that gives 
almost an "air-support vehicle" look to it.
there is a dent in the drivers front that i pulled back out with several 
small holes.

the bus is registered in vermont, but as it's pre smog, it should  not be a 
problem

if this sounds like a project you are ready for, or would like to hear more 
about what it would take to make it happen (mechanically),
send me a contact #...
i don't have a phone # right now.
Thank You,
Shawn
