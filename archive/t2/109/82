Matty,

Never get a grilled cheese "golden brown".

But you can cook polish sausage, hamburger's, hot dogs, steaks, chops,
tuna, swordfish, lamb, liver,squid,and steer fries----

I used to drive a semi, and always cooked on the exhaust
manifold---worked good.

To cook on the type 2 may be a problem, as there isn't a good place to
get enough heat----maybe try on the top of the engine for a crock pot
type slow cook----

Later,

Terry

cheese 
hello all, 
!!!!!!!!!!!!!FRIDAY TOPIC!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
is anyone out there familiar with the concept of "cooking" grilled
cheese on ones engine. as i understand it, all that is needed to achieve
this to wrap cheese and bread in tin foil, place on engine, drive, and,
eat. 
heres what i'm wondering. what would be the best place to put the
sandwich on a type IV engine (bus content). and how long would one want
to drive in order to get that puppy a nice golden brown? (starting with
a cold engine). any insights would be great. i seriously want to try
this! thanks in advance as always.
