Oh good----

I just spent $30.00 on a "maybe it will work" repair set-up, and I could
have found a good used one, that doesn't leak for $15.00-----

What's wrong with this picture?

Later,

Terry

Or get the plastic welding kit from Harbor Tools fro $.30 
The only way to repair a polyethylene, or polypropylene, 
plastic is to 
hot air weld it---- And it is not an inexpensive 
proposition--you'd be 
better off buying a new tank, for what the welding set-up 
will cost .
