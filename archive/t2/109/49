hello,

there is a 75 Automatic Camper for sale not far from
my house. i am seriously considering buying it. does
anyone on this list own an automatic that wouild be
willing to share with me any info that might aid in my
decision. pertanent to the automatic aspect.

BTW- i have already checked out the usual outside
stuff, rockers, fenders, beam axle, etc and thsi bus
seems solid.

thanks in advance for any replys.
