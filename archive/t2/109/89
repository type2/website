Yes indeed!  As (someone) said in one of the other responses, "Manifold
Destiny" is the book for you!  The only problem with that book is that it
is aimed at water-cooled engine owners.  Those poor benighted beings have
to wrap their exhaust manifolds in some sort of containment system to
collect the heat.

VW owners are far, far luckier.  VW not only wrapped the manifolds in
sheet metal, they cast fins onto the manifold to increase heat exchange!
We call them "heater boxes"!  Then they rigged a fan to drive air thru
them!  We already have a complete cooking system in place.  All that is
missing is a box to contain the food!

I have *not* done this, but I can easily imagine re-routing the output of
one of the heater boxes to an insulated box under the rear seat (exhaust
the used hot air to the rear passenger compartment or outside the bus).
If you wanted to get fancy, you could even rig a thermostat to open and
close the flap to keep the "oven" at a set temerature.  Anyone want to
give it a shot?

Never.  It is, as (someone else) mentioned, an oven, not a frying pan.  I
*hope* that no place on your engine gets hot enough to run a fry pan!  To
melt the cheese between 2 slices of bread... think oven at ~300...  5
minutes to pre-heat the oven and maybe 10 to melt the cheese.

The challenge is to roast a chicken while driving to a campout!  figure
3-4 hours driving time... start the ckicken as you leave, add a baking
potato 1.5 hours before you arrive and you have a roasted chicken and hot
baked potato when you arrive!

Go for it!

Finally, there are two other potential sources of cooking heat on a bus.

First, as (a third person) mentioned, I do remember ovens that attached to
the rear bumper that routed exhaust gas thru them to pick up heat.  The
caveat is that they did increase back pressure and exhaust can be full of
crap like fine oil and unburned HC.  Adds a bit of spice to your food :-)
You could make one of these and run the exhaust thru an exchanger to
separate it from the food, but it starts to get complicated and also
begins to look a lot like a heater box.

Second, there is the air flowing off the cylinders.  VW does pick up some
of this air for carb pre-heat on some later T1 engines, but I don't think
it is hot enough and I am *very* cautious about messing with or
potentially blocking cooling air from/to the cylinders.
