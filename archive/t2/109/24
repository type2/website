Subject: What size spacer?

What size barrel spacers would replicate the reduced compression that dished
pistons would provide on 85.5mm cylinders?

It's easy enough to calculate the volume increase due to the spacer but I do
not know the volume of the "dish" in the piston top.

Thanks for any help.
