Subject: Re: [T2] Replacing Propane Shut Off Valve


My tank was in bad shape, fortunately it was not full. My advice would be
to go someplace safe like out in the countryside and park the bus
disconnect the ground strap on the battery and empty the tank. If you can
find a parking lot that is empty overnight try emptying it there. Propane
is heavier than air so it will sink. In Arlington it has been windy lately
so you should be able to let it fly!!  Good Luck and dont light any
matches. Don't worry propane is not as explosive as gasoline.  Once its
empty unscrew the valve and I bet you can find a new one at Home Depot. If
not Go Westy has this stuff but be prepared to get ripped on the prices.

Hi All,

Any places in Northern Virginia competent to do this
without blowing up my van.  The tank is full by the
way.

Rob
