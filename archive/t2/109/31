As a number have already said, it's obviously a Brazilian DC ( the giveaways 
would be the Type1 engine & Split style spare tyre storage behind teh front 
seat, resulting in the bulge at the back of the bulkhead ).

Really wish I could get my hands on those bumpers for my project DC, though, 
don't s'pose anyone has a spare set of Brazilian bumpers laying around, have 
they? ;^)
