Takes two or three hours to replace the cables.  You need to remove the heater control levers from the dash, take out the instrument panel, remove the pedal pan, remove the plastic caps at the end of the cable tubes near the heater boxes by pulling the tube with cap out of the hanger strap, remove the caps, take out the plastic pieces that slip over the cable, pull the old cables, run the new ones, reconnect everything, adjust the effective length at the barrel clamps on the heater box linkage.

It's just one of those jobs where it seems like you're working all ends of the bus at once.
