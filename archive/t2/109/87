Can't help you on that specifically, Matty, but, when my son was a
little'un, we used to heat bottles on the engine tin (type 1 DP doghouse).
Remarkably effective!

hello all,

!!!!!!!!!!!!!FRIDAY TOPIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!

is anyone out there familiar with the concept of
"cooking" grilled cheese on ones engine. as i
understand it, all that is needed to achieve this to
wrap cheese and bread in tin foil, place on engine,
drive, and, eat.

heres what i'm wondering. what would be the best place
to put the sandwich on a type IV engine (bus content).
and how long would one want to drive in order to get
that puppy a nice golden brown? (starting with a cold
engine). any insights would be great. i seriously want
to try this! thanks in advance as always.
