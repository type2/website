Is it not polyethylene? There is a good reason many glue tubes and bottle
are polyethylene . . . nothing sticks well to it.
 
The only way to properly repair polyethylene is to weld it but you need the
right tools, technique, and experience to do that. A hot gas jet is used
rather than an electrode of any sort so forget the soldering iron.
 
You could encapsulate it in a layer of fiberglass and polyester resin.
