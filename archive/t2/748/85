I took my van to the mechanic today and he verified that it is the 
second gear
brake piston cover leaking and that I would be a fool to try and do it 
myself.

The bad news is that he could not get the gaskets/seals without buying 
the whole $100 kit. I told him that I would find them myself... so, if 
anyone here could help me find those, I would appreciate it! I don't 
have parts numbers or anything, but I am busy online trying to find the 
info that I need. I'm checking some of the other trans parts companies 
listed here, but it is a little confusing. BTW the machine is an 80 
Vanagon with a 3-speed, and a real leaky second gear
brake piston cover.

I sincerely appreciate anyone's help with this problem, in advance.

Be well- Herb. (Go Cardinals)
