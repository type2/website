Maybe I mis-read your post, but it appeared like you only had the clutch area resurfaced.

"When I had my flywheel step cut and ...."

This makes it sound like you just had it step cut on the disk surface!

Some shops are dumb enough to do that......

I was looking for the correct measurement from the cover edge to the disc surface. I know it has to be out 
there somewhere.

I AM very puzzled as to why they machined just the clutch surface.

I didn't say that...

You have to machine the same amount off the face where the cover bolts on, on stepped flywheels.
Otherwise the geometry is off. Then when the disk wears, you are out of
leverage to hold pressure. That is why your wing nut is at the bottom end of the threads.... you are out of 
the range of travel.
Either you need to have them redo the flywheel correctly or get another one.

 The dowels were removed, the flywheel was step cut, and the dowels replaced:

 Looking for what?
