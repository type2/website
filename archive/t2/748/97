I added the gauages to the dash between the radio and ashtray. No parts necessary... Think long and hard about whether you want to cut the dash. Also measure about 7 times because mistakes show up really well. finally spend the extra cash and get a GOOD hole saw (aka DeWalt or Milwaukee). It killed 2-3 Black and Decker saws. I would have been cash ahead with the better hole saw with a tool I could have used again later.
