Oh, sure. I just installed a tach. Not in the clock hole, but still... ;-)

Nice gesture! I'm sure they'll all be welcomed by someone who didn't
just install a tach... LoL!

BTW: If you don't have a tach on your bus you have NO idea what you're
missing! Training your ear with a handheld tach at the rear of the bus
doesn't translate to sitting a mile away at the front of the bus. =)
