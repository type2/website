Subject: sockets: regular versus impact

I broke my 19mm socket trying to coax lug bolts off the wheels of a 
newly purchased vehicle.
I would like to buy just this individual socket. My favorite catalog 
has sections for regular sockets and other sections for impact 
sockets.
What is the difference?
