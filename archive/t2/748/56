Well, I still blame it on Lucas.  I bet earlier generations made ice-boxes with no insulation.  I was once fishing in a creek and saw an old man pull a milk crate tied to a rope out of the water.  Yep, he was keeping his moonshine cool!  Drinking stuff cold goes back generations here.  Drinking beer warm is downright disgusting after you've tasted a good cold one.   JMHO....KR
