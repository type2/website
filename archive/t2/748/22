Subject: Re: [T2] sender units

I took a failed sender apart, and it is simply  a winding of resistant 
wire wrapped around a flat that the wiper arm (attached to the float) 
rides on in an arc.  The winding had failed at one spot in the middle 
(literally rubbed through), explaining why one can have a gauge that 
seems to be working and then suddenly fails when the float wiper passes 
the broken spot.  I can send a pic if one wants (I'll send it to R. 
Atwell to post).
