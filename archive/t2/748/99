Subject: Clutch Operating Shaft - 69 Stock

Short Description
--------------------
Need some advice on where to get a replacement clutch
operating shaft (and associated parts).  One of the
arms on the left side broke off.

Little bit of looking I have found so far is a site in
UK;
http://www.johnmaherracing.co.uk/jmrshop/clutch.htm.  
Anyone in the states order from here or have better
advice ?

If you read carefully there is also some talk on this
web page about changing the clutch operating shaft to
a later style that has a better weld etc....Should I
be considering this?

Long Description
--------------------
Driving along in my Bus; large SUV cuts in front of
me, obviously the few feet of following distance was
more than enought to squeeze into at 60+ mph! 
Slamming on brakes and down shifting, clutch goes to
floor and does not come back up...darn another broken
clutch cable.  Pull off to side of road and inspect,
no such luck...clutch cable is good...darn I see a
motor being pulled in my future.

As I and a friend begin preparing to pull the motor it
is not completely obvious what is wrong, but as work
progresses a very loose top left engine nut is found,
after engine is removed found clips and broken peice
of metal from stock spot welded clutch operating
shaft.

I am now looking for advice on where to get the needed
parts, the repair looks pretty strait forward in
bently, also will probably order a new clutch kit as
well to ensure that pulling the motor only needs to be
done once. 

This happenned on a rebuilt single port motor with
about 10,000 miles on it.

All advice and encouragement needed !
Thanks
Bob Horkay
