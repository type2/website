I have no answer as to why Lucas has successfully made bad 
auto-electrical components for so may years but the warm bear has two 
answers.

1)  Beer has been a food in the British isles for hundreds of years... 
long before refrigeration.

2)  Perhaps the most important reason; refrigeration (and therefore 
cold temperatures) suppress the beer's ability to release its aroma and 
taste.  Real (fresh, unpasturized) larger has a sweet heavy aroma that 
is lost when the beer is cold--it won't form a good head either.  Since 
taste is about forty percent smell, that also partially explains why 
the Brits (and other Europeans) only drink beer from a glass--never out 
of a bottle (no smell, minimal taste, too much excess gas).  Cheers
