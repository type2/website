Your premise seems valid but doesn't the transmission "center itself" once
it is handing from it's carrier?

Everytime I install it, the dirt marks on the prongs form the nose cone end
up in the same place but only if I bolt that part last.

I just broke a cable inside the bowden tube myself so I'm wondering what's
wrong with my setup...
