Subject: Re: [T2] deck height

You guys can techno bable this thing to death but Tom Wilson says .060 for
high performance engines in the Air Cooled class.
I've run .031 deck height on several stock Type IV engines for over 200,000
miles.
My 912e Porsche only had .056 deck height. (Measured with a piece of crushed
hollow core solder and crushed thin wall brass tube).
I read deck height by dropping a brass flat of 1/4" x .060 down the spark
plug hole with the heads fully torqued down.
In situations where you're using Used OEM VW heads it's about the only way
to read the true clearance between the piston and the head.
The reading across the piston top / cylinder just could cause a collision.
