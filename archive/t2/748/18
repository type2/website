Some don't consider it "nothing."  It could result in someone losing their
job if someone inadvertantly accesses an inappropriate image at the wrong
time.

Therein lies the difference.  The type2 list is a technical resource, not
a general entertainment medium.  "Switching off" the type2 list means the
loss of valuable technical content concerning our buses.  There are
plenty of "adult" sites to satisfy those who want that content, so there
is no reason to put it on the type2 list.

Sorry guys, but take the adult content elsewhere.
