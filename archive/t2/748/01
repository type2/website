Subject: Re: [T2] Windshield Washer Pump?- & switch

When we installed speakers in a better front location in Nyssa's 75 
(justoutboard from the heat vents) I moved the washer tank to the bottom 
right by heating it in a oven and squished it flatter to fit in the 
narrower space.  Added an electric pump to the bottom tube and a 
momentary push switch that fits nicely to the wall of the ignition key 
surround on your steering column. Pics available on request.
