 I feel like the spring moved around
in the switch, jamming everything.  The fact that the lock worked fine
without the switch in place tends to validate my thoughts.  Ron's searching
for a new electrical assembly now, and should be back to normal as soon as
that's installed.

Any speculation on how risky it is to run with a bus whose ignition
doesn't have any return to on spring action?  Shrugged off my "broken"
switch with resolve to appropriately spin the key myself, but after
seeing this post I'm concerned about floating spring parts..
