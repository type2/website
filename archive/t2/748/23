Subject: Re: [T2] Where is the engine supposed to be?

From Richard Atwell:

I installed a new cable (Gemo) 2+ years ago. The adjustment was somewhere in the middle of the threads. When I 
had my flywheel step cut and installed a new clutch disc, the same cable had to be threaded almost all the way 
in. The replacement cable (also Gemo) is in the same position even with the new Bowden tube.

This makes sense to me because the deeper flywheel and new clutch disc have bent the fingers on the pressure 
plate more towards the engine. I also replaced the release breaing but it didn't see so much thicker that it 
would make up for difference.

I AM very puzzled as to why they machined just the clutch surface.
You have to machine the same amount off the face where the cover bolts on, on stepped flywheels.
Otherwise the geometry is off. Then when the disk wears, you are out of
leverage to hold pressure. That is why your wing nut is at the bottom end of the threads.... you are out of 
the range of travel.
Either you need to have them redo the flywheel correctly or get another one.

* I have looked, for the past hour!, in the early split bus Bentley, bay Bentley, yellow book, Vanagon 
Bentley, Without Guesswork, Rimcos website, and all over the web to substantiate this but either it is a 
best-kept secret or my meds are wearing off!
