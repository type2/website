Subject: bowden tube - was: Where is the engine supposed to be?

Well, I have an old one, but the rubber on the outside is broken and the 
outside metal "wrapping" is rusted.  The tube is still pretty solid, but 
I'm not sure if I should use it or not.  It seems like there is also 
another tube inside of the metal "wrapping" so I might go ahead and use 
it.  The older tube that I have uses metal ends instead of the newer 
tubes that have plastic ends.  Plus, I think I remember the newer tubes 
being slightly longer than the older tubes.

Do you think a longer tube (with more bend) will lead to faster cable wear?

Thanks,
Mike
