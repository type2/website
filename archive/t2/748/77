That ramp is also a little spendier because it's all aluminum.  This
place offers a steel ramp for a little less money:

The frame-contact lift is better if you want to work on the wheels,
brakes, etc, since the wheels are not holding up the car.  On the other
hand, supporting the car under the wheels is probably a little more
stable than supporting it by the frame.  The frame-contact lift is
arguably a little more portable than the ramp, but the lift does weigh
over 1,000 pounds.  It appears that the ramp can be broken down
somewhat, but I don't know how small it gets or what it weighs total.

Standard disclaimers apply: I don't get money from any of the companies
mentioned above.
