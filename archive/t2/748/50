PS: PROPER compression is critical. The Otto engine converts gas to
mechanical work, heat, and noise. The higher the CR, the more work is
accomplished out of the conversion (to a point).

The argument that lower CR means a cooler running engine is false. The
example I often give is a furnace, with a compression ratio of 0, it's sole
purpose is to produce HEAT. If the compression is too low or too high (for
the cam and gas used), the engine will run hotter then you want it to.
