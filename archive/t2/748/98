Hi John,

Is there a way to determine the compression ratio of an engine without dismantling it to take measurements. i.e. can a compression reading (in psi) be converted to CR?

Thanks,
Bill Moon

is 226 the .050" duration?

Plenty of guys think I'm full of it, I have a pump gas street engine that
runs 14:1 CR, I'd like to think I know a little bit about VW Combustion
chambers. But with traditional flat-top pistons, I strongly suggest you keep
the deck under .065".

Without more details on the cam, I can't go any further.

That appears to be a very close to stock cam, I would not go over 7.5:1 with
it. The combo that will work is a larger chamber and .065" deck. 6.9:1 is
for the birds IMO.
