Subject: Re: [T2] Where is the engine supposed to be?

I have to agree with Richard (Atwell),
The way I understand it the trans. is centred by the support above the 
flywheel. The bend in the Bowden tube is adjusted with shims between the end 
of the tube and the support on the trans it slips into. If there are no 
shimmed for you to remove there you may have to look into why it is bent too 
far. Could something be out of alignment, or the tube ends not seating 
properly, or be a tube off a different model?
Regards,
Richard
