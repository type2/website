...but I think I'm still a bit lost. I'll probably have to take it to
a shop with a co meter.

#1: I pulled the hot start valve off. The running like crap for 5
minutes after a stop for gas went away. It seems the gasket that came
with my rebuild kit was binding. I'll leave it off until I find
another for the right carb and then I'll cut my own gasket.

#2: The balance was set based on the stop plate screws which I had
left alone. Ahhh... Dumb Don Dumb Don Dumb Don

I backed them both out until the bus wouldn't idle at all regardless
of the mixture screw settings, turned them in 1/2 turns each until I
could affect the idle at the left carb. Started over then balancing.
MUCH better. I have power again. However I couldn't get the match to
be perfect, hence the comment about taking the bus to a shop. But at
least I'm comfortable with what's happening now.

Time to hook up my $19 tach. :)
