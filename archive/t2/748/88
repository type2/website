Subject: Re: [T2] Automatic Transmission Leak

From Herb Belrose:

I took my van to the mechanic today and he verified that it is the 
 second gear brake piston cover leaking and that I would be a fool to try and do it myself.
 
The bad news is that he could not get the gaskets/seals without buying 
the whole $100 kit. I told him that I would find them myself... so, if 
anyone here could help me find those, I would appreciate it! I don't 
have parts numbers or anything, but I am busy online trying to find the 
info that I need. I'm checking some of the other trans parts companies 
 listed here, but it is a little confusing. BTW the machine is an 80 
Vanagon with a 3-speed, and a real leaky second gear
brake piston cover.

According to ETKA, here are the part numbers for the seals in that area.
And the early Vanagon trans uses the same seal rings as the late bay trans.
Here is a pic of the trans pieces:

54 is the cover seal  010 323 533     91x3mm
52 is the piston sealing washer 003 323 525A      97mm
45 is a sealing washer  010 323 487C     61.4mm
