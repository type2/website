Subject: pitted lifters

not to distract us too much from deck :)

but the lifters in the crapcase have some obvious probs:

these are supposedly 'the best german' ensemann (sp?) lifters, but 
that wear is with less than 5K. i know they didn't look like that at 
500 miles, and david crow had pronounced the cam and lifters as 
'breaking in nicely.'

so either something has changed to pit them, they were crap to begin 
with despite seller's claims, or (as one shop told me) 'they all do 
that now - just no-one sees em till 60k when they do a rebuild.'

either way, they're getting slapped back into the crapcase. a new set 
of stock cam and lifters is out of budget right now.

comments welcome.


on the happy side, here's a crank jig i had a muffler shop make for me:
