Subject: Type 2 is about Type 2's, right?

Hi Volks:

I'm not prude but I'm with George here.  Every so often, usually during 
a holiday where some part of the country has bad weather Type 2 posts go 
south.  I read this for Bus stuff.  I read other lists for political 
stuff.  Since beginning ministerial training, I'd prefer to skip "Adult" 
content in my email lists..... And yes there is Type2 Talk to which I do 
subscribe.  Let's use it more and move the questionable stuff over there.

George is the Admin.  Let him do his job!

BEN
