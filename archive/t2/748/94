Subject: Re: [T2] Adding gages 

Hi,  I recently added gauges to my 70, 1600 DP.  I added a Tach, Oil
Pressure and Temp and a voltage gauge.  They are all VDO gauges. I mounted
the Tach in the hole sometimes used for a clock.  The Tach is a 3 1/8"
diameter and uses a retaining ring purchased through Bus Boys.  It is
connected to the Coil.  The Oil Temp. gauge uses a galley plug in the engine
for the sensor location.  The Oil pressure uses the existing pressure sender
location, but I used the VDO dual sensor unit so that I can retain the idiot
light function.  The Voltage gauge simply is connected to the positive side
of the fuse box (via a switched source).  All the gauges are wired using
common +Vdc and ground connections.  The 3 smaller gauges are mounted in the
radio slot using a 3 gauge DIN size panel purchased from egauges.com
(http://www.bugsandbuggies.com/vdo_acce.asp?Subgroup=Generic_DIN-).  You can
also mount them between the radio DIN and the ashtray.  I believe Bus Boys
sells a 3 gauge panel for this area as well.  You'll have to use a hole saw
to cut the dash however.

I like having the gauges.

Hope this helps,

I have a 1978 ASI/Riviera Camperbus 2L (2000cc) Fuel Injected VW.

I am interesting in putting in an Oil Gage and a Tachometer and possibly a
voltage gage.  These would be just so I can monitor whats going behind me so
I do not have to totally rely on my nose and butt (vibrations) and rear view
mirror to let me know something's up.

I am planning on pulling the engine at the end of summer to do all of this,
just want to know what I need to have/get to make all of this happen.

Thanks.
