You hit the button on those things, Chris.
The best thing to do if you can is take it to a
trustworthy VW specialist & have them put it on a
hoist and do the whole check.
It cost me about $120 here in Australia.
Often the Automobile Association does similar
services.
My own check to add is the windscreen seal & front
skirt.
If it looks dodgy you may be in LOTS of trouble.
Cheers And Happy Hunting
