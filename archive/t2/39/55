the 009 dizzy doesn't work that badly in a type1 engine, it is in 72 when
the type4 engine started being used in the bus that the 009 dizzy became
very difficult to use, and with the Fuel Injected engine next to
impossible to get to even run half assed well.

I had a 009 in my 71 years ago and it was ok.  but my 78  had a newish
009 in it when I got it.  I phutzed with it and phutzed with it and never
could get that engine to run right.  finally someone told me to find the
right dizzy for it.  took some searching but finally found one but the
difference was unbelievable.

if yours is a type IV engine, take the time and energy to find a decent
correct vacuum dizzy you won't have wasted your time
