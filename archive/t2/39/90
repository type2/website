I keep reading posts where people say they have a 050 distributor, like this
one.

What is the complete Bosch number on this or any 050 distributor? Is this 050 in
a oval circle stamped by itself on the housing? Isn't an abbreviated number i.e.
009 or 010 or 050 the last 3 numbers of the Bosch part number?? I have seen LOTS
of distributors with 050 in a oval circle and they have been all centrifugal and
vac/centrifugal. I believe the 050 in a circle is some form of casting
number.....
