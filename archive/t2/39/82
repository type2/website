Subject: RE: [T2] 009 into a 71 Westy with 1600cc?

Thanks all for your advice.

Seems like I need to switch back to the original vaccum advance distributor
for my 71 westy... don't want to fiddle with 009 adjustments and so on... I
have a stock vaccum advance distributor out of 75 bug(FI). Is this
compatible with 71 westy engine(type1, 1600cc dual port)? Can I just take
out the 009 and put this one in?... how about the timing? Where does the
vaccum line from the distributor hook up to?

Thanks!
William
