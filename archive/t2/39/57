Subject: Westy tent Ridge connectors wanted

Hey there Volks,

I know this is a long shot, but...

I want the two ridge connectors for a westy tent frame. These 2
connectors form the peak in the westy driveaway tent frame. I bought
a tent at a decent price, but it's missing these 2 peices.

Figured I try to tap the resources of the lists before I try to rig
something up like what is described here:

using parts that can be obtained from here:

http://www.canopymasters.com/fittings_page.htm

The 2 parts I need are like the P3E fitting pictured in the link
above. If I can't locate originals, I'll need a measurement of the
angle of an original peice from someone so I can buy a suitable
replacement (and some 3/4 conduit).

Many thanks to Joe Clark for maintaining his Westy tent page that was
the source for all the info above.

If you've got the peices I'm interested in, or can measure the angle
of an original peice for me, please drop me a pmail.

Thanks in advance,
