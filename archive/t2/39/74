Subject: sunroof locks

For those of you contributing recently on the lack of keys for my new 79 sunroof, I took apart the slider lock assembly as someone had suggested that key codes could be found on the door handle shaft, but I found none.

Not wanting to deal with the passenger door locks yet I went to the hatch lock. a 5 or 6 digit letter and number combination was on there as well as two vw part numbers. I am assuming this is the key code. (if not necessarily still in synch with the ignition)

Will find out at locksmith today.
