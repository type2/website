GEX also seems to be the master of the "service limits" rebuild.
Basically, if a part is less than 100% worn out it is good enough for
them.  They give a 15K warranty and hope that the engine lasts that long
or that the teenybopper will sell their VW before the motor goes.  On the
first and last GEX engine I bought I managed to get 40K miles in a very
well maintained bug with a perfect cooling system.  The engine had low oil
pressure from day 1.  The "new" heads had mismatched valve stem heights.

Jake and Boston Bob are the people to talk to.  If they weren't around,
I'd put a Subaru in my bus before I'd buy anything from GEX.
