Subject: Re: [T2] weber carbs, fuel pump, etc.

one problem is that webers are designed for NO MORE than 3.5psi.

When you exceed this, the engine will not "flood" as most people understand
it, but the extra pressure puts pressure on the needle/seat, and effectively
raises the fuel level, which brings the main jets in sooner (rich running),
and you are running on both the idle AND main jets at 2500-3000.

BTW, the chrome regulators with a cheesy dial on them are garbage, get them
away from your car into the nearest trash can, and get a quality Holley or
Mallory regulator.
