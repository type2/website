Not knowing squat about power curves, etc. I hesitate
to say this, but I owned a '66 bus, original engine.
but it had a 009. I ran it all over the country, never
noticed anything amiss. I remember it fondly as the
best VW  i ever had.

Now I own a 68 that has the same engine as the 66 and
a vacuum advance dist. Runs just as wonderfully as my
'66.

<shrug?> I guess it's like wine. One needs to develop
a "nose" and a "palate" to fully appreciate a good dizzy.
