Subject: Re: [T2] 009 distributor? Why not?


On Vacuum Distributors:
I have seen two different kinds, one has the single hose fitting and the 
other has 2 (front and back). My 77 2.0L has the two hose kind, but the 
front hose was disconnected for 4 years and it ran great, i finally got it 
hooked up right, and it runs about the same. I have always wondered what the 
main difference is on the two hose vs. one hose dizzy. Is there an 
advantage? I assume the one hose vac advance pulls more air from the diz 
shaft area.. anyways, food for thought.
