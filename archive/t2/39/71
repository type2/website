Subject: Re: [T2] 009 distributor? Why not?

Oh, and further proof that 009 is evil:  If you add up the digits of 666 you
get 18, which when similarly combined equals 009.
And  when you spell Muir backwards, you get Rium, which is sort of a
misspelling of Ruin, which is also bad.  Very Halloween.

Burn them! Burn them!
