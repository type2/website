Subject: Re: [T2] 009 distributor? Why not?

Near as I know, the advance curve on the 009 doesn't go beyond 30
degrees- but the 2000cc 77 needs 45 degrees advance, as I measured on
mine.  I had the 009 on a 71 bus, and it was very unforgiving at initial
takeoff (needed to punch  the throttle soundly).
