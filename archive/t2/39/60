Rob and Keith,

The 34's are similar to the stock carbs in that they are the same 
size (bore) and both supply air/fuel to two cylinders per barrel.  
My conclusion from that info is that they should work fine on an 
1800 or even a 2-liter (which got 34mm Solexes outside the US).

I run a Holley regulator set at 1.3 psi which works for me.  
Keith, the consequenses for too much pressure are as follows:  
Under 5psi probably won't cause any problems (although there is no 
reason to run more than 3psi IMO).  At around 10-15psi the float 
valves will be overpowered and gas will run continuously through 
the carbs into your engine which will probably result in hydro-
lock, oil dillution (sp?), breakdown of cylinder wall lubrication 
and accelerated ring wear.

Minor rant follows - apologies in advance:
Alarms always go off in my head when someone posts a question and 
then mentions something related along the lines of, "I have no 
idea what X is" where X is something basic like fuel pressure, or 
compression, or oil temperature, or carb jet size.  It would 
really help those who would supply answers/experience if the 
people asking the questions would do a little data gathering 
before posting.  If you don't know how to get this data the 
listmembers will be happy to help.  Otherwise, useless speculation 
will most likely result.

So Keith, the obvious thing that you need to do ASAP is check your 
fuel pressure.  Beg/Borrow/Steal a gauge.  If you can't find a 
fuel pressure gauge, one of the vacuum/pressure gauges from 
AutoZone will do (they read pressure up to 10psi - I think it's a 
SunPro?  Cheap, about $20 - keep it, you will need it again 
someday).  Unhook one fuel line at the carb and attach it to the 
gauge.  The vacuum/pressure gauge will have a tapered plastic 
connector that you can just shove into the fuel line and hold 
there while someone cranks the engine.  Be sure to ground the coil 
wire first and have a fire extinguisher close at hand.  Read the 
pressure on the gauge and if it goes over 5 I would get a 
regulator immediately.  Otherwise you are probably okay.

-David

p.s. When you get the new pump, check its pressure too.  Assume 
nothing when it comes to replacement parts for your bus!
