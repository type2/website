It will work; many people use it. But since its advance curve is
inappropriate for a type 4 engine, you simply will not be able to time it
properly. You can time it for acceptable acceleration, but the timing at
idle will be wrong. You can time it correctly for idle but it will
accelerate poorly.  Most people do the former. This is fine for most use,
but if you are idling for an extended period of time, incorrect timing can
overheat your motor, with potentially disasterous results.

I do have a different centrifugal-advance distributor which is said to have
slightly more appropriate timing characteristics for a 72-up bus engine, for
hardly more than the price of an 009. You will find a review of this
distributor on Type2.com.   No reason to replace your stock vacuum advance
distributor with this unless you have to, of course, but if you do have to,
at least this one is affordable and a better option than an 009.   Part # 9
