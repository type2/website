I've never heard of Good Carma.  I've also heard that the VW Man does good 
work but I do my own so no personal experience there either.  You might also 
try J.A.C Automotive at the Anoka/Ramsey city borders.  They also do very 
good work there and Jerry Coffin, owner and fellow Twin Cities Volkswagen 
Club member, has had a few, about 3 I think, of his bugs in the VW mags.
