Subject: Lost Key Nonsense

All this talk about tearing the steering column apart because of lost keys.
STOP.
I lost my keys to several VWs over the years. Square, bug, and a 79 loaf.
Take the door handle off (outside) take it to a locksmith he will read the
code and make you
a new key.  Unless of course, your handles and/or ignition are different.
