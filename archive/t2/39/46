Subject: Re: [T2] RE: GEX

The 76 bus I'm resurecting,  the engine,I found out last week, is a 
GEX...seems to run good with good pressure, etc. ...but in replacing the 
pushrod tube seals, #3 exhaust pushrod was something I'd never seen...a tube 
that was solid stainless steal, about 1/4" in diameter???
(no, it wasn't a hydrolic lifter tube)...the rest of the tubes were the 
standard alum/steel tubes.  I replaced it with a regular tube...no, the PO 
did not do this, he said it was a "new engine"...so, GEX did it.
I fear the future...
