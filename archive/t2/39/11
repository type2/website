Hey folks - call a locksmith.

Watched one make a key for a car one time.

He took a new blank, used a file to clean the edges of the key and inserted 
it into the lock. Twisted it back and forth to mark the tumblers on the 
key, filled the key down at the marks, repeat, repeat. 20 mins. Don't know 
if her used an ink on the key - been about 6 years.

In the end we had a working key for that lock. It worked on the doors too. 
He made a copy that wasn't so rough on the tumblers with smoother teeth.
Ciao!
