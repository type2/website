That is strange that the archives don't return anything on a search for 009,
I don't have an explanation for it--however, if you enter more cogent search
terms such as "bosch distributor advance curve" I think you will be happier
with the results you get.

I didn't try a search for "centrifugal stumble", that might bear fruit too.
