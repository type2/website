Subject: Re: [T2] GEX

I've got to second John here. Jake built an engine for my bug that was not 
only extremely powerful but very reliable, and he's currently building a new 
engine for my bus. I've yet to meet someone in my air-cooled VW travels that 
has any complaints about his work. Yes, it will cost you a little more up 
front, but how much is piece of mind worth? Lots of people say they warranty 
their stuff, but Jake actually stands behind his work 100%.

Bob, I don't know where you're located, but if it's anywhere near the 
southeast, a trip to Jake's is well worth your time. Plus, I believe he 
ships his engines as well.
