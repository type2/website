Subject: Buying Help '73

Hi All,

I may be buying a 73' westy hard top this weekend.  I will probably have
about 30 minutes to decide if I want it or not since it is located about 2
hours away.  He has been very open with the condition of the engine and
exterior/interior and says it runs great, no issues at all.  He has done
lots of work with the engine.

So,  any tips or tricks on what to look for when I check it out?

Also, what should I expect to pay for something like this.  The paint is
good, only rust is on the bumpers, 2-3 minor dents, great working engine,
and the mattress is in good shape.
Just a ballpark figure....
