Subject: Re: [T2] crank holder

Hey! That is the ticket! ,, and it worked great!

A local group of folks got together last night to disassemble a T4 2 Liter ,,In
a party type or atmosphere,, beer and wings to start, then some serious
diagnostics, and questions,,  I was able to impress them with a few tips and
tricks I have learned,, and visa versa.
It was quite a learning experience for some folks,, 

I am really impressed with idea's that are "cheap and easy!" :-)

Thanks Kayaker!
