He probally bought up SIR machines. After 30 years of business he threw in
the towel, that only leaves the last HACK shop, known as GEX.

ps. GEX is known as buying all the importers damaged goods, p/l, heads,
bearings, etc. I won't go into what I found in a customers new 1776 GEX
crapola engine.

A friend of mine told me on Sunday that GEX has gone out of business.  If
he's right ---- HURRAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

There's a guy that has built a business driving all over California
collecting engine and trans cases for resale to builders in southern Cal in
exchange for completed units that he would then deliver back to the VW shops
around the state.  The story my friend told me is that the guy has
apparently decided to think bigger and has bought up tooling and inventory
from some defunct outfit down there to do the whole thing himself.
