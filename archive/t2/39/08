Subject: 1600cc DP intake manifold

I'm rebuilding a1600DP and I'm about to bolt on the three intake manifold
sections. The center section has a tang that is secured to the case using
an existing extra long stud.

When I joined the case halves, I put a nut on that stud and torqued it to
spec.

At this stage,  doo I remove that nut, slip the manifold tang over the stud
with its face against the case, and then secure this with the nut?  Or do I
slip the manifold tang up against that nut and add another nut to the stud
so that the tang is sandwiched between these  two nuts?

It makes a difference because the heat riser flanges must eventually mate
with those on the muffler.

TIA.  Jack
