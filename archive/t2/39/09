Hi Folks,

FREE TO A GOOD HOME: Green 1969 Kombi converted to cargo bus; currently in 
St. George, Utah. Fully dressed engine with cracked case along with working 
trans are sitting in cargo bay. All electrical, steering, brakes, glass, 
etc., are in good shape. Needs new long block and C.V. joints to be a daily 
driver. Quite a bit of rust but structurally sound, crash damage on rear 
corner. Four good tires and terrific karma - it was taken off the road in 
August 2001 in order to donate its drivetrain to another bus. Interested 
parties can email whoajesus(-at-)hotmail.com for a more thorough description.
