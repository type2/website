John,
     I just don't think your gonna be happy with a 40 horse in your Thing.  I 
myself have a 74' Thing.  The 0 to 60 time for a stock Thing is 23 seconds.  
I have a 1641 in my Thing and it is quite a bit faster than that.  But a 40 
horse is going to slower than the stocker.  Also the Things had a skid plate, 
it used the same mounting holes as the mustache bar on the buses (bus 
content).  So if you have or stumble across the skid plate you can't use 
them.  You also going to have a 12 volt flywheel and the pressure plate, the 
kind set up for the guide tube on around the input shaft.   
                                                                Peace,
                                                                   F.W.Tyler
                                                                    Too many 
VW's to list
