I just felt I should add to this:

The key for the ignition switch is the same as the front doors and the
locksmith can make a key from the door handle too. It is much more difficult
to get the ignition switch lock cylinder out of the steering column. Most
locksmiths have a mobile van so I would just have them come out to make a
key. Here is a good link for the procedure:
