Subject: Deluxe Window  Rubber - w/groove

Early deluxe bay window buses have aluminum molding in the window seal and
later ones I've seen have plastic. When purchasing replacement window rubber
does it make a difference whether the molding groove is designed for the
plastic or aluminum insert? Obviously the alignment of the molding will be
slightly different if the groove is in the same place because the groove
aligns with the centerline on the plastic insert and with the edge of the
aluminum insert. So I guess my questions are. . .

- Are all rubbers with the groove the same?
- Are both the aluminum and plastic trim available from vendors? If so, from
whom.

Thanks in advance for any info and advice.
