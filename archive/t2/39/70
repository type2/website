Hi Jeremy,

One side is advance, the other is retard.  The retard was used in the 70s to
keep the engine hot at idle (just what a VW engine needs) to burn more
hydrocarbons.

At the risk of being a heretic, I am haunted by the statement somewhere in
Bentley that the vac advance was cut off in my year except in 4th gear
unless the air temp was less than 54 degrees, which is 90 percent of the
time here in LA.

The VW engineers must have been an ignorant bunch to have failed to realize
that vac advance is critical to accelleration, and thus to have restricted
it to 4th gear.  Or maybe they just didn't think anyone would live where the
temp was more than 54 degrees.

Or could it be that we've indulged in a bit of mythologizing, promped by St.
Bob Hoover?  Nahh, couldn't be.  Of course we need vac advance.  Bad 009!
Bad 009! Anathema! Anathema!

Regards,

Grant
