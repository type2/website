Drooled over an pristine '87 Westy today on Salt
Lake's capitol hill.
110K original miles, beautiful body and paint.
But I fell over when the owner asked $13,500 for it.

Guess I'll stick with my '68, coleman stove and
sleeping bags.
But if any of you high rollers are tired of fixing
rust, i'll send u info and phone #.
