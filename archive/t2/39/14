Subject: attn: Vermonters..any way around "collectors" tax?

I'm fixing to buy another bus as the engine just blew  up in my '72.  
Vermont taxation now has a collectors value on microbuses to the tune of 
3,000$ even if your bus actually acts it's age.....i'm out of state right 
now, so no chance of a dealer's appraisal (must be in state).

any way around this?

thanks,
Shawn
