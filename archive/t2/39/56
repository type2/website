It will bolt up...It will be low on power, as the Thing is actually heavier
than the bus......

> Hey Y'all!
> Sorry for the mrginal bus content of this post, but I may have the
opportunity to trade this 64 bus I have for a 73 Thing. The thing is (pun
intended) that the Thing has no engine, so I would want to use the 40HP
currently in the bus for the Thing.  Anyone know if i can put a 40HP engine
in a 73 Thing?
