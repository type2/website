It is the one that I described the other day:

" I do have a different centrifugal-advance distributor which is said to
have slightly more appropriate timing characteristics for a 72-up bus
engine, for hardly more than the price of an 009. You will find a review of
this distributor on Type2.com.   No reason to replace your stock vacuum
advance distributor with this unless you have to, but if you do have to, at
least this one is affordable and a better option than an 009.  Part # 9 230
081 050.  $66.50 with listmember discount."

This is the centrifugal one. Any other distributor ending in 050 is a
completely different beast. (Most others I've seen that ended in 050 were
vacuum advance Porsche distributors.)
