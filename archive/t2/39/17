Subject: Help in Indiana

Hi Volks,
A Friend of mine (Terry) just emailed me, seems that her 82 Vanagon diesel
engine caught fire in Indiana.  She asked if I could forward this to the list
in the hopes that someone could help.  I had a friend forward to the Vanagon
list but thought someone on here might have a diesel engine they might be able
to come off of.

Please respond to her at girlandherbus(-at-)yahoo.com.

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
