Subject: A quote apropo to this list?

Saw this on the oboe list, a poster who gives a quote a day, I was
reminded of the Type2 list  and thought it should be kept in mind....
Gallois's Revelation:
 
If you put tomfoolery into a computer, nothing comes out but tomfoolery.
But 
this tomfoolery, having passed through a very expensive machine, is
somehow 
ennobled, and no one dares to criticize it.
 
Corollary - An expert is a person who avoids the small errors while
sweeping 
on to the Grand Fallacy.
