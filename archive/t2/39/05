Subject: Re: [T2] GEX Update Question...

based on the numerous posts in the archives of almost
every VW list I'm on, including this one, I wouldn't
want anything from GEX (even maybe a poster of one of
their bikini clad GEX chicks anywhere near a VW)
anywhere near my bus. I'd buy used before a HEX
engine.   

But it's your money.  Gamble if you will.
