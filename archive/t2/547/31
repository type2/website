Michael,
Tough call over the internet--

I'd have to actually give the Bus a visual prior to making that call--

Buy 4 quarts of Utra fill grey--what you don't use take back--

This is about the best I can tell you to do without actually seeing the
vehicle--

Question to Terry: 
How much primer or ultrafill is needed if the majority of your 30 year
old paint is still good? Or is it better to goo ahead a prime it all to
be safe? 
TravelOn,
