Subject: Re: [T2] putting an end on rust; my type 2 can last 4 ever

An interesting topic ,, I just came home from a new shop. 20 kettles large enough to dip any car in.

Kettle size 55 ft long by 98 inches wide by 11.5 ft deep

They use 10 ton cranes to load the "kettles"....

As Marcus talked about,, the temperatures will most likely be a problem on body sheet metal
panels.... causing warpage.

There is another method,, cold galvanizing.

My Camper is a Cali transplant,, no rust Yet,,, 15 years in Ontario Canada,, driven very few days
on PICKLED roads,, if I can taste the salt on the asphalt,, it stays in the driveway.
I think this is because we painted it with a high zinc primer as soon as it arrived here.


If your going to drive your Type 2 in Las Vegas, then I suspect your cutting your rust problem
down right away

If your going to drive in the winter , salted weather, then I don't know if any process will meet
the "last for ever" part.

Do your Best
