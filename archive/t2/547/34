Frank,

Have battery tested first...might be bad cell....remember that FI actually 
*needs* good power to run injectors and ECU.

Start it up and rev up a couple oftimes and then test voltage while engine 
rpm's up a little to see alternator trying to charge.

Sounds more like bad battery to me...Batteries manufactured these days 
seem to die like that...one minute ok, next minute, just dead.

Cheers, dave
