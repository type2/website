Subject: !(-at-)!(-at-)#% Key won't come out!

Well, I was enjoying the first nice day I could bomb aroun town in my 
Bus now that the lights were working for signals and brakes!  Gas is 
getting low so I turned into the SHELL station to fill up. Turned her 
off and the (-at-)#(-at-)% key stuck.  If I wiggle it the dash lights go off or 
the dash light go on.  I pop-started her and drove home.  Is there a 
quick way to pop the lock without removing the steering wheel, etc.? 
Or a known way to release the tumblers?  Also, the key I have is the 
ONLY key to the back gate which is now locked.  Arrrrgh!

Thanks,

BEN
