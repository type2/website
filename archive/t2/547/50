Subject: Fan Shroud Seal question

Anyone happen to know the part number for the seal that goes between fan
shroud and the oil cooler on a 71?  I can't seem to find it on Bus Depot's
site, probably because I don't know what it's called.. LOL  The squared off
piece that goes thru the tin in Front of the engine. There is a gap between
this piece and the Fan shroud.

Thanks in advance,
