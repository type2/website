Hi Ben,

There is no quick way to replace the lock cylinder. But I can help you 
out with the rear hatch.

You can open the rear hatch from the inside. Remove the interior panel 
and you will see a tab  on the side of the lock mechanism. Just pull 
the tab towards yourself and the latch will open.

My Westfakia has a small hole drilled in the cover panel and a loop of 
nylon string attached to the tab. That allows me to use the rear hatch 
for stealthy midnight escapes that don't wake everyone in the bus the 
way the sliding door does.

Happy trails,
