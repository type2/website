Maybe a case of beer would help Chris---

I think we all would contribute for that  assistance--

Check that out---sounds like a good idea--



----> Well prob not beer. They are church folks and in a BIG way... <grin!>

I'm still game either way. The garage offered by Faster-Laster sounds great too! For those scratching their head about what to do... (comparison shopping)

We've got an 1100 sq ft house and no garage. Certainly we could spread everybody out on the floors and we've got a nice size yard to work in or sleep in. Of course there is only 1 bathroom... <grin> We can post a schedule outside the door though. Like I mentioned before, if we use Faster-Laster's place and if anyone is going west and needs a stopping point we'll be happy to host folks here in Cookeville. I'll certainly be travelling west the morning of the starting day and we can caravan together. My bus will be easy. Remove lights and bumpers and handles, sand and spray. Got a pin hole in the rocker under the sliding door. No dents to fix.
