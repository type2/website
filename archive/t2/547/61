Subject: 215 vs 210mm in a 1973 3-rib transmission

Hi Volks,

Here's a dumb question... will a 215mm clutch and flywheel fit in a 
1973 3-rib transmission bellhousing?

Last summer I pulled the 3-rib 73 tranny out of the westfakia and 
swapped in a 5-rib 1975 transmission in its place. At the same time I 
changed the clutch and flywheel to the 215mm parts, mostly because the 
215mm clutch disk I had on hand was in better shape than the 210mm disk 
was.

The 5-rib tranny has started singing to me under power in 4th gear, so 
I'm planning to swap back to the 3-rib next week, and need to know if 
the parts currently installed on the engine will fit into the "new" 
bellhousing.

If the 215mm clutch disk is still in good shape I suppose I could swap 
the bell housing, but I'd prefer to avoid that hassle if possible.

Thanks in advance,
