Having a Bus galvanized?

Never happen--

Unless--the Bus is stripped down to the bone---

The galvanizing process would require the whole vehicle to be stripped
to bare metal--everywhere--no paint left in a nook or cranny and then
immersed in a couple of plating tanks wash, zinc, and wash again---and I
don't think that there is any tank's anywhere that is big enough to
handle a whole vehicle--or a hanger to handle it.

It would have to be totally disassembled down to the last nut and bolt
first.

A bigger job than any one man could do in lifetime.
