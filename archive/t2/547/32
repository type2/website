Subject: No juice

You have to love the karma of the VW.  Hapybus took me on a 1300 mile round
trip to EveryBus with nary a problem.  Back at home, first ride, and it leaves
me needing assistance.
Out of no where, I have zero juice to the key.
I can connect jumper cables, and it starts.  Remove the cables and you can
hear the power drop.
My conclusions, with Bentley help.... alternator or (now I cant even
remember)
Bentley wasn't real clear, seemed to be more for the generator on a 1600.
This is a 78 FI.

Ideas?

Kind Regards,
