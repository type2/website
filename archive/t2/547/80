Subject: RE: [VB] oil sump screen

The 71 on up 1600 DP screen is the one you are looking for. I don't have
the tube size on me but the part is only a couple of bucks at FLAPS. I
use the Honda V-Twin oil filter mini sump on most of my keeper engines
for the truck or a bug, but opt for the screen and a filtered pump on
everything else.
