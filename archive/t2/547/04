I'm posting this message for everyone involved--so the last message I
posted on this is clearer--

If you have bare metal--or want a super sealer you need to first lock
whatever is below with Vari Prime.
It comes in quarts, as does the converter for it.
Then you have the choice of either laquer priming it ( Ultra Fill ) --or
Uro Priming it--
And what I failed to mention is the Uro Prime has a 12 hour drying
time--required
The Uro Prime only comes in quarts--and probably will take 2 for for
each Bus.--maybe 1.5--why cut it close when we're in Podunk Tenn?

The reduction of the Uro prime I believe (I don't have the can in front
of me) is variable becuase the stuff can be used as a sealer or a
primer--either way the reducer only comes in quarts-- I think it's 4-2-1
reduction for sealing.

I forgot flex agen--which comes in pints--which will be needed for the
Uro Prime if ya want it flexable--same for the paint--you guys can split
this item up--

If ya wanna go with the Ultra Fill, a gallon will do probably 2
buses--two coats.
The "fiver" (5) of the laquer thinner is to cut the Ultra Fill
primer--and yes to keep my equipment clean.

Forget the old word Warsaw newspaper that will leak--and take twice as
long to mask--

I have a 3-M masking machine--it has an 18" roll of paper on it--and I
would want that to be replaced as used.

Reducer for the paint all depends on what you are going to put on the
Bus--
Mid temp reducer is what I use Summer, Fall, Winter, Spring. If it's
really hot out I'll add some retarder to taste. That's why I think
September will be good--

What else?

You guys choose the site--and the material's---line it all out---and
I'll appear ready to go--
