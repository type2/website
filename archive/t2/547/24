If you guys are serious about this, I also have my 2 car garage w/a

well that would be the difference between a one day and a two day drive,
would still come but it would make it more expensive since I would have
to get a room, my bus isn't a westy and it would be full of tools etc...

Well I think garage might be a better arrangement that doesn't leave us looking at the sky every 10 minutes for a week. Anyone going west that needs a stop over certainly could crash at our house or camp at our house. I've also got a local VW buddy and they have a huge place and would most certainly offer the same (I'll confirm before I offer you their house).
