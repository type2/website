Subject: never saw that before, never see again

in the process of tearing down a siezed a SP engine from a recently
acquired bus i found something unusual: behind the oil pump there was a
plastic pink and white rabbit head. the face was the size of a nickel and
the ears were oh, about 3/4" above. is that awesome or what. there was no
vw part number, nor emblem. not a german part - sez china on the back. in a
few weeks i'm going on a long bus trip, it means good luck right, ed
mcmahon?   - steve
