Subject: Re: [VB] Oil pressure gauge readings...

sounds good to me.   At least it's comparable to what I see on the OilPr 
guage.  I think guages are neat things to look at... usually just confirm 
everything is like it should be... but when you see something read oddly it can help 
tell you of problems ahead of catastrophe, ahead of the dash lights. or to say 
slow down a bit in hot weather. 

 the 10-50psi, w/ about 10 psi for every 1000 rpms... That's a good way to 
look at it, what a normal engine has.  I have a heavier oil pump on one engine, 
it gets 20 psi at idle.  I had to switch to thinner oil (from 30 wt to 10-30) 
in that engine as it burst oil filters in winter.

Good morning Y'all,
Yesterday I completed the install of a VDO oil
pressure gauge in my 71 westy, 1600 DP.  I am just
curious as to what I should consider "normal" PSI
readings on the gauge.  On  my way to work this
morning I got a reading of just over 20 PSI at idle
and then at 55MPH I got a reading of just over 40 PSI.
Its all backroads to work and it was a cool morning,
so oil temps stayed about 180 degrees with the
previously mentioned pressure readings.
Anyway, what reading is considered "too low" what
reading is considered "too high".  
Just curious about what I should expect the gauge to say.
