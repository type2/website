Subject: repacking cv joints  / westie fridge

74 westie.
Is it hard? The shop wanted to charge me something silly and it looks pretty
straight forward.. easy?  Im guessing it's just messy and an hour of dirty 
work.

What kinda grease to i repack with ... anyone have this online?

Also.. I have a propane/electrical fridge. How do i set the pilot light on? 
And
how do i switch it from electical to propane?  (for those lazy nights of 
electrical
bliss)
I don't think I have a manual for it.
