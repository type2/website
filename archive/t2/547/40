Subject: RE: [T2] Oil pressure gauge readings...

Pressure readings vary greatly depending on engine rpm and temp.
These are some approx readings I've seen...
 
Cold: Idle 40 psi
Cold Cruise: 60+ psi
180 *F Idle: 20 psi
180 *F Cruise: 50 psi
220 *F Idle 10 psi
220* F Cruise 30 psi
 
I use 20W50 in a freshly rebuilt T-4 engine. I think the oil pressure bypass valve lifts around 70 psi cuz it never goes higher than that.
