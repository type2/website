well if the key went in it should come out,  sounds like a tumble is
sticking.  I would squirt some WD40 or similar down in the key slot
(disconnect the battery) if the key can be worked loose ok, if not I would
then let some light oil drip into the cyl and continue to work the key up
and down, you want to get the key out in the off position if you can...

then when you get it out, get a key made to the key code on the lock and
squirt some graphite in the keyhole and use the new key, your key is
probably worn
