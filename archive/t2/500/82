Sorry Barry, but what you're asking for can't be done.  The 2" long 10mm nut
is integral with the clamp and the clamp is held to the case so it can only
go on one way.  

I have an extra long, very slender Snap-On 10mm open-end wrench that does
the trick for me.  Turn the nut as far as you can, flip the wrench over,
turn it as far as you can, repeat until tight.  The good news is the nut
only needs to be loosened about 1/2 turn to adjust the timing and it doesn't
need to be "gorilla-tight" afterwards.
