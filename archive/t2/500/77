Hahah.. I'm 25.  Actually.. that doesn't sound as young as it used to..
hmm. Yeah, I think it's cool to listen to that music in the Bus. Totally
makes me feel like I'm in a different time. Not that there's anything
WRONG with the time today, but I just feel like there's SOOO much
communication today, that it's tough to "get away". I'm a computer
programmer, and yet, I absolutely REFUSE to have a cell phone. Everyone
says.. "YOU HAVE TO GET ONE!!!" but the way I see it.. the human race has
survived so far for hundreds upon thousands of years without cell phones.
Only now, in the past 8 years have people started buying cell phones. Why
now is it suddenly a requirement that everyone have one? I'd rather walk
a mile from my broken down vehicle than carry a cell phone on me all 364
other days of the year.

I could totally be into the 60s "hippie" lifestyle, people who are tired
of the day to day crap. I don't know if I'm into the whole convent thing,
and well.. I am a Republican too, but I think the true ideals of a
"hippie" are simplicity, and not getting caught up in the latest and
greatest fad.
