Subject: engine fire suppresion...found!

Folks, was looking for some better fire extinguishers for the
VW family at home...found this...


Interesting...prices starting at $400

Actually, their stuff is pretty amazing.  Look around the rest of the site
and check it out.  They claim absolutely no damage to engine.

16oz's seems pretty small, but check out some comparisons
agains the foam and "dry" stuff.

Billy???  You are in the business...what do you think???


Anyone else?...ever hear of this stuff??...pro or con?

Cheers, dave
