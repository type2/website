Subject: front passenger side exhaust support

So I'm looking at my engine out of my 78 westy and there is a spot on 
the front (flywheel side) of the engine where a support bracket attaches 
from the tin to the front heat exchanger mount.  Strangely, this bracket 
is only on one side.  Is this bracket needed?  It seems kinda strange, 
and on top of that, the last one was broken, and the tin was cracked. 
It doesn't seem like it's supporting much at all, especially if it's 
attached to the tin for support.

Should I fabricate a new one or leave it off?  As far as the back of the 
engine, there is the alternator bracket and another support on the 
drivers side that connects from the cooling housing to the muffler 
bracket (I think).

Any ideas?

thanks,
Mike
