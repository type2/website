Subject: need size of plug

Folks,

I need the thread size for a T1 engine oil pressure releif plug.
The one that holds the spring and pressure relief valve.

Also the distance from the start of the threads(under the cap) to the end
of the threads.

I have looked everywhere in my stuff this morning and can't find one.

Thanks!  dave
