Subject: BBB Tow possibilities?

Anybody know someone headed to BBB from the Concord, CA area with the
ability to tow a '73 (for a reasonable fuel cost compensation)? I haven't
even called on the bus I looked at yet -- it may be already sold. I thought
about driving to get it myself but that would add another ~1200 miles (RT)
to the ~3000 miles I'm driving already.

I suppose with a departure tomorrow I could make it to Concord and back to
Havasu by Thursday..... brainstorming....

I'm coming from Texas.
