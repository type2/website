Subject: Difference between CA and Federal AFM's

Hi All:

Does anyone know what the difference is between the California and
Federal AFM's (air fuel meter) for the early (80-82) Vanagon's and late
Types2's? The Bosch number for the CA is 0-280-200-030 (VW 071-906-301B)
and for the Federal is 0-280-200-032 (VW 071-906-301C).

I have two Federal units and one California (for use with the O2
sensor). The CA AFM and one of the Federal units have the same resistor
unit inside, made by Bourns (Bosch part 1-288-310-021). The other
federal AFM has a resistor unit made by Sfernice (Bosch part
1-288-310-026).

I have graphed the voltage output curves (pin 7 Vsig)/(pin 9 Vin) of the
units with respect to flapper angle (see
http://www.cs.fiu.edu/~jstric01/images/AFM_Curves.jpg for the curves).
The units with the same resistors behave the same. However, the
electrical differences between AFM's with different resistor units are
only of the order of 1 degree and could be entirely due to my error in
measurements between the units.

I was the first person to open the CA and one of the Federal units (with
the Sfernice resistor block). For all I know the other Federal unit may
just have the wrong plastic top and hence is marked incorrectly.

Does anyone know if maybe the California is tuned to run leaner (open
loop) than the Federal (see curves)? Know of any other design
differences as it pertains to the AFM's.

They seem to be completely interchangeable in my Vanagon and behave
essentially the same, however I do not have a CO meter.

TIA
