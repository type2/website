Subject: Need a SC truck

Hi all,

I just bought a rural property in southern Arkansas with a "fixer upper"
house. Trouble is, I need to haul building supplies and lumber from the
store as I fix the house. I don't want to trash the interior of my 82
Aircooled Westie trying to press that vehicle into service as a lumber
hauler....I need a truck....one that is either close enough to me to be
economically transported here for repairs or is in good running
condition...and solid enough that I can restore it later on without becoming
an expert at inert gas welding.

Can anyone on the list help me out?

Regards,

Robert S. Williams
