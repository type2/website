Sounds a lot like my week driving to and from work in snow and freezing rain
the past few days. Don't know if you guys got the freezing rain up in
Seattle but if you think snow freezes fast on the windshield try that stuff.
There's nothing I could do except look out four little holes about four
inches round and get out and scrape the glass every couple miles. I even
have decent heat but not at 18 degrees. I'm glad I don't live to far from
work. Other than that I was very impressed with where I could go with six
inches of snow on the ground and one inch of ice on the top of that. That
was without chains. With the chains on I think the bus did better than my
Jeep CJ7 in 4wd. It was fun to watch some of the looks on guys faces in
their big 4wd's as I easily cruised right past them. If I could just avoid
the aching back from crouching down lookin out those small clear spots on
the glass.
