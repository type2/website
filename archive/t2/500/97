Subject: Engine Balancing in VA/MD/DE

Volks,

I'm trying to get an idea of how much my engine rebuild is going to cost 
me, and as such I'm trying to figure out someone in my area who can 
balance my engine parts (and how much it's going to cost me).

Can anyone recommend someone in the Washington, DC area.  I get up to 
philadelphia somewhat often, so Delaware or Eastern PA would also work.  

Similarly, I'd be willing to drive a fair distance for a shop that's 
particularly reputable -- say somewhere in MD or VA.

Do I need to go to a VW shop for this, or will any hot rod shop be able to 
balance my rotating parts (which I assume to be the flywheel, pulley and 
perhaps fan)?

Thanks,
	Tom
