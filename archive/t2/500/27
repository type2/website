I have not done this but the swap should be possible.

Good news:

the bolt pattern on the '70 beam should match the later beam;

the steering box is not an issue as it is mounted to the bus frame and not
connected to the beam.

Things to consider:

you may have problems connecting the actuating rod for the brake
booster to the brake pedal;

you will need to plumb in a vacuum line to the rear end and a static line
to the front dogleg;

you will need to replace your intake manifold with one from a '71 bus with
the proper nipple;

you *may* need to find a '71-73 booster unit as they were a different and
smaller diameter than the later units;

you will definitely have to replumb the metal lines both to insert a
proportioning valve and to bring the ends to the new position of the
master cylinder;

you should consider substituting the later upper resevoir.

Bad news:

You are, alas, stuck with the earlier steering box as the mounting points
are different for the later box.

Measure it up, but I believe you need only replace the early hub/drum
casting with the later separte hub and drum.  At worst I believe you will
need to replace the cylinder and shoes.  Again the warning that I have not
done this but have seen many of both the early and late bays.  I'd wanna
take a micrometer to them to be sure but they look very close.

                             OOK!
