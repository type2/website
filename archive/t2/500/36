Subject: RE: [T2] Check Condenser

Hey,
I was going to ask a similar question!
I have had two condensers fail on me.
On the beetle (1600tp) a few years back it cause erratic timing and back
firing. As usually it was the last think to check/replace and all was fine
after that.
In the last week I have had intermittent problems on my bus (2L dual carb). It
would run fine and then completely die, usually after ~1/2 hr driving. I'd sit
and tinker for a while and everything would be fine after that even though I
never found the problem.
It has had me stumped all week and numerous checking of fuel and spark.
Finally over the week end it would not start at all. Again the last thing I
replaced was the condenser, and it fired right up! I have yet to do a long run
though to confirm it was the source of the bus to die.

So to answer Barry's question, great to hear you are running again, but there
may still be a problem if it was back firing earlier!
A condenser is a capacitor. My multi meter is has a capacitor measurement
function. When I test the bad condenser and a good condenser they both read
~0.2uF. In my case I'm guessing the capacitor was breaking down once hot
(hence the 1/2hr running) but OK when cold???

So does anyone know another test to check on a condenser?
