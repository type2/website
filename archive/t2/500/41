If anyone else has a better solution, I'm more than interested...
I've replaced a few broken mirrors (just the glass, luckily), but
only by gently prying the chrome away from the glass and letting
the mirror fall out onto a safe surface. Once the glass is out, 
you'll see a spring-loaded bolt that holds the mirror frame to
the arm. Tightening this slightly increases the tension and keeps
the mirror from moving once it's set into position..."Course, now
you've got to replace the mirror...I've used caulk to set the mirror,
but I'm open to a better suggestion...
