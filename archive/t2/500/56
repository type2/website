Subject: Re: [T2] VW van, how to tighten side view mirrors?

There is the permanent method- set the mirror to a good viewing point
relative to left/right, run some superglue into the swivel housing. 
Remove mirror, run MORE superglue all into the housing lip.  Replace
mirror.  If it needs to be reset for different height drivers, easy to
do by adjusting flatted round lock nut.   Superglue CAN be
reset/loosened by heating the joint.
