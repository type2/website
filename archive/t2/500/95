Subject: Re: [T2] INSULATED BUS?

Hi Darren,

I'm in the process of doing this. I'm following along with the how-to located here:
http://www.shagadelic.org/VW/info/gmbulley-soundproof/

I'm not quite sure that I'll follow it exactly but for the most part is seems
pretty spot-on.
Some of my fears deal with the need to get body panels off in the event that
repair becomes necessary. The rest of it seems pretty sound though.


HTH,
Harry
