Subject: RE: [T2] Check Condenser - not needed

Sorry for the red flag.

My condenser MUST be good, because I got the '72 to fire off ! !!   Great 
billows of smoke from the tail pipe, and one wild flaming backfire out of 
the left carb.

I feel like the 'Right' brothers, except I must be doing everything 
'Wrong'..


So, why wasn't I getting spark at the plugs??  Because someone forgot to put 
the rotor back on ! !  !  [I wish someone was here to help, then I could 
look over my spectacles at my partner in crime...]

I have to go to a meeting this PM, but I hope to have it running and timed 
tomorrow.
