like.. "Sha la-la-la-la live for today!! lalala". Then "California Dreaming" by 
the Mammas and the Pas, grace slick with Jefferson Airplane, all of that other 
hippie stuff. Sounds great in a Bus!

That'd be "Let's Live For Today" by the Grass Roots...
The Mamas and the Papas...
Try Grace Slick with her husband in "The Great Society"
(Or Signe Tole Anderson in Jefferson Airplane...)

If you really like this stuff, try 
The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band...
Or Skip Spence's (he did a little work with another
band... ;-) strange effort, "Oar"...
