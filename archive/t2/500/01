Subject: A week at the factory

Peter Keetman's "A Week at the Volkswagen Factory" has been out of print for
a while and the prices for used copies have skyrocketed. I'm wishing I had
bought a copy from BD for $12 when I had the chance.

I did notice that a new book is being released, called "Peter Keetman:
Volkswagenwerk 1953". It looks like it will be the same except it will be in
hardcover form for about $60 (Amazon). ISBN 3936646287

I'd appreciate any leads on used copies of the original book. I'm hoping
that the price of the new book when it's released in March will seriously
lower the price of the used copies but any leads would still be appreciated.
