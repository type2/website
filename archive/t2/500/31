Subject: OTP - Century welders homepage??

OK I've surfed all over the *(*%&&&&!!! internet and I cannot find a
homepage for Century welders or battery chargers. Does anyone know of a
1-800 no. or a homepage for these guys? I would appreciate it, as I have
purchased a Century quick-fix mig welder but have no manual.

Many thanks,

Courtney
