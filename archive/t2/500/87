Dave,

Interesting product. It is listed under NFPA 18 (National Fire Protection Association) which is the standard for "wetting agents". Not dry chemical, wet chemical, foam or gas sytems (CO2, inert gases, halon, etc.) So it's different from most of the systems you see.

Pros-----------------------------------------

effective on Class B fires (flamable liquids)

Does not settle (like powders) or come out of solution over time

Apparently cleans up easily & acts like a grease cutter (engine's cleaner AFTER the fire!)

Non-toxic/Biodegradable, so you can be around the discharge or it's aftermath.

It's a wetting agent, so it actually cools the fuel, instead of just eliminating the flame itself, prevents reignition.

Apparently reacts with flamable liquids rendering them non-flamable.

Cons-----------------------------------------------

"proprietary" solution, they say it's water-based, so I'd assume it's probably 90% just that, water, despite the pricetag. I'd ask for a MSDS sheet.

Does the solution lose potency over time? 10 years?

THE BIG ISSUE: A person with a few hours training is 10 times more effective in fighting a fire with an extinguisher than an untrained person. With this system, remotely mounted, and only 16oz of agent, that translates into you mounting the system so that discharge occurs right on the location you expect flames, and that a majority of that 16oz gets on the fire. 

Could be tricky with only one cylinder, although it looked like they had discharge tubing for remote mounting discharge nozzles. If you go this route,
THE DISCHARGE TUBING MUST BE BALANCED. Meaning, use equal lenths of tubing to the nozzles. Or you blast one side and miss the other.

There's a lot of pressure at a dishcarge nozzle. I know people who've been blown off ladders during accidental discharge of larger systems. Mount the dishcarge nozzles and cylinder securely.

All in all, it looks like a decent system. If I had a copy of NFPA 18, I could really analyze this system against the code, but alas.

If you buy it, a test run over an old case inside a similarly sized enclosure to an engine bay would be interesting to see spray patterns, discharge time, etc.

Ask them for all the literature they can provide and we can take it apart.

later,
