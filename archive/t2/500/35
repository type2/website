Subject: Re: [T2] when does the spark plug fire?

Yes, I like that version.  I will use that when I actually get to 
installing the distributor.  I still have to mount that cooling fan 
housing so I can install the cooling fan and then put the timing markers 
on.  However, somehow I keep managing to find more parts to paint so it 
keeps getting delayed ;)

I am almost done with this engine rebuild!  And what, it's only been, 
hmmm... 2.5 years.. doh!

hahaha,
