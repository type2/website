Subject: axle swap

i have the axle swap hoo-ha on my 70.

go for the 73+, as the brake parts (rotors, calipers, etc) are 
bigger, often available new, and FAR cheaper than the 71 - 72 
stuff... which i have :P

you will need: entire front axle if you want the power brakes; just 
the spindles  --> out if you can deal with a hard brake pedal (i like 
the feel of my non-booster brakes).
rear axles... if you can, just drop both whole assemblies off the 
frame. otherwise, spindles, backing plates, drums, etc. if you don't 
swap out the rear, you will need to carry two different spares. 
ebrake cable will need changing, or bodging, but the old cable won't 
quite fit. i have barrel spacers at the front adjuster screws on mine 
to take up the slack - still gets loose and rubs against the drum, 
squeaksqueak.
grab the brake regulator off the underframe, and read the bentley on 
how to plumb it. you will need to measure where it was on donor, and 
drill mounts in new bus.
steering box will NOT swap over, so you will be keeping the old one.

you will have to get used to pietin hubcaps instead of the nice dome ones.

if you keep the power brakes, you will need to rig up the lines for 
vac can, and plumb in to the doglegs for a plenum (or work sumpin 
else out).

job is work, but relatively easy - i bought my bus in '88, learned to 
drive :)   got the bentley, bought a donor 72, and swapped out the 
brakes all  in one month. only thing i DIDN'T know was that the rear 
axles had to come, too, and drove around with  a huge washer under 
the axle nut to make the 70 drum fit right!

ps - where in AZ is ya?
