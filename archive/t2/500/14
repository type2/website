Subject: Check Condenser - if good

How do I check to see if my condenser is burned out??

[Testing the engine outside the VW '72. -- I wired the battery to the - 
terminal on my coil, and I think that physically burned the wire on my 
points, i. e., the wire from the condenser to the points, inside the 
distributor.  It even melted the plastic parts of the point set.]

If I take the condenser off, is there some ohm reading I should get on good 
condenser??

I have a decent dwell reading, although it jumps between 44 and 52, not yet 
settled in.  There is probably another reason for that, though.
