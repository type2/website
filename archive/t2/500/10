Subject: Does anyone have a front engine tin from a 71 1600 bus

Tom,

I have the "front tin" (one year only) for a doghouse set up as well as the
"air exhaust duct" pieces if you need them.

These parts are thirty (+/-) years old,
That I pulled from a parts bus or traded...
I would use them on my buses, but they are
