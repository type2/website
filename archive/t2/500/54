<< Wow, that's a name I haven't heard for a while! I actually have their
track "Smell of Incense" on my Westy's indash MP3 drive. Other personal
favorites that share the "psychedelia" folder on my hard drive are H.P.
Lovecraft (the band, not the poet), Bubble Puppy, Pearls Before Swine,
Kalaidoscope, and the Glitterhouse.
