I used to use one of those (old mousepads work too) until I got one of these:

It tightens as you turn the wrench to loosen the filter. I've used it
on a bunch of cars and haven't found one it won't work on yet, though
I suppose the big diesel filters might be too big for it. ;-)

The great thing about it is that you can use a long extension if you
need to for access. Or a universal or whatever is needed. Works
awesome.
