"Email me directly to set up a time to come and
see it.  Thanks....
NOTE: Here's the thing.  I need a starter for my
1993 Ford Explorer or other piece of work.
Everything comes on in the truck, but it won't 
turn over.  I know NOTHING about cars and I am
basically broke. If you can  get my
explorer running (email me if interested) the VAN
IS YOURS!   Title is onsite, all I need to do is
sign it.)


1970 VW Transport Van
Baby Blue with White top

Includes:
Water holding tank
Sink with water pump
front bucket seats
backseat folds out into a bed
top bunk for kids
clothes closet
ice box
fold out table
overhead lighting
12 Volt fan to help on hot days
Front spare tire mount
locking gas cap

We are the 3rd owners of this little jem.  But we
don't use it as 
much as we
should and we aren't volkswagon people. :)  It
would be a great 
vehicle for
a real volkswagon enthusiast, especially one who
knows how to do 
their own
work (volkswagons like to be tinkered on
apparently).   It needs some 
work, but if you know about VW's you could
probably do it yourself. 

Title is free and clear.

If you don't know how to fix the explorer, but
are interested in the Van I'll sell it for
$500.00 OBO.
