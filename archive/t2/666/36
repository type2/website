Subject: Re: [T2] crankshaft interchangeability?

To all who replied, thanx for the great info.  It looks like the
substitution would be a bit of a "bodgit" job which wouldn't be fair to the
next owner of the van so I won't bother with such a substitution...but heck,
you never know unless you ask.  The Vanagon has near new P & Cs so if I
split the case for inspection / repair I'll look for a 2.0 crank as required
and do it right.  I'm trying to sell the Vanagon as I prefer the comradeship
of the T-2's...plus the mountain driving I do on vacations is far easier on
ol' Bussosarus than the heavier, automatic Vanagon.
