One week after putting heater hose on for my brake vacuum line the
thing collapsed just a bit, but enough to pull it off the pipe
creating a massive vacuum leak. :(

Yeah, I could put clamps on there for now, but that's not going to
prevent it from collapsing. I considered putting springs inside the
hose, but realized that I'd end up spending more on springs than I
would for proper hose.
