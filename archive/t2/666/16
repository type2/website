Hi Don,

It sounds like you and I are running down similar problems.  I'll keep 
everybody posted on my progress, and hopefully you'll come up with something 
I missed.  Maybe if we work together we'll nail down the problem (assuming 
they're the same thing).

Best of luck.  I know I need as much as I can get.

Best,
