Subject: Re: [T2] Possible to elimate the power brake servo?

Yes, I know how hard it is to stop a vehicle not using the power brake servo.  But you miss the point of my question.  My question is there a way to switch to another master cylinder such as the 68-70 and have normal non power brakes thus saving the $159 cost of a rebuilt servo.
 
Was wondering if this 68-70 MC would work in conjunction with the front discs...
 
Thanks

coast it with the clutch, put it in neutral, cut the engine and try to stop
