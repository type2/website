Subject: Re: [T2] alternator idiot light

Mine has always done the exact opposite: When the signals are on, the
light GOES OUT when the turn signal light is on. In between flashes
the alt light is lit up.

=D 

The light is very dim in any case, and it only happens when idling. So
I figured it had to do with voltage differences between alt and
battery. And since the resistance on some of these old wires is bound
to have increased over the 30 years of life...
