For oil filters I've been using the same strap wrench for about the
last 25 years.  The nice thing is that it fits every size filter I've
ever had to change.  It's got a 2 inch wide heavy fabric strap and the
metal end fitting is broached to accept a 3/8ths square drive.  It's a
Snap-On tool and by it's looks I expect it will out last me.
