But....
All (3) bulbs connected at the time were blown.  "In theory there's no 
difference between theory and practice, but in practice there is."  I 
don't get it either, but the replacements work fine.

I found a decent replacement at the FLAPS, tight but possible without 
cursing fit.  They had 3 EIKO brand models that were impossible to tell 
apart inside their blister packs.  A touch skinnier base would have 
been perfect.  Maybe I'll try a different one in 25 years when these 
blow (assuming I keep my hamfists out from behind the dash).
