I also have an oil wrench similer to this one that Don
mentioned
http://www.midwayautosupply.com/detailedproductdescription.asp?2055,
but mine has like 3 fingers that fit over the filter.
The more you twist with the wrench the tighter it
grips. I bought mine at my local NAPA parts store for
around $6.99. I have also used every type of filter
wrench I could find to fit my bus, but when I got my
westy, I tried to change the oil, nothing I had would
take the filter off, so I went to napa and they showed
me this tool. When I got home it took only a couple
turns of the wrench to get it off.
Here is the napa site=

Hope this helps.
