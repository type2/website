Subject: Re: [T2] Possible to elimate the power brake servo?

tcs said:


 I have a `71 westfalia I just picked up.  It is a beater but none the less useable for camping.

 The brakse are all shot.  Seems quite costly replacing all the brake components for this vehicle and i wonder
if my servo is any good?

 My question is there a way to eliminate using the power brake servo, Maybe be using the earlier 68-70 master
cylinder ?  Will this work with the front disc brakes?  Any ideas helpful hints on this subject or for doing
the brakes on this vehicle cheaply as possible?

Brakes are NOT one of the areas to skimp and save on. They should be at least 100% to the point of where they
were when the bus was new.

I know I don't want to be behind someone on the road that knows "The brakse are all shot" and
"for doing the brakes on this vehicle cheaply as possible?"

If you are going to be driving somewhere to go camping, you need to fix the brakes correctly before anything
else. Cheap is NOT to go or stop. Cheap brake pads suck when you step on the brakes for the 3rd or 4th time on
a big downhill curve and bus does not slow down!
