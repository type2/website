Hi Don,

In the archives, it has been suggested that 15/32" is the correct size and there was a reference to this web site for 15/32 hose:

http://www.goodyearbeltsandhose.com/cars/vacuum.html

I went to NAPA recently and asked them to cross this number (Goodyear 65108)to their part number and they came up with "H1451 NBH" at $1.99 per foot. I bought some but haven't installed it yet(and probably won't until spring). Quite frankly, it looks like heater hose although hopefully it will resist gas fumes. The hose is marked as "DOT 15/32 VL" made by Gates.

PS. The local NAPA ordered a 50 foot roll of this and I know they have plenty left. If anyone can't find any locally, let me know and I can buy some and ship it.

Good Luck
