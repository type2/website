Subject: headlights + fresh air fans

Good day people,

What a spirit, -10 C and still working on the van...

Today trying things out, I ran into a problem..




When I turn the Fresh air fans on all goes right
      Until...
I turn the headlights on,
      Then...
my Fuse burn out.... every time... some time it goes maybe 20 sec.. then
pops......

The lights don't go out just the fan...




any idea, hope you guys understand the way I explained it...

cheers
