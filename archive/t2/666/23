Any tips on driving in the snow with your bus?

For the first time ever I actually found a little patch of snow and noticed 
the bus liked to kick itself into a fishtale pretty easily.

I will be travelling across the country, from the midwest to the west coast 
soon and just want to plan properly.
I have chains, just in case.

My biggest concern is what happens if I need to access the engine 
compartment, and I have half of my worldly belongings sitting on top of the 
hatch. Im going to need to try and plan according, where whatever I place 
here can be easily moved.

But is this just like an old car, where you just want all the weight at the 
back for more tracktion, or doesnt that apply when the motor is also at the 
back?

thanks.
