Subject: RE: [T2] alternator idiot light

Mine has been doing this for years. Never gave it a second thought.
Just figured the light was sensitive to the voltage drop caused by the
signals operating. Always charges good, never leaves me stranded.

Ditto to that.  I've only owned two busses, and they both have behaved in
the exact manner as John described.  I've never worried about it, and have
never had trouble from it.
