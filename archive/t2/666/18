VW went water cooled in the 80's same reason they went with Fuel Injection 
in the U.S. in the 70's.  U.S. Emission laws.

Note that they still sold air cooled Bugs in Mexico until government 
regulation no longer made them desireable.  In Mexico, the govenment 
required all Taxi cabs to have 4 doors (sometime around 2001), which 
eliminated the Bug as a potential taxi cab, and terminated the car's 
primary market.

Porsche managed to keep the 911 air cooled until the 1998 when the first 
water cooled 911 was produced.
