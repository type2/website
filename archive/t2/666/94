Subject: Re: [T2] Possible to elimate the power brake servo?

Richard,

How is pedal effort compared to a stock '68-'70 with drum brakes?  I
know that some of the euro busses came with disk brakes and no
booster.  I wonder if having the non-functional booster in the system
would greatly increase the effort required to stop the bus?  Anyone
out there with disk brakes and no booster care to comment?

I ask because I am in the process of upgrading my '69 to disk brakes,
and I am not planning to use the booster.  My feeling is that the bus
won't be any harder to stop than it is now, and I don't have a problem
with the level of effort now.

Thanks.
