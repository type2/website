Whew!

Jules, you are liable to get all sorts of opinions on this one, so here is 
mine.

You change your oil while the engine/oil is cold, right?

You fill it with the correct amount so that the dip stick shows full after 
the oil change....at this point, there should be *no* excess oil anywhere 
to drain back down anywhere.

So, how much oil is it using?  After sitting 3 years, I would expect you 
to use some oil the first few hundred or thousand miles, so might be best 
to wait on that.  You might want to try and use some Marvel Mystery oil in 
it for awhile on the first oil change.

A suitable new distributor(Single Diaphram Vacum Advance) should be 
available from www.aircooled.net or from www.cip1....
We try to support John at aircooled since he was the "originator" of these 
when everyone else seemed to be on the 009 kick.

Someone else will have to pick one on the samba for your year as It's been 
a long time since I looked at one.

Cheers, dave
