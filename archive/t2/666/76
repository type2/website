Chris,

I have used cut off pieces from large radiator type hoses to bring carb
bases "up" to a height that would accept an aftermarket air filter.

Mounting and gluing or taking part of a plastic pvc pipe to finish off the 
install is up to your imagination.

I buy lots of NLA'd and unobtanium car parts at Lowe's.  <grin>

You should see some of my contraptions!

For example:  need Kadron filters that absolutely would not fit under the 
places they needed to go.

Lowes's has a very nice 90 degree 2" rubber elbow with two clamps that is
then attached to a piece of PVC 90 degreee pipe with the other clamp...the 
"off road" K&N looking airfilters then clamped perfectly to the PVC pipe.

Air cleaners wiggle a little, but look and work great hanging upside down.

They do have sizes other than 2"  take a piece of pipe or something with 
you that is the same OD as your carb neck.  

Cheers, dave
