I wish they wouldn't keep changing the size. If you ever let the jiffydrip change your oil don't believe for a second their filter won't be some weird size and shape that doesn't fit your adapter. Thank goodness the bus filter never changes.

I've never found a good one that was universal enough. Unless it's an absolute requirement because of location I find one of those rubber discs for removing the tops of pickle jars works very well.

Has anyone actually had the oil filter fall off on any car they've owned?

That's a brain tickler if you also bought your TSP at wallmart: it may not contain any.

For the last 15 years I've been wearing coveralls from one of the local commercial cleaning companies. When I was in high school we used to get coverals for about $12. They were used but clean and still had the mechanic's name patch sewed onto them. When my favorite pair shrunk (ahem) I had a difficult time finding a place that sold them (I didn't like any of the Dickie's versions in the work wear stores) so I went back to that same place and although they didn't have any recyclyed ones they did sell me a new one so I bought two pairs hoping the spare doesn't shrink on me (ahem).
