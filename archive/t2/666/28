Subject: Going back to stock, more hardware required

Hi,

Well I'm getting closer by the day to getting my '71 westy w/ 1600 dp
up and running. Got my valves and timing adjusted, and began to
attempt tuning the carb. Still doing some sputtering but she's idling
now. I think the major source of my problems now are this darn 009
that i'm ready to get rid of in exchange for the stock distributor.
I've read the articles in the library regarding the 009 and 34Pict3,
and I've seen the disdain on the list for the 009.

So first off, where's the best place to pick up the stock distributor?
It's the 205 DVDA if I'm correct. Am I correct?

Secondly, I'm looking for an oil bath aircleaner. I noticed there's a
bunch of different style cleaners up on the samba, but I'm not sure
which vw make/model year are compatible with my bus.

Finally, my bus is equipped with an external oil cooler (i can hear
the groans now) and oil filter. While we can debate the efficacy of
the oil cooler, I'm not ready at this point to remove it and my oil
filter in order to revert to the stock doghouse cooler. The oil filter
especially is something I don't want to give up.

The problem is that my engine appears to be burning some oil, my
theory is that with the extra oil capacity, when the bus sits for a
while the extra oil in the cooler is flowing back down into my engine
and filling it with too much oil. Could this account for the burning
oil? Any possible solutions? I was thinking a one way valve could
prevent the oil from draining back but I'd like to hear of similar
experiences.

Thanks in advance
peace
jules
