Subject: bed brackets.

It seems like I saw a bracket which would allow a passenger back seat 
to fold down like a westy bench. I thought I was looking for Z brackets, 
but a samba search only turns up westy appearing brackets.

What is this bracket called? Does anyone have a source for a set at
which I can be pointed? Do they even exist?

Thanks bunches,

jack
