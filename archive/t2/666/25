finally got the old one out, but the temps are dropping like a rock as a
cold front moves in,  started out it was almost fifty, two hours later it
was falling into the 30s and 15-20 mph gusts.... fingers going numb, can't
get hand into space with gloves on,,..

*)!*(-at-)##$#!!!! threw up hands and got Rotozip.  cut a 1 inch by 2 inch hole
to the rear of the round one where it is getting hung up,  AH! now I can
see what is the problem.  (mirrors and crawling upside down under door did
not reveal the problem) it's gotta go here!   20 minutes later I'm putting
the finishing touches of putting the door cover back and going inside to
get warm.   dern it is so much easier to do when you can see what your
doing.  from now on I will cut the hole first, and reccomend  to anyone
asking  to cut the small hole.
