Subject: Re: [T2] Possible to elimate the power brake servo?

If you remove the servo, won't you have to replace the master cylinder
too? I'd bet the shaft is too long to use it without.

My servo is currently disconnected (again) because of vacuum line
leaks. It REALLY builds up your leg trying to stop disk brakes without
it... ;-)

PS: Does anybody know where to get proper vacuum line for the brake
booster? Heater hose isn't cutting it. FLAPS looked at me funny when I
asked for it...
