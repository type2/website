Richard,

Correct you are!

As I remember from the "rumors" that we heard at vpc, it was just going to 
get worse and worse in terms of engines running hotter than they liked in 
order to meet the stricter and stricter emisions standards.

And guess what they had waiting in the wings...a brand new car called the 
rabbit....with a water cooled engine that met the standards and ran rings 
around bugs.

Besides, after years of the asian invasion, the beetle days were numbered.

And *none* of the late model asian cars were air cooled....and they had 
lots more horsepower than the beetle.....and you know what happened in 
1973-74....the first gas "crunch"....the Asian cars were getting better 
gas mileage than the beetles...*and* they had good air conditioners as 
well.

Bottom line....time to dump the air-cooled soon.  Anyone in Cali have 
comparisons smog testing numbers from a late model car as opposed to the
numbers required for the bus?...just for comparisons? 4cyl against 4 cyl?

Cheers, dave
