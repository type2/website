Subject: alternator idiot light

Has anyone else had this experience?? If yes, then what did your find was 
your problem:

My alternator idiot light flashes when I use my left or my right turn 
signals, but it does not flash when I use my emergency flasher, and it does 
not come on when the parking lights and the full suite of lights are on.  
All four bulbs flash as they are suppose to do.  The turn signals flash at a 
higher spead if I turn  all my lights off, and the idiot light comes on at 
three levels, equally with either turn signal is on: [1] very dim, when no 
other lights are on; [2]  moderate dim, when only parking lights are on, and 
[3] bright, when all lights are on.

Agin, my two questions are -  [1] has anyone else had this experience?? [2] 
If yes, then what [spoecifically] was your problem??

Thanks  Barry
