Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon Fuel Injection on Bay Window?

You are. ;)

But I was wondering about that. I know the engine management on newer cars
will probably barf on an ACVW, but older ones with just the Lambda/Oxygen
sensor should work fine, right? I've owned a few Jetronic-based vehicles
over the years, and am pretty familiar with it. I'd rather mess with that
than my dual carbs. ;)

  I put Bosch LH-Jetronic from a Volvo into my 1600cc Type3 Fastback
and drove 800 miles to Idaho on a test drive. I'm nuts. =)
