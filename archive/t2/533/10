Hello Guys   Let me throw my 2 cents in here all the good things for the type 
4 motor can be had easily with the type 1 motor, oil cooler(we are fabing 
type 4s) oil filter, more HP go with a stroker   1835or 1904 work well ,as for 
sealing you can do a number of things get the south american tin, creative car 
craft makes fiberglass stuff, or go el cheapo and use a truck inner tube. As 
for the type 4 mention remember that those are reman motors, and you didn't 
include shipping, and you will have reman heads ,cam, etc.  Now lets touch on the 
bad points of the type 4 motor, weak heads , always dropping seats, very bad 
design on the oil screen, if you overtighten it the case will break, push tubes 
that always leak,  probably about 125 lbs heavier,which takes away HP. and 
makes working on it a PITA compared to the lighter type 1 ,  also dont forget 
about the case plugs blowing out, I haven't seen a single type 1 motor do that 
but have seen a bunch of the typee 4s do it.  Now the good points   more 
torque?  maybe not with the stroker type 1, stronger bottom end, again you can do 
this with a type 1 ,  last longer ? , depends a lot on the driver,   more HP ? 
not with the weight difference even comparing stock engines , now lets compare 
costs  reman motors  type 1 about a $1000.00 cheaper , you can get a new mex 
motor for about $1500.00 , there are no new type 4 motors, you can build one 
using some new parts but the crank, rods, case will all have to be machined to 
new specs.  I personally like them both and do a lot of work on both, But the 
type 1 gives you more opions at a better cost. Also remember that I drive 
splitties but my tow vehicle is a Sycro.   Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem
