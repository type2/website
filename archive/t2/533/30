if you get all the parts it will work. most important is that the harness,
AFM and ECU are a set. many of the other bits are common to most years. do
some research in the library (FI section, there is a good part numbers
interchange matrix) and check the applicable part numbers to make sure you
are getting a matched bunch of components.
