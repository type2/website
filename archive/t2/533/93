The differences are mostly in where the plug for the condenser is located.

For our engines, generally the plug is either on the bottom of the distr
(and uses a round insert) or on the side.

The points for the bottom-plug generally have a slightly longer wire, and
a straight connector.

The points for the side-plug often have a slightly shorter wire, and a 90
degree connector.

It's possible to make do with the wrong type, but..
