Hey Pete,
Unhook the tube that goes to the aux air valve and blow through it (when 
cold).  If you can't blow through it, then the valve is either stuck or 
broken.  You can try pulling it out and cleaning it with some cleaning 
spray.  Otherwise you're gonna have to replace it.

When and if you take it out, you should be able to see through it (when 
cold).  There is a lever that swings open (not all the way), but enough 
to let air through.  I stick mine in the freezer to make it open all the 
way.  Apply 12 volts and it should close all the way in about 5 minutes.

You can also adjust the opening by loosening that nut on the unit and 
sliding it one way or the other.  You can try sticking a screw driver in 
there and moving the plate to the side if it's just frozen stuck to free 
it up.
