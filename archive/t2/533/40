Hi Pete,

I would suggest you stick with the FI troubleshooting procedures in the 
Bentley Manual. If you don't have one of these it is the BEST 
investment a poor man can make in their bus. There is also an FI manual 
available at Richard Atwell's site at http://homepage.mac.com/ratwell.

According to the Bosch FI manual, this is what you should do:

1. Check electrical components: Distributor, coil, plugs, wires, dwell 
and timing.

2. Check valves, compression and oil pressure

3. Check all hoses for proper connection and good condition.

4. Check fuel pressure.

5. Check cold start valve & TTS

6. Check Aux Air inlet valve

7. Check Air Flow Meter


The trick is to NOT SKIP stuff just because you "know" it's OK. Verify 
everything in proper order.


Happy trails,
