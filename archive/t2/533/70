Subject: westy curtains and bosch 6v generator and regulator for sale

Hello list,

I am sorry to have to do this but would the person who
emailed me about the green westy curtains please send
me another email? I deleted the old one by accident. I
am going to work on trying tt get some pictures of
those curtains.

Regards,

P.S. I have a Bosch factory rebuilt 6v generator with
new Voltage regulator for sale. It is in the factory
Bosch box. Part # GR11X. This part will cost you at
least $165 out right from the cheepest source. I will
sell this one for $100.00 plus shipping or possible
trade for certain upright engine parts ect. Let me
know what you got. ;) This generator was purchased for
a customer at a local garage at least 10-15 years ago.
The customer never picked it up and it has set on the
shelf ever since. The mechanic who was keeping it
passed away and I picked it up thinking it was a 12v
generator. My loss your gain. Never installed since
remanufactured.
