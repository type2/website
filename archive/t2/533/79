"Most Busses were converted by "backyard okie"
mechanics "

I dont understand FI, but I have a mechanic who does.

"The single Weber progressive is a horrible conversion
for the 
T4-engined Busses. . ."

That was my expierence. I hated that carberator.



 "The "best"
carb conversion is dual carbs; my Westy's
"Weberiziation" was done with 
a pair of 34ICT 
one-barrels."

Thats what I have. What kind of gas milage do you get?
Im getting 16 in mixed driving, 18 on the freeway.
