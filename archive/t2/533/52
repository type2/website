Subject: Questions about timing

I've got some questions about engine timing on Ashleys 1600 - Type 1
engine - proper vacuum advance distributor with Petronix.

1) At TDC, according to the mark on the flywheel, the rotor is pointing
away
from the no.1 cylinder mark on the dizzy body. Looking at the wires, the
rotor is on no.3 at  TDC. I guess this means the dizzy is at 180 degrees to
where it should be since the engine is new (Remtec). Does this matter ? If
it does, do I just rotate the body 180 degrees ? I did try "correcting" the
order of the wires to the plugs, but then couldn't get the engine to fire
so
I put them back again.

2) I though I'd check the timing anyway using the idiot guide. Is it the
big
fat central wire the test light is attached to ? Won't this blow up my test
light ? Assuming the position of the dizzy above, will my test be valid ?

 3) The engine runs smoothly but takes around 5 seconds to start. As the
engine runs in I've noticed that this has changed. Idle is excellent so am
I
looking at the right thing ? Does timing alter as an engine runs in ?

Most of this is me trying to understand my van better. I could leave well
alone as running is so smooth, but if I can look and learn now I know
better for the future.

Thanks

Phil
