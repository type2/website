Subject: [T2]homemade front tire mount

well made this the other day and was pretty impressed... do not have a welder so there for everything had to be put together with heavy duty bolts and threaded rod for the tire....
it is bolted to the bumper with 17 mm nuts and 12 inch bolt through the bumper and then has a security mount drilled into the top of the bumper with a 10mm bolt... and for the top there is two small threaded rods holding the tire in place through the front vent  for basically just extra security,... the 12" bolt in the bumper keeps it pretty tightened down though.....
the tire itself is braced down by a very large piece of threaded rod and nuts and then a smaller piece of threaded rod and nuts... secure enough my daughter can jump on it and swing on it and it doesnt budge.. yahoo finally have somewheres else to put some more junk now that that tire is out of my floorboard   LOL...
 
 
believe it or not this was a old DP weight bench.... LOL..
peace
Chris
