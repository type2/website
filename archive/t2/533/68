Subject: Generator and fan from a SP engine in Doghouse shroud??

Hello List,

Quick question: Will the generator, generator stand,
and fan from a 1600cc SP engine work with a 1600cc DP
dog house fan shroud? I am getting a rebuilt 1600cc DP
engine to put in my 68 bus. I wanted to use the
generator, stand, and fan from the old SP engine with
a set of dog house tin and shroud, but I wanted to
make sure they were compatable with each other.Is
there anything I should be aware of when doing this?
Any suggestions?

Thanks!
