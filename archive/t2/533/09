yes.

it doesn't fit, unless you are very "lucky" with the way you route the wire.
lots of people have had this problem, and some bus drivers have installed
them with no difficulty. it all depends on the location of the gauge and
where the wire runs from front to back.

i have about 12" of wire on mine. i know this is not supposed to be good,
but i have tested it and it doesn't seem to introduce any error. i used wire
that was the same gauge.

we need to get VDO to add about 18" onto the harness so it fits no matter
what.
