Subject: A few things to sell

Hello List,

I have a couple of thing I am interested in selling. 

I have a complete set of green westy curtains. These
are in excellent condition. I would go as far as
saying they are in almost new condition with almost no
fading. Any fading would be hard to spot when the
curtains are lying flat uninstalled and undetectable
when installed. This set includes all the curtains
including thr front windshield curtain. This set will
include some but not all the hold back straps. I am
asking $180.00 for the set. It does not include any
mounting hardware like curtain rods.

I have a NOS rear view mirror that I know will fit a
73-79 bus. Asking $10.00

I have a NOS set of whinshield arms and wipers for a
late model bus. Both the arms and wipers are the
factory silver color and are new. Asking $45 for the
set.

Just let me know,

David Kelly
