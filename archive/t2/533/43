Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon Fuel Injection on Bay Window?

> Back to the quest for FI. I have seen posted on the Samba a FI setup
 Complete for a 1982 Vanagon Air Cooled. I have a 1977 Westy 2.0L(currently
 Webbered). Would this swap work? Would I have to modify this setup? Should I
 just forget about it and look for a closer year to match my ride? I have no
 experience with VW FI, so I am looking for those of you that do to HELP
 Please. TIA.

My opinion:  I would try to get as close to the year you have. Each bay year has 4 different ECU's.
Fed manual, Fed auto, Cal manual, and Cal auto. [I have not seen a difference other than part numbers....]
But 80 and up Calif Vanagons have O2 sensors and electronic ignitions that are part of the wiring harness. 79
Cal electronic ignition was a add-on.
The big S hose and aircleaner from a Vanagon will not fit on a bay. You need the bay version of each. And the
big S hose is NLA.
The EFI engine harness is different on a bay. The ECU mounts in a different corner on the Vanagon, I am not
sure the Vanagon harness will reach where the bay ECU goes.
