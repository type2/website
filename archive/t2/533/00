Hmmm, what kind of wheelchair do you use?  Entry to the bus is not hard,
what with the big sliding door, but getting into the driver's seat will be
a challenge.  You can't cut down the pedestal, as it is also the front
wheel well.  You'd have to devise a way to transfer to the driver's seat
from the rear.  This may or may not be a challenge depending upon your
ability to transfer back and forth.

I don't mean to discourage you.  Any and all problems can be overcome with
application of money and creativity.
