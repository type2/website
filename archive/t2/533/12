Yep, they're out there, but are a little pricey. I remember the last time that
this topic came up John at aircooled.net said he could get them. I don't think
that they're listed on his website tho'. He does have the exhaust stubs listed
so you can make your own custom headers.

I've got a page out of a old vw trends/hot vws mag of a company that used to
sell 'em. Eurowerks, Euromotors??, or something like that. If needed I can find
the ad when I get home to verify the correct company name. IIRC they were
pricey ($165-185??).

Like Access Bob suggested gutting a pair of rusted out 72-74 (how much can bad
HE's go for) is probably the most cost effective way. Or
