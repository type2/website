I bought a brand new Westy in 1978 that ran like a top for years (until it died of body rust in Panama six years later).  I can't understand why so many injected Busses were converted.  My"Webberized" '76 is terribly cold natured and gets horrible gas milage... it doesn't seem to have been a very smart conversion.

Most Busses were converted by "backyard okie" mechanics who don't understand
injection and refuse to *learn* about injection.  They "understand" carbs (though for 
many even *that* is debatable!), so they'll rip out "that mess of crap" and slap in carbs 
as a band-aid cure-all when faced with something they don't understand.  Even if they 
have a shop and business cards, they still have the "backyard okie" mindset.

Me, I've got a 2" stack of books on Bosch fuel injection, many different manuals for 
each ACVW car I own (Clymer, Haynes, Chiltons, Bentley) and several for cars that 
I *don't* own.  I put Bosch LH-Jetronic from a Volvo into my 1600cc Type3 Fastback 
and drove 800 miles to Idaho on a test drive. I'm nuts. =)

The single Weber progressive is a horrible conversion for the T4-engined Busses, partly 
because of the lack of manifold heat and partly because of intake runner length.  The "best"
carb conversion is dual carbs; my Westy's "Weberiziation" was done with a pair of 34ICT 
one-barrels.  Still not as good as stock FI (when everything is working right), but much
much better than the single carb disaster.
