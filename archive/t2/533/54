Check TDC by pulling the #1 spark plug, use a thin metal screwdriver,
and feel the piston gently push upward as you turn to TDC. IF THE PULLEY
AND PISTON AGREE ON TDC, then you have a dizzy 180 out. Only then.

You remedy this NOT by turning the dizzy body, but by removing the dizzy
and checking drive shaft orientation, which is described well in iodiot
guide and Bentley, Hanes, etc. The dizzy drive might be in wrong.

Actually, re locating the wires should make it run, but isn't the best
way to address this. 

Since moving them made it not run, I BET YOU WERE AT TDC FOR NUMBER 3!
Bascially, that pulley makes its way from TDC at #1 BDC at #2 TDC at 3,
and BDC at 4. This assumes hand rotation counterclockwise when you set
you valves for instance, and when in running order (clockwise), results
in teh firing order 1-4-3-2.

I imagine everything is ok, you can prove this by checking out TDC as
above for #1. then feel better.

NO! Timing light pickup if from CYL #1 wire never from Coil wire! Make
sure you are timing the engine to the right dizzy model. If it is around
TDC at idle, and advances though vacuum to 28-32(sometimes 34), as
RPM/Vac increases, you should be fine. Some Vac dizzys can go above the
magic 32 deg advance limit, which I imagine is the point of them in one
way under part load throttles, but that's another subject.

No, timing is related to RPM, well in your case vaccuum, unless you have
a dual advance dizzy. If this is breaking in, yes they get better
usually.

Good idea. Just be careful. Learn what the valves feel like when they
are set right, firing order, dizzy, and know your carb(s), and hunt and
kill all vacuum leaks.
then tripple check that fuel line you just replaced and enjoy.
