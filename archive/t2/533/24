Subject: engine parts for sale.

So I have decided how to go with my engine rebuild. I
also need a new tranny for the bus, so I need to sell
the motor parts that I am not using to pay for it. A
complete list of the parts is on the samba, (parts bus
68-up) but here are the big items:

cleaned machined 1.7/1.8 case 100$
used unrebuilt heads 1.8 pair 150$
crank rods unmachined good condition: 75$
1700 P&Cs NIB, Brazilian 175$

Ill give a 10% discount to people who come to pick
them up.

Or Ill concider trades for a 75 pyramid tranny with
complete nosecone (mines busted) that came out of a
recently running vehicle.
