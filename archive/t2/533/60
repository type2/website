Subject: Bus related emails with attachments

Recently I have received a coupla emails from seemingly bus-related 
sites.  I have not opened the attachments because I don't know the 
sender.  Is there someone www savvy out there (Raistrick?)  that can 
sleuth these senders?

I'm getting Lurch ready for the trip to Everybus.  It's a daily driver 
now - my only means of conveyance.

This weekend it will turn 340,000 miles, so tune-up and oil change are 
scheduled.

I'll take it in for a front end alignment next week (it pulls to the 
right when braking).
