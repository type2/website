Subject: doghouse tightness

i picked up a roll of 3/8" round foam called caulk saver and adhered it to
the doghouse gaps with 3M seal adhesive 08008. the foam is supposed to be
water resistant. then i ran a bead of the adheasive between the metal -
nearly encasing the foam. that oughtta work, letcha know in a few years.
