Subject: RE: [T2] regarding biodieasel

The problem with biodiesel as I see it is that the making of it requires a
bunch of equipment, dedicated space and the handling of V. caustic
chemicals. Also in Australia the govt has just taxed all biodiesel
manufacturers at the rate of 38 cents a liter. I don't know if there is
something the same here or not but the conversion of a car to run on
straight vegetable oil seems much easier to do and supply with fuel.
My 2 cents Barry Wright.

Bio-diesel is not vegetable oil. Bio-diesel made from vegetable oil.
Bio-diesel can be run in any vehicle that runs on petroleum diesel.
Bio-diesel and petroleum diesel can be mixed together.
