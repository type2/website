I just got a big nut and bolt and welded them together. I lucked out in
looking through my parts stash and I found a bolt, with 17mm hex head, that
had threads almost all the way to the head so I could weld the nut close to
the bolt head to keep it short when I cut off all the extra threads with a
grinder. I left it long enough to bottom out in the socket and stick out far
enough to reach into the bottom of the allen head screws. It is real
convenient to use with a socket in a short 3/8" rachet wrench or for more
leverage in a long 1/2" rachet wrench. I later got a 17mm bent allen wrench
but it turns out, I like my socket adapter because it works better.

I admit I stole the following ascii art from someone with much more artistic
ability than I have
