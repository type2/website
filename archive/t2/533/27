Subject: 72 bus

Not sure if this is the correct email address to send a technical question
to or not.  Please redirect my email if necessary.
I have recently purchased a 1972 transporter.  I am the owner of 3 beetles,
but the pancake-style engine in my new bus is a new monster to me.  I have
dropped the engine, replaced a cracked head, replaced all of the gaskets,
etc.  Engine is running fine on the shop table...compression checks are
great.  I have not placed it back into the bus yet.  I am concerned about
one thing...the cooling flaps and the spring that seems to control them.
Just by moving the flaps with my hand, the tension on the spring seems
awfully tight.  I do not know how tight it is supposed to be.   Should they
just move open and closed with no effort at all, or should it be on the
tight side.  When I ran the engine on the table, I never saw the flaps
move...aren't they operated off of the thermostat somehow?  I'm just not
familiar at all w/the flap system and do not know if this spring is okay, or
if it has been "fooled with" by a previous owner.  I don't want my engine to
overheat.  Can you further explain how I can make sure my "flap system" is
working correctly? ...and if this is something that needs to be done prior
to placing the engine back into the bus, or can it be done with the engine
in place?

THANKS!!
