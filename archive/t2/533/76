Subject: RE: [T2] regarding biodieasel

I think there needs to be some clarification on the "green" fuels out
there.

Bio-diesel is not vegetable oil. Bio-diesel made from vegetable oil.
Bio-diesel can be run in any vehicle that runs on petroleum diesel.
Bio-diesel and petroleum diesel can be mixed together.

Cars that can run on straight vegetable oil have had their fuel deliver
system modified so that the vegetable oil can be heated to a temperature
that allows the vegetable oil to be used as fuel in a standard diesel
engine.
Many of these vegetable oil cars have 2 fuel tanks, one for diesel, the
other for veg oil. In this set up the car is started up on diesel and
switched over to veg oil after everything has heated up. Before shutting
down, the engine is switched back over to diesel to clear the veg oil
out of the fuel pump and injectors. The veg oil is too thick for the
fuel deliver system when its cold. It must be heated before it can be
used by the engine.

I've been doing some research on bio diesel during the past year, and in

my opinion the Josh Tickel method (he wrote "from the fryer to the fuel
tank") is the way to go.  I don't believe spending $700 is required to
make your car run on biodiesel.  In fact, i think it's much simpler than

the kit makes it out to be.  I'm sure some of that stuff is very
necessary, but i'm also sure you can get away with not having most of
it.
Now if only I could find a diesel bus for a dollar....
just my $0.02.....
