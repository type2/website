Subject: Found a neat product

If you're like me a aren't the greatest at soldering wire, I found a
product at Lowes in the plumbing section called "Solder It" Silver
Bearing Solder Paste. It comes in a little white syringe. It allows you
to solder stuff with a match or lighter. For wiring, one twists the wire
together, put the paste on, heat it with a match, and presto.... a very
nice looking silver soldered connection. A small 7.1 gram syringe costs
about $4 US. A little goes a long way. Its not the cheapest way to
solder, but if you've had some of the misadventures I've had with
regular soldering, its worth the price. It would be a great thing to
keep in your toolbox. It works great on soldering copper piping also.
