Subject: Vanagon Fuel Injection on Bay Window?

Back to the quest for FI. I have seen posted on the Samba a FI setup 
Complete for a 1982 Vanagon Air Cooled. I have a 1977 Westy 2.0L(currently 
Webbered). Would this swap work? Would I have to modify this setup? Should I 
just forget about it and look for a closer year to match my ride? I have no 
experience with VW FI, so I am looking for those of you that do to HELP 
Please. TIA.

Travel On and Enjoy,

Michael Knight
