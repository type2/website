Those two engines use a similar arrangement to operate the cooling flaps. 
Verify the thermostat is operational and in spec. Just as with the Beetles, 
the Bentley gives all info. Do get one before proceeding further and verify 
all procedures already done if you want to make sure you won't be pulling 
that motor again soon. A wire attached to the thermostat runs rearward to 
an idler wheel then turns up and through a hole in the tin and attaches to 
a lock tap on the flap control rod. The spring holding the flaps is indeed 
quite strong normally. I use a Vise Grips to twist the rod and load the 
spring, then wire from the Grips to hold it open. Then it is just a two 
handed job to attach the wire.
