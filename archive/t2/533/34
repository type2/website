Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel filler hose

Hi folks

The hose was aroiund the 2 inch mark, I just put it on (deparate to get on
with it) its the one that goes from the metal filler pipe to the tank
itself, it has a bend in it, about 75 degrees near the end.
It seems to be made of a softer rubber than my original, but that might have
gone hard.  Its thicker walled (but still fits the stock clips) and does not
seem to have any of the reinforcing "string" through it.  It was clearly
marked Fuel hose - made in the UK.

The supplier (with whom I have no connection etc) was VW Heritage in the UK,
cost was a fairly steep UKP40, but I was tired of fiddling with the old one.
I have just checked an online converter and thats about  CDN95 or USD73,
plus shipping.

Its not on the website at www.vwheritage.com but is at the bottom of their
ad in the latest Camper and Comercial (realy bad picture).

I have Emailed them and asked for a price to ship to North Ameriaca and will
report back with details. I will also take some photos if I can get a
Digicam at the weekend.
