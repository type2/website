I think Chris is correct.  If the bowl goes dry, the engine will fall on 
it's face under acceleration due to lack of fuel.  If there is no loss 
of power, the bowl is not running dry and there can be no issue with low 
fuel pressure.

It is my understanding that Timo's bus has no driveability issues that 
would indicate the bowl running dry, and also larger jets increased his 
power output.  Thus I don't think it is possible that low fuel pressure 
is his problem.

Why his engine is running so lean is a mystery though.  Maybe the air in 
Germany is just thinner?  Maybe he lives on thhe Zugspitze?  :-)  Vacuum 
leak is possible but it would have to be a big one to affect A/F that much.
