Subject: Turn Signal Question

Quick question before I get too deep into this.  Browsing through the archives
on turn signal issues I read about something being able to come loose around
the hazards switch that would cause the issues I'm having.  Can someone take a
look at the picture in the link below and tell me if the part shown needs to
be attached to work?

Symptoms -
Turn signal switch seems to work fine, when moved left or right the turn
signal indicator light comes on but stays solidly lit.  No lights work on the
outside but the bulbs and connections there seem to be OK.  When I pull the
hazard switch nothing happens.

The PO did a lot of fooling w/ the electrical stuff around this area, and his
toolkit apparently consisted of a machete, some silly string, and 10 rolls of
electrical tape.

The picture of the part in question can be found at

If that part should function while just dangling then I'll start from scratch
but wanted to ask the experts first.

Thanks in advance!
