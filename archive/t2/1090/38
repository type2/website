Ah, the LED on the Module box.  To the best of my memory, most of my older
Allison/Cranes didn't even have that feature, so no attention was paid to
for that.  Musta been somethin' Crane added later on.  I'd have to dig into
my stash for my spare Crane unit and get the instructions then to correctly
answer your question.  I may scan them as a PDF and put them on my website.

Gotta remember that I've been using these units since the early 70s (I
practically grew up next to the Allison factory in Duarte, CA).  I even used
their 6 volt units on a 56 and 61 Bus back then.
