That's quite thorough Timo. Just a thought. Are you sure your
thermostatic air flaps are not sticking in the closed or partially
closed postition?

How about the AFR sensor? Do you use a bung welded to your exhaust or
a tailpipe adaptor? If the latter, insufficient insertion can read
lean due to mixing atmospheric air with the exhaust air.

Of course, that doesn't explain high temps. Check carefully for leaks
at the intake manifolds, both at the head side, top and bottom, and at
the carb side, front and rear. Let us know what you find out there.
How about the balance tube elbows for the crossover tube (the one that
feeds your brake booster)?

As you can see, we are all getting stumped for more ideas!

You're sure your distributor is timed correctly and performing correctly?

Your cold weather stumbling sounds more like a choke adjustment since
you have no problem when warm.

I'm not experienced with how much AFR change to expect with various
jet sizes. All of the carbs I have used were either stock or already
set up for my engine size with no problems.
