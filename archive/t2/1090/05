yeah moving wires about seems to occasionally cause the relay to drop
in/out. so could be wires but my spare double relay is known to have
an intermittent problem so out of frying pan into fire.

Bus Depot wants $79 for that little thing, OUCH hate buying one if
that is not actually the problem, if it is the problem don't begrudge
Ron making a living just hate to spend it if that isn't it.

wish I could pin down the problem intermittent stuff is such a royal
pain.

thanks
Bob
