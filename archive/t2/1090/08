The count so far has been two experiences with bad wires/connectors
and none with bad double relays. But if you want to swap the double
relay without buying one, I have had some luck in the past with
disassembling and reconditioning the contact surfaces in the relay.
You might try it on your spare so your down time on the swap is
minimal.

 yeah moving wires about seems to occasionally cause the relay to drop

 an intermittent problem so out of frying pan into fire.

 Bus Depot wants $79 for that little thing, OUCH hate buying one if
 that is not actually the problem, if it is the problem don't begrudge
 Ron making a living just hate to spend it if that isn't it.

 wish I could pin down the problem intermittent stuff is such a royal
 pain.
