Subject: crane ignition question.

been screwing up my bus the past couple days and can't find the
instructions that came with my crane ignition, and crane evidently was
recently sold so their website is semi off line.

in any case

does the little light on the control box go out or on when it triggers
a firing ???   seems like I''m gonna need to static time it and can't
remember the prochedure.

thanks
Bob
