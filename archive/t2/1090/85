Hi all,

I have forgotten the person's name that wanted me to collect/photo
informational stickers/plaques for his database. I'm going to see a '79
Westy parts bus this weekend to see if there is anything on it that is worth
salvaging. I haven't seen it yet so I don't know what is there except for
the fact that there is no engine or transmission in her. I'll do my best to
at least take the photos you wanted.

Bob
