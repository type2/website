Hey Bob,, that is exasperating eh?  ... thing is .. when ever I have seen
this happen.. it isn't the rotor loose on the shaft.. rotor is either set on
out of place, or the dist has lifted slightly and the shaft isn't in the
drive properly... so the entire dist shaft isn't spinning,

when you press down on the rotor, it may engage at that moment, but a few
miles down the road it lets looose again.

check the clamp to see it is seating correctly...   my 2 cents
