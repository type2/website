Now, I am no expert but that looks like it is a broken relay. it very well 
could be your hazard or turn signal relay. I would replace it. At the very 
least you have introduced a point in your wiring for unwanted grounding. 
That is the other thought, your symptoms do appear to be the cause of a 
short/ground, and that broken relay is a good place to start.
