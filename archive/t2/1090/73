I shoved mine up against the disk sander for a quick fix.  The bottom of 
the rotor doesn't have to be perfectly flat - you just need to allow the 
top-inside surface of the rotor to seat firmly on the top of the 
distributor shaft.  I would even allow a 1-2mm gap so that you know it's 
seated all the way...
