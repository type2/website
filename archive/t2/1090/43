Subject: 1980 vanagon sluggish--loss of power

Hello,

Check archives but found no answer to this question.  I recently rebuilt by
80 VW engine and removed FI system and reverted to a carb instead.  After
rebuild bus seemed underpowered.  I removed cat converter to see if maybe it
was clogged...gained a little power but not a lot.  Question--  Do I need to
replace my fuel pump since it was for FI system? or is this not the prob.

Thanks,

Mark
