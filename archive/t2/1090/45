Subject: Solex Rejetting - Round 1

Hi all,
it's again about high CHTs on a stock Solex-carbed 2.0 liter 78 westy. A
while ago, I posted some data with AFRs at different speeds and the
resulting CHT. The AFRs I recorded were between 14.4 and 16.0 when
running from 2800-3200 RPM in 4th gear. After talking to my engine
rebuilder he said that I'm running way too lean (his advice is to run
between 11.75 and 13.0 AFR) and sent me some bigger main jets. Before, I
used 132.5 main jets, 160 air correction and 52.5 for idle (which is
supposed to be the stock configuration according to the Solex manual).
Now, I've replaced the 132.5 mains with 137.5 mains. That dropped AFRs
from the range 14.4-16.0 down to the range 13.6-14.7. The engine runs
much better now (more power) and CHTs were a bit lower, but not much.
So, I guess I should order some even bigger ones and rejet the idle and
air correction also. But what could be the reason for a stock
configuration to run so lean? I suspect a vacuum leak somewhere, so I
even disconnected and plugged the line to the brake booster right at the
intake manifold to be sure there is none. Am I missing something obvious
here? To get in the range of AFR the engine rebuilder told me, I would
probably need 145 main jets. Is this excessive? Could my mechanical fuel
pump be the reason? And if so, how do I check it? Or could the cylinder
head with larger intake and exhaust valves be the culprit (intake is
42mm and exhaust is 34mm)? Or should I just drop in the bigger jets and
don't care about it any more?

Thanks for all the help,

Timo
