I'm running a 74 carb bus right now, so my memory is a little dim, but
most of the connector plugs are just plastic holders for standard
spade terminals. Should be able to push them out of the plug and
replace them.

 wonder if someone has the plugs that could be upgraded with new wires

 the one that is causing all the problems is the "other" one that is
 probably original with the bus, 33 years old.
