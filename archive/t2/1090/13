Hi Bob,
Sometimes there is a metal tab (part of the metal spade connector) that acts
as a clip to keep the spade connector inside the plastic housing, and it can
be depressed w/ a small flathead screwdriver to release the connector. You
might be able to see it on the side of the housing where the connector and
wire slides in.

Cheers, Mike
