Just my 2 cents, Check your fuel pump pressure and make sure the lines from 
the tank to the pump and the pump to the carbs are clear. Check out the fuel 
screen in the tank too ( little difficult with fuel in the tank) . If its 
all OK then I wouldn't much worry about fuel delivery. The pump pushes fuel 
into the bowl (reservoir) in the carb where it is removed via the vacuum 
developed in the carb venturi. The pump is not forcing fuel thru the jets.
