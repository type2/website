Subject: Friday: New Matchbox 1970 T2

Them that collects....

Found on the toy aisle yesterday. 1970 T2. Keep your eyes open. The  
first Bay Window I've come across in ten yours off collecting off the  
big box store toy aisles. Mine's red. I've seen green advertised.

Matchbox #94 "Volkswagen T2 Bus"

Discussion off-list please.
