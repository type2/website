Subject: Looking for a subsitute receiver-dryer

I have a '75 bay with overhead air conditioning. I am upgrading the system
from R12 to R134a refrigerant. I'm having trouble finding a receiver-dryer
(R134a) replacement with similar dimensions. If it is much longer than 4
inches it starts to reduce my ground clearance.
