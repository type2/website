This is the best idea yet. I'm thinking if one cylinder is causing the
problem, it is going to be on the one with the CHT sensor since
cylinders running normally should not be hot.

 I find a good starting point to identifying cylinders with an air leak

 after spraying looking for leaks with no success to find that a
 concentrated effort on the underperforming cylinder can find a leak that
 was previously undiscovered.
