I think there is too much air getting into your engine somehow.

Here's a thought... what kind of air cleaner are you running?  My thinking is that perhaps the stock jets are sized assuming the use of the stock air cleaner system, which looks somewhat restrictive.  If you are running an open-element air cleaner, you might try switching to the stock air cleaner and see if your A/F ratio goes down.

Regardless, if you can't find the problem I would go with larger jets (140 or perhaps even 142.5) before I would drive around with an overheating engine.  But keep track of your fuel mileage - if it drops to far below what you would expect for your setup that may be a sign that you are masking a problem instead of fixing it.
