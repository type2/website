I find a good starting point to identifying cylinders with an air leak
is to remove the leads one at a time and identify the cylinder that
makes no/less difference to the engine revs. I have sometimes done this
after spraying looking for leaks with no success to find that a
concentrated effort on the underperforming cylinder can find a leak that
was previously undiscovered.
