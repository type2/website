Yes, you can easily change them out.  I did exactly this.  Here is all 
the info and the tool that you need:

To remove the connector, you need to insert a very small screwdriver in 
the connector side and it will release the clip (look at the pictures 
above to see what side the clip is on) - it pulls out from the wire 
side.  Chop off the connector, strip the wire, install new connector.

I bought the Del City crimper and it seems to work well.  Doesn't work 
great on the very small crimps, but oh well...
