Bob -

The infared light never goes out.  What breaks the light beam is the
rotating disc with the cut-outs.  When the beam lights thru the cut-out, it
completes the circuit telling the module when to fire the spark plug.
Static timing is accomplished essentially the same way as a points ignition,
but I find that stroboscopically timing while the the engine is properly
idling is a better way after static timing it for initial set up.  All my
points VWs and a former T*y*t* truck have been retro-fitted to the Crane
(formerly known as Allison Ignition before Crane swallowed it up).

The company that took over Crane has indicated to me recently that it will
eventually bring them back into production soon, possibly next year.  I hope
so, I only have one kit left in my stash.  Much better than the
Pertronix/Accu-Fire/Compu-Fire Units currently prevalent in the market IMHO.
