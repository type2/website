Why'd you switch to carbs?

Maybe the carbs aren't jetted correctly?

Um, yeah.  The pressure difference between the two is huge.  EFI is 
around 40psi and I think carbs are under 10.  You're probably flooding 
the thing.

But why carbs?  Go with megasquirt and you'll get way more tunability 
than with carbs, unless you're really like taking carbs apart to rejet 
them...
