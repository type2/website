I would remove any extra parts and then see how far the rotor seats and 
then replace the parts and then confirm that the rotor is seating the 
same.  If it isn't, I'd definitely sand it down.  The "key" in the rotor 
has a taper, if I remember correctly, so it could also offset your 
timing one direction or another if it's not fully seated.
