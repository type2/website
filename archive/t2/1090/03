So far I can still get them, but whereas before I had about six suppliers
now it's down to one or two (when last I checked). Obviously I can't predict
the future, but that doesn't bode well. The situation could reverse itself,
but my gut feeling is that it's more likely that the price will continue to
rise or the engines just become unobtainable. So speaking for myself, if I
were thinking of buying one sometime in the future, I'd do it soon. That
said, I should also mention that the new VW engines are generally not
warranteed other than initial shipping damage, as the factory warranty is
only valid within the country of intended distribution.  Of course factory
defects are very rare, but it is something to consider if you plan to just
buy the engine and store it in the crate for a few years.
