Subject: Wanted: Splitty or Early Bay Camper

hey all,

A friend of a friend is looking to get into the bus world and is interested
in buying a splitty or Early Bay westy, preferrably hard top.  He's located
here in Pittsburgh, PA but might be willing to travel for the right price, etc.

Anyone have a somewhat solid westy that they are looking to divest themselves
of?  Or a project that needs love but is available at the right price?

Just curious...

Cheers,
   Tom
