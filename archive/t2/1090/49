3+ days to find, 3 minutes to fix.  did a tuneup last weekend and
couldn't get the engine started afterward, no way no how would it
start.sweated cursed fumed and hollared
many on here offered wise words and parts, but still no start.

so this morning back to basics, lets find TDC in case I messed it up.
uh, notice rotor is not turning....????

somehow when I had the dist cap off last time I didn't get the rotor
fully seated and it was spinning loose on the shaft... coil was firing
but plugs weren't getting the message.

pushed it down tight, engine fires right up....put on timing light and
set timing, lock it down and go for drive...two days off work and lots
of fuming and it was just something that simple..

thanks all. and glad it was just something that simple.  now if all
the other stuff that beast needs were so simple...

Bob
