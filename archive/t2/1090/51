HI,
I've been running into the same issues. 2.0 L with stock dual solex carbs
running 135 mains, 140 air correction, and 55 idle.  My AFRs are around 16
at idle, i do not yet have a CHT, but my oil temps are hot at idle about
220, and when it get that hot it starts to stumble and diesel when shut
off.  I would have to think that the 55s at idle should supply enough fuel?
it sounds and runs good untill it gets hot.  I too have been looking for vac
leaks, but all my hoses are new and carbs are freshly rebuilt and i have a
new mechanical fuel pump. when i was running my weber progressive carb, i
wasn't running into these temp issues, which leads me to believe its jetting
or a vac leak with my current solex set up

I think you have a vacuum leak.

These are the stock carb jets for a 2l (intereurope manual):

main 132.5
air corr 160
pilot 52.5
pilot air 130
aux fuel 45 (left carb)
aux air 0.7 (left carb)
