Hi all,
thanks again for all the input! Again, I try to answer everything is
this single post:

Yep, flaps operate perfectly as far as I can tell (checked thoroughly
during rebuild and moving the thermostat cable you feel the flaps moving
from closed to open position -clonk--clonk). Oil temps are in the normal
range. I'd guess they would be too high if the flaps were sticking...

I'm using a bung welded into a thunderbird exhaust just after the
collector and before the silencer. Pics from the install can be seen
here: http://tinyurl.com/r6eh6h

I checked with brake cleaner all possible sources of air leaks. Neither
increase in RPM nor any change in engine sound. What other methods for
checking for air leaks can you think of?

I disconnected and plugged the brake booster tube directly at the intake
manifold. All hoses between intake manifolds are new and secured with
hose clamps.

Yes, rebuilt it last year and the advance (mechanical and centrifugal)
is working according to specs (vacuum: 8.5-11deg adv (-at-) 7.9 In. Hg;
Centrifugal: 8-13deg (-at-) 1600 rpm, 20.5-24.5 (-at-) 3400 rpm). Timing is set at
7.5deg BTDC (-at-) 850-950 rpm (Man Trans).

Stock system, no modifications.

This is what I'm going to do. But you're right, I don't like to fiddle
about the symptoms not knowing the source of the problem...

Thank you all very much,
Timo
