Subject: carb kit

	An internet-sales outfit near me offers a carb kit (NZ $24.95 
i.e. c.U$17.50) claimed to be suitable for Solex 34 PICT but also 
smaller Solex models.  Perhaps the various gaskets are supplied in 
several sizes within this one kit; does anyone know whether that is 
the contents of

		VW 113.198.575 URP

		Parte  NO.
