From napaonline.com - the Echlin VR502 is here:

It is a standard regulator for Type 1 engine type generator. I pulled
the above link by inputting a 1971 bus with 1600 engine.

The Echlin VR503 which is for the Type 4 engine style alternator. I
have used this regulator before. Works fine. It varies from the OEM
style because of the external pigtail type connector.
