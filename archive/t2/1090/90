I'm thinking you must be on the right track with too much air being
the problem, but carburetor theory means that the point of mixture is
at the venturi. So the air volume is regulated by the venturi size,
and it should handle however much or little air the air cleaner can
deliver. The problem occurs when air is introduced through a leak
AFTER the venturi so that the venturi is not able to regulate the
mixture. The same thing happens with fuel injection when the air leak
is after the air flow sensor. If the air sneaks in downstream, the
sensor doesn't know it is happening.

The most common source of "stealth" air is going to be at the intake
gaskets, deteriorated hoses and bad connections. And of course,
throttle bushings.

 I think there is too much air getting into your engine somehow.

 Here's a thought... what kind of air cleaner are you running?  My
thinking is that perhaps the stock jets are sized assuming the use of
the stock air cleaner system, which looks somewhat restrictive.  If
you are running an open-element air cleaner, you might try switching
to the stock air cleaner and see if your A/F ratio goes down.

 Regardless, if you can't find the problem I would go with larger jets
(140 or perhaps even 142.5) before I would drive around with an
overheating engine.  But keep track of your fuel mileage - if it drops
to far below what you would expect for your setup that may be a sign
that you are masking a problem instead of fixing it.
