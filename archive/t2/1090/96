That's an interesting picture. Dangling parts aren't good
housekeeping, but usually don't prevent them from functioning if all
of the connecting wires are present.

The $64 question is, what is that dangling part? I don't think it is a
VW part unless the top is broken off and all that remains is the
connector board.

I just happened to pull my fuse box to clean up the connectors, so I
have this photo for you to look at:

My bus is not perfect either. This exercise showed me that my previous
owner had moved the wires around in the fuse box, so who knows what
feeds what.

But in this picture you see three boxes mounted on the fuse box. From
left to right you see the flasher, the left headlight relay and the
right headlight relay. Note this photo is shot from above, looking
down at the floor.

So, back to your mystery part - it almost looks like the breadboard on
the headlight switch as if it fell off the switch and is waiting for
you to put it back on, but you did not say that you have problems with
the other lights not working.

It could be the connector board for an aftermarket flasher that has
broken off, or it could be a slimline electronic flasher. Or your
flasher could be on the fuse box like mine and this could be a mystery
part.
