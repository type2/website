Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] Re: [VB] New Mexi Engine Specs

I put a mexi motor in together to go in a 56' panel that I owned for a couple of years it was a very smooth running engine. 

At that time the price was $1400 for the engine. I knew I should have bought 2 at that time. 

Here is what I remember 

1) the valves ARE NOT SET by the factory!!! --> you must set valve lash - Clara is right 15mm nuts, thats OK I guess 
- don't forget to set the valves 
2) Plugs are different ( long reach ) 
- perhaps someone can weigh in on specific differences, my engine came with plugs installed I think 
3) Does NOT have a distributor gear installed!!! --> you need one, plus the copper rings and ideally the little tool to put it in 
- Somewhere there is a procedure for putting the distributor gear in. 
-- you need to set engine to TDC 
-- as I recall you can put the gear in a couple of ways so that TDC could be in a odd place such that it would confuse people ( ie pointing to #3 cylinder location ) 
-- I didn't have the tool but used a bent coat hanger to "lower the gear" in to place 

Engine felt very smooth and well balanced, had the same power as a any "stock" engine.
