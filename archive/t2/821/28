Subject: re: tranny mount sealing rings

Thanks to Jim and Karl for your encyclopedic knowledge. I guess we know of another instance where Bentley is fallible. 
Ever since I discoevered these little things, I have been scratching my head as to why the nylon sleeve and bushing are there in the first place. The only possible answer I can muster is that the rings/bushings were meant to keep the steel fasteners from contact with the dissimilar metal of the trans? Or did VW goof and end up with oversized holes in the bellhousing, necessitating the use of of the sleeves?

I said:
In the process of de-gunking the trans out of my 72, I dislodged some
nylon looking rings. They came from the sleeves that the trans carrierbolts
go through. According to Bentley, ch.6 p.12, Fig 4.1 #5, they are sealing
rings. What exactly are they supposed to seal? How critical are they? Does
anyone out there happen to know a part number for said rings?
TIA
