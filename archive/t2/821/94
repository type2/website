Well.. if you were using EFi,,you would just connect the vac line for the 
brakes to the air distributor spigot... same place VW connected it to in 
78... you have to rearrange the hose a little... I used a short length of 
steel line with short rubber flex lines to lengthen the original 74 line to 
reach the EFi air dist port.

So. I am assuming your using carb[s]   in which case your going to have to 
find an intake manifold port to connect the vac line to... you may have to 
drill the intake manifold to accept something like a 3/8" npt barbed hose 
adapter.. with the appropriate size hose barbs...
