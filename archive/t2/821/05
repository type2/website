I didn't mention my bus is a 73 camper. I have also
looked into the ragtop alternative. The only reason I
would like to keep the fiberglass top is to maintain
the bus' original style. 

The only place I found a ragtop was on the following
website:

If I can get a complete camper top for the same price
or less, I may stick to the camper option.
