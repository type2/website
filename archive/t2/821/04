www.type3.org is a great start.
There's also a forum + loads of other stuff.
The long block of a type 3 is almost identical to the beetle motor (for
1600DP's that is), the main difference is the filler is a tube coming from the
sump for a type 3 + some extra threaded holes for the rear engine support.
The tinware, fan, generator, dissy, carbs etc are all different and not
interchangeable. If you've owned and loved kombi's and beetle's, type 3's are
a great car to set up to as I've found out now I have a couple :)

Bus content: I was caught in a rather nasty storm here in Sunny Brisbane,
Australia on Sunday afternoon, after 15min. of rain and there were already
shallow streams running across the road. Lots of wind, rain and hail, not a
nice time to be on the road. I was very glad to be in Andy ('77 2L), he took
it in his stride, when most cars were parked on the side of the road :) I was
glad when it was over though after ~1/2hr.
