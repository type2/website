Subject: westy in accident

Does anyone know who was the driver of the white/orange (73 I think) that  
was involved in an accident on 220 / Battleground ave. on Thursday  night?
It didn't appear that the westy was that damaged, but the windshield was  
out, but I'm still worried about the drivers heath.
