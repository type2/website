Subject: Piece of sheetmetal I need

Hello,

Does anyone have a suggestion as to where I can get this piece of 
sheetmetal I need?  I'd rather try to get one cut off instead of 
fabricating.  It is the left side metal that has the channel for the 
engine gasket.  The PO chopped it off when they put a different engine in. 

The picture can be viewed here:

Thanks,

Stephen
