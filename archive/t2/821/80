I don't think the drain tubes were installed at the factory if the vehicle
was to be a camper, I know my 70 westy don't have em... holes are there but
no drain tubes.

On my 74 sunroof bus the front drain tubes run down the B pillar and exits
out the bottom and the rear drain tubes exits out in the rear engine cooling
vents. I've seen some buses with middle drain tubes as well.
