   It's for to protect the clutch cable when it passes thru' the box
section of the frame to reach the pedal hookup...FWIW, I once
replaced a cable and when I went to attach the adjustment nut,
the cable was an inch or two shy of the lever...After I cursed
the FLAPS counterman for givin' me the wrong cable, I came
to my senses and checked the front connection...D'oh, missed
the tube and had the cable running outside the frame... :-(
