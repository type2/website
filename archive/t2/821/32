Subject: Re: [T2] re: tranny mount sealing rings

It was probably designed (ie: over-engineered) that way. Speculation on my
part, but the bushings could have been used to dampen vibration. The seals
(perhaps o-rings) were probably there to prevent the ends of the bushings
from being crushed/cracked on the ends when torqued. With the advent of the
different design on 73-later models, this point perhaps became moot (and
they were probably cheeper to produce this way).
