 I checked with my bently and see what you mean. but....
I have had 3 fuel injected buses and still have the fuel injection from
all of them. The clamps from all three
buses are exactly the same, on both ends of the "S" hose. These were on
 two '75's and a '76. They are also
very similar (if not the same) as the clamps used on the fuel filler
neck. I assume they are factory parts.

 Did VW get smart and later discontinue the clamps to protect the AFM?

No, no, no.     You are mis-understanding what I said. The big S hose has ALWAYS had a clamp on each end. The
hoses that GO to the big S hose and the decel valve never had clamps on them.

Here is exactly what I wrote:
"I bet there is a hose clamp on every hose going to and from the big S hose....."

GOING TO and FROM the big S hose. NOT the big S hose itself.

I tried to write it in as plain English as I could, I guess it still got misconstrued.
