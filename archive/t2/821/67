Heather,

I've studied the external oil cooler thing because my stock 1600dp oil gets
to 230F when outside temp is > 80F and I try to drive >50 mph for more than
an hour. I may drill the case to do it when the engine is rebuilt but for
now i kept it stock and enjoy the slow drive.

There seems to be something wrong in your setup, I'd point my finger at the
valve. If the oil is only 100-140 degrees, the valve is obviously opening
too early. Or maybe the oil temp reaches 181 degrees, the valve opens and
oil drops to 100-140 degrees while the valve remais open. Do you know when
the valve is supposed to open and close given that it was open?

Why did you hook up two additional coolers ? Wasn't one enough ? Given the
oil temps you mention with two coolers it really seems like overkill to have
two. Assuming that a stock 1600dp needs one cooler (the one in the
doghouse), a built 2000 that needs to stay cold _may_ need two coolers (one
in doghouse and one external) but really not three (doghouse + two
external). Three would be for a 4.8liters in proportion.

Also why soo long oil lines, it must give the oil pump a really hard time.

If I were you I'd try one cooler, one 180 degree valve and the cooler way
closer to the engine to shorten oil lines and associated oil pressure drop.

Ron Van Ness had worked it out : http://www.type2.com/rvanness/oilcool.htm

good luck - Arnaud
