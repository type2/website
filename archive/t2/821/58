     << What year Bus and what condition? I think you'd be
asking' a lot out of a brand new van, much less a 20+ year old VW...Not
that it can't be done, but the VW engine was just marginally enough for
the Bus when new and adding a trailer is just asking for future
trouble...I assume you're planning on cruising the "blue highways"
exclusively...Interstate highway speeds may just be a bit too much for
even a Boston Bob rebuilt motor... ;-(
      Emergency repairs might be a problem, too...It's no
fun being stuck in some out of the way burg waiting for a hard to source
part(s)...
      I'd have no problem with this, if it was the 60's or
70's when every parts joint had shelves full of VW stuff... ;-(>>


The raw, umolested truth Anthony--not a doubt in my mind--

And to have the whole fan damily marooned in Whichwaydoigo Mo. waiting
for parts or service on a Bus is not  pleasant thought.

I'd be awfully cranky if I was on my own,
let alone with whole crew stranded.---

Here's a pantry of food for some self teaching material.

Nope.
