Subject: just changed my oil filter

I just changed my oil filter and instead of using the 3 jaw variable 
sized tool that fits on my socket wrench (like I usually do), I used the 
channel lock oil filter pliers.  My god was it easy.  It took me all of 
3 seconds to get it loose.  I had a mahle filter, which I believe is the 
shorter of the filters people are using and I still had no problem 
getting at it.

I think this almost ranks as high on the useful tools list as using drum 
brake pliers to take off valve covers.  That one has been my best find 
to date ;)
