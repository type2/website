Subject: Absence of consensus (was Living out of a Bus on the road with

Sometimes it seems as though there is consensus on this list about 
certain things. Towing always seemed to me to be one of those things, 
in spite of Greg Potts' nifty Westfakia trailer. Now this, from Jay 
Ollom.

I'm beginning to wonder if there is consensus about anything on this 
list. For instance:

Solid vs. hydraulic valves
Whether parcel shelves are dangerous
Trailers and towing
How to heat a parked bus
How to heat a moving bus
Best oil, best tires
Extra gauges or no extra gauges.
How to fix a cv joint.

The only real consensus I can think of is about tin, flaps, and 
thermostat. They need to be installed and in working order.

And having said that, I'll bet dollars to doughnuts someone will say 
otherwise before the day is out.

Isn't democracy grand?
