Subject: Re: [T2] Living out of a Bus on the road with Kids

   What year Bus and what condition? I think you'd be askin' a lot out of a 
brand new van, much less a 20+ year old VW...
    >I'd say that it's less likely to break under frequent reasonable 
highway use than occasional weekend and around town use, and it will most 
likely be maintained better for it's constant use and attention.  I'd trust 
a tried and true VW over any new van, hands down.  You are right though, it 
better be in very good shape prior to the trip.

     The VW engine was just marginally enough for the Bus when new and 
adding a trailer is just asking for future trouble...
    >Nope, I don't buy it.  I've towed other busses with a weak and leaky 
2000CC engine.  A small trailer should be no problem for any reasonably 
maintained and driven bus in good condition.

Interstate highway speeds may just be a bit too much for even a Boston Bob 
rebuilt motor... ;-(
    >You don't HAVE to go interstate speeds just because you are on an 
interstate, and I bet (but I don't know) they intend to take smaller 
highways whenever possible to enjoy the ride more.

Emergency repairs might be a problem, too...It's no fun being stuck in some 
out of the way burg waiting for a hard to source part(s)...
    > Being stuck in some out of the way burg only sucks if you have 
somewhere else you need to be.  If you don't have a firm deadline, it's just 
another rest stop along the way.

   I'd have no problem with this, if it was the 60's or 70's when every 
parts joint had shelves full of VW stuff... ;-(
    > Make sure you have the bus in good condition, the AIRS list, and a 
fair stock of spare parts, and I just don't think it would be a big deal.

     Tony, I'm not trying to bust your chops, I see your points here and 
they are valid, I just don't think these concerns are the show stoppers you 
are making them out to be.  They are all things that would concern me if I 
were taking a trip like Chai is talking about, but none that would keep me 
from doing it if I had the opportunity.
     I'd take a test and tune trip of several hundred miles to work out the 
kinks in the bus, trailer, and all other equipment before I committed to the 
cross-country trip.

Just my .02
