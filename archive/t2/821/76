Subject: going on a road trip!

My girlfriend and I are going to be taking a trip in the bus working up 
the coast of CA and then into Oregon.  First we're gonna stop off up at 
my parent's place in SF for Thanksgiving.  Then on Saturday, we're going 
to head up to Oregon and check out a few places.  So far, people have 
told us to check out Ashland, Jacksonville, and my friend said Silver 
Falls was pretty cool, as well.

Anyone have any other recommendations?  We'll be driving around 
oregon/northern CA from this Saturday through next Wednesday.

I just insulated my heater pipes and they're pumping some good heat up 
front.  My GF also sewed some new blackout curtains so that should be 
handy!  She even helped me install my stereo and change out my door 
locks - they used to be on two keys.. drove me bonkers!

Ok, that's about it.... gotta go pack!

Thanks,
Mike
