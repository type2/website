Subject: Re: [T2] Living out of a Bus on the road with Kids

Your welcome. I also have this crosspost from Buskatiers. Phillip and
Catherine just got back from an extended bus trip, no kids though.
They do this frequently. The post has a link to their blog where you
can read about the trip and see pictures too. For the first time. I
retire in 5 years. We hope to do this too, but I have my concerns
about space and not being able to have things I have at home.

"We have been down many roads in our VW.  Tonight we are home and it
seems a little strange to not have to rearrange the bus to go to sleep.
(actually as we are unpacking we do need to rearrange to get to the
bedroom.)  If you want most of our story check out the blog.  2005

As we travel we have had a lot of different reactions to our journey and
mode of transport.  Some people cannot imagine going across town in a 37
year old bus.  Many gave us thumbs up and applauded (and helped with)
our adventure.  We enjoyed meeting the adventurous souls who were always
ready to join us, either in their buses or in spirit.   Of course about
the time we think we were the oldest thing on the road we come across
Model A's.

It was a trip of a lifetime but we plan on many more adventures.
