Hey, I'd send him one. I have a top of the line Fram with the gray colored textured end that helps with removing it. Are you going to contact him then Don?? I'll chip in.

 I'm thinking it's time to do another filter cutup with all the new 
 filtersout there. The last one is like 5 years old. Anybody wanna 
 hook up with
 BobistheOilGuy and get him to do it? If we each contribute one 
 filter he'll
 have plenty to work with!
