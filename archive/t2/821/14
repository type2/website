Subject: Re: [T2] &*^&!!!! oil filter length and removal

I just bought a pair of generic vice grips designed to remove oil filters at 
Princess Auto for about $5. It'll grab anything shaped like a filter. One 
size fits all too.

probably the same .. I know I picked mine up for about $3.00 wally world
I heard there was a longer filter avail.. but like those remote filters.. 
sooner
or later  you pick up a piece of debris on the road.. and it punctures your
filter.. you could be in  a bad situation.

From Courtney:

Is it only me that finds the oil filters tough to remove on the 77 Westy?
What brands are people using? Mine is an all black filter can with the VW 
Audi
symbols on the side, but the
*&*&^!!!! thing is just short enough that my wrench can't get a good grip. 
Is
there a longer QUALITY filter
out there??
