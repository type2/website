Heather,

For what its worth....I have a 82x90.5 engine with a stock cooler
and big valve heads in a regular VW....well, not stock cooler, but a t3 
type cooler with one more pass of fins...oh, and a doghouse shroud.

In the summer in 95 degree weather, I can get it to about 210 at 
4,000 rpm for 30 minutes(interstate).

In 60 degree weather, it runs about 180-190 at 4,000 rpm.

If you are running that hot, something else is wrong.  See archives for 
<Arnaud> and his bus heat problems.

Might be better to rethink the whole oil cooler part and re-evaluate
what is going on.....

Something is *not* right somewhere.
Stock pulley and alternator pulley?
Belt is well tensioned?
All tin in place and sealed?

The list goes on.....


Cheers, dave
