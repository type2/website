   What year Bus and what condition? I think you'd be askin' a lot out of a
brand new van, much less a 20+ year old VW...Not that it can't be done,
but the VW engine was just marginally enough for the Bus when new and
adding a trailer is just asking for future trouble...I assume you're planning
on cruising the "blue highways" exclusively...Interstate highway speeds
may just be a bit too much for even a Boston Bob rebuilt motor... ;-(
   Emergency repairs might be a problem, too...It's no fun being stuck in
some out of the way burg waiting for a hard to source part(s)...
   I'd have no problem with this, if it was the 60's or 70's when every
parts joint had shelves full of VW stuff... ;-(
