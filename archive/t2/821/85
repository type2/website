Hi Lee,

You can't get there from here.

The late westy (74-91) have no roof behind the driver's seat:

Adding a "factory original" sunroof would require a complete transplant of the
roof section from an original Sunroof bus, which is the same job as converting
a transporter to a westy. *That* took me about 100 hours back in the winter of
2000. (A professional could probably do the job in a quarter of that time).

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
