Don't forget the Testarossa...

Funny enough, when I was in automotive publishing there was (and  
probably still is) a raging debate among some writers as to the whole  
"boxer" motor versus Flat-V (like the Ferrari) motors.

I found it all pretty silly, since at the time I drove a Subaru...and  
still do.

BB512i of course was "called" a Boxer, but simply had a V12 with 180  
degree V.

Not technically a boxer motor, though, like we have in our buses.
