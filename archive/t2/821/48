I guess I'd just say that a few weeks to a month or so is way different
from *living* in a bus. Especially with multiple people... I think that
would take quite a bit of patience.

I'd think it can be done... just be ready to incorporate everyone's
opinions into the decision at all points in time.

Best of luck with it!

Cheers,
Harry
