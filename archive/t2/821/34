Subject: Re: [T2] &*^&!!!! oil filter length and removal

No Phil, mine are just like vice grips, but the jaws look just like that 
tool. Your's may be better since the handles are longer giving more 
leverage. I have yet to use it though so I can't vouch for it's 
effectiveness. I have found large channel lock pliers to be marginal at best 
in removing large, slimy filters.
