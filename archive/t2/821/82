Subject: Shocks

Can shocks be changed without having a lift to get all the wheels off 
at once.  Would blocking the wheels and doing one shock at a time using 
the jack to raise it, and a set of really sturdy jackstands be the way 
to go?

I'm just considering if the pain and labor involved in doing it one 
shock at a time in a parking garage is worse than paying the labor at 
the shock shop.
