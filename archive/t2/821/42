Subject: Re: [T2] Living out of a Bus on the road with Kids

Read Peter Coyote's book *Sleeping Where I Fall*. He lived on the road with
his daughter for years. Until he saw the toll the lifestyle was having on
her. The decisive moment came when he found his little girl staring into a
window at Macy's, looking at a bed displayed for the seasonal white sale.
With all her heart she wished that she could live in that store window.

Some families may honestly have the vagabond spirit. But for the most part
kids need the rhythym of the familiar. Our own tastes might be cinnamon and
curry, but we have to respect the fact that our little ones often prefer
white bread, peanut butter, grape jelly and Velveeta cheese.

One thing I hear repeated often in the bus community is a fond story of a
family trip in the VW camper. I'm sure that more than a few listees are
second generation bus owners.

I think the wisest choice would be to live out of your bus with your family
for a few weeks or a few months at a time. And let your kids grow up with a
sense of place the rest of the time. It'll be better for the bus's sanity as
well.

But read the Coyote book. I think you'll dig it.
