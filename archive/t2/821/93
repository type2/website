Subject: 78 2.0 transplant into a 74 westy

I about to install my 78 2.0 with a my 091 tranny into my 74 westy.  I'm 
prepared to full with the shift rod adjustments, I think I need to shorten it by 
about 12mm (from the archives) but I haven't found out how to hook up the 
vaccume assist brakes??  Has anyone done this and have any good suggestions???  
Thanks in advance
