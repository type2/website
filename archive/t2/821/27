Hi Todd,

The metal sliding sunroof retracts below the outer roof skin and the  
above the headliner.  It doesn't take up any of the interior space,  
and it makes for infinite headroom when you cruise with it open.

Sunroof parts are hard to come by in good condition. The cables are  
NLA and weren't cheap when they were available. I got the last set  
CIP sold about 2 years ago, and they cost me $300US.

CAUTION:
The worst part about sunroof buses is that the roof wasn't designed  
to be watertight. Instead, the water is drained off through plastic  
and metal tubes that run through the body. If the tubes get clogged  
with debris, the water backs up and then runs inside your bus. Ask me  
how I know. This is probably why there aren't as many around and why  
they are so commonly converted to high-tops and pop-tops.


Happy trails,
