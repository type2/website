   That's fine for scholastic proficiency, but schools/neighborhoods
teach socialization (or should). There was an episode of "Boston
Public" a few years ago and the gist was that one of the students
was livng with her mother in a (Gasp!) VW Bus...I wonder how a
kid would react to other kids asking him/her "Where do you live?"
