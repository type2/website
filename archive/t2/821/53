I don't see 200-220 as being out of line for 55-60mph.  Remember, you 
gotta get it over 212 to adequately drive off the water 
contamination!!!!!!  With 2 busses monitored with accurate digital 
modified meat thermometers, when it is warm out (80) it can be 240, 
which is the limit I set....dependent on the speed, this would be around 
65 mph.  I don't think this is bad, as I now have 245,000 mi on the 78 
UNREBUILT engine (and orig. tranny)!  My daughter has a 75 and goes 
"yay" when it is cooler out as she can then drive faster.
    The pressure drops noticably after 180 deg, which is when I assumne 
is when the relief valve opens to let the oil to the cooler.  I think it 
is incorrect to assume higher rpm's will run the fan more and get better 
cooling- it is directly rpm dependent, as is shown when shifting down on 
a hill and using higher rpm's to maintain a speed at less load- the temp 
goes up.  I shift down and back off the throttle to go as slow as the 
gear is comfortable with. It is driven by friction/time as much as the 
heat of combustion.

I drove to the Champoeg WW meet Saturday

  hardly every go that slow, but if the temps reached 220 I would downshift
  (to raise the rpms for the stock fan to help with the cooling) and 
pull over
  and waited until the temps went back down.
