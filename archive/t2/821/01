I also found out why you should not use ether spray start in the air 
intake- did this many times, but the one time in Nyssa's 75 bus, it 
backfired and LITERALLY blew up the flapper in the 6 pin AFM.  Would it 
be safer to do this AFTER the airbox throttle, like into one of the big 
hoses?  The pivot/resistance part seems ok.  Is there any easy way to 
transpose the flapper if her spare fails?

This is why [I believe] VW NEVER put hose clamps on those
hoses. The hoses should blow off 1st to protect the AFM.



  I'll second that. It took me two air flow meters to learn that lesson, 
some
  years ago.  :-(
