Thanks Karl,

      That really clears things up for me. From what I can tell, sun roof busses are very hard to find because most of them have been converted. Is this a safe assumption?
If he did buy a 68-72, would he be able to easily convert it back to a sunroof bus rather than a Westfalia bus?

Does the sunroof components interfere with anything in the bus? Does it eliminate a lot of potential headroom?


Thanks!!!

Todd
