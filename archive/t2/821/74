Well, my students would probably say "You live in a VW bus?  Cool!"

However, there is no replacement for a flesh-and-blood teacher, whether a
professional or a parent.  This is a demanding and time consuming task.  I
teach high school and know that there is no way that I could master the
entire elementary curriculum well enough to teach it.

Most "homeschooled" students are taught by a team of parents who have
banded together to pool their talents.  It is possible for one person to
teach it all, but that would basically become their entire life.  Several
hours to prepare lessons, then several more hours to present them.  You
don't just do this "on the fly!"

Now, some parents take a more hands-off approach than this, saying that
their children will learn material as their need to learn directs.  Less
charitable folks call this "neglect" and I have to deal with it now and
then when these students re-enter public school without major blocks of
knowledge.

On-line classes are the coming thing, but the jury is still out whether
they work well for most students.  Up to now, most students using on-line
classes are from the most tech-savvy and motivated group, which virtually
guarantees success.

A VW bus lifestyle is a great thing, but make sure that it is good for
everyone who you are asking to join you in it.
