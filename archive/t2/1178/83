I am SO confused as to what TYPE of paint to use. I live in Massachusetts
where there are not too many restrictions as to the type of paint I can use.


 

SO what type of paint should I use for the exterior and interior of the
bus/bug? I saw that Advanced Auto is selling Dupli-Color pre mixed paint,
but they have a limited paint selection. 

 

So what does a beginning car painter use? Epoxy, Urethane, or Acrylic?

 

Thanks for any advice. Oh Ya, money is an object!
