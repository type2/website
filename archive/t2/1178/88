I've been using Bus Depot rattle cans to touch up the sage green arts of 
the bus body.  For the fiberglass roof (which had been pretty worn with 
open fibers, I used Interlux Brightside Fiberglass Enamel.  It was a one 
step which smells of epoxy which went on with a roller.  It looks pretty 
good but will likely fine sand it and put in another coast in the fall 
or next spring.

As for the body, a proper paint job looms after I retire in another 18 
months or so.

Thanks to hints on this list, I found the Interlux Brightside White at 
West Marine.  Just use the "white" not the Hatteras White or Blue White.

Buy and wear a respirator from the paint store and cover hands and arms.
