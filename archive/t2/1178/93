Excellent reply - and excellent topic.

What is everyone using to strip (sand) old paint off. I've been 
experimenting on my bus in prep for eventually sanding it down to the 
factory primer b/c it's been painted x3+ times. I have air sanders, 
electric wood working sanders (palm, orbital palm sanders), 2" disc 
sander, etc.

Thanks Bob for an interesting thread.
