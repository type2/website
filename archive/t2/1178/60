Of course Subaru was the other company that produced engines based on
the VW, and there have been millions in the junkyards providing a
source of alternate VW engines. Of course these water-cooled engines
are more convenient for a Vanagon, but they have found their way into
their share of air-cooled VWs too. Personally I just like to keep the
VW experience pure, including the slow driving.
