Subject: GM's near-winner which could have indirectly helped us

	Bus connexion (if not content :-/):  some enterprising & 
rightly loyal yanks have eased a Corvair motor into a bus   ...
	This article grievously under-rates the Corvair, acceding 
ignorantly to Nader's propaganda.  Once GM got around to slapping 
independent rear suspension on it, they had a good car, not seriously 
flawed.  I for one wish GM had had the guts to counterattack Nader 
more vigorously.  At that rate, as their bodies rusted out by the 
million, numerous 110+ hp motors would have become available for 
buses  ...  with water injection, and I imagine turbocharging on 
some, this would have challenged VW to lift their game :-|
