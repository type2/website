Subject: Can a rear brake pull down one side of a 77  bus as you stop???

So I've gone through my front brakes on my 77 Westy  completely and the bus
still squats down on the passenger side when braking, even to the point the
front wheel will skid a bit if I really push on the pedal. The calipers are
not stuck, the tire pressure is equal. It all appears to be working properly.
One thing I noticed however, is the REAR brake on that side seems to do much
of the work when I put the emergency brake on. When I release the brake, the
bus will actually come up on that side and return to a level keel right to
left as I move slowly. So the question is:

Can a rear brake that is mis-adjusted like mine seems to be (manual adjustment
rear brakes on a 77) cause this problem I'm having with braking in general? Of
course I'm going to adjust it anyway, but just wondering what the experienced
mechanics on the list think?? If that's not it, then it's all new calipers,
brake hoses, hard lines I guess on the front. Seems like a waste though to me.
????? Of course this has to be safe, can't pretend it's all ok when something
is not.
