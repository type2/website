Easy.  Wilwood adjustable proportioning valve!  I have had one on my 
track car for over ten years.  Used to be about $40, I think they have 
gone up but should still be under $100.  If that isn't enough, you can 
also adjust the balance by playing with brake pad types.  The rear of a 
bus is so heavy that weight transfer should not be as big of an issue as 
in other vehicles.  I would seriously consider the rear discs if I 
hadn't just bought four new 14" Hankooks.  Maybe in a few years.
