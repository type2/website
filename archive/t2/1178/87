Note that while it's 'pre mixed' the duplicolor stuff isn't really much 
cheaper than other options using real paint. ;)   Don't forget to factor 
in clear in the price, because the Paint Shop line -must- be clear coated. 
You also have a very limited selection of colors...  When I last compared 
pricing, a modern urethane single stage (instead of base coat clear coat) 
in the economy lines was cheaper than the DC PS stuff, and a 2 stage 
(base/clear) was about the same.   And I got to pick my colors.

You generally won't find epoxy paint - just primer.   Unless you like 
Appliance White/Beige/Black. ;)


Beyond that I'm not much help - I'm still in the epoxy primer stage. ;)
