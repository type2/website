Subject: RE: Throttle Cable - Guide Tube Through Fan Housing

Hey guys, funny you asked about this. 

 

I was just working on my '65 (see separate posts) and I realized the
throttle tube on mine was in rough shape. I remember buying a replacement
once, but it was a very different design. I think mine might be original -
it is a tube with a bent piece of metal brazed to it. This holds the tube at
a specific angle as it comes through the fan shroud. Unfortunately a couple
slices are starting to appear in it, where it chafes on other engine tin.
I've since got some rubber grommets at my local hardware store. I think
ideally these would be metal grommets, just enough to round out the edges,
instead of them being straight/sharp edges.
