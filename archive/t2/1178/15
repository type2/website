I have this cookbook, too.  Someone in the was selling them a year or two
ago.  It is really good.

Friends..have a look at a fantastic cookbook, with a new VW picture of a
type
2 on every page, and great recipies!!

www.vwcampercookbook.com

It is a rare, and should be coveted by all bus owners, recipe book, with
just fantastic recipes..and pixs!  A good friend of mine sent me a copy for
my 65th Bday last week, and I feel priviledged to have it!
