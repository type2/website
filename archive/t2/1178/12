Hey there everyone,

I'm not quite sure if this is the correct way to reply to previous posts, but
here goes.

I do not currently own a hitch....I am considering buying one though.  I think
Uhaul
trailers might be a bit too heavy b/c as I was told they are made for rental
abuse.  One
option I'm looking at is buying a light(er) enclosed trailer and selling it
once I get to
CA....or converting it to camp in, haven't decided yet....  :)  Another option
is to
invest in a luggage rack for the roof.

Anti-sway bars?  My dad has them for his camping trailer, I could see if I
could borrow
them if those would help any.  Don't know if they would even fit though, need
to look at
size and configuration.

There are a lot of "unknowns" at the moment but to me it still makes more
sense
to invest $1,000-2,000 in the bus versus simply renting a Uhaul truck and I
would have to
pay for gas either way.  I am trying to look at all options though for
transporting a
queen sized mattress and box springs, 2 cats and a few boxes.  all suggestions
are
welcome.


Thanks for your help everyone I do sincerely appreciate it.  :)

take care,
Lauren
