Subject: Re: [T2] Valve cover clips

I take an appropriate size drill bit and clean em out, then a dab of moly
grease.  Will slide easily for 15 years.  Like Bob mentions though, if the
bales are still good, they have plenty of tension holding them in the holes,
big F'in lever to pry em out.
 
But you want them damn tight, means the bales
are still nice and strong, just like you want them.  Use a longer tool of your
choosing to get them off for more leverage.  I actually tend to use the end of
about a 15mm open end wrench and I "walk" them off, a bit hard to describe
unfortunately, more of a got to see it.  And I don't recall if you can on a
T1, cause mostly I work on T4's and waterboxers (same bale, but no heat
exchanger obviously.)

Trying to do a tune up, and the valve
cover clips are a real bear to turn.
Even after getting one of the covers off,
the clip is REALLY hard to turn. I
am thinking I need to remove the clip, and
somehow clean up the little hole
that it spins in? Or do I just need to get
new clips?
