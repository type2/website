That's all you have to transport?  Sell the box spring, bend the 
mattress 90 degrees and force it into the back of the bus.  Trust me, it 
will fit.

As someone who has moved across the country with two cats, in a bus, 
I'll tell you that it is possible.  Take Bob's advice and bring their 
catbox.  They will be fine after the first couple of hours - mine even 
enjoyed sleeping on the dashboard at times.  Don't attempt to keep up 
with traffic.

As someone who has witnessed someone else moving across the country in a 
bus and pulling a trailer, and having said bus break down in the desert 
and require a new engine, I would recommend that you NOT pull a trailer 
under any circumstances.  Your probability of crossing the continental 
divide and arriving at your destination without paying significant 
amounts of money for emergency repairs is already uncomfortably low in a 
bus - with a trailer, any trailer, you decrease that probability 
significantly IMO.  If you can fit everything into your bus, drive 
gently and take your time and you are the type of person who religiously 
maintains your bus, then I would encourage you to go for it.  If on the 
other hand you have a rockin stereo with iPod hookup that you listen to 
while you drive and think "maintenance" means changing the oil, air 
filter and blinker fluid every 3K miles, I would encourage you to rent 
the U-Haul truck and trailer your bus to your destination.  Yes it will 
cost a lot of money but you will arrive safely and on time with a 
running bus.  That is worth quite a bit, or at least it would be to me.

Good luck,

-David
