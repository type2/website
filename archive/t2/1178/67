Kevin lamented:
"So now I have one little piece of the bale wire stuck inside the
little hole of the cylinder head. [...] To get to it, I think I've got
to pull the engine."

Just a thought: bolt-on valve covers.
I have no experience with them and they might well be a terrible idea.
But it would postpone an engine pull.
