Hi Volks,

My bus is experiencing an occasional blip in power delivery at speed, 
once that has seems to be becoming a bit more frequent over the past 
couple of weeks, though its origins trace back at least a year or more.

In the time since the problem first surfaced I have already replaced the 
pertronix unit and the fuel pump, spark plugs and wires as well. So with 
all these other items eliminated I am thinking it's the coil. This 
particular coil is of relatively unknown origin, having been sourced 
from the 2004 Natural Bus Raffle Engine while I was at Buses By The 
Tracks in 2006. So it's very likely ready to be retired anyway.

I have a known-good spare coil from a 1987 vanagon, will that work?

Happy Trails,
