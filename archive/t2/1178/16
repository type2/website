I would use the bus except for that climb over the rockies and sierra 
nevadas your bus is tuned for sealevel at some points you can get well 
over 2 miles high... and I-80 can be deceptive, going westbound you can be 
climbing a gentle grade for 20-30 miles or more and not even realize you 
have just pushed the gas peddle down a little more

I have to agree sell off anything you can't easily fit into the bus and 
take it real easy. keep wife and cats. although make sure you take their 
personal liter box if they are indoor cats' in the middle of the desert 
they will want to use thier own litter box even with all the sand 
underfoot. (cats not wife).

spring for an oil temp or head temp gauge and watch the trends, get it 
soonest so you can get your buses baseline readings.  I have found with my 
78, 58mph is the sweet spot for cooling. YMMV I have an auto tranny.

the easier you make it for your bus the less sweat you will have while 
traveling most likely, ship what you can sell or donate what you can't 
take what is important to you.

have fun
