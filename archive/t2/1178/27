Hi Chad,

This may not be much help to you. Some years ago I bought a
replacement top from PLFVW. The owner, Dawn Smyth, made the tops using the
finest materials. The site, however, has been dormant for several years since
she suffered a bus accident: http://www.plfvw.com/home/default.asp  But when I
go there it seems to promise a reopening in the future. The site has not been
taken down. Still it has been a long time.

I am attaching a photo of the top
she made for me using I believe Sunbrella.

Maybe more
relevant, Go Westy now sells a line of tops raging in price from low to high
including a synthetic canvas at:

Hope you find
what you are looking for.

Cheers,

John
