For those using Interlux Brightside on the pop-top.  The recommended home
method is "roll and tip". Very simple and time proven method. Look it up
and/or watch the *tube vids.  Use good quality short nap rollers and multiple,
inexpensive foam brushes.  Throw the brush away when it accumulates enough
paint to drag.  You will know when.  Works best with two people, doable with
one.  Gives an outstanding finish without any additional work.  Reasonable
price for durable, high quality, high gloss, finish that will make you proud.
