Look at what you can buy there and 'nix what you can't buy.

Next look at the safety gear that each requires. What you can't safely 
spray nixes another type of paint.

Personally I like acrylic enamel plus a bit of hardener. It's durable, 
cheaper than the others but it doesn't have the mile deep shine that the 
urethane has. I've sprayed it with home shop grade equipment and had 
good luck with it. Home shop grade equipment: hotdog compressor, $50 
siphon spray gun. I've upgraded since then.

Alternative: prep the bus yourself and pay someone with a paint booth 
and the right safety gear to spray it for you. You might look at the 
price of that. It might be beyond your budget.

For me I wanted something tough that would look as good as the factory 
paint did way back when and the VWs didn't use a cleared paint like 
modern cars. I also wanted something that kept the rust bug at bay. This 
paint did all that but some rust is coming back (pinhole rust) b/c the 
friend that I paid to prep it (I didn't have the compressor or air tools 
or any way to spray it easily). Basically the paint isn't at fault I 
think, it's that the rusty spots were not fixed right. he used bondo to 
fill rusty holes and the moisture got into the bondo and it restarted 
any rust - or the rust never quite stopped.

Anyhow either drill the pinhole rust out and MIG/TIG/torch weld the 
holes closed or use epoxy filler - aka aluminum impregnanted filler 
which will not let the moisture in over time.
