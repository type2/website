Lowe's is advertising a socket set with deep sockets and a ratchet wrench
that one can put a screwdriver through. I was thinking that this would be
the perfect tool to use to adjust the lifters. You can loosen to lock nut
then without taking the socket off the lock nut, insert the screwdriver
though to adjust the gap, then while holding onto the screwdriver, tighten
the nut again!!
