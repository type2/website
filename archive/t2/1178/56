Subject: Re: [T2] OT:  Anyone ever see/drive a Suzuki LJ-10

John, I owned it's big brother, the LJ80 and I loved it. It was bonehead 
simple, but ran a miniature inline 4 4stroke. One day a tranny bearing blew. 
My friend ( a mechanic) put a wooden block under the oil pan, pulled off the 
tranny, opened it up like an oyster shell (it split into top and bottom. All 
the guts sat in the bottom. He pulled out the offending shaft, replaced the 
bearing, slapped it all back together and went home. All in 3 hours. The 
only thing is they like to mimic VW buses like yours and my 77.  They rust 
themselves to death.
HTH,
Courtney
