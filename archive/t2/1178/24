I'll make one further suggestion.  If you go the route of renting a U-haul
truck and an auto-transport trailer to traier your bus, you might not want
to tell them it's a 1970's (or 1960's) bus.  They may not find that in their
"approved" vehilcles list and can refuse to rent the trailer to you.  Tell
them it's something like a 1985 Ford Aerostar or something of that nature
and then they're happy.  

I went to rent a trailer to put my 1974 914 on about 12 years ago when I
moved from San Antonio to Denver and they said no-can-do - not in the books.
So I had my wife go back an hour later and tell them she was going to
trailer a 1983 Ford Escort and they said, cool - no problemo and off we went
with the truck and trailer.

Maybe it's better these days.  One can only hope.

Cheers.
