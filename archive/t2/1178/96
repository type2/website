That makes perfect sense to me, except I have never seen these parts either
installed on a vehicle, or available from any of our favorite parts suppliers.
Doesn anyone know where to get these things?

Rusty,
There is a spring and a hollow cylindrical part that fits over the
pring and a washer with a slit which catches on the cable end.
ssembly is as follows:
: thread the cable through the tube
: slide the spring over the cable and the end of the tube
. slide the cylinder over the cable and down over the spring.
: compress the spring with the tube until the cable end is clear
: slide the slit washer across the cable
: slowly release the spring and tube until the slit washer catches on
he cable end.
Your tube should no longer slide out unless you have quite the kinked
able.
