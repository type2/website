Subject: excellent VW BUS cookbook!!

Friends..have a look at a fantastic cookbook, with a new VW picture of a type
2 on every page, and great recipies!!

www.vwcampercookbook.com

It is a rare, and should be coveted by all bus owners, recipe book, with just
fantastic recipes..and pixs!  A good friend of mine sent me a copy for my 65th
Bday last week, and I feel priviledged to have it!
