I have used the Dupli-Color high performance paints about double the price 
and more colors (mine is metalic blue) and the white I have had good 
results with has been the Krylon appiance white epoxy paint.  over 15 
years and still looks decent and touch ups are a snap because that stuff 
blends almost seamlessly.

if your going rattle can paint it is not a bad selection but it takes a 
bunch. I guess to completely paint my 78 took about 25cans of the stuff 
at $8 per can so it is not "cheap" paint.  and of course decent primer etc 
etc.  still was less than $500 dollars total for materials.

prices are current what I paid for most recent cans, obviously 15 years 
ago was cheaper.
