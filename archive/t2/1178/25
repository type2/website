Subject: Pop top tent repmacement

I know this has been done before. But not for a while the products change. So
that being said I bought a pop top one from Bus depot last week for a bus I am
selling it was one they got from just campers not very good quality. But it
fit ok. I want a better quality one for my bus I am also thinking of getting
acrylic. Does anyone have any thought's on where to buy or what material to
get any help would be great thanks
