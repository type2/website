I pulled a small trailer behind my 73 Westy many times.  It was a home-built
enclosed trailer based on the small frame trailer sold by Harbor Freight and
some of the other tool places.  Empty, it probably weighed no more than 250
lbs and I'd guess I frequently loaded it with about 300-400 lbs of stuff.  I
barely felt it behind the bus with a fresh 2.0 motor and, one day during an
emergency stop, I actually out-braked a newish passenger car next to me as
he smoked his tires and slid further than I did even though I was passing
him at the time.  The weight of the trailer pushed down on the back of the
bus making the panic stop feel very flat front-to-back and seemed to keep
the bus from diving during the extreme maneuver.
 
Now, that being said, U-Haul's 4x8 trailer weighs in at a hefty 850 lbs
empty.  That means that if you add 500 lbs of cargo to it you're exceeding
the bus's rated capacity of 1322 lbs.  That's not much cargo.in a pretty
spacious trailer  If you must pull a trailer and can't find any better way
(like shipping some stuff to yourself as others have suggested) plan on
putting only light, bulky items (bedding, lamps, bicycles, etc.) in the
trailer and try to pack as much of the heavy stuff on the floor of the bus.
 
And as several others have mentioned, you've got to have a hitch that
attaches to the frame of the bus, not just the bumper or you're screwed from
the start and U-Haul (if they've got any sense) won't rent you the trailer
since those bumper hitches are probably rated at about 500 lbs towing
capacity and probably around 100 lbs tongue weight.
 
BTW, Lauren, I'm in the S. Denver area so if you want my contact info in
case you need any assistance out this way, email me directly.
