Subject: Re: [T2] Insulation under the fuel tank on a 79 bus

I recently did a tank .. there is a foam seal around the outlet opening,, 
and there is 2 vinyl patches from seat material under the tank.
I couldnt figure it out,, but i bet there is some expansion of the tank with 
heat and contraction with the cold gas.

I put the vinyl back in,, and put dense foam weather strips around the 
opening to keep dirt out ...
