Subject: RE: [T2] 73 bus pedal replace

If you disconnect the arm that attaches to the pedal this will give the pedal
more range of motion, with that range, lube and a drift it should come out.
Be careful of the eyelets that attach to the floor they can be pretty weak.
Hope this helps.

I want to replace my gas pedal on my 73 because the spring is broke and the
pedal is worn out.  The oin seems to be rusted and I can get it out. Any ideas
on pulling the pin.  I am soaking with wd40 right know.
