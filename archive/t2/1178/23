Considering a similar move in the OTHER direction in about 2 years.  I 
am reading this with interest but definitely leaning towards the U-haul 
solution.  When I retire I want the bus with me, not abandoned a 
Oklahoma somewhere with a blown engine.  I expect to have a lot more 
time to use it then!
