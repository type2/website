Ooof.

The why is easy, aluminum + steel + electrolyte/moisture = rust and
corrosion of the aluminum to boot.

Doesn't help you of course Kevin.B  Damn
I've never seen one that bad though, even in WV.B  I might be inclined to try
a couple things, local heat being first, +/- the vice grip attempt, or
attempting to dig at it with a quality little screwdriver, quality hardened
awl, whatever, don't have anything to lose.B  If that can't do it, I might
actually whack the nubin left with a hammer (punch if you need to get past the
heater box) with good solid heavy taps, 50-100 times (like I do with brake
bleeders.)B  Counterintuitive to whack it inwards I know, but that might well
loosen up the remaining steel core in the rust and corroded aluminum which
might then let you dig it out with a tiny little screwdriver or the like.
Sami has a good fallback plan as well, cheap set of Bugpack (or whatever) bolt
on's.B  Some leak, some don't, most don't leak "that" bad.B  Depending, may be
better than risking heater box removal if things are THAT corroded.B  I'd hate
to break off an exhaust stud at this point and be pulling the head...

Dangb&dang b&dangb&. I had soaked them both with penetrating oil over
night, I got one off b the 15MM wrench was very helpful.

Unfortunately the
other one broke. So now I have one little piece of the bale wire stuck inside
the little hole of the cylinder head. To make matters worse, it is the one on
the front driver side. So the heater box is right in the way. Ibm not sure
how to get this little nub out, except to try to drill it out. To get to it, I
think Ibve got to pull the engine. As this is spring steel (it is spring
steel right?) Ibm not sure if I can even drill it out, do I need a special
bit to get it out?

I think the amount of metal sticking out is so small as to
make it near impossible to get a pair of vise grips or anything on it.

What
causes this? Ibve never had one seize inside the head like that.
