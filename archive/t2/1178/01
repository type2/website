Subject: Insulation under the fuel tank on a 79 bus

Does anyone know much about the insulation below the fuel tank on a late 
bay (mounted on the underside of the body, facing the transmission)? 
Can it still be sourced?  What was its purpose?  I'm working on a 
project and that insulation was previously removed and we're trying to 
figure out if it's needed.  The owner is concerned that it's going to 
trap water against the body and promote rust, so I wanted to see if 
anyone had any input on its pros/cons.

Thanks!
Mike
