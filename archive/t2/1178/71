Subject: Distributor advance curve

First a little history.

My bus was running hot, and I tracked down a couple of vacuum leaks:
1. brake booster servo - replaced
2. carburetor throttle bushing - replaced 34 PICT 3 with 30/31 PICT

My SVDA distributor (purchased from a vendor whom we all know about 6 years
ago) was not working just right - advancing 12 degrees at best.  I was under
the impression that the vacuum signal for the 34 PICT was different from the
30/31 PICT.  I asked if the distributor could be recurved, and the vendor
said, " Yes, provided you make some purchases to offset the cost of working
with the distributor."

One hundred dollars later, I got the distributor back, and the total advance
was still only 12 degrees.  I put it on a shelf and kept on using the 009, as
I never had any trouble out of it in the 20 years that I've owned it.

At a bus festival recently, I showed the distributor to one of my Canadian
friends, who suggested that perhaps something might be hanging up the advance
mechanism, or things may simply need to be cleaned and lubed.

Fast forward to today.

I futzed around with the SVDA, and swapped the 009 out.  I was still not
getting an advance at high RPM that I would expect (28 degrees or so).  I
sprayed some WD-40 down into the distributor.  Now it works just fine, so I'm
guessing the centrifugal advance system wasn't working right.  Perhaps since I
put the Pertronix in, I wasn't paying enough attention to lubrication (putting
a few drops of oil onto the wick in the distributor shaft).

Lesson learned.

Distributors are quite simple, really, and I don't have to rely on the
"expertise" of anyone else to fix something that I'm perfectly capable of
fixing on my own.
