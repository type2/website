Subject: re: main seal leak

Rings are good.
5W30 oil being used
temp good
oil pressure good
Did not use sealant on the crank
Did do the polishing bit.
Started leaking almost immediately after startup.

I guess I just did two sloppy installs.
I dunno!
They used to not leak when I have done this before.
