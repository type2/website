Subject: Fw: [VB] Vintage cars wanted for filming

I'm going to FWD this to T2, not sure if Tom posted it there.
 
It is pretty
cool at least to have your vehicle in a film, a couple of friends did the same
with the "Big Miracle" whale movie up here in AK when it was filming.  Didn't
pay much but got their vehicles in the movie.
 
Funny how almost every vintage
car ends up a perfectly restored just like it rolled off the showroom floor
car in films like this, cause after all no one was still driving a 50's beater
in CA in 1973 after all...

Doesn't look like
there's any money in it, but they are looking for
67-73 cars for scenes in a
movie about Steve Jobs, filming around
Palo Alto, California soon.
