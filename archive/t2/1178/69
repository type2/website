Subject: RE: [T2] wiper parking position stumped

Got it sorted, this did the trick, thanks for all your suggestions/help.

Disconnet the linkage. Remove the drive levers from the motor. Position
wiper arms at correct rest position just above the lower windshield seal.
Reattch the drive levers in the correct position on the motor shaft. You
just got the cross piece misoriented on the motor when putting it back
together I bet.
