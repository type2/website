The problem of course Robert (and you know I love the vair, particular the IRS
ones, but even the swing axle cars) is that Nader was the first guy to really
"get the goods" on a large corporation, producing internal cost estimates of
settling wrongful death or injury lawsuits vs paying for a recall, and GM
going with the cheaper option...

Nobody (excepting perhaps large governments)
can backstep from that sort of press, not even GM in the glory days.  The "oh
well we'll just pay for the people we kill, if they can prove we had anything
to do with it" mentality makes ones position rather untenable.

flawed. 
I for one wish GM had had the guts to counterattack Nader 
more vigorously. 
At that rate, as their bodies rusted out by the 
million, numerous 110+ hp
motors would have become available for 
buses  ...  with water injection, and
I imagine turbocharging on 
some, this would have challenged VW to lift their
game :-|
