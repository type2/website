Subject: Re: [T2] Can a rear brake pull down one side of a 77  bus as

Have you replaced the rubber lines to the front calipers? One of mine 
"collapsed" (disintegrated inside) and became a check valve that allowed 
the brake to come on but would not allow it to release. If driven that 
side would get very hot b/c the caliper was stuck and it other side 
would lock up before the stuck side.

The fact that one of the rear brakes seems to be working more than the 
other indicates a problem. Might be as simple as shoes that need 
adjustment, might be hydraulic leaks coating the shoes or - and here is 
a rare one - I had a Fiat 131 where the front brakes did most of the 
work and the rears did little. It took a while but I found that the 
steel line was crimped shut after a collision with road debris. The rear 
brakes weren't getting any hydraulic pressure to amount to much.

Have you recently replaced the master cylinder? I noticed that something 
I read - Bentley? - called for bench bleeding the master the first time. 
Maybe it is air-bound?

Keep us updated!
