You know Chris has a real f'ing good idea there.  I bet the heat from the MIG
would damn near do it without welding anything onto it.  I think I'd hit the
nub with a file or grinding wheel and just try to MIG a bit of .035 wire onto
the nub and pull on it, could only break off of it.  Or if you got a friend
with one, perhaps (after heater box out of way) a stud welder stud onto it an
pull that with the stud welder slide hammer.  I bet sure as hell that would
work.

Can you MIG weld another piece of steel to the
nub? Then pull it out that way? Maybe MIG weld something to the nub and then
use the acid trick to loosen it up?
