Subject: Throttle Cable - Guide Tube Through Fan Housing

This is for a 71 bus, stock 1600 CC type 1 dual port engine.  The short (about
4 inches long, or so) tube that goes through the fan housing and guides the
throttle cable from the point where it exits the bus body, to the throttle arm
on the carburetor, keeps sliding out of the fan housing, to the point that it
rides against the throttle arm.  The tube gets misalinged and causes the cable
to bind slightly.  Is there something that is supposed to hold the guide tube
in the fan housing?  How would one get in there to work on it without pulling
the engine, or is pulling the engine a must to fix this? (would not make me
too unhappy, because I need to pull it to install a thermostat linkage
anyway)
