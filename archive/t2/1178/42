Subject: wiper parking position

I am on my 4th pull of the wiper assembly on my '73 campmobile and need a
little help.  The initial reason I pulled it was to try to fix slow wiper
action, little difference in speed between high and low, but otherwise
working normally.  I took everything apart, cleaned and lubed the shafts,
the ball joints, took apart the motor and cleaned and lightly lubed it.  Now
the wipers are still slow, which is OK, been like that for many years, but
the bigger issue for me is the wipers are failing to stop (park) in the
correct position.  If anyone has any experience with this issue help would
be greatly appreciated.

 

Thanks,

Tom
