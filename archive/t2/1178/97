Go here, be fulfilled. :-) More info that you want to know. Type in your paint code to their sheet and be amazed that they can offer it in different paints.

Seriously though, my friend used their acrylic enamel and was greatly pleased. Prices are awesome. Just watch out you use the proper mask for isocyanates if that is what you choose.

So what does a beginning car painter use? Epoxy, Urethane, or Acrylic?

 

Thanks for any advice. Oh Ya, money is an object!
