It can happen!! I suppose the other issue is that some coils with low
resistance are designed to run with an external resistor. They are wired to
get the battery voltage when starting and the voltage reduced via the resistor
when running. The idea is that the voltage is dropped anyway while starting so
during starting the coil gets the voltage it requires for normal running. In
comparison a non-resistor coil which will be getting less voltage than
required during starting. The bottom line is don't use a coil designed for an
external resistor without one!

To complicate things, some cars use a wire with higher resistance rather than
an obvious external resistor.

Clear as mud? First thing is to measure the coil resistance.

Martin.

Thanks for the reply. Unfortunately I let the smoke out of my Petronix unit a
couple weeks ago and had to revert to points temporarily.

Happy Trails,

Greg
