Subject: wiper parking position stumped

I have a '73 Campmobile that the wipers will not park in the correct
position.  Since I have been working on it all morning I have gotten it to
stop in a consistent place but that stopping point is in the middle of the
range that the wipers move in.  If the blades were positioned correctly in
the "park" position the next time they were turned on the wipers would go
off the windshield.  The park position is not at the end of the range of
motion but in the middle.  I hope I have explained my problem and someone
has had a  similar issue and can help.  The unit was working correctly until
I took it apart to lube and clean it up.  Thanks for any help,

Tom
