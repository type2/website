Subject: RE: [T2] wiper parking position

Thanks Neil but the position that it stops in is totally random.  The range
that the wipers work in is correct because if I relocated them they would go
off the windshield, thanks for your input.

I would think if you just took the wiper arms off.
Then turn the wipers on then off.
The motor should stop in the park position.
Then replace the wipers arms back on in the position you desired as the
stopped position then all would be good.
