Subject: Fwd: [T2] Main engine seal placement, 1600 CC, type 1 engine

OK, That's what I did ...... on both of my two engines.
They run really excellent in all other aspects......
......They both leak.

I used "new" Red seals vs. some I have in stock (older) which are black.

Are the newer available seals (red) less thick, softer, smaller spring, or
somehow, "different",  from what used to be sold.

Somethin' ain't right !

I was pretty meticulous in the install process both times.
Grrr  :(
