actually, you'll also need to, a good week in advance, drop the expire
times on each zone you care about down to the dirt...5-15 minutes or so is
usually good.

creates more overhead, but cuts down on
waiting-for-all-the-worlds-servers-to-catch-up time.

anyway.  no one still has any idea for the crash/restart that happened
about 2 hrs after you guys left verio the other night, and came back
up..oh..6-7pm EST yesterday?  no one pushed anything to make it come back?


the vendor is asking us to run http://www.teresaudio.com/memtest86/  this
on it...its a standalone floppybooting memory tester....along with the
powersupply obvious bit, we're having all sorts of coring going on.  I
asked for a loaner/replacement so they can have this back to work on,
they're asking us to run this and see what the results are....
