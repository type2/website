When I lived in Naples, Italy we would make day trips to the mountains east 
of Rome to ski (Abruzzi National Park).

My friends drove a wide variety of vehicles on these ski trips - a US spec 
Cavalier, a BMW, my 40 HP Super Beetle, a Tempo. I was sure that I wanted 
to be in a Beetle b/c none of the others had a chance of making it home if 
they broke down - except maybe the Bimmer.

("Ah - yes - I need an ignition module of a '89 Cavalier...."  The local 
Italian guy looks at you carefully and with a slightly cocked head - "Scusi?")

These friends knew it and always wanted me to go with the Beetle so 
SOMEBODY could get us home (I also at the time could speak better Italian).

We always stopped at the MP station we ran at the government housing 
facility north of the city to borrow a few sand bags - all ready for pickup 
anytime. I put them in the front but would move them to the back if we had 
traction problems (I needed better traction up front for brakes). Just a 
couple. Gave it a nice stance!

Added bonus was that you could spread the sand for a bit more traction too. 
Italian law required chains if the weather was bad enough. I had a set with 
round plastic hoops covering the chains that rested nearest the wheel. All 
you had to do was flex them open to go over the tire, drive forward, hook 
the latch,and lock them on. Easy! In some areas where a large # of cars 
were stopping to put on chains, there would be folks there that would do 
the job for you for a few thousand lira (few bucks). Wish I had kept those 
chains!

Damn that Beetle had good heat!
