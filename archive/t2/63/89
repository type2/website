Subject: Mounting a bumper

I just replaced the passenger side rear corner and batt. tray in my 75 
westy.  Only one problem left....  The part of the frame at the back where 
the bumper mount brackets bolt on is rotted.  the most rear hole is totally 
off and it looks like the 2nd hole up had been ripped when the bumper 
possibly fell off as a result of the rotting.  Here's my question. I've 
heard that the 68 to 72 bumper mounts are longer. and even on the later 
busses there's another hole tapped on both sides farther up than the back 2. 
  I'm wondering if this was done so that you could use either bracket?  
Could I use the older mounting brackets on a 75 bumper/bus? and if so, does 
anybody have a set they'd like to sell?  Thanx for all the help.  I'm trying 
to avoid any more welding if i can. but that will be plan B if i discover 
there's no alternative. take care guys
Increase the peace
