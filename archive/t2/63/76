illegal

This is false.  Logic games ("motorcycles don't have to have windscreens therefore cars do not") have nothing to do with the way motor vehicle codes (or other statutes) are written.  I've now been involved with criminal justice in three states and this wouldn't be legal in any of the three.  

Maybe your chances of actually getting stopped and issued a citation are slim.  Guess it depends on where you live.  Haven't we beaten this to death now?
