Subject: Re: [T2] Points Configurations

The best way to insure the proper points/condenser (You'll need both to
replace the wizbang trigger) is to use the stock distributor and order by
application (70 Bus). But this assumes your sure you have a stock dizzy. If
the dizzy is not stock, then you must order by Dizzy No. Typically, only
authorized Bosch jobbers have those lists. If your parts man will not talk
to his Bosch source with the dizzy no. in hand, find another parts seller.
It's the only way to get the right parts first time. Any parts personage
who doesn't know which parts fit the "universal" replacement 009 is simply
not VW oriented and should be avoided.
