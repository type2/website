Both these vehicles are in Germany.  As I see a lot of interest in the double 
cab, I would say that purchase price and shipping to the states are less than 
most of you would pay for the like vehicle down the road from "hometown 
anywhere USA."  Only serious inquiries need email as time is as precious as 
the cargo you'd be hauling if you'd bought this vehicle.
