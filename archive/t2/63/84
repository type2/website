George:
I think it is called a cape chisel. It works better if you can take a hacksaw
blade and cut nearly all the way through the inner object first.
Oops! the race is hardened! Use a Dremel and GRIND through it first.
OTOH, I have never had a pilot bearing fail to come out with the grease and
input shaft method.
I use a VW input shaft (Main shaft rear piece) and fill the cavity with
grease from a grease gun. A 32 oz. hammer, GLOVES on both hands in case you
miss (I've got the scars to prove it happens!), and swing away hard. Once it
moves, you'll have to add more grease. A 32 oz. hammer will move as much as a
10,000 lb press. A great deal of this shock energy is lost due to the
squeezing  of the bubbles, but that bearing is not really stuck in there very
tight! Nothing compared to how tight bearings are pressed inside
transmissions or even the timing gear on the crankshaft.
