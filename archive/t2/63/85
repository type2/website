Subject: Points Configurations

OK,
Here is an ongoing confusion on my part..........
(1970 Bus, 1600 SP engine as manufactured in November of 1969)

AA)
Let's say I go to order a set of spare points just to have on hand for my 
Vac advance dizzy  in the event that my Compufire module fails on the road.
BB)
Also, I want to order a set of points for the spare .009 that I also keep 
stashed in my spares box in the event of a "total" dizzy failure on the 
part of the Vac advance installation.

Here is the specific problem that concerns me...........
I keep seeing/getting points where the wire comes off of the point set in 
the wrong direction.

CC)
I do not want a point set where the connected wire on the set departs with 
an orientation towards the spring coil/stud area.
DD)
I want a point set where the connected wire departs and is oriented towards 
the adjustment slot and the actual points themselves.

Just for visual reference to see what I am trying to explain........
What I want is illustrated in the far left hand upper corner of page 94 of 
the latest RMMW Christmas catalog.

When I order points over the phone or via Internet, how do I specify the 
correct part number so as to ensure proper wire departure orientation?
