Hi,

When I posted last weekend about the new to me 68 Adventurewagen a 
nice fellow from Canada sent me some pics of his 1970 A-wagen. The 
pics were cool and set me on a quest to collect pictures of 
Adventurewagens. If you have a A-wagen or pics of one you took at a 
show or know the whereabouts of some on the web send them to me or 
let me know where I can find them

Thanks
Chris
