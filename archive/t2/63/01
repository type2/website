The purpose of points, in very simple terms (the only way I can understand it), 
is to pass a signal to the coil telling it when to sent the Big Bang to be 
distributed to the spark plugs.  So as far as I know, any way that can be 
accomplished is OK by the vehicle.

The standards "points" system does this by creating an open condition everytime 
the 4-sided lobe on the distributor shaft forces the points to break contact.  
The Pertronix does it with by placing a "donut" on the dist shaft that has 4 
evenly spaced magnets imbedded in it along with a magnetic pickup that is 
fastened where the points module used to go.  Each time one of these magnets in 
the donut passes the magnetic pickup it creates the same open condition.

So the direct answer to your question is that the Pertronix can be used to 
replace points regardless of what type of fuel system you are using.
