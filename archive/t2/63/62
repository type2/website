Subject: Re: [T2] replacing windsheld and rubber together?

FWIW, I had a customer in a sedan that did this, and the lack of hood
pressure allowed his hood to fly up, ruining his new $3K paint job (he
hadn't put ANYTHING on the car yet, even a hood latch). Not an issue on a
T2, but anything else, watch it!
