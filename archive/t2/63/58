Real good.  This is a common tire circumference.  Look on the box, but definitely test them before you hit the snow.

Never seen it happen.  And folks around here run them all the time.  The key is to ensure that you have all the slack taken up, with a bungie cord type device (preferably the special made deal that comes with the chain sets.)  YOU CAN THROW A CHAIN IF YOU LEAVE TOO MUCH SLACK, DRIVE TOO FAST, OR DRIVE ON DRY ROAD.  Don't do any of these.  Take them off as soon as you can.

Ditto in a big way.

Don't agree.  It's easy to put them on, assuming you are not stuck already.  Drape them over the rear tires, then pull forward a bit.  That reach to the back lever-thingie is rough, but certainly not harder than changing a tire.  

>Many folks prefer cable chains to "real" chains.  They run a lot smoother

Never tried them.  If you use chains properly and only when necessary, I'm not sure what advantage these would have.  

Good luck,
