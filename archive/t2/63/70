Solving that problem.  Which is another reason why I need aux heat. And
those squirrel cage blowers do nothing except at idle.  The engine fan
overpowers those blowers as soon as it is moving.  If you want real power
install a bilge blower midstream.  which I have.  And for everyone that
knows me I really like it warm...
