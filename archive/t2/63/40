Subject: Follow-up: No Brake lights - '78

Day 2 -

After some great suggestions, I decided to do the 'brick' trouble shooting 
when I got home yesterday evening.

Except I used a heavy cinder block (you know, the kind you use instead of 
jack stands) vice a brick (brick still functions as a secondary [OK, 
PRIMARY] emergency brake when parked on a hill sans curb).

It seems that my brake light comes on ONLY after I get a bit of resistance 
when pushing down on the pedal, and it is NOT directly related to the actual 
movement of the brake pedal.

This morning, with an observer calling out from the rear, I confirmed my 
brake lights do come on.

Now, here is the 'hint from Heloise':  Pull the emergency brake handle out 
to the first click, and the 'B' light will come on.  While the 'B' light is 
on, depress the brake pedal and when the brake lights come on, the 'B' light 
will flicker slightly.  This can conveniently be done while driving, to get 
an idea when you are flashing your brake lights. Remember to maintain an 
adequate supply of bricks as your brake pads/shoes wear down.

Thanks for all the responses,  I recommend H Steven Dolan's for the academy 
award for troubleshooting.
