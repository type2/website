Subject: No Go SnOw

Two years ago, after large snow fall Northern Virginia, I could not get the 
'78 up a slight incline/hill in front of the house.  The rear tires (very 
good snow thread) kept spinning in the deep snow (since the front tires were 
NOT spinning in the snow, I considered swapping tires, front to rear . . . 
<a little humor, people >).

My neighbor, a certified rocket scientist (designs payloads for NASA in 
Maryland) said I needed more weight over the tires (yeah, right, with my 
engine and trans in the rear!!).

I opened the back window hatch, and he and my son stood on the back bumper, 
while holding on to the '78 Westy thru the open back window hatch.

I drove up the incline at 5 MPH (8 KPH for those of you in the euro world) 
smooth as could be!!  Just that extra 350 lbs ( 350/2.2 kg for those of you 
in the euro world.  It is still a bit early in the AM here) at the rear was 
the answer.

So I wonder, if I was stuck in the wilderness by myself, how could I have 
made that weight adjustment to the rear??  If I stashed some large plastic 
bags in the Westy, I could shovel some SnOw into the bags, and into the rear 
compartment.  Water wise, it would take about 350/8 gallon jugs to make up 
for the weight ( ____ liters for . . .) if I waited for the SnOw to melt!!

Also -

I had a '90 Acura that would NOT go up a particular hill in the snow.  It 
was front wheel drive, and the front end kept losing traction as it was 
higher than the rear while inclined.  I simply backed down the hill, turned 
the Acura around and went up the hill backwards, as pretty as you please!!!  
(Gosh, I hope this bright idea does not convince me to try that stunt in the 
'78 Westy!!)

PS.  Prepare for this eventuality.
(1) If not snow shovel, keep a dust pan in the VW for digging out.
(2) recycle some of that kitty litter and keep a supply in the VW.  At least 
it WILL keep the rodents out!!
(3) add extra weight at the rear in metric terms, since 1 kg is generally 
heavier than 1 lb.  At least in Virginia it is.
(4) Make sure you carry an extra fan belt.  I don't know how this will help, 
but everyone keeps telling me to do this, so I guess it would be more 
important in the winter, when you could get stuck in the SnOw.
