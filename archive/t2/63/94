I don't know from whence you gather that.  Fire your gatherers.   Never said "all vehicles must have windshields."   If given a ticket here in one of my courtrooms, you'd lose your case with the defense "motorcycles don't have them, so I don't have to either."   In my state, one of the correct charges would be defective equipment, you are correct.
