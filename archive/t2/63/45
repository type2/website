Subject: Hooray for our ISP / Back-Up Light Needs Home

Hooray for keen and especially hooray for the excellent folks at ISP
ATLASTA.NET, who have bent over backwards for us once again. Try to find a
co-loc where the staff will drive out to the NOC multiple times to look at
your outage, and scrounge up a power supply to keep you running while you
get a new one; service like this is simply unheard of in the co-location
business. If you need a hosting provider you could not do better than these
guys.

I was cleaning up some of the vast graveyard of used Mac bits and carcasses
here, which means I was coming across some VW stuff, because it's all mixed
up together. This is logical if you are me. =^ )

Free to a good home, one clear glass early Bay reverse light by Hella,
uncracked, slight haze inside, also one stainless bezel. You can't sell it
or stash it, you have to put it on your bus. Pmail only, if you reply to the
list you aren't getting it.
