Uhh...Victor...you seem to have missed the point here.

Alcohol flames are invisible. Not only can't you see them, neither can the
fire department. Which means that a small fuel-only fire that would have
been easily contained may become a fuel-plus-Bus fire before you realize
there's any fire at all back there.

One other problem in alcohol-burning vehicles: alcohol has fewer BTUs per
gallon than does gasoline. IIRC, it's 90,000 BTUs for alcohol and 150,000
for gas. You will therefore need more alcohol than gasoline to go the same
distance.
