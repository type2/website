The key is to ensure that you have all the slack taken up, with a bungie
cord type device (preferably the special made deal that comes with the
chain sets.)  YOU CAN THROW A CHAIN IF YOU LEAVE TOO MUCH SLACK, DRIVE
TOO FAST, OR DRIVE ON DRY ROAD.  Don't do any of these.  Take them off as
soon as you can.

I'll second that.  Another cause of fender flogging is trying to get too
much wear out of the chains.  Every time you remove them you should check
all the links for cracks and replace any cross-chains that are cracked.
Buy a few cross-chains for spares, and the chain pliars to put them in
place.  Always keep your chains in the snow, even if it means driving in
the snow with a dry lane next to you.  The CHP sometimes makes this
difficult by putting chain controls miles before the snow.

I put two rubber bungee gadgets on each chain.  That way if one breaks the
other will still be there

changing a tire.

I guess it depends upon how well equipped you are to change tires.  If you
have a good jack and a healthy cross-wrench it can be done in about a
minute per side.  I don't think I can put a chain on, adjust it, wire the
extra links back, and put on the stretechers that fast even in my
driveway, let alone on the hill.  I hate to do detail work like adjusting
chains when I'm freezing and the lug nuts are usually warm and dry!

They are more tolerant of driving on dry pavement, which you sometimes
have to do in states like California.  They also don't thrash your
wheelwells as badly if a cross-link breaks.
