Subject: Re: [VB] Mt. Shast Snow Trip  <Tire chain advice>

Which brings up a question. I never ever have had to
have snow chains, but I want to join in on this trip
because there wont be any lowered buses there. If I
were to pick up some chains at a garage sale what are
the chances that they will fit my 205/70/15's ? Do
chains very in saize too much to hope they will fit.
And what are the chances of throwing a chain into the
unshiney orig paint on my kombi? Anyone else planning
on going, I know the only list member that went last
year was Gene, and he is not currently on the list.
