IF all else fails, you can take a chisel and cut the pilot bearing
lengthwise.  I have a special chisel that is cut with a rake angle for
just this purpose.  You just hook the edge of the bearing and whack away
at it until it bends toward the center of the hole, then pull it out with
pliars.

I'd prefer a gentler method, but sometimes you just have to whack it!
