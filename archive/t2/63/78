So from what I have gathered---a Jeep  with the windshield folded down
would be illegal to drive?

Nay, Nay----

I'm think the legalities start with what the vehicle came originally
equipt with----
and if it came with one, that's what's supposed to be there, and the
citations would start with a saftey issue----

Later,

The good news is that driving without a windshield is almost *never*
illegal 
This is false. Logic games ("motorcycles don't have to have windscreens
therefore cars do not") have nothing to do with the way motor vehicle
codes (or other statutes) are written. I've now been involved with
criminal justice in three states and this wouldn't be legal in any of
the three. 
Maybe your chances of actually getting stopped and issued a citation are
slim. Guess it depends on where you live. Haven't we beaten this to
death now?
