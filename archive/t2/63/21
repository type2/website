Subject: Re: [T2] replacing windsheld and rubber together?

I have seen nice restorations with new glass. A nice touch. You won't know 
how bad the original glass was until you see new glass. 20 years of dust 
and grime and grit - rubbed in with the wipers.

If you don't decide to put new glass in - it will just cost you a new seal 
later (and maybe labor if you don't do it yourself).

My wife and I installed our windshield (old one) in the driveway with 
silicone spray lube and string. We also repaired the rust in the driveway 
with sandpaper, metal impregnated body filler, and primer (I had somebody 
else paint it).
