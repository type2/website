goggles/glasses, for legalities and safeties sake!

I've argued that the "Brookland's windscreens" on my Bugeye were a
replacement for the missing windshield, but the officer disagreed and
wanted to see the inspection sticker. Don't know about "your" state,
but it's illegal in NJ to do anything that makes the sticker not read-
ily viewable i.e. removing the windshield. At least that's what the po-
lice officer told me. I suspect that if you are carrying the replacement
or new glass with you you might get around this, but the law's the law
