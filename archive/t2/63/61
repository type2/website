Subject: Re: [T2] replacing windsheld and rubber together?

I had to drive my bus home from my buddies house about 10 miles in 5'oclock
traffic after we took the glass out. We had to wait for the primer to dry
and it was too late in the day to paint. It was funny to see the the double
takes people took when they looked at the bus and there was no windshield.

I froze driving back the next morning to put the windshield back in. Didn't
see any officers on the way.
