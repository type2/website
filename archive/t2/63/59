Absolutely correct, Barry.  The lights are controled by two pressure-
sensative switches mounted on the master cylinder.  You need a bit of
pressure on the fluid in the MC to activate them.  Should not be more than
a brick or two will supply, tho.

Barry,

(Semi-)bad news... this works fine on your '78, but this is not true of
all years.  I am not sure when the changes occured, but VW used three
different mechanisms to test the filament in the "B" lamp.  The three
options, depending on year/model are:

the "B" lamp lights when you press on it;
the "B" lamp lights when you put the key in the "start" position;
the "B" lamp lights when you apply the parking brake.

I know for certain that the first procedure was used on my '71 Super
Beetle, the second was used on my '73, and the third was used on my '78.
