Subject: Buses Of The Corn, Selwyn Beach Conservation Area, August

As of today, BOTC has negotiated a new site: (cue the drum roll)

Selwyn Beach Conservation Area. It's located just east of  
Peterborough, Ontario
on the east shore of Chemong Lake.

The family-friendly event will be held August 9th-11th. Event costs will
be $20/bus plus the camping fee of $5 per person per night.

Facilities are about as rustic as Heber Down, but campers will be allowed to
use the showers at nearby Beavermead or Warsaw Caves campgrounds if we wish.
But now there is a beach!

Happy Trails,
