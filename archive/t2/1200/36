Subject: Securing Pedal Pan on '69

I've got to put my pedal pan back on my '69 singlecab. One of the bolts
snapped off inside the frame, and none of the others seems right. How were
these originally attached? I.e. what size/type of screw, and is there
supposed to be some sort of speed nut clipped to the frame?
