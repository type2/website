Subject: Re: [T2] Drifting a VW

Robert, that's the least of his worries.  Rolling the body over is the 
scariest thing.  I've thought sure that mine would tip over on several 
occasions. Especially driving in high wind across Chickamauga Dam.  
Google that.  The wind is usually always perpendicular to the road. 
Sometimes it feels like it'll knock you right over the side. Aside from 
that, I no longer have interest in pushing the limits of most anything.  
Lesson learned over and over throughout the years.  In many vehicles.  
Almost killed me several times.  :) Lucky to be alive.....KR
