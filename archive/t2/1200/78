Subject: 2nd battery for westfalia & Fridge indicator light

So I've got my '78 westy out in CA. my wife and are planning a mini-trip to
Big Sur this weekend. The 2nd battery that the PO installed was not a
deep-cycle battery. It also appears to not be taking a charge. He said he
didn't really use it, so he didn't bother putting a deep cycle battery in. 

 

I went to a FLAPS here, and tried to get a Deep Cycle battery. The smallest
one they had was too tall to fit. This battery is located on the driver's
side engine compartment, opposite the regular battery. 

 

What have you guys used for this spot? Ie do you know a brand battery that
will fit? 

 

Also someone in the history of using the bus swapped the fridge indicator
light with a rocker switch that is supposed to light up. It does not. I want
to replace this, and have tried a couple electric supply houses around
here-without any luck. I've seen some online, but can't quite tell if they
are the right size, and they don' list the measurements. Have any of you
replaced this-know where to get one?

 

Thanks for any tips
