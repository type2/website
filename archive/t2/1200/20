My recommendation is to look around for caravan/campervan/RV tanks. Most are
too big for our purposes but there are some small ones out there. Here is one
in Australia which would meet your requirements. I'm sure they are available
elsewhere!

Not sure exactly what you mean by cutting and rewelding the heater tube? I
have heard of several on The Samba who have split their systems so one side
supplies the rear of the van and the other the front. Is this what you had in
mind?
