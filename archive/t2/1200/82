Subject: Optima Batteries for 2nd battery

Well a quick check of the optima options, from their website. There is a
D34M (the D stands for Deep cycle as far as I can tell. The say not to use
the regular 34M for deep cycle stuff. I'll see if anyone around here has
that. 

 

Forgot to respond to the idea of a putting together my own battery
pak.although that sounds like an interesting project, I don't foresee time
to do that. ;)
