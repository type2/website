Yes, I had the same trouble with my front shocks. I would use an angle 
grinder (die grinder) to cut the metal loop that encircles the rubber 
bushing. Cut it on both sides and it'll fall off revealing the old 
rubber bushing. Then use a hacksaw to cut the bushing on both sides 
(inline with the bolt) and peel it off the bolt/pin/dowel. Clean it up 
with a wire brush and paint it.

Easier than trying to remove the dowel/pin/bolt and your old shocks 
probably need to be replaced anyhow.

If you need more detail, let me know.
