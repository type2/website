When we got the 78 back in 1986 I got out the sledge hammer and "moved" 
up the spare tire well enough to fit the battery- don't have one in 
there now, so I don't know the size.  Also, side post batteries will 
take less height. We went to LED lights inside, and use a cooler and 
small flatscreen DVD/TV player, so electric demands are low.  Unless you 
can drive enough to recharge the battery back to 12.7 after 2 hr 
resting, consider hookups at a campground every other day or so to 
properly charge it up with a 3 stage charger.  Since these are really 
annoying to check as a wet cell battery, consider the AGM, RV owners 
swear by them....Also, the wiring used to hook the bateries together 
should be larger than I usually see with those light relays- it will 
take too long to recharge.

I went to a FLAPS here, and tried to get a Deep Cycle battery. The 
smallest one they had was too tall to fit. This battery is located on 
the driver's side engine compartment, opposite the regular battery.
What have you guys used for this spot? Ie do you know a brand battery that
will fit?
