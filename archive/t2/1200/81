Subject: re:2nd battery for Westfalia & Fridge indicator light

I can appreciate the idea of tapping the spare tire to fit a battery, but I
don't think I want to go that route yet. A side post is a great idea I had
not thought of. Do you power your DVD/TV player off the battery? I don't
plan on using anything like that, but may plug in cell phone chargers when
parked. 

 

As for the charging relay - a previous owner installed a Blue Sea Systems
auto-charging relay, which sounds like a good unit. Is this what you mean by
a more exotic isolator?  Although I have not had time to trace all the lines
to understand exactly what is powering what. Anyone else using one of these
relays?

 

The fridge is a primary concern right now-but eventually I'd like to make
sure all the electrical is running off the 2nd battery when the bus is
parked. I'm planning on switching all the interior bulbs to LED. It was
recommended to me ( and I think it says so in the Westy manual) to plug the
bus to a land line (aka 120 V) overnight to get the fridge nice and cold.
Then when driving, the engine should be able to provide enough juice to keep
it cold, then at camp ground plug it in again. 

 

As far as the optima - I'll look at the different options. The battery that
is currently installed is 7.75" high. It fits, but anything bigger would
probably not fit, unless I can get a side post battery.
