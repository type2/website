Yep - I have a little horde of parts that I figure I won't be able to 
get as cheaply as holding on to the ones i already have. Remember when 
spare Type IV engine blocks were a dime a dozen?

That stuff was never common where I live so I have a couple of spare 
longblocks and a few boxes of odds and ends.

Not hoarding as seen on TV but a couple of VW van loads - the flat floor 
portion inside the sliding door. I knew I better save whatever I thought 
I might need when the local VW junkyard the next county over lectured me 
about how rare cooling tin screws were... No, I can buy them all day 
long but HE thinks they are rare so his parts have been gold plated for 
a decade. ;)

Then there is the Type IV longblock that an acquaintance purchased from 
that junkyard that was locked up and glued together (epoxy?). He never 
could separate the case halves. Somehow that was worth $175. I warned 
the acquaintance... ;)
