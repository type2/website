Subject: Re: [T2] Replacing torsion arms

Yeah Bob makes a point there, I was presuming that the OP had looked carefully
considering he had ordered the springs and arms.  But Bob is right you got to
look VERY carefully, poke around with a sharp thing, at the pivot mount, and
in the shock pillars, under the grease and dirt (which counterintuitively just
soak up and collect water.)
 
Dolan's article was actually a beam swap article
on the dread '73 to a new Bus Depot SA beam, but covered the arm swap
obviously, and I think we swapped the upper spring as well at the time. 
Wonder what happened to that bus, somebody should of hauled it off for the new
beam.
 
Wherever you are Steve, you are still a worthless PITA....   and one
of my best friends.

I at this point took  a
close look at my torsion tubes and didn't like what I saw and just bought a
complete assembly from "BUSTED BUS" shipping was crazy but just bolted the
entire front end onto the front of the bus. I replaced ALL of the brake parts
at the same time, probably was faster than just the ball joint part would have
been.
