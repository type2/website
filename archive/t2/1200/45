Subject: KONI Shocks for 68-71 Bus Now Available!

Just a quick note that I have obtained a VERY small supply of the long
discontinued Koni Red shocks for the front of a 1968-69 Bus. Those who have
been on the List a while may recall that Richard Atwell and I arranged a
Type 2 List group buy of the '70-up fronts and rears several years ago, but
at the time Koni was unwilling to do the '68-69 ones. Well it took 8 years
(!!!!), but they finally put together a few of them for us. I only have 20
pair on hand and AFAIK that will be the end of them. (Or maybe for another 8
years anyway. :-)

The Koni's are universally regarded as the best shocks ever made for the
Volkswagen Bus, and are warranted for life by Koni.  They are not cheap but
they are the best and last shocks you will ever buy for your Bus. You can
read all the glowing reviews at http://www.ratwell.com/technical/Koni.html ,
<http://www.thesamba.com/vw/forum/viewtopic.php?t=206625&highlight=koni>
(and the three threads linked from the first post of that thread), or the
Type 2 List archives.

I also got 25 pair of the '68-71 rears.  While the '72-79 rears do just fine
on a '68-71, for those who want perfection these ones were designed
specifically for the earlier Bus and are valved and sized slightly
differently. They too have not been available in a couple of decades, and I
don't expect to see them again once the 25 pair are gone.
