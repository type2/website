Subject: Westy Extension Cord - power and water

So, my wife and I have planned a mini trip with our new westy near the end
of the month. We are planning on going down to Big Sur to sort of test out
driving a new pop-top and camping in it.

 

One thing I was wondering-the option to plug the bus in at a camp ground.
I've never had a bus with that option before. What length cord is generally
sufficient? I know this is sort of open-ended, and I could get any length,
and that are a lot of factors involved.but based on those with westy's that
you plug in, what length cord did you bring with you? Is 25' usually long
enough for most campgrounds? Also what length hose for the sink hook up? Or
do you guys find that you never really hook up that hose?

 

Also-if I plug my bus in, does that just run the refrigerator and interior
outlet, or does it power all the 12V stuff inside the bus? Ie cigarette
lighter outlet, and interior lights?

 

Thanks in advance..
