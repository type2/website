corner. unfortunately had to clean the seat my companion was riding on

couldn't agree more, many years ago I took my old VW (buggie) to a skid 
pad and learned to drift and other "manuvers" in my own vehicle..  couple 
years later a large truck blew a stop sign crossing right in front of me, 
reactions and practice allowed me to slide right past him,    about 20 
years ago my 78 bus was "Clipped" by a tractor trailer when the driver 
fell asleep and came over on me.  I did two, 180 degree spins in oppisite 
directions and only hit the guard rail when on the third 180 degree turn I 
just couldn't spin the steering wheel fast enough to hang onto it, no time 
to think, practice and reactions.  but didn't go over an embankment or 
roll so if one can get a chance to learn the sliding skills and practice 
do so.
