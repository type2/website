Subject: Re: [T2] Securing Pedal Pan on '69

On my '71 there are several bolts that go around the pedal pan. There are
slight "u" shaped slots in the pan that slide next to the bolts. The bolt
heads simply secure down at these locations. I think they are 13mm bolts. I
would drill out the bolt that snapped so you can use that location again.
