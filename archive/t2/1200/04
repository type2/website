Subject: Re: [T2] RE Stealing a VW bus

I bought a cheap little air compressor and left it accessible to
the neighborhood kids to air up tires and balls.  I got tired one day of
opening the garage over and over to fire up the big compressor.  Now its
self serve!  If someone takes it I guess I'm out $25 but its already paid
for itself in letting me nap :-).
