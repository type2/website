Subject: RE:Camper Fresh Water Tank Options

Not sure about what would work-but I replaced the tank on my '65 split with
a 7 gallon from this place - plastic-mart.com

 

It took a bit of searching their site, but I was  able to find a tank that
was pretty close to the dimensions I was looking for, they will put the
holes wherever you want. (drain, fill holes) You could even add a large
access hole for cleaning?
