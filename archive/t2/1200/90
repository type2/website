Hey Monty
if you want a full "length" bed,, it is around 9ft from the back of the 
front seats, to the rear of the bus...   ;-)

if you are doing a full "width" bed... it is around 54" from the archives

the foam is
18.5 x 54 x 3  seat
21    x 54 x 3  seatthat is.. if you are putting the arm rests on the side 
like the stock westfalia.. other wise. you might make it a bit wider.
