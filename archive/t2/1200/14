Subject: Camper Fresh Water Tank Options

Does anyone have any recommendations for under body water tank options? Due
to limited space, i am looking to mount a water tank underneath the bus,
has anyone ever done this?

I have a 1971 (bay window)

dimensions:
preferably 6" deep, but possibly up to 8" (although would reduce my ground
clearance a bit)
13" wide
24- 46" long

I am also thinking about cutting the heater tube out and rewelding (with a
fan) so it goes to one side or the other.

Thoughts?
