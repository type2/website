I at this point took  a close look at my torsion tubes and didn't like 
what I saw and just bought a complete assembly from "BUSTED BUS" shipping 
was crazy but just bolted the entire front end onto the front of the bus. 
I replaced ALL of the brake parts at the same time, probably was faster 
than just the ball joint part would have been.

YMMV
