There is no benefit on front wheel drive on a T2.  The you already have the
advantage of having the weight on the drive wheels (real engine / rear
wheel drive).  Going 4-wheel drive would be sweet, and I've seen at least
one conversion.

BTW, these buses are already great going off-road.  Check out any of the
dozens of youtube videos, including the Shasta Snow Trip (with splitties no
less).  Here is one of a river crossing:

Also, there is an optional limited slip differential.
