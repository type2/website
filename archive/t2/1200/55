Subject: Replacing torsion arms

Hey,

I am going to be replacing the torsion arms and ball joints (the only from Bus
Boys) hopefully next weekend in my 69 Westy. I have never done this before,
anything else I should replace while I have everything apart? And more
importantly anything I need to know about doing this on jack stands in my
garage?

Clear Skies,

Brian Eney
