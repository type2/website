Subject: RE: [T2] Securing Pedal Pan on '69

Thanks to all for the tips on the bolt sizing. I got a few at the hardware
store - unfortunately even a size 14 sheet metal screw does not really grab
tightly.so I ordered some size 17 online from McMaster.

 

I was able to use a few 13mm bolts where there is a threaded connection. One
of the original bolts snapped off, so I'm trying to drill that out
carefully. I'll be using some anti-seize on the new stuff.

 

I've also discovered some other stuff that needs work up front.this never
seems to end. ;)

On my '71 there are several bolts that go around the pedal pan. There are
slight "u" shaped slots in the pan that slide next to the bolts. The bolt
heads simply secure down at these locations. I think they are 13mm bolts. I
would drill out the bolt that snapped so you can use that location again.
