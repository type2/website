I got some from the first batch for my 78
and they are amazing.
and lifetime warranty too.
(how do I drive while they are serviced?)
fortunately they have been trouble free since I dialed them in

all I can say
is do not pass go
do not collect $200
go directly to your phone and buy them.

do you think I am satisfied with the shocks.
price back then was outrageous and took up several months of my bus 
budget.

but worth every cent.
