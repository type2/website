Got a cool event coming up in edmonds that would be cool to get a good
turnout at. basically, a semi pro soccer team wants to feature some cool
old vws, yes vanagons too, before the game. they wanna throw a BBQ and
tailgating party before the game. would anyone be interested in joining in
this? if so, please pick on of the two dates, june 28, or july 12, so i can
give him a day to plan for.

Thanks
Stuart

ok, I have two choices -

Friday, June 28 (-at-) 7:30 v. Kitsap Pumas (Bremerton and 2011 national PDL
champions)
Friday, July 12 (-at-) 7:30 v. Washington Crossfire (Redmonds-base)

Once y'all decide, we'll plan the event and check on any required permits,
etc.  While having you and your 'vintages' outside and around the stadium,
please know that we want you to be part of the game crowd and enjoy the
heck out of the game.  We'll do a press release that gets picked-up by most
media outlets.  If you guys can do an e-blast to your community about
attending, we'll be good.  Thanks.

Jim
