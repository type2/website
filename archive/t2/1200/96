Subject: re:Optima Batteries for 2nd battery

Well this optima bashing has given me some pause on getting one.so I'm going
to go this trip without it. I'll do a bit more research-and study my wiring
system a bit more. 

 

I looked at the converter adaptor or whatever the device that turns the AC
in to DC to charge the battery/run the fridge. It looks to be rated at only
13.4 V at 15 amps when plugged in to AC. That does not appear to be enough
to charge the Optima batteries anyway.

 

I think I need at least 13.8 for it to charge the battery. 

 

No more time right now.but will continue the investigation.and report back. 

 

Thanks.any more tips/info appreciated.
