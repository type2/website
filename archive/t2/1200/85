Subject: Re: [T2] Optima Batteries for 2nd battery

I have never seen a side-terminal deep cycle battery, but you could make your own by turning an Optima battery sideways.  They are able to be used in that orientation.

That said, I would not buy an Optima anymore.  They have gotten quite expensive, are not space-optimized due to their cylindrical cells AND in the past 15 years or so their weight has silently decreased from 45lbs to about 35lbs (Red Top), which tells me that they do not have the lead content that they used to.  Instead, check out Marine supply and sporting goods stores such as Cabelas and Bass Pro.  They sell rectangular SLA batteries in various sizes which I believe were a better value than the Optimas, last time I looked.  No, they are not as pretty.

Well a quick check of the optima options, from their website. There is a
D34M (the D stands for Deep cycle as far as I can tell. The say not to use
the regular 34M for deep cycle stuff. I'll see if anyone around here has
that.
