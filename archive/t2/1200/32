Reminds me of our looking over Nyssa's 75 bus last week after it sat 4 
months because of hesitation problems/lack of power-thought it may be 
gas tank blockage and yanked sender to look into tank-hole must be cut 
large enough to the side to see into baffle box- looked good with some 
rust bloom on bottom. Gas back in, fuel pressure good, ..idled great. 
So we took it for a test drive ..nada power on our hill we must climb to 
get to town, it did not hesitate but just did not respond and I had to 
back it into a driveway where it stalled and did not start, so we pushed 
it onto the hill and rolled down trying to jump it- started and we took 
it home.  *#&%$&^$#   Did a compression test, good, 140 to 125, spark ok 
on each plug, but they looked "wet" or darkly stained, not oil fouled. 
Started fine cold, timing/advance ok.  Timidly took if for another test, 
is fine now!  Daughter says, "What did you fix?"...I said, "I don't 
kmow!"   She is not very confidant but has taken it to work twice.
..idled grea
