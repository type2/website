	Snow in my benign sub-tropical climate is
almost as rare as the fabled rocking-horse sh*t
which became the standard citation for rarity
among tradesmen 35 y ago >:-}
	But NZ has a few  -  far too few  -
skid-pans, carefully horizontal so that an inch
or so of water can be spread  ...  that will do.
I would require the license test to include safe
skidding on such a pan.

	They have now degenerated into studied
raving idiots, spewing blatant falsehoods.  Peh
nv attenszionsz  ...
	if anyone of any credibility had said the
Prius II is easy to get skidding, I'd be jammed
in cognitive dissonance as I wrestled with the
challenge to my hoon reputation.  As it is, I
merely record that cornering faster than anyone
I've noticed induces little tyre-squealing, let
alone skidding.  This means either that the
modest weight of the Prius II is suitably served
by 165/60R15 (with modern sticky compounds) or
that I have lost much of my hoonishness of youth
:-/.

	Renault 10 on 155 R 15 was a champion
drifter.  A friend of mine on his R10 with the
original 145 x 15 did a time Auckland-Taupo (c.
200 mi) unmatched by many more powerful cars with
fatter tyres; that could be achieved only by v
fast cornering.

	What I hadn't grasped till recently is
the strong influence of temperature, affecting
both road surface and tyre stickiness.  Also v
important is the recent trend to soft rubber
compounds which (esp if warmed up) grip the road
far better than the old hard compounds (at the
price of wearing out several times faster).  The
manner of 'letting go' (beginning to skid) varies
across that spectrum.
	Any Bay driver who finds himself pressed
to drive as fast as possible thru curves should
'warm up' not only the tyres but also the mind.
Settle into concentrating on the race, if a race
is forced upon you; don't suddenly go much faster
than you previously have done.  Rear skidding
will emerge, gently; discover how much 'R for L &
v-v' counter-steering will correct the tendency
to spin; then take the successive curves slightly
faster and see whether you can drift.  I admit it
is a bit of a thrill, but it can sometimes be
rationalised by a genuine reason for speed  ...
:-[
	The only justification for this is, as
I've said, to be ready for a later emergency in
which you are forced suddenly to corner so fast
that skidding is inevitable.  You had better have
had some practice before that event!
