Shiny metal is a ground wires best friend.

I knew a guy with a Lotus Elan with
constant electrical problems (The
Lotus is almost all fiberglass and
fragile as a wineglass) He solved the
problems with a copper grounding rod
running fore and aft under the car and
running the grounds (earths, it's a Lotus)
to the copper rod...
