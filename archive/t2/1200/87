I'm with David on this.   I had two die (internally shorted one of the 
cells) inside the warranty periods in the past 2 years.

Both were in-service for less than 1 year (one sat on the shelf for a 
while the bus was offline before going into service..)

The first was from before they dropped the pro-rate period warranty, the 
second was after (so only 36 month warranty these days btw!).   The 
pro-rated battery was 3 months into the 36 month pro-rate period and they 
wanted $260 to replace a battery I could buy that day from them for 
$191...   That got replaced with an exide, instead (Exide Orbital 
ORB75DT-108 specifically, so far 11 months in and it's working great in my 
'66)


the other, which was still inside the 36 month (it was only 7 months from 
purchase when I bought it that it died, it took 5 months to get it 
replaced..november to april), they did finally straight swap.   It's been 
sitting disconnected since then since we haven't been able to take the 
track car to the track...



Anyway - optima/interstate was remarkably difficult to deal with on these, 
fwiw, and have pretty much lost my business for good.   I'd hoped the 
rumors were wrong, but my experience was otherwise. :(
