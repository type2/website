Yep, I've done some pretty big slides in my '65 Beetle and my '78 Westy 
too. The beetle had a worn king pin bushing and was twitchy on wet 
roads. Italy (where I was living at the time) had alot of marble mixed 
into the asphalt (so we were told) so the roads were slick when first 
wet - more so than here. I think it was as much the amount of oil on the 
roads from the pre-sealed crankcase engines still commonly running 
around back then.

The bus is better in the snow than the Beetle in my opinion. I've done a 
180 a few times at low speeds but it was due to my stupidity and hooning 
than anything else. Yeah - a rollover waiting to happen.

As much as I love our aircooled VWs - I respect their shortcomings 
carefully. ;) Wish there was more 35 traffic where I live and less 50+ 
mph traffic i.e. more like village traffic rather than suburban America 
traffic.
