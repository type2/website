Subject: Re: [T2] re:Optima Batteries for 2nd battery

Wow, with all the Optima bashes from trustworthy folks here, I surf around now
and see indeed Optima was bought and sold, and now has a less than stellar
rep...  I have 2 red tops still, one 6 years old, one about 10 that are solid
as day 1 sitting as the start and coach in the '77, I've alternated those
positions occasionally, but have abused them ruthlessly for years, letting
them sit all winter, then starting and charging at the full output of the
massive T4 alternator, using just a 40A late Vanagon A/C relay as my
isolation.
 
I do see Sears has a bevy of AGM's in standard non spiral cell's
in a multitude of form factors (though no 41, or 42) so one might want to look
there.  Go to sears and search AGM battery for the forms ranging from
$140-200.  There is a $200, size 94R that is a monster, but just 1/2 taller
than a 41/42 and about 3/4 longer than the 41.  Perhaps a tight fit, but maybe
doable on the passenger side...  There is a nice side terminal size 78 as well
$165 which might be even better, just a smidge taller than a 41/42, a smidge
wider, and between the 41 and 42 lengths.  And the side terminals are
convenient IMHO.
