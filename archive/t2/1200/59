Subject: Re: [T2] Replacing torsion arms

Brian,
 
Long long ago Dolan did a nice writeup with pics, was on his server
for a long time, perhaps somewhere on type2??
 
I'd say have a close look at
your tie bars, drag link, and the center pivot bush, if all aren't snuff, now
is the time.  And of course opportune time for complete front brakes with soft
lines, and even your master if not all perfect.  And might as well do the rag
joint in the steering as well.  This is the time, do you have the money is the
question?
 
 
John

Hey,

I am going to be replacing
the torsion arms and ball joints (the only from Bus
Boys) hopefully next
weekend in my 69 Westy. I have never done this before,
anything else I should
replace while I have everything apart? And more
importantly anything I need to
know about doing this on jack stands in my
garage?
