ok have been having turn signal issues.
78bus

put in 2 new relays, nada.
put in brand new turn signal switch.

only right side bulbs light up and while 4ways blink (right side) turn 
signals do not left/right.  have swapped relays. checked fuses, changed 
switch..????  bulbs are ok. so where could the problem be that affects all 
turn signals.

before going out they would not light but if I turned on the 4way then 
turned it off the turn signals worked normally, until next time in bus, 
then repeat with 4ways to "kick" the turn signals back into service.

????????
