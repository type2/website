Kevin, pricey but the Optima will fit physically.  Back in the day, even the
regular red tops (when all there were, were red tops say 1995ish) lasted just
as well as a wet cell deep cycle.  The mechanical and electrical engineering
depts at my school used them in electric car projects and did real life
extensive research in life cycles vs wet cells back then.  Now that they sell
the yellow and blue tops, I don't know how the red's quality is.  But there is
a size 34 blue top which fits just fine, so a blue top Optima may be the
ticket.  Go for $180-220 depending on source, but a good marine wet cell will
cost damn near $140, so not much more.)  The trick to it though with Optima's
is not cooking them, and not imbalancing them vs the starting battery, so if
still with the dirt simple and reliable OEM relay to charge the coach battery,
you may overcharge the Optima, and lessen its life unless you go with a bit
more exotic isolator.  The other thing
 to look at is surf to Ken Mullendore (sp?) site (the east coast Westy guy in
MD who sells Propex heaters) he has ganged together slews of small form factor
gelled cell UPS batteries to fit under the Vanagon driver seat, for better mah
capacity in smaller form.  Home Depot has a pretty good selection of them
reasonable, so you might look at that for a Bus but a bit of a project.

I went to a FLAPS here, and tried to get a Deep Cycle battery. The smallest
one they had was too tall to fit. This battery is located on the driver's
side
engine compartment, opposite the regular battery. 



What have you guys used
for this spot? Ie do you know a brand battery that
will fit?
