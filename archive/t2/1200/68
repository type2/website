Subject: RE: Subject: Replacing torsion arms

"Message-Id: <899AF7C0-B99A-4D3B-87BD-E176C09C2A28(-at-)aol.com>  Hey,  I am
going to be replacing the torsion arms and ball joints (the only from Bus
Boys) hopefully next weekend in my 69 Westy. I have never done this before,
anything else I should replace while I have everything apart? And more
importantly anything I need to know about doing this on jack stands in my
garage?  Clear Skies,  Brian Eney"

Where are you? You can come use my lift if your are anywhere remotely
close. I can not begin to imagine this job on the floor (but I am old).
