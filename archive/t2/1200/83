The spare tire well sits below the closet, and will never be used for 
the spare tire in a camper.
Yes, the Sony can be run off the spare battery, usints battery first.. 
We went years with a starting battery for the extra in parallel with the 
starting battery (doubling its capacity) , ok for a charger or small tv, 
making sure not to let voltage go below 12 under load....but a fridge 
takes like 4 amps and letting it run 10 hrs will run a typical deep 
cycle down to 50% of its capacity (around 85AH), below which I would not 
go for long battery life.
A typical table of charge % vs resting voltage: 100%=12.7, 70%=12.4, 
50%=12.2, 30%=12, dead=11.8  A portable fridge that we had cut out at 
11.8v, but that is the under load cutoff.

  don't think I want to go that route yet. A side post is a great idea I had
  not thought of. Do you power your DVD/TV player off the battery? I don't
  plan on using anything like that, but may plug in cell phone chargers when
  parked.
