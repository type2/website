Subject: Re: [T2] Drifting a VW

I aggree here entirely.  I've always taught my SO's how to skid and drift
about on snow covered parking lots, might be hard for Robert to find those...
 
Now I've heard it said the mighty Pius is a joke to get skidding on them
teeny little bits of rubber.  Or so the Top Gear UK guys have always stated,
but they are known Pius haters and all.
 
However they mentioned it as a
positive recently that the new little Toyota/Subaru GT86 sports the same
rubber in a RWD platform due to how easy it is to get it hanging out with
"relatively" little power.

    Unpredictable twitches in such metastable
manouevres make it dangerous to drift a bus often.  But I believe every driver
should experience skidding in the vehicle he mainly drives, if only to meet
some emergencies more effectively.
    Having said that, I have to admit my
Prius II (160/65 R 15) is difficult to provoke to skid so as to learn how to
handle understeer.
