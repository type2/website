Subject: re:Optima Batteries for 2nd battery

Thanks for all the tips I'm getting.I looked at the specs for the optima
D34M. It looks like the key to keep it from cooking is to keep the
recharging voltage between 13.65 and 15 when charging off alternator, 13.85
and 15 when on battery charger, or 15.6 when doing a rapid charge. 

 

I'm going to try to monitor the voltage at the existing 2nd battery with the
engine running. Even though I think the battery is not good anymore, with
the engine running, I think the alternator should be putting out juice to
this battery. So my voltmeter can tell me what is going to the 2nd battery.
Then I'll test it with the bus plugged in to 110. If the charging voltage
seems to fall in the range specified, I'll go with one of these optima blue
top D34M.
