Looking like you made the right choice for sure to take off the head. My
suggestion was ONLY because I thought the engine was in situ. There is a guy
in Portland people either love or hate, named James Lutz. He does nothing
but VW work. He used to have the shop, Strictly Foreign and the no. was
503-233-0030 . Don't know if he's still around or not, but it's worth a try.
Also, don't forget that any motorcycle shop is really experienced in playing
with aluminum heads too.
Take care,
Courtney
