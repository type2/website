the BA4 is stock in the VW 411/412 I have one in my bus and it puts out
so much heat that I have totally disconected my stock heating system and
use the BA4 for all heat....and I ski and get into some pretty cold
situations.  it can be finiky to  get working right but then it works
fine.

don't know anything about the SW so can't compare em...
