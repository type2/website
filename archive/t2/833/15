Subject: really stupid

Alright guys, I'm going to ask a really stupid  one.  But then I'm a jazz musician, not a mechanic.   When  winter came around, in the fall, I started getting terrible squeaking  noises from my suspension.  Sometimes it sounds like it's actually  coming from the dash itself but it is the suspension.  Other than  the main springs, what is there to squeak?  Bushings  somewhere?  Which ones?  If it's the springs, what to do  about it?  Something I can fix with PB Blaster?  I know the  door hinges need it.
  
  Also, my cargo door is getting to where it doesn't shut properly.   I've adjusted the front before but the problem is now in the  rear.  I have to hold my had on the rear and push while I shut the  door.  And I have to put some effort into it.  Is something  bent?  
  
  That squeaking is about to drive me back to Fords, my favorite American cars (for American cars!).  Cheers....KR
