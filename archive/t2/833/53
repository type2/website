Subject: Re: [T2] Producer Gas

Hi Jenny,

Less power to run our VWs?  That's gonna be a hard pill to swallow. A  
vehicle any less powerful than a VW bus on the roads today is a goner.

Producer gas was used in WW2 not by choice, but because  the  
refineries were disabled, the available output was diverted to  
military usage only; and the usual distribution network was disrupted  
by war. Coal is a much less efficient fuel than gasoline, as it's  
very heavy to haul. Like Terry says, it's more efficient to refine  
fossil fuels into a more concentrated form for distribution. which in  
the world now is gasoline, diesel, and kerosene.

For *future* fuel use I would suggest research into Hydrogen. It's  
even cleaner burning than coal, and is easier to store and  
transport.  Hydrogen can be produced with solar, wind, hydro-electric  
or nuclear power, or though the burning of fossil fuels like coal,  
oil or natural gas. Hydrogen energy can be converted into energy  
using internal combustion or it can be converted into electricity  
using a fuel cell. So you could choose to power your bus with  
electricity if you wanted and you wouldn't have to haul around all  
those heavy batteries.

If the media stopped trotting out the old clips of the Hindenberg  
burning down then we could look forward to DRINKING the output from  
our bus's exhaust pipe.


Happy trails,
