Subject: scary sounds

Well, I'm almost afraid to ask this one.  My  mom is in the hospital with 3 broken ribs, a bad heart, and some  dimensia, I lost my weekend band gig, and until tax season starts up  I'm not working days.  So its a REALLY bad time for me to have bus  trouble.  
  
  I'm starting to hear a sound like a cable slapping against something.    Mostly in first and second gear when you're taking off.   Tap  tap   tap   Tap tap tap taptaptap then it just  peters out once you get rolling.  First time I heard it, I ran by  my local mechanic and it quit doing it on the way.  Couldn't make  it do it again.  Well, he and I were both in a hurry so I didn't  get it up on the rack.
  
  Now it's back and seems to be getting worse.  I know that's a  really vague description but some of you have probably heard it  before.  I've got to get back and forth to the hospital a couple  more times this weekend and then tomorrow afternoon I should be able to  get it looked at.  Any ideas?  Is it safe for me to continue  driving it the 10 miles or so round trip to the hospital?  Thanks  guys....KR
