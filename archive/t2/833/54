yee how.....0-60 in 4days 8hr 27min

I once looked into powering a 71 bus I had with batteries, my uncle is an
electrical engineer and the more we looked at it the more I decided the
technology wasn't mature enough

don't look now but a few major cities in the world (including USA & Cdn)
are already using H2 in their BIG buses. so far none have blown up or even
had a major mishap... the technology isn't quite ready yet but very very
soon coming to a city near you, transit buses power by H2, can our little
buses be far behind..?


happy new years to all
