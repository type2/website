Subject: Re: [T2] Stewart Warner Gas Heater vs. Eberspacher

Oooooh, I can feel the heat already and with a DoubleCab, I'll cook my toes
off! Oh Joy!!!

Now to find the missing pieces... I'll let everyone know what is missing and
hopefully someone will have the parts. If anyone is interested in the
Stewart Warner, it is very hidden on ebay not under heaters and has yet to
have a bid. A steal at $125 bucks.

Or item # 8026035546

Looks complete and in pretty good condition.
