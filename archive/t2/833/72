Hey Neale, when my 74 with original PDSIT's was doing
that, it was the float height on the left carburetor. 
It would be running down the road nicely and then
would only start running off of one carburetor.  It
took me a while to determine what it was but it might
be something into which might be worth looking. It
could be either carburetor.  Greg
