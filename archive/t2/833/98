Hmmm, never had one break off, but then again I've never had one refuse to
take grease.  Use a good grease gun and make sure that the connection is
straight and firm before pumping.  There is a little hammer gadget that
supposedly clears clogged fittings, but I've never had need of it.

If you have to remove the fitting, use a socket or a box end wrench.  Tap
on the fitting with a small hammer and punch against the wrench flats to
get things a bit looser.
