<<      In 1906, a Stanley Steamer set the world's land
speed record at   205.44/kmhr - 121.573/mph>>

In 1955 a ATSF Lima 4-8-4 ecceeded 130mph mph on the flats of Nebraska
pulling 95 box cars Anthony.

So what?

I just can't really think of anyone running a boiler on coal, corn cobs,
or wood, in any Bus right this second.

You really pulled this one right outa your hat---: )
