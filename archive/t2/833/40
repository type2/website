Subject: Tire Chains Question

Hi everyone,

Just got back from a winter camping getaway in Vermont's Green
Mountain National Forest. As I'm slowing spinning out 180 degrees on
an ice covered road I come to 2 realizations:

1) I really need to keep the back brakes adjusted very well
2) I need snow chains

I'm running Hankook 195R14's (from Bus Depot) on all 4 wheels. I'm
wondering if anyone is using snow chains with these slightly over
sized tires. Primarily I'm concerned about the clearance for the
chains, does anyone know if "Class-S" chains would be appropriate for
this setup or if I should go with the more expensive "Sub-S" low
clearance chain? Any input is appreciated as this is my first
experience with snow chains.

Thanks in advance


happy new year!
peace
