Subject: Re: [T2] adding a light to my engine compartment

sam i have installed a cigarette lighter connection to my aux(marine)battery that sits on left side that i can plug my little cigarette lighter light into whenever i need to see back there....
  the light has also a cord that rolls back up inside it so i can reach where ever...
  this was just my solution to a dark engine compartment....
  also i keep a couple of those little push battery operated lights in the hatch in case i need one...
  you can buy them at wally world in a pack for less than five bucks,.... dont leave them in the engine bay though or the roll up cord cigarette light may get to hot and melt might not but i dont want to take a chance at it....
   
  good luck in whatever you do i am sure that some folks have other ideas i also would be interested in hearing/reading about...
   
  i also have the push lights installed throughout the bus stuck with velcro sot hat when camping or just at night i can push the light and see my way.... work really good for camping....
  and take like two /four doubla a's
  peace
