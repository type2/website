Subject: Re: [T2] adding a light to my engine compartment

hey Guys  What I did was to take a inside lite from a splittie and glued a  
magnetic strip to the back of it , attached two very long wires to it and used 
clip connectors on the end so that I can hook it directly to the battery . 
Comes in very handy and the magnet makes it nice to stick where you need it.
