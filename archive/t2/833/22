if you can find a junkyard/pick n pull 411/412 you can find all the pieces
but they are well hidden...lets see you need:

. the heater itself,
  heater should also have glow/spark plug, burner fan, exhaust pipe,
ignition coil, thermo switch..
. seperately there is
. temp regulating switch
. fuel pump
. main switch
. temp sensor
. dual relay
. safety switch
. heater air blower
. overheat switch

think that is all.  fuel pump, plug and burner fan are not easy to funge
around others can be worked around but not easy.

good luck
Bob
