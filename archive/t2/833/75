You mean in the cargo/living/passenger area?  Yes, they can be 
replaced by a single pane of glass and matching rubber.  That's
the standard configuration of Kombis.  The glass is flat, so
if you cannot find it, you can have it cut.  The rubber should
be readily available.  But used should be cheaper ...

Why do you want to do this?  I'd love to install vent wings or
sliding windows in my '74 Kombi if only I could find them cheap
here in Germany.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
