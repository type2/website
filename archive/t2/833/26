Subject: #^$^%&clutch release arm won't slide off shaft

Well, the 75 my daughter is driving back to Savannah in a day has a 
small problem.......said her clutch pedal is "sagging" & was that way 
driving to home -and I checked it out and see the return spring is 
broken.  So I checked out the 2 parts trannies I have and see it's just 
a simple snap ring that I removed, slid off the release arm, took the 
good spring, and prepared to do the same to her bus- aarrgh, the snap 
ring came off, but no prying, PB blasting, or heating will let the arm 
slide off.  I noticed that the shaft is also larger (76 tranny, I think) 
in diameter than the 77 parter (larger snap ring!).  Probably 30 years 
of never being removed.  Trying to slide the good spring over the arm 
hangs it up at the bottom. I don't want to force it with so little time 
(like hammering on it), and so decided to deal with it at a future time 
when engine could be liesurely pulled and get to it from above and 
inside.  Nyssa understands that when the pedal drops (by the free play 
amount I assume) it stops when the release bearing touches the pressure 
plate and could cause it to spin.  I don't think there is a spring at 
the pedal arm where the cable attaches, since the arm drops to the floor 
if the cable is untensioned.  The arm is too close to the floor for a 
spring to be put there.   A bungee under the pedal run to the steering 
column would get in the way of clutching, but may work for highway 
driving.   I suppose an extender could be put under the pedal to bring 
the bungee attachment forward and allow foot pressure.....
    We felt the free play of the release arm to see when it touches the 
plate, and see very little pressure is needed to return the arm; most of 
the spring must be to keep the pedal up?  We decided to add an eyebolt 
in the engine wall facing the arm top, which is about 3" away. For now 
it has quality 5/32" bungee running between the arm and the eyebolt. I 
hope to find a spring that will tolerate double its initial stretch, 
which 4 wraps of bungee handles OK.  There was no release bearing noise 
before, and she has spare bearings and the replacement spring with her.
