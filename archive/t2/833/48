Subject: Cheap Stewart-Warner Gas Heater on ebay

I found this when I was looking around for a heater. Still 4 days left on
the auction and only $125 with no bids yet.

Evidentially "busbarn" says:

"Jon, the VW-256-168 is a 12V Southwind model #8349-A for a sedan.  It
does have the separate blower, so it could be configured to work
about anywhere in a bus.  It is a 13,000 BTU model."

That sounds good for a westy or transporter.

Or item #8026035546
