Subject: Weird ignition problem made bus flunk smog

Hi Volks:

I had my 78 CA FI bus "smogged" Wednesday.  (It has a cat converter too) 
Good news and bad news.  Good news - passed on emissions.  Bad news 
flunked on timing.  Here's why and why I need some help.

When the bus sits for a few days and I start it up it runs gangbusters.  
Back and forth to Sacramento (15 miles each way) stop and go, no 
problem.  The bus sits for longer than 10 minutes and splutter splutter 
splutter.  It won't idle and keeps stalling.  It did that for the smog 
guy because the line was too long.

If it sits for four hours or more it runs great again.  But that was too 
long for the smog guy.  He flunked it.

Any ideas?  My guesses are fuel pump fuel filter (even though it is 
fairly recent) or pressure valve.  I need to start fixing it and get the 
stickers from DMV before my landlord notices.

Thanks,

BEN
