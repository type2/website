Getting one should be the smaller problem.  Getting one
registered for street use is the bigger one.  It's possible
here in Germany (they cost 18k Euros or something like that),
but I understand that in the US it's as good as impossible.

But why would you want to?  18k Euros would buy you a nice
restored Bus, and a nice restore Westy for weekends to go
with it.  They may not be as good as new, but they are
certainly better than new Brazilian.  There's a new Brazil
Bus in the wolfsburg Auto Museum, and it's not nicely
finished at all.  

It's generally an agreed fact that South American made
spare parts are second rate material, isn't it?  Well, so
are South American made Buses.  They're made from those
parts, after all.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
