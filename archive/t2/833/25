Subject: Re: [T2] Flywheel O Ring

Barry asked:

 Where does the flywheel O Ring go???  Under or over the shims??

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Flip the flywheel around and dig out the old o-ring stuck into the bottom of the hole. Put the new in the
groove.
