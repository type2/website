Subject: Re: [T2] Weird ignition problem made bus flunk smog

Hi Ben,

Poor idle can be due to a number of factors.  Check the dwell first,  
and consider replacing coil, points, plugs and wires. Once the  
electrical system is verified, check the compression. Then adjust the  
valves and check compression again and compare.... If it changed then  
you had a valve out of adjustment. Run some fuel injector cleaner  
through the engine, or remove the injectors and have them  
professionally serviced. Also check vaccuum, it needs to be better  
than 14" at idle.

Let us know if the above doesn't clear up the problem.... That's when  
things get interesting.
