Subject: Re: [T2] adding a light to my engine compartment

Check out the diode flashlights; I have one with 21 diodes in it (3 AAA 
batts) you can hold in your teeth; got it on Ebay through a Hong Kong 
character named Jack Kie.  They have one that uses one AA battery, 9 
diodes as I recall.  These things last forever, provide super bright 
light with NO heat.
    Barring that, check out the 12 volt lights you can get at IKEA or 
Home Depot, using small 20w 12v halogens- you can wire these into your 
system minus the transformer- some have arms you can move around and 
aim, like the IKEA table light that is $4.99.
