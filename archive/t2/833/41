Subject: Re: [T2] Stewart Warner Gas Heater vs. Eberspacher

Are the heaters hard to rebuild? I picked up s 69 dormobile from a local
yard and it has the heater and all the duct and other stuff. Just woundering
if its worth my time to add it to one of my buses. Im in norfolk va and it
doesnt get all that cold.
