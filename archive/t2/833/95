Subject: Re: [T2] really stupid

I had a very loud squeek coming from the right front suspension on my '71 
that was driving me nuts. Any rough area on the street, entering the driveway, 
anytime the suspension moved it squeeked loudly.  I greased all the zerks but it 
still squeeked.  Thinking maybe it was the ball joints , I greased them with 
a little tool that looks like a zerk fitting with a
hypodermic needle connected to it. Its about 3" long.  It just snaps onto the 
end of your
grease gun and grease comes out of the needle tip.   I carefully inserted the 
needle
through the balljoint boot and gave it a few pumps of grease. I then cleaned 
the little
dot sized spot where the needle was inserted with a little paint thinner on a 
rag, dried
it with a dry rag, and applied a spot of silicone seal.  The squeek 
disappeared that day.
