Subject: Re: [T2] AW code NGK spark plug question

Buying VW parts with FLAPS cross-referencing can be an entertaining
experience with all kinds of flukes and errors. So generally you need
your authoritative information from the Bentley or other reliable VW
sources before you go shopping.

AW is the correct code for a 1974 1800. If FI was available in 1974 it
was probably only for the automatic transmission version. I would
think the engine drives the plug application rather than the type of
fuel delivery, but I'm not a spark plug expert. As you say, there's a
lot of info in the archives, but it is certainly easier to digest that
stuff a little at a time as it comes in the inbox than it is to wade
through archives. I've read some really well-informed posts, but
without having written them down, it seems a daunting task to try to
find them again.
