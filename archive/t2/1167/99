Subject: Re: [T2] AW code NGK spark plug question

The purpose of going resistor in almost everything is to afford the
maximum  protection from RF interference.  Starting in the early 80s
VW and Audi got on a kick to up the ante on RF interference
suppression, especially in ignition systems, partly to deal with radio
noise complaints, partly to meet newer USDOT/FCC regs to suppress the
interference.  1 to 5kOhm resistor  ends at the spark plug weren't
cutting the mustard as time went on, so the switch to rrsistor spark
plugs....which BTW do not degrade ignition spark performance in
comparison to non resistor variety.  I've been using resistor spark
plugs on my VWs for over 20 years, not a problem in power or mileage.

Ignition rotors (Bosch 04033 [which replaced the non resistor 04012),
04038, etc., have had resistors in them since the late 70s.  Even the
Wasserboxer started getting a metal shield (grounded with a strap)
around the distributor cap to help suppress RF.

The FCC has gotten very regulatory on RF intereference in the past two
decades with all the electronic devices we use nowadays.
