Thanks John, I'll check out the archives, I found the library on a Type 2
search via Google.  

 

I think it was in the Library that I saw the recommendation to get rid of
the twin Solexes because they were not as good as a single Weber.  The first
few posts I received after joining indicated the opposite.  

 

Why do some people curse the Weber and you don't?  Jetting, adjustments,
intake design?  I have to make mine work because the twin Solexes are gone
and I don't really have the money to replace them, do you have any
recommendations for being happy with my Weber?  

 

This was going to be my first question after checking into the archives but
since you're happy with your setup, maybe you can tell me what I need to
know.

 

Joe

Welcome to the list Joe. Be sure to check the library at Type2.com.
Searching the archives can also yield rich, detailed explanations that you
might not get as much attention to on a new request.

 

I love the Type 4 engine myself and have a 1700 on my 74 bus. I love my
center mount Weber progressive, but you will hear a lot of people curse it.

 

Let us know when we can help.

 

Have fun,

 

John
