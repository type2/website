I would think about replacing your rubber brake lines as well.  If they are
old there is a good chance they are your problem.  As they get old they swell
and restrict the movement of brake fluid causing sticky brakes.  It fits with
the intermittent characteristic.

winter came and I got a brake problem... rear
 drum brake gets stuck
even when a slight pressure applied. it is 
intermittent - driving a
while and gets away . I assume I have to 
bleed the lines and check for
rust / scratches on the cylinders. 
Unfortunately the bleeding vents
are to be replaced - they are rusty 
and I couldnt get the wrench a
good hold.
