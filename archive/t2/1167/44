Subject: was brakes problem, now transmission fluid ... ouch !

Thank you all
i bought spare bleeder valves and then use penetration oil and slight
hammering on the tips, also propane torch - just a little warming ,
cooling and spraying oil . the other important precedure is to scrach
the edge of the thread where it enters so the oil will penetrate.
also helpfull was that I cut the head of a socket type wrench ( back
is 7mm and front is 11 mm ) and grind it with two outside flat
surfdaces - that way I created a wrench that has a 6 side inside and
opening on the back for the bleding hose to go through.
it appears that there was so much moisture in the unbleeded for years
back brakes and the liquid was brownish .

Now another issue : checking the transmission oil and I found out that
it is greenish and with a lot of foam - the car was not driven (
stored ) for 12 years before we purchased it - could that be a sign
(the foam) of moisture and deterioration ? or is it something else ?
. and yes - i am refiling right away with new gear oil !
