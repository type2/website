I had fantastic results out of my Weber until it finally gave up the 
ghost and I replaced it with Baby Delortos.  I'm still evaluating them 
but I swear that I've lost a little power over the single Weber.  And 
the 009 works better.  I'm going to try again on the SVDA dizzy with the 
Petronix built in.  It might be that the timing was not set right for 
it.  I probably would have gone with another Weber if I could have found 
one at a decent price.  I can't complain about the Dels.  The Bopmobile 
has never run better except for the slight loss in power.  Which might 
be either a figment of my imagination or bad memory.  We'll see.

Why do some people curse the Weber and you don't? Jetting, adjustments, 
intake design? I have to make mine work because the twin Solexes are 
gone and I don't really have the money to replace them, do you have any 
recommendations for being happy with my Weber? This was going to be my 
first question after checking into the archives but since you're happy 
with your setup, maybe you can tell me what I need to know.
