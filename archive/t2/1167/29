Iwould go with the tips mentioned by others, particularly replacing soft hoses
as well.
 
I would add to servicing bleeders, every time I go to touch one I
take a 12 oz hammer, and give the tip of the bleeder good solid hard taps.  I
count AT LEAST 50, really no shit I count them, probably takes a minute or two
a bleeder.  I've done this for 20 years, in my youth previously I used to
break them occasionally, I've never broken one since, and I seldom even apply
penetrant oil to them, just the taps with the hammer, and a real brake bleeder
wrench (long arm flare wrench) or a closed head wrench only.  The tapping will
deform the tip of the bleeder to some extent, but a hose will still fit
easily.  I do this on any make or model car.  I think off the top of my head
they are M6 or M7 bleeders, but it has been so long since I've replaced one I
don't recall.  Good local parts stores in the US used to stock them (universal
to some extent for Euro cars), but with cylinders being only $12-15 sort of
became foolish to rebuild/reseal cylinders or
 replace bleeders.
 
I would say also this problem may or may not be
hydraulic, though that would be my first guess.  But other thoughts include
overly closely adjusted shoes will flash rust shoes to drum sometimes and hold
and drag a bit then release.  Parking brake cables can also cause problems
like this that will drive you in fits.  Not VW but a good story is that I had
the exact same symptoms on a Suburban.  I had rebuilt the entire drums, new
hydraulics, new drums, new shoes, proper adjustment.  When it got cold (about
a month later) one brake would drag, and seem to tighten itself up.  I
readjusted countless times, finally looking at parking brake adjustment with
the drum off I realized that far up the cable where it crossed the exhaust,
the sheath had cracked and rusted, let water in, when it got cold water froze
the cable internally, it would pull hold, not release until exhaust heat
melted it.   So all kinds of weird stuff can happen.

winter came and I got a brake problem... rear drum brake gets stuck
even when
a slight pressure applied. it is intermittent - driving a
while and gets away
. I assume I have to bleed the lines and check for
rust / scratches on the
cylinders. Unfortunately the bleeding vents
are to be replaced - they are
rusty and I couldnt get the wrench a
good hold. Looking for a replacement
before I continue the job
