Right. Seems unavoidable. I planned not to repair the sag dent in the
last bus I had with one. The rest of the body and paint was passable,
but I decided that the dent was hidden by the tire and would likely
just happen again anyway if I fixed it.

I don't like silicone because of later hassles for painting. If you
decide to use it, smooth the face, wipe with alcohol around the holes
before the silicone sets, and let it overflow behind for grip.

That's a notoriously difficult area to get your fingers to. A real
challenge even for just changing an emblem.

 looking for a match for the one screw I had that fit the inserts.  Problem
 was, I was looking in the metric section and I later found the insert was a
 10-24 thread!  Didn't see that one coming!

Typical for made in the USA VW accessories. Why not just keep it
simple and plug your inserts with well-greased bolts?

Have fun,
