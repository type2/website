Subject: True Canadian Winter Bus Campout - February 18th, 2012

Hi Volks,

The date is set: February 18th, 2012 will be the Ninth Annual
True Canadian Winter Bus Campout. We've done this eight times already, 
and there's no sign of stopping any time soon.

Dig out your mothballed camping gear, pile it into your bus, and come 
out for a weekend of the most fun you never thought possible!! Really, 
it's not that difficult, as the campground has serviced sites with hydro 
and the washrooms are close by with flush toilets and showers.  We make 
the most of the long winter night with a big campfire and a lot of 
snacks and beverages to share.

The cost for camping is $39/night for fees; be sure to get there before 
7PM or the gate may not be staffed. If you can contribute (locally 
sourced) firewood, please do.
