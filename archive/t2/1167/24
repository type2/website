We mostly just lurk nowadays as the buses sleep quietly in the garage and
life with teens just remains too hectic. Having been at this hobby long
enough
 I don't have to ask many questions, but always at the back of my mind, was
the comfort of knowing that the knowledge of our long time statesman
was just a keyboard away. That comfort is a little colder as of late. Be
well all.
