Subject: 83 vanagon front end alignment 

Hi
I'm ready to help a pal align the front end on his 83 aircooled vanagon. We
just replaced the ball joints.
Any directions are welcome. Or even Directions
to Directions. He'd rather not fork out the $80 the shops are asking for---and
even then you don't know if they do it right.
Thanks much!
