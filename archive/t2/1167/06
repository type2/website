Welcome to AK.
 
Though in reality in the last 4 years since I've been here,
on the road system, such that it is, coverage has gone from nothing to pretty
fair.  Probably far better than high desert SW at least any place you can get
on road, cause you can't get anywhere.  Still between Denali and Fairbanks
there are some 30-40 minutes stretches without unless you are high enough to
be line of sight I presume.
 
Always got sat phones for the truely rich, or
those $99 GPS emergency beacon things, I presume they would work pretty well
down there.  They sell a pile of those up here to people going middle of
nowhere who can't afford sat phones.  Likely a smart idea on such a trip.

feel the thrill of isolation that I once did when traveling around California
and Arizona. I've

recently (with a rental car, I flew in) I traveled the
entire length of Death Valley and except for a little bit around the
campgrounds there was no cell coverage in the entire valley, it was a
different experience.
