about 20 years ago so info is out of date,  traveled 66 thru the desert of 
California. awesome beauty but very desolate in places. don't expect much 
help, however if truely stranded, it parallels a very busy RR line much of 
the way and a flag waved at a train would likely get help sent via their 
train radios, doubt they would stop but they would send help. (state 
police)
   is worth the trip but wouldn't do it without a temp guage, I did it in 
Sept and temps were over 100F most days.  fortunately for the bus the road 
is fairly flat except into and out of the desert and bad enough that you 
won't go very fast. plan on 40-45mph with plenty of stops to enjoy the 
scenery, and abandoned towns.

have no idea about cell coverage, they hadn't invented those things yet
