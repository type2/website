Subject: reindeer

yes, the addition of the reindeer did the job. the first few days the respnse
was good but mixed. when the reindeer landed on the luggage rack the response
went....through the roof?   no matter how cool or reserved you are, the
reindeer cracks the shell. probably some good deals coming up on monday on
surplus wire reindeer, angels, snowmen, trees, santas, sleighs, etc. hey, it's
a big roof up there. 50 sqf and counting.
