Subject: Re: was brakes problem, now transmission fluid ... ouch !

I wouldn't sweat the gear oil, it has a green tint, and after running some it
will vent its moisture.  Replacement is always smart of course but unless you
find a good GL4 replacement, I wouldn't touch it.  When you do (Sta-lube GL4
may still be around locally, NAPA around me last I looked, Redline MTL a great
order away choice, maybe local if you are in a big city, there is also an
AMSOIL GL4 and they have more dealers) then drain and fill.  Main thing you
want to worry about is big chunks of steel or a very heavy coating of
shavings on the magnet on the drain plug.  I presume it is the fill plug you
have pulled to witness the oil, if it wasn't somehow, bear in mind to always
pull the fill before the drain, as sometimes you can't pull the fill and you
don't want to find that out after the oil is out.
 
Brown brake fluid, hell if
it isn't black with a lot of sediment, that is nothing.  I'd still do the soft
lines as soon as you can get them as has been mentioned by all.

Now another issue : checking the
transmission oil and I found out that
it is greenish and with a lot of foam -
the car was not driven (
stored ) for 12 years before we purchased it - could
that be a sign
(the foam) of moisture and deterioration ? or is it something
else ?
. and yes - i am refiling right away with new gear oil !
