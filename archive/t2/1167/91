Yeah, I'm with Chris. Take your pick. The reason the carb is numbered
32/36 is because each venturi is a different size. The smaller number
is for fuel economy at cruise and the larger barrel is for power.

I've got a Motorcraft as a spare too. Use whichever suits you for
convenience or better condition. My Motorcraft is really late model
and I had to plug all the excess vacuum ports on it. But it was NOS
for $20 off that famous auction site, so I'm glad I have it.
