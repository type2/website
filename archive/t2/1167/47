Subject: Re: [T2] 83 vanagon front end alignment 

Search for home wheel alignment, or home racecar wheel alignment and there are
lots of sites with procedures/tips.
 
But, you are going to need be pretty
accurate measuring track, and need a really good degreed level or come up with
alternate methods to use a regular level (measured shims on a 2' level and
calculating.)  Caster is sort of a bitch still, though you can make at home
turntables by laying 2 well waxed floor tiles shiny face to shiny face.
 
I
used to do it in a race 914, but it is one of those things where saving $80
when you got what $200 of tires on the front end may not end up money well
spent.  You got to trust somebody in the work, and any big shop with even a 10
year old computerized Hunter rack is pretty foolproof, let alone the more
modern it gets.  They just have to follow pictures and all.  I briefly had a
vintage 50's Hunter Lite-Align and it still did a wonderful job actually but I
sold it to a buddy before starting med school as I had no where to keep it.
 
If you marked the eccentrics well, and replaced in same position, and didn't
screw with the tie rods, actually things are probably damn close.

alignment 
 
Hi
I'm ready to help a pal align the front end on his 83
aircooled vanagon. We
just replaced the ball joints.
Any directions are
welcome. Or even Directions
to Directions. He'd rather not fork out the $80
the shops are asking for---and
even then you don't know if they do it right.
Thanks much!
