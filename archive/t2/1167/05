I just leave mine turned off. or even take the battery out so the GPS 
function is not even working, although that is a bit extreme.  heck I bet 
some areas still do not have coverage though.

recently (with a rental car, I flew in) I traveled the entire length of 
Death Valley and except for a little bit around the campgrounds there was 
no cell coverage in the entire valley, it was a different experience.

one reason I don't mind driving my bus now is the AIRS list of course but 
also the 200 mile premier AAA tow coverage.
