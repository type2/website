It took us about 3.5 hours working on building it.  That included 3 adults
most of the time, another coming and going and the help of a 5 and 7 year old
intermittently.

I am so glad that my mother doesnt have a problem buying legos for her 37 year
old son!

My wife sent my folks the link and they got it for us!

It is so cool.  I felt like a kid at Christmas again!

Jeremy
