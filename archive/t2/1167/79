I have to agree with John; a carb is where my heads at too. This is just 
because I love the simplicity of a properly tuned carb as opposed to all the 
FI stuff that for some reason just seems like black magic to my little 
brain. :-) It's the trouble shooting on the side of the road with FI that 
scares the heck outta me. Old dog - new tricks???
