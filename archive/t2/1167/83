Hey Joe,

 

Welcome to the list.There is plenty of info in the archive, but please ask
away.this list has gotten sleepy as of late. I think it is because there are
so many other VW dedidcated pages, and resources. But I think it is
important to keep the chatter up..

 

As for posting photos-thesamba is also a good place.
