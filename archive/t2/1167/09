never any wires, the door needs to be adjusted as the stardard hold open 
catch on the door at the rear is what holds it open.

there is a locking mechanism with a lever attached to the ramp.  I took 
some photos yesterday and will send them to you, as I don't have a site to 
post them yet.  (will come from a differet e-mail address)

anyone else needs the photos let me know
