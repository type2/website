Subject: Weber

Thanks for all the sharing of knowledge,,it is great. I am inclined to stay
stock. I also can't see it working in my rig. The alternator is in the way as
well not enough room above for the carb. It is not worth the effort for me, so
I have installed a new original pict carb and is working nicely. I have a 2000
engine that needs rebuild so I think the weber to be a match for that engine.
Anyway, interesting conversation ,,thanks a lot.
Linda, from PEI,,nice winter but not summer here
