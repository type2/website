Bob,
 
They actually have a new one out that is $50 more (though $129 on sale
up here, the older one goes $79) that has more functions for non emergencies. 
Then the service goes an extra $30 for roadside assistance beyond the normal
$99/year.  I think the new one will call and text friends/family with your
location if you hit the "help" instead of "911" button, even with the base
service.  And you can have continuous tracking of it for friends/family for
another $45 or so a year so your wife can find out who you've been stopping at
when she isn't tracking your cell...  I've thought about putting one in the
wifes car for safety, but reality is again if you are on the road system up
here, most of the time, somebody is going to pass you within a reasonable
time.  Probably for me it would be smarter to have her learn to use a 9mm and
have her carry one in the car, as everyone else is going to have at least a
.44 when they stop to "help" you.  I don't stop to
 help anyone up here, sad as I am to admit that, and I still did in WV, or
even on the DC beltway when I was over there, instead I call the state police
if I see someone I feel is truely stuck.
 
Anyway, although I do love the days
of driving in the middle of nowhere with no contact, and didn't get a cell
phone until 2003, as I get older I do realize having one of those "Spot"
things on a Route 66 drive would be pretty damn smart for $200.  I actually
did break down in a rental once on the drive between Phoenix and Yuma on US95,
which I did monthly there in '96 or so.  Damn mid size Chevy of some sort just
stopped dead.  I always grabbed a gallon of water at a convenience store
leaving town on that trip, but wouldn't have wanted to wait very long or start
walking on some of those stretches.  I'm sure cell service then (not that I
had one) was nonextant.

I fly and am required to have one
of those "Spot" becons in the aircraft, is even part of the preflight check
list to check the battery etc.
  they are only for true emergencies though,
but if it is an emergency they could save your life.
