Subject: Re: [T2] Weber carb

Well, lets hold on a second.  Actually the 2 barrel Weber progressive,
particularly if it has an electric choke, is a very nice carb for a slightly
warmed T1.  The T1 progressive manifold has heat riser (at least most of them
do) so doesn't ice as much, and the thing works a lot better than on a T4
actually.  Can be jetted for even a stock 1600 T1 though works better in the
1641-1776 sort of T1 range.  They are usually jetted a bit lean for a 2000cc
actually, in the day they came jetted for 1700/1800 or 2000 in the T4 world,
but somewhere along the way they all became jetted the same for T4 kits.  So
you'd likely need to rejet it, and probably even if it looks good, if it has
been run, then setting, it will need a rebuild kit and they are $35, and you'd
need the manifold, and a linkage for a T1, etc, etc.  Basically you'd be
assembling this:

but would probably be $100-120 into the bits to assemble it.  CB could
probably supply the parts, would definitely be able to tell you how to jet it
and supply the jets, or Larry's Offroad if on the east coast likely has the
manifold.  Or could find the whole shebang on samba.

etc.
 
They
sell used with T4 or T1 manifolds for in the $125-175 range depending on how
complete, carb alone, maybe $50-75 if it looks real nice.

Linda that carb is a two barrel downdraft carb really designed for inline 4's
and modified for Type 4 engines. Your 1600 would not be a good match for this
really. If you are using a stock dual port 1600 Type 1 engine then I would
suggest you stick to the stock 34pict Solex carb that was used on the 1600.
