Yup, first thing is to study the wiring diagram for your year model. VW
made little changes almost every year.

Then do check all the dash switches. They can get loose and the back sides
twist and contact the metal dash causing intermittent shorts. Just reach
behind and see if they are firm, won't twist/turn. If they do move,
reorient them so the terms on the back are clear of the dash, then tighten
the ring nut on the front.

The wiring diagrams in the Bentley will show the size of fuze for each
position. Also, when new, the fuze block cover would have symbols over
each fuze indicating the primary item/s on that circuit.
