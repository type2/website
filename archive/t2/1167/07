To the original question, I have traveled most of the longest remaining stretch of the Original Route 66 in my bus. It was awesome by all accounts, except for the torrential rain that wandered through. 
We went from Kingman to Seligman, which takes you through Truxton, Peach Springs, and of course, Grand Canyon Caverns - where there is a campground nice enough to have held a big VW campout last spring. I recommend taking the cavern tour also, great stuff. 

I wish I could have meandered a bit more, but the weather dictated our day more than anything. 

From what I remember, cell coverage was spotty at best.
