ouch !
I was thinking about a secondary cage (rollbar ? ) on the front - best
would be of durable aluminum , bolted to the underside and to another
frame at the rooftop, wherever the strongest points of the body are.
such cage will mimic , repeat the shape of the frame but transfer the
possible impact to structurlly stronger points which are not in front
of the drivers seat.
any welder ready for a sketch and orders?

this wreckage reminds me about the warning not to use the spare tire
option in front of the weak front wall!
