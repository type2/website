Subject: MB manifold for single Weber 32/36 DFAV?

My 72 came with two single carb manifolds to go with the AW code 1800
engine, and my case has a clamp in the center bolt that matches an eyelet in
the bottom of the manifold.  Both manifolds have an MB cast into the bottom,
does anyone know who made this?  The archive doesn't provide a hint and
neither does Google.  

It also came with two 2 barrel carbs.  I had a closer look at them and one
is a Weber 32 36 DFAV, it looks to be new or close to it.  The other is a
weird 2 barrel that has been used, not marked other than an 12R 5765 B cast
into the upper housing and Motorcraft in what appears to be the electric
choke housing.  I was thinking that it might be for a Capri or other Euro
Ford but Google found me a link below that suggests it's from an early
Pinto:

My plan is to use the Weber, the Pinto carb appears to be a PITA to tune
from what is noted in the line above, but the archives tell me that a lot of
listers have used them in the past.  Any preferences out there?  This is
going to be a summer driver in  Ohio, not a 4 season vehicle.

TIA

Joe

Welcome to the list Joe. Be sure to check the library at Type2.com.
Searching the archives can also yield rich, detailed explanations that you
might not get as much attention to on a new request.

I love the Type 4 engine myself and have a 1700 on my 74 bus. I love my
center mount Weber progressive, but you will hear a lot of people curse it.
