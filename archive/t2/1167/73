Subject: Re: [T2] Weber carb

On installing a Weber progressive on a T1 engine, be sure you get a 
manifold with the throttle cable adapter. Somebody out there sells a 
manifold with it. This is a pivot mechanism which lowers the cable 
connection point to nearly the stock carb position. Without the 
mechanism the cable will not run smoothly.

Pmail me if you would like a picture of my home made mechanism.
