Subject: Re: [T2] bus wreck in Boulder

 recently,"sort of", I was involved in a what started out to be a head on.
The other vehicle didn't see me! He was avoiding rear ending a car in front
of him so he took my lane to avoid that... seeing him coming at me,, I
jumped out of the drivers seat, into the passenger area.. and took the top
of the steering wheel with me.. that made the van swerve very hard to the
right,, avoiding the head on. But he still managed to hit me along the side
,, sort of like a T bone ,, that caused the van to swerve back to the left,
and popped me back into the drivers seat! Where I had time to step on the
brakes and stop the game [so I could get off].... thankfully it was less
than 30mph,, and I didn't suffer any injury,,, my camper is still waiting
for paint, after the repairs.

Of course a seat belt is a good Idea,, I risked a lot of personal injury
being thrown around ,, and out of control,,  but I ride 2 wheels a lot,, so
no seat belt, and no helmet if I can get away with it!   One day I will be a
statistic!

I couldn't imagine what that impact would have been like without a seat belt
on!!
