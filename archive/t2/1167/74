Subject: Weber carb

From time to time Webers and Dellortos are mentioned on the forum.  I DO NOT
have any experience with these cars but a book dealing with another car does
make the following statement which, perhaps, may be of use.

"A common mistake made by first-time users of Webers an Dellortos is bolting
the carbs up solid to the intake manifolds.  This can, especially with Webers,
cause a float bowl vibration problem which lead to frothing of the fuel.  To
prevent this it is necessary to use rubber O-rings between carb and manifold,
and the securing nuts should only be tightened sufficiently to effect a seal."
(Tuning the A-Series Engine by David Vizard)

From this mention "frothing" must not be a good thing - it's not a good idea
to shake your beer either, is it?  :-)
