Hi Joe,

I don't know if people are busy with the season, or if no one had an
idea of how to help you because of the vagueness of the problem.

Electricals are not my forte, so I rarely chime in on this type of
thread anyway. I will say that depending on the year of your bus, 16
amp may not be the right fuse. The earlier the bus, the more likely it
is only supposed to have 8 amp fuses, or at least fewer 16s.

So melting or blowing, either way means a short. It is just tedious to
track it down, and is not easily diagnosed over the net. You need to
start tracing back the wires fed by that fuse.

Good luck and Merry Christmas,

John
