Subject: cargo door, brakes problem

Marry Christmas to all !
tried to look in haynes for the cargo sliding door of T2 (1970) . the
mechanism which slides on the middle ( outside on the panel ) rail
broke. Doesnt hold the door on a distance. Door scratching the panel
and doesnt close tight. I assume there is some kind of spring inside
this mechanism which doesn hold any more. Anyone with reference how to
fix it ? is it possible or I have to look for totally new mechanism?

winter came and I got a brake problem... rear drum brake gets stuck
even when a slight pressure applied. it is intermittent - driving a
while and gets away . I assume I have to bleed the lines and check for
rust / scratches on the cylinders. Unfortunately the bleeding vents
are to be replaced - they are rusty and I couldnt get the wrench a
good hold. Looking for a replacement before I continue the job. Are
they specific for VW cylinders, i.e. - thread ? ... or I could get a
replacement from the local auto part store ?
