Yea, I was a bit disappointed in that myself.  The 62 was a transition year
from the little round ones to the late split/ early bay, but the red blocks
they used really look more like Late bay in size.  However being full red
you could just say they are the late split tail lights, since they dont'
have multi colored lenses ;)
