I took a couple of weeks in 2002 and drove Rte66 Eastbound from
Victorville, CA to Winslow, AZ.  I made every effort to use the
old alignments by following a map from the internet like this one

Side trip to the Grand Canyon on the way to Winslow Crater.  Then
turned South to Sedona, AZ and the Jerome Jamboree XII.  Back home
to LA across the hot Mojave Desert.

Before you leave town, get a good map and plan your waypoints,
service your VW and sign up with A.I.R.S. as a volunteer.
Gute fahrt,
