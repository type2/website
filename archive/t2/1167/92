I'm curious, about some of these front tire mounts.  I've seen lots of the
aftermarket spare tire mounts which just bolt on to the front panel as you've
all described.
Was there a "factory" option for front tire mounting?  If so,
did it mount to the front in the same way?

When I get the time, I'll post
some photos of my front spare mounting.
It was part of the camper conversion
from Viking.

It's a little nicer in that it's an L-shaped piece of sheet
metal.  The bottom of the L is mounted to the top of the front bumper.
At the
top of the L there are two brackets.  The front bracket has the lugs for
mounting the spare.  The rear bracket attaches to the front grille and is
basically used for stability.
So all the load from the wheel and mount is
handled by the bumper.
Maybe in time this will deform the bumper, but it seems
to be of a heavier gauge steel as well as being easier to replace.

Right. Seems unavoidable. I planned not to repair the sag dent in
the
last bus I had with one. The rest of the body and paint was passable,
but
I decided that the dent was hidden by the tire and would likely
just happen
again anyway if I fixed it.

I don't like
silicone because of later hassles for painting. If you
decide to use it,
smooth the face, wipe with alcohol around the holes
before the silicone sets,
and let it overflow behind for grip.

That's a notoriously difficult area to get your fingers to. A real
challenge even for just changing an emblem.

good half hour at the local  wall of fasteners
looking for a match for the one
screw I had that fit the inserts.  Problem
was, I was looking in the metric
section and I later found the insert was a
10-24 thread!  Didn't see that one
coming!

Typical for made in the USA VW accessories. Why not just keep it
simple and plug your inserts with well-greased bolts?

Have fun,
