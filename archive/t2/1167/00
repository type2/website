Subject: "more spark plug stuff"

back in the mid 70s, a friend raced a Vega V/8..especially 'built' for road
courses with a 'mucho HP" engine, that if anything major ..broke..we were to
send entire motor back to California shop..and we were in Canada!  "They'
siad..to throw away the spark plugs after any 'running time', because the
combustion chamber equation, was altered!  Now adays..with much more spark
plug 'savvy', I heard a parts counter person..state to a person with a
'current production Domestic truck"..that he should never have to replace his
plugs..which got me to thinking.. that the spark plug technology has improved
'light years', and if we use them in our current rides, which are ..'old'
tech, how can anything we do, be seen as 'good evidence' to base a
..conclusion on!  If you do it, and it works for you..great..because..what I
say contrary to what you have ..'found'..creates a 'non linear'..new
understanding..so..if it worked for you..and you are still running..must be
good!
To all my fellow 'Bus Lovers"..everywhere, have a Great Xmas, and if yours is
on the road, give it a "huge" hug, and if yours is in a dry stall, just go sit
in it and enjoy it, even if it is not running!
Merry Xmas from the "Best Coast of Canada'!
