Sure it could work with the correct intake manifold

for example the intake shown in the following photo:

kits

but it also might need to be re-jetted for the smaller displacement
engine. If previously tuned for a 1700 engine you might be close
enough that it will just work (though my guess is it would run a tad
rich).

are you putting a 1600 engine in your '73 bus? US or European '73? If
you're putting a type 1 engine where a type IV engine used to live
you'll also need to figure out the rear engine mounting and filling in
the extra space so the cooling system works correctly, something like
the filler panel listed here:
