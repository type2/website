Well, it's possible since the Weber is a power upgrade over the stock
dual Solexes. The baby Dells are probably about the same CFM rating as
the Weber. Of course, remember that with the Dells and Solexes, under
high throttle positions, each cylinder draws from one barrel, but from
two barrels on the Weber.

That has to be a statement that is relative to either an SVDA in bad
condition or either dizzy misadjusted. The 009 is a serious
performance downgrade, but I am not opposed to using it in
contingencies when an SVDA is not available, or in high-performance
dual carb setups where a proper vacuum signal is not sent at cruise
due to the low cruise throttle positions provided by high-powered
carbs.

Take care,

John
