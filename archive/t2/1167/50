What John said.

I scrapped a pair of new Hakkas ($265 + shipping) in 3000 miles due to  
bad alignment. When I replaced them, I drove it directly to the  
alignment rack. Ten blocks. Less than a mile. I took Bentley along  
with me and paid to have it aligned to the specs, not to 'good  
enough.' The wrench was resistant at first until I explained I was not  
concerned about price. I was concerned about correct alignment.

Caster is the hard one.  You set camber and toe then you measure  
caster. Changing it changes the other two. A good wrench usually gets  
it on the 2nd go round.

Computerized Laser Hunter will give 'green' readings when it's still  
well out of spec.
