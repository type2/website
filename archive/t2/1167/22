I would really like to thank Jim for posting this.  As I re-read that late
last night, a thought occurred to me.  I was speaking to Steve Dolan this week
and he too had been thinking of now absent friends.  So I would suggest on
this holiday, for all to take a quiet moment and remember friends,
particularly from the lists and VW world now absent.  There are unfortunately
so many, may they live in our memories.
 
John

Every
year, I would write Bob and ask his permission to repost the following. It got
to the point where he would send permission before I remembered that it was
time to ask.  We lost Bob a year and a half ago. I can't ask anymore.  I miss
that.
