Santa (my wife) got me the Lego VW for Christmas.  It would have taken you
3 hours without the kids "help".  At least that's how it works around my
house.

I'm planning on much more than 3 hours to get it done with help from my 8
year old son.  It looks like a giant time sink, just like the real thing!
