Subject: ignition folly

greetings, on my 69 bus the key was pulled, and the ignition stayed on. the
car cut out as in stalled. both idiot lights remained glowing and the key
will no longer re-enter the cylinder. i disconnected the battery for now.
i'm looking for suggestions on how to get the key in, thanks in adv., steve
