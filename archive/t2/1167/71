Linda that carb is a two barrel downdraft carb really designed for inline 4's and modified for Type 4 engines. Your 1600 would not be a good match for this really. If you are using a stock dual port 1600 Type 1 engine then I would suggest you stick to the stock 34pict Solex carb that was used on the 1600. They are readily available on www.thesamba.com to purchase used, and you can even buy new aftermarket clones like these ones from www.cip1.com

Stay stock, be happy. :-)
