Subject: Re: [T2] AW code NGK spark plug question

To add to John Kolak's information:

Carbureted 1800 1974's are an AW series engine

Fuel Injected 1800 1974 is an ED, used thru 1975, then they went GD in
1976 for the 2.0 with mechanical followers, then the GE in 1978 with
the hydraulic followers.

Note:  1974 ED engines were originally installed on California
Automatics.  California Manual Trans used the AW engine,  This was due
to DOT and California EPA restrictions of that year.

The Samba listings in some instances are incorrect and they are
corrected with this post.

I have used NGK BR5ES and the Bosch equivalent W8CC/WR8CC in both
carbed and FI enngines, both working just fine.  However, if you do
alot of prolonged driving at speed, I recommend the BR6ES or the
W7CC/WR7CC plugs.  BTDT.

Note:  The lower the old style number, the hotter the plug, perfect
for around town and winter driving.  In hotter ambient temps with
prolonged highway driving a colder plug is recommended for better heat
transfer. B6ES/BR6ES and W7CC/WR7CC is superseded to a 3 or 4 digit
number for better computer accounting and inventory product management
at the manufacturer and warehouses.  These numerical identifications
are often worthless without knowing what actual spark plug is
represented.  Airhead/VWG sells by the old "W" for better ID, but I
have to order them using the numerical number.  Another note:  Non
resistor plugs were discontinued by Bosch last year and have been
superseded to the resistor style.
