Nice write-up, Bob.

Cell phones change everything, don't they? It's hard to feel the  
thrill of isolation that I once did when traveling around California  
and Arizona. I've thought about going for weekend trip without a  
phone, but that seems so stupid and reckless. So as a second-best,  
I've thought about taking the most basic phone I can get, without  
internet capability or email, and pay as you go, so that I would have  
to load minutes or something in case I needed to use it. Or lock a  
phone in a box with a glass door and leave the key at home.
