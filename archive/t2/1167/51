Subject: Free 90 amp battery isolator

Hey Everyone,
I have a battery isolator that I bought a loooooooong while ago and I 
never found a use for it (ended up getting the hellroaring isolator 
instead).  This is the model:

It's never been used and it's free to whoever wants it - all I ask is 
that you pay shipping.  Please email me if you're interested.

Thanks,
Mike
