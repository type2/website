Subject: AW code NGK spark plug question

My AW code engine rebuilt by the previous owner is equipped with AC Delco
R44XL plugs.  I'm not an AC Delco fan, I switched to NGK over Bosch Supers
some years ago on the advice of a local import car parts guy who switched to
NGK's in his 911 and had really good luck.  

The AC Delco R44XL Xrefs to an NGK BR6ES, I went to Amazon and their vehicle
ID for a 74 transporter with a 1.8 twin carb Xrefs to an NGK BR5ES.  

I looked at the archives and found a number of posts on this subject,
including some Xref information between Bosch and NGK.  

Here is my barrier....when I go to a spark plug site such as Bosch and plug
in a 1974 VW transporter to get the recommendation for making the Xref, the
AW code shows it as being fuel injected, which mine was not.  

I just want a base NGK plug for my AW code engine with single Weber
carburation, summer use and winter use if they are different.  What are you
guys using?

Thanks

Joe
