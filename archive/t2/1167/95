Subject: Re: [T2] AW code NGK spark plug question

To all,
My vote is always going to be the NGK BP6ET, triple electrode plug.
I have been using them for years on my FI type 4 engines with very good
luck.  
I used to be a purist as far as Bosch goes, but when they started dumping
those 
cheaply made plugs made in India (probably by 5 year old children) I
stopped using 
Bosch for plugs.

Where they are available, I use multi-electrode plugs in all of my cars.

I'm off to Haiti for the next three weeks...... fun in the sunshine.
