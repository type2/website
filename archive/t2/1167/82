Subject: Front tire carrier to VW emblem

Hey folks -

On my 72, a front mounted spare tire carrier came with the bus, but was not
mounted.  I figured since there were threaded inserts already in the holes,
I would just mount the carrier and tire up there, I kinda like the look of
it.  Looking in the archives via a search for "spare tire carrier", I see
some folks have had problems with the metal tearing out and denting from the
weight/position of the tire, I thought I would just put an emblem on there,
I have one left that is hanging downstairs in my bar.   Problem is, I have
those threaded inserts in the holes where the emblem pins usually go.  I
didn't see anything in the archives about how to do this.  I could drill out
the threads and use silicone to fill the holes around the pins, or look at
the backside of the nose panel and see if I can remove the inserts, has
anyone done this and if so, how?  

On a related note, I spent a good half hour at the local  wall of fasteners
looking for a match for the one screw I had that fit the inserts.  Problem
was, I was looking in the metric section and I later found the insert was a
10-24 thread!  Didn't see that one coming!  

TIA

Joe
