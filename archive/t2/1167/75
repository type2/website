Subject: Re: [T2] Weber carb

I agree John, but the KISS principal in me just begs for stock. I started 
the whole VW scene in 1972 with the purchase of a 67 bug. Being young and 
immortal I soon realized that the stock 1500 was not making it happen. Of 
course Fisher's book How to HotRod VW's didn't help much. I made my way 
through outrageous mechanical motor concoctions including Zenith's, Holley 
Bugsprays, dual Solex's (still one of the best setups in my mind, marketed 
as kadrons in the day) etc. I finally figured out after being marooned in 
the middle of the Mojave one day that if I'd just left the engine stock, I 
wouldn't be baking slowly to death and down to a few cans of Bud to stave 
off the Grim Reaper. :-) Luckily, I was able to diddle the Holley Bugspray 
carb to a modicum of cooperation and get out of the blast furnace. Since 
then, I've pretty much advocated  stock FOR THE STREET. :-) That's my 
reasoning, and I'm stickin' to it. LOL!!
All the best,
Courtney
