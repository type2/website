Welcome to the list Joe. Be sure to check the library at Type2.com.
Searching the archives can also yield rich, detailed explanations that you
might not get as much attention to on a new request.

I love the Type 4 engine myself and have a 1700 on my 74 bus. I love my
center mount Weber progressive, but you will hear a lot of people curse it.

Let us know when we can help.

Have fun,

John
