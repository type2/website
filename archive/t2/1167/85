Subject: Re: [T2] MB manifold for single Weber 32/36 DFAV?

I have one of these on my T1 1776. It has a Scat manifold with the 
heater tubes. It runs OK. I've played with the jets etc, but the 
default set up from the factory seems to be pretty close to what it 
should be. Be sure to follow the factory set up instructions on the 
idle settings.  Next make sure all the linkages are set up correctly. 
I had a problem with the second barrel being cracked open slightly at 
idle as the 2nd barrel adjustment screw was turned in about 1/2 turn 
too much. Big improvement when I got that one figured out.
