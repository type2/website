Subject: Dixie Bus Gathering 

I crashed the Dixie Bus site a week or so ago.

I have added a page for directions, and a page of what to expect.

You should be able to get directions at

www.geocities.com/dixie_bus_gathering

For the event T-shirt collectors....
Shirts are on order, I will have some at the gathering, they are in the
bright day glo colors (safety green etc) and the XXL are in a blue for you
manly types. 
The cost of the shirt is $13, and $15 for the XXL.

This event is located in Central Ohio, with a local Dixie Days festival, and
the largest VW car show in the Midwest.  

Everyone that visits Rustic Knolls raves about the beauty.  Bring the kids
for a wonderful family outing.

New attractions this year:

Game room
Basketball
New Horseshoe pits

We will have a cara-bus to the VW show bright and early Sat morn (usually 20
or so vehicles) and we will offer the FMBC breakfast burrito Sun morn.

How'd I do JB?  Energetic enuff?

Make it a Great Day!!
