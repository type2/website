Performance, economy, safety. Not necessarily in that order.

CHT from DD: $120-ish
2 O2 sensors: $8
2 bungs welded in: What, $20?
Gauge and switch made by yours truly: Less than $10 since I already
have most of what I need.

I can get awesome information about my engine from that $38
investment, including good indicators about if I'm running hot. The
CHT gauge will also tell me much about my engine and is an excellent
indicator if my #3 cylinder (or wherever I put it) is running hot.

I like O2 better personally. Especially since there will be one for
each pair of cylinders. A good CHT is definitely coming, but I have
other projects that need done first. This is an opportunity because
that Empi muffler is already going to the muffler shop either next
payday or the one after, depending on where I can squeeze the $$ from.

Thanks for the suggestions all. I'll let everybody know how it goes.
