Because the size of the step is slightly bigger than size of the  
gasket if you will lower the compression ratio anyway but I think  
this is intended. Using both the step and gasket will mean not enough  
squish in the combustion chamber.

You can probably stick something through the piston pin bore to keep  
the piston from move when you rest the cylinder but in a jam a large  
hose clamp should work to compress the rings.
