I put mine in the 3/4 header.  Granted it's only looking at half the 
engine, but it was able to keep my engine in check during my smog test, 
so I think it's working nicely.  When the megasquirt supports dual o2 
sensors, I'll put one on both sides.

Here's a pic:

Looking at the bottom of the picture you can see a rectangular piece of 
metal.  That is a rock guard blocking the sensor(not installed yet in 
that picture).

depending on your exhaust, you can put the sensor after the pipes join 
up before the cat.  But that is obviously dependant on your exhaust 
system.  I took mine off and switched to a muffler that got rid of that 
whole cat setup so I had to run off the header.

the farther from the cylinders, the more delayed it will be.  I found 
this to be true with my previous setup and placing it in the sensor made 
it much more responsive.  It also actually reads correctly at idle. 
Even if you have a heated sensor, it still doesn't work quite well at 
idle unless it's nice and close to the cylinders.

thanks,
