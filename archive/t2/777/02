Subject: Re: [T2] Loose ends -oil temp

I can only speak for myself and the 250,00mi  never rebuilt engine in 
our 78: I try to keep it at 240 deg top temp even if it means doing 55 
on a 90 deg plus day.   I may be the only one on record who likely will 
fail a bearing (main or rod?) before a head, as my oil pressure is about 
24 at crusing speed. Also, NEVER floor it for longer than about 15 sec 
before going to the next lower gear.  As Mark? pointed out, it is 
usually the intake valve seat that loosens, usually due I think to 
getting the head really hot when floored too long, and then getting it 
cooled too quickly when you let go and burn no gas.  Also, I am certain 
that manifold to head leaks can damage a head exhaust valve, for my 
lowest compression (about 105) is in number one, where for a long time I 
had an exhaust leak; when I pulled the manifold to check it, the copper 
oval gasket had burned away to a half moon.  The hot gases coming out 
can heat the area excessively.

  anyone tell me roughly at what oil temperature I
  should be worrying/slowing down, to avooid this
