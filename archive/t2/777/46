Subject: Curious about engine temps

Mine is an 81 Air Cooled Vanagon. It has a VDO oil temp gauge with the
sensor in the oil drain plug, which may not give  me a lot of useful,
accurate temps, but it keeps an eye on things on hot days going up the mts.
It helps my outlook to see it go up a bit, then come down as the road levels
out so I know it is cooling itself properly :-)

I often dwell too much on dropping a valve seat, and would buy an engine
head temp gauge if I could afford it,but alas.......

I am wondering if anyone would care to take a lighthearted, SWAG as to what
the oil temp would be, if the engine was running so hot as to warp the head
and lead to dropping  an intake valve seat. I realize there are lots of
variables, and no promises. I have seen my gauge get up to 250-260 degrees,
at which point I find a nice place to park, and shut it down. Given all good
tin, a clean engine, etc, at 260 degrees in the drain plug, am I coming
close to overheating the heads and risking valve seat issues? Anyone have
both type gauges for comparing?

Its just a general inquiry, looking for some kind of relationship between
head temps and oil temps. It gets rather hot out here in Utah during the
summer, and sometimes I stay home, rather than risk hurting my baby during
the hottest days. A cyl head gauge is on the list, but there is so much
ahead of it...... :-)

Anyway, just wondering if folks have an opinion. Seems like there are always
several for any number of topics. <g>

Thanks,

John
