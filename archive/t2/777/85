Subject: Rebuild questions

Here's a question I have cross-posted to the Samba and STF. It seems 
there are a lot on this list that don't post on those other sites so I 
would definitely like to get your input.

Hi all,
I own a 1970 Westy that currently has a 1776 in it. This engine leaks 
oil like crazy. I pulled the engine thinking it was the rear main seal. 
To my surprise I found about a tube and a half of JB-Weld smeared in 
front of #3. Right down the middle of the epoxy is a nice old crack. 
AAARGH I paid a dude a bunch of money to "restore" my bus about 5 years 
ago and got screwed!!  I know I know boo hoo.

On to my question. I have always wanted to build an engine and now might 
be as good a time as any. What I was wondering is what should I build? I 
have absolutely no experience building an engine. My understanding is 
that a stroker will give me more low end torque which seems like it 
would be good for a bus. Assuming things are in decent shape, could I 
re-use my current cylinders (should be 90.5 right?)? Would something 
like this be too much for me to bite off for a first time build?

Finally can someone give me a ballpark idea as to what this might run me 
dollars-wide? I'm not looking to pinch every penny, but it needs to be 
reasonable so my wife doesn't make me sleep in the garage. This bus will 
be my daily driver, so it'll have to be reliable. I also already have a 
set of Kads I plan on sending out to AJ Sims to give a once over that I 
will need to use.


Thanks
Zach
