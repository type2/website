hmmm.... how would I find out for sure? The AMC heads
I have on ther did have the head gasket, and the Tom
Wilson book says use the gasket for all Type 4
engines.

If it turns out they do require the gasket, does that
mean no lapping the cyls/heads is necessary? I'd like
to avoid lapping if possible, since i'd have to remove
the cylinders (the motor's still in the van, and I
left the cylinders on for now), which would mean
replacing them again afterwards, and probably breaking
a ring in the process, knowing my luck ;-)

There is a VW bulletin floating around where they specify not using a head 
gasket on rebuilt engines. However, to maintain the compression ratio you 
need to put a shim under the cylinders. Some have also said to lap the 
cylinders into the head to prevent leaks. In your case, I would use a head 
gasket if there is already one and save the cylinder lapping for your next 
rebuild! ;)
