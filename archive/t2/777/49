THey are not really related. Oil temp goes up with RPM, Head temp goes
up with load. So if heads are hot, and you rev up the RPMs to get
lower head temps, you get higher oil temps. If oil temps are high and
you drop RPMs to get lower oil temps, you get higher head temps.

Considering your investment, you really can't afford not to own an
accurate Dakota Digital gauge. About $100 plus about $20 for the
sensor.

 the oil temp would be, if the engine was running so hot as to warp the head
 and lead to dropping  an intake valve seat. I realize there are lots of
 variables, and no promises. I have seen my gauge get up to 250-260 degrees,
 at which point I find a nice place to park, and shut it down. Given all good
 tin, a clean engine, etc, at 260 degrees in the drain plug, am I coming
 close to overheating the heads and risking valve seat issues? Anyone have
 both type gauges for comparing?
