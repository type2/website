Subject: Re: [T2] Part Help Needed

> While driving home the other day, my gas pedal went to the floor. No
problem I think. I go the import shop and get a new cable. However, when
I go to install it today. I find what I think is a "broken" part. The
metal piece the cable feeds into is hanging "loose". Three parts stores
and two hours later, I still don't have a replacement nor know exactly
what the name of this part is.
 
If anyone can help with both the name and a vendor, I would truly
appreciate it.

Front or rear of bus?

Year of bus? 

Engine?

Carb or FI?

Is it #14 here? http://www.ratwell.com/technical/Microfiche/t206100.gif
