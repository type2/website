Subject: Wire harness desperately needed!

Hi all!  Update on my "fried solenoid wire" project.

Have removed the alternator, had it tested, it's OK.

Bought new starter & new voltage regulator & am about to install.

My mechanical skills are coming along nicely.

Trouble is, I can't find the all-important wire harness ANYWHERE!  This is
the wire harness & wiring that runs from the starter to the voltage
regulator and alternator.  They don't make them new anymore.  Busted Bus in
Boulder has one on an old bus, but they "might be able to get to it in a
week or so" (it is a pain to get off) and it costs $60.  Called about ten
used parts places and nobody has it.  We're in Colorado Springs with no
wheels and need to leave town this weekend - was hoping to get the bus going
to go to the Denver Bug-In on Sunday.

Does anybody have one of these harnesses lying around or know where I can
get one?  I am considering making one - the rubber grommets on my
super-fried wire are all OK - but am worried it's beyond my expertise, and I
really don't want this to happen again due to my ignorance.  The wire fry
was so bad I'm really lucky I didn't lose my entire bus.

Any ideas or tips are much appreciated!

Thanks!
