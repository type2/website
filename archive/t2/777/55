Subject: Re: [T2] Curious about engine temps

I've got the same thing and use it the same way.   I
know that it normally reads the temp too high, which
is better than the other way around.  On the freewy
running 65 or so, mine'll get to 250 on a hot day. 
But it normally stays around 200-220.  I've seen
higher temps lately as the heat index has been over
100 here.  The air is not as dry as out there and that
contributes to heating.  Sounds like you're ok.  I'm
going to spring for one of those Dakota Digitals as
soon as I'm back in the black myself.  Cheers...KR
