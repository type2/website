The best place on the 75-78 exhaust is the u-bend. On the others, you  
have to wled your bung into the manifold just before the HE. Scott  
Lyons had a great picture of this before his personal website went  
offline.

What are you trying to do? Locate a bad cylinder while driving? You  
can't tune individual cylinders as easily as cylinder banks  
(considering your two carb setup).

The tailpipe is a bad location because fresh air is sucked in from  
the exhaust pulses. Your reading near idle would not be accurate.
