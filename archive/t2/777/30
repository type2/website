Subject: Brake adjusting star clip replacement

Hi folks,

Does anyone have advice on fabricating one of the spring steel clips 
that keep the adjusting star from backing off (1970, rear)?  One side 
of one of my clips has broken off.  The guy at the parts store 
recommended that I simply knurl the barrel a little to hold the star in 
place, but that seems tenuous at best.

Thanks!
