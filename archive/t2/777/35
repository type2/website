Subject: Re: [T2] clean out crank case without opening it?

A buddy of mine is one of the best mechanics in town and he recommended that I run a quart of tranny fluid in my oil periodically to clean the engine.  He says it works better than the more expensive additives and won't do any harm.  I haven't put any in my bus yet but have other vehicles.  Cheers....KR



I had a friend that used to substitute a quart of auto tranny oil for engine oil and drive it that way... Dunno 'bout that one..
