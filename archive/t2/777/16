Hi Jen,

Anything you can do to flush it while on the bench is good. I have
also seen recommended that you fill it with straight Automatic
Transmission Fluid and run it briefly to flush out the motor. I
haven't heard any feedback on the other suggestion to actually use a
quart of ATF in your oil and drive that way. It's too thin to protect
the motor to drive with straight ATF, but one quart in the oil might
not hurt for a short while.

 out to the parts cleaner, and run paint thinner
 through it for a few days.
