Subject: Re: [T2] Intake manifold for Holley 2 barrel/1600

Dave and Will, thanks for the education.I haven't see anything that I wouldn't need to make work. 
What I now have I can make work w new heat riser tubing. Think I may use copper tubing attached to old flanges.
I had no idea how many different intake styles are out there. 
Kinda thought I'd find something economical, ready to install. 
Don't want to put too much into this as I reckon I'll be reverting to stock one of these days.

Denny
