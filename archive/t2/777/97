Actually it's easy for me as I've been reading them for more years than I
care to admit and they are very simple.  

For example: there are only two fuses (yes, only two) on the fuse block... I
think there is another one inline with the fuel pump.  Anyway, one fuse is
always on and the other is ignition... simple.  The ignition switch on my
MGA has two positions On/Off... there is a separate starter switch and it is
just a pull cable to a heavy duty switch in the engine compartment.  So if
you ever want to steal an old MG, you can either reach under the dash and
hot wire it or just put a paper clip between the fuses and pull the starter.

Impossible!
