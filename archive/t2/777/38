Subject: Re: [T2] Part Help Needed

I can get these from my local vw store, they are for clamping the cables on
the heater boxes and the throttle cable...however, the only thing that i can
see that could go wrong with the barrel nut is if the threads have stripped,
this is only used to clamp down on the end of the throttle cable. Once, I
have used several small zip ties to get it home, but would not recommend it
as a permanent fix.
 if you like I can send you a few, im sure they are fairly cheap less than a
dollar from my local vw part store. I could also call them and get the part
number for you if you like :)
 good luck!
