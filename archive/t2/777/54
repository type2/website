they are on zig zag lines. 
A bit difficult to describe, but if you have one you know what I mean. 
I'm wondering does it get set to the line next to the number, or to the lower 
leg of that same zig zag line that touches the centerline?? whew!!
Instructions were no help, they showed straight lines.
I need to get this figured out before I can put my engine in. 
Thanks
