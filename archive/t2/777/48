I'm not disagreeing with dave, just to add a little info to this post on 2bbl applications, in my limited experience--most 2bbl carbs out there that I have seen are progressive (open first primary barrel then secondary), however these WON'T work with what dave calls the "correct" manifold (secondary feeding 2 cyls and primary feeding 2 cyls). an example of a progressive carb is the "NOT a Bugspray" the 3rd link below--this is the Holley licensed copy of the Weber 32/36DFEV e.g. Pinto application--and of course it won't work with what dave called the "correct" one--but it WILL work with the one it is shown in the photo with (big plenum, barrels oriented longitudinally to the bus).  the manifold I have seen is the one shown in the "NOT a Bugspray" link.  

The 2100 shown (I'm assuming this is similar to or same thing as bugspray?) has synchronous barrels (i.e. not progressive) that open at the same time, and dave's advice on manifolds applies to these primarily. 

somewhere I even saw a kit to run dual progressives. why one would want to run such a frankenstein instead of DRLAs or IDFs I dunno. 

I have a DP manifold (big plenum, barrels oriented longitudinally to the bus) similar to the "not a bugspray" manifold example that I would be happy to sell to you Denny, PM me for more info, heat riser tubes are virtually new.  I can even send a couple progressive carbs (solex 32/35DIDTA and another old solex progressive).  would it work with a synchronous Holley 2100, or Weber 34/34 or 38/38? probably. optimally? don't know, I haven't read the hot rod book.  It worked well with the progressive 32/35DIDTA that I ran for a time.

As with any carb, the key is going to be running the proper idle, main and air correction jets once you have it properly fitted.
