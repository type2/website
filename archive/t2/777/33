Subject: O2 Sensors

Those of you who've installed O2 sensors, where did you place them in
the exhaust?

Since they need to get hot to work, the tailpipe is a bad place. But
the HEs get in the way of anywhere else short of the vertical pipes.
Then you'd need 4 of 'em to get a total reading.

Now, I was thinking about putting the bung at the tailpipe, but with a
3 wire O2 sensor so that it heats itself. Would this be accurate?
