Subject: Re: [T2] Intake manifold for Holley 2 barrel/1600

Will,

Your advice is pretty much spot on although if I remember correctly
the reason that Holley's run correctly on the non plenum intakes are 
because they have a plenum balance slot built in to the bottom of the 
carb.

Been a long time in a land far away!  The Fischer book goes in to this 
extensively and explains what doesn't work right when you use the Bug 
Spray's on an intake with a big plenum hole under the carb.

Will, if you do a search for Holley on thesamba.com a guy has a set of Bug 
spray's  and intake manifolds for running dual Bug Spray's!!

The Fischer book did dyno runs with these and pointed out that the power 
derived from dual Bug Spray's was not all that much better than the 
single....IIIRC!

Oh! and the Holley's are progressive in just one way...mechanical.
Progressive on them is strictly about how fast the butterflys open.
One barrel feeds one side of the engine and....

Lordy, I miss those days a little.  I could make Holley's and a 009 just 
purr.  Now it's weber 48's and Mallory Unilites.

Will, thanks for reminding me about the "other" carbs and what
progressive means for them!

Cheers, dave

 however these WON'T work with what dave calls the 
"correct" manifold (secondary feeding 2 cyls and primary feeding 2 cyls).

why one would want to run such a frankenstein instead of DRLAs or IDFs I dunno.

similar to the "not a bugspray" manifold example that I would be happy to sell 
to you Denny, PM me for more info, heat riser tubes are virtually new.
