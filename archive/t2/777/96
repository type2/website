<What's so hard about, "Refill with magic smoke here"... ?-)>

What they heck do I BUY magic smoke? Been looking for a source for many moons... I figured I'd buy it and then refill later but if you can't find the refill point maybe I need to quit looking for magic smoke... <grin!> 

The schematics are not so bad. As I recall the top horizontal line represents the pos side of the battery, and the line at the bottom the chassis (neg). As a wire connects to anyting it is numbered. That number is found on the switch or electrical item most of the time. That item is also numbered and can be ID'd in the legend. 

Each wire has a color and that also is ID'd in the legend. The contacts inside the switch are presented in the drawing of a component many times and all of the ground terminals are ID'd. 

I found that the first time was difficult but has been easier every time I have studied the diagrams.

Now the schematics of the Navy ship I was stationed on... Now that was complicated!!! <griN!> Actually just finding the right page was complicated. A VW Bus is what - 15 ft long? That ship was several, several, stories high and 600+ ft long... <grin!> 

Hang in there. It DOES get easier.
