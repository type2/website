Denny, got the Fischer, "how to Hot Rod..." book?  Read more about the 
proper manifold there....and how to set up dual port intake manifolds 
properly in order to make it run well!"

Thanks Dave,
The links were educational.
Dual port.
Unsure re plenum.
Already using on a bus w lo pro cleaner. My heat riser tube is non repairable. I may just replace my heat riser tube if nothing ez shows up.

I'll keep my eye open for the Fisher, sounds relevant.
I'm not really trying to Hot Rod anything, came w bug spray and 009 25 years ago, works OK for me. I'm considering going back to stock, but now is not the time, I'm putting in a new Mexican longblock and don't want to make too many changes at one time, trouble shooting nightmare.

I can't believe this guy is asking $200 for a holley 2110 and so 
everyone knows what these look like...

This one is *not* a bug spray

Hmmm...interesting...not one single dual port holley intake manifold on 
thesamba.com

Denny, got the Fischer, "how to Hot Rod..." book? Read more about the 
proper manifold there....and how to set up dual port intake manifolds 
properly in order to make it run well!

Cheers, dave
