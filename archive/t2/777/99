Dave,

Thanks for the info.

For some reason I thought I read that the oil pressure switch was near the
firewall... could this be on other engines...

Wayne,

The sensor should be the oil pressure switch.

Oh, the other wire....hmm can't remember right now, but I think it has a 
fuse on it and goes over to the drivers side of the compartment and then 
to ...hmmm...I beter let someone else answer that one, but I guarantee 
you, if it is not on there, your bus will start(almost), but then 
die....at least if it is the same as the 78 version.


THe diagrams for buses that are a little older are wonderful...somewhere 
along 75 or so, they changed the method that that used to draw them and 
they stink....maybe because things started getting much more complicated 
in later models with FI and lots of other electrical goodies.

Cheers, dave
