Subject: Re: [T2] Intake manifold for Holley 2 barrel/1600

Denny,

Dual port or single port?....the correct intake manifold with no plenum? 
or the *wrong* one with a big plenum?

Gonna use this on a bus????  yer gonna need to check clearance on the top 
and probably get a low profile air cleaner assly.

And for those of you who are *not* an "oldtimer"...LOL!, they look like 
this.

wrong one looks like this

Right one looks like this

I can't believe this guy is asking $200 for a holley 2110 and so 
everyone knows what these look like...

This one is *not* a bug spray

Hmmm...interesting...not one single dual port holley intake manifold on 
thesamba.com

Denny, got the Fischer, "how to Hot Rod..." book?  Read more about the 
proper manifold there....and how to set up dual port intake manifolds 
properly in order to make it run well!

Cheers, dave
