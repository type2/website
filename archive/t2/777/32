Will;

Unfortunately, I live in Indiana where there are no emission testing 
requirements.  Consequently, it costs an arm and a leg to go to a speed 
shop to get this done.  In lieu of that, I installed an air/fuel ratio 
meter from CB performance that runs off the oxygen sensor ( I have a 
stock 79 cal emissions bus) so that I could adjust mixture properly 
(not needed).  I also verified the reading of this meter using an 
averaging voltmeter reading the output of the ox sensor.  When I 
installed my heads, I took great a great deal of time measuring stroke, 
deck height and cylinder head volume, then shimmed the cylinders at the 
base (no head gasket) to achieve a stock compression ratio of 7.3 : 1.  
I also took great care assembling the induction and cooling systems and 
verified that there were no vacuum leaks using a vacuum gauge. I had 
had the injectors cleaned and flow/balanced tested by Cruzin 
Performance.  Everything indicates normal except for the CHT gauge.  
The bus runs perfectly, hot or cold, at any speed and gets 20-21 mpg on 
the road.  So at this point, I'm no longer terribly concerned about the 
VDO CHT because I don't believe it is correct.  I use it as a trend 
indicator only.  When I get around to it I plan to install the Dakota 
Digital setup.
