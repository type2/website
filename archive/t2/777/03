Sounds like you are on the right track. AMC heads are known for
worthless hardware installed, but they ought to get you through your
trip, and then you can have them reworked as you planned. The only
difficulty I had in reinstalling a head was getting a good angle for
the torque wrench, but then I was using a beam type. A clicker would
have been nice here.

 and at that time buy another new AMC, get both of them
 machined together, and do the job properly

 true...
