Subject: RE: [T2] wiring diagrams

OK, I don't know if I'm along in this, but I find these wiring diagrams
tough to read and understand - I've got a '79 Westy.  I'm not new to this -
my Lucas electrical MG has an easier wiring diagram to understand.  I've
even figured out a buddy's old Fiat's wiring diagram and it was in Italian.
:-)

 

Anyway, on to my question - I've been checking out and trying to understand
the wiring in my '79 bus's engine compartment - today is the coil. as I
understand it, on one side of the coil - one wire goes to the distributor
and the other goes to F/I to as a trigger. on the other side of the coil -
one wire goes to ignition to energize the system. where does the other wire
go on this side of the coil?

 

Oh, BTW, there is a sensor right next to the distributor (towards the front
of the bus). what is this?

 

TIA,

 

Wayne
