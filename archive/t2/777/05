Subject: Good Ground for Engine

When I first got my '72 Bus, the battery area was almost completely rotted
out.  The Grounding area was gone.  I drilled a hole in the body area near
the rear vertical plate and installed a S/S bolt to use as a Ground.  From
there, I then ran an additional Ground to the Engine mounting bolt that
holds the starter.  I also cleaned up the factory grounding strap at the
transmission.  I have never had a problem related to grounding with this
setup.  I also installed the starting relay because I did not trust the old
wiring to be trouble free for starting.  I will need to run a new power wire
sometime.

Report on the derusting of the window frames.

After practicing on the middle side window frames, I proceeded to remove the
Windshield that had been leaking water into the front.  I expected to find
all my metal completely gone.  What a surprise, it was mostly intact with
just a couple of holes.  With POR-15, lots of scrapping and cleanup, the
repairs are underway.

I did have a problem of slowing Windshield Wipers then the headlights were
turned on go away when I had my alternator rebuilt at my local Bosch
distributer.  I am not really sure why that would have made a difference.
Wouldn't the battery still provide what was needed for amps, etc?
