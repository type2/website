Richard and Don,

I welded a bung into my #3 about 3 inches from the head when I re-did my 
Champagne edition.

My thoughts(and Scott's) were that that cylinder would run the hotest and 
give A/F numbers that would be usefull for the rest  ofthe engine.

In other words, it might be a little rich for the other cylinders, but 
that was ok if #3 was saved from running too lean.

Not many ECU's out there will actually modify the pulse width on a single 
cylinder to compensate...think of having an o2 sensor on each exhaust 
pipe.

+1 on all the other stuff that Richard said that I didn't quote.

Cheers, dave
