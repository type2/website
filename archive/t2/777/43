where did you place them in
the exhaust?

Since they need to get hot to work, the tailpipe is a bad place. But
the HEs get in the way of anywhere else short of the vertical pipes.
Then you'd need 4 of 'em to get a total reading.

Now, I was thinking about putting the bung at the tailpipe, but with a
3 wire O2 sensor so that it heats itself. Would this be 
accurate?*****************************

My bus came with the stock '79 california emissions setup.  The O2 
sensor is located at the collector where the exhaust streams from the 
two heater boxes merge into one, before the catalytic converter and 
muffler.  I think the idea is that you want it in the stream at the 
earliest point before the gas stream has a chance to cool.
