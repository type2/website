Subject: Re: [T2] Wire harness desperately needed!

Just make one... I had no wiring harnesses for my Corvair implant, have made all the wiring I needed. Nuy some GOOD crimpers, some GOOD strippers (not generally an all-in-one tool from the FLAPS), GOOD terminals, some GOOD shrink tubing, and a couple spools of GOOD wire. I can send pics of my tools and wire. You might still have $60 in it but you'll finish with some skills and some tools you can keep. You can buy multiple rolls of wire to color code it (take notes for future reference) or use multiple colors of shrink tubing to color code the ends of the wires. 

FWIW we have wired our street rods from scartch everytime. Not impossible at all.

the wire harness & wiring that runs from the starter to the voltage
regulator and alternator. >
