Subject: Re: [T2] Intake manifold for Holley 2 barrel/1600

Hey guys I have ran some of these  were true two barrel carb  both barrells 
opened at the same time  came in two sizes  200 and 300  made good power bad 
gas mileage and the base would freeze solid when it got real cold and the motor 
wouldnt run worth a danm till you thrawed the base out .  To drive in the 
winter you had to increase the engine heat a whole lot. not the best of carbs and 
now if you are changing the motor would be the time to up grade  later Mark
