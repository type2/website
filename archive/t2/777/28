George,


Exactamundo!  I looked at these devices many years ago and while they are 
really cool(pun intended) they require massive amounts of power to do 
anything interesting.

On a side note, the reason I got interested was because you could make
a peletier device out of iron and copper wire and then power it from a 
candle...made just enough power to barely run a 9v transistor radio.

So, my thought was why have an alternator at all...make a largish set
of the same iron/copper peletier junction devices and arrange for it to 
be around your exhaust(american car)...long tubes....then you wouldn't 
need an alternator at all...you would be using the heat from the exhaust 
to generate battery charging power.

Never got around to trying it though(on a car).

Chers, dave
