A couple things to share, (kinda bored today and such) but today I was driving
down I-95 just south of DC I saw a trailer carrying a few cars and one was a
most fetching Westie, green from NY and looking most good, hope it belongs to
someone on the list cause it's a keeper.
Yesterday while helping a friend move into a new house I spied at '72 camper.
 I stopped by and knocked on the door but no one answered so today when I came
back to finish up the move I figured on trying to say Hi again.   I expected
to meet a middle aged man and wife or someone old like me to be the proud
owner, instead as I drove by I saw a woman in her mid 20's and a couple kids
so I stopped to inquire about the bus.  So to my pleasant suprise she was the
actual owner but the kids belonged to a neighbor (she does have two, but not
those).  She
 bought the camper on thesamba and actually knew little about
them but just loved it.  I told her about type2 site and she said she may sign
up.  Next the actual owners of the kids came by and as we started talking
about the bus I found that the husband (also mid 20's) grew up camping in one
and as we were talking about it his wife was looking over the camper and
looked at her hubby and said "I want one!"  Too cool...
Since my fiancie is working I haven't got anything planned for the weekend but
meeting these people made the holiday a little bit nicer.  
I would like to think that 20 years from now when all these new luxury and
fancy sports cars we have today are rusting away in a junkyard, some young
couple will be buying an old VW camper, just like the one that their parents
had.  Sort of like that cycle of life thing, but the version that no one gets
eaten.
Enjoy the holiday
Stan
