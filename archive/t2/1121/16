Subject: Re: [T2] Upper bunk bed for sportsmobile conversion

One word of caution - there is an important frame rail at the C pillar (the
one at the rear edge of the sliding door) that gives strength and rigidity
to the roof, and to the structure of the bus itself. On late Westies, this
curved rail was replaced at the factory with a flat rail, which lowers the
height of the bed.
When I installed a late bay Westy top onto my old split camper, I welded in
a piece of 2x2 square steel tubing to replace that brace, and then ran 1x1
tubing longitudinally along the sides of the huge, gaping hole in the roof
to brace it up.
I know some have done it, but I STRONGLY caution you about removing that
brace completely and not doing any structural reinforcement to the (w)hole
roof. good luck,
