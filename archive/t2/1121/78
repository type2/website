You might try wiggling it while the engine is running (if it runs again) 
and see if it kills the engine and/or pump.  I would highly recommend 
getting some Caig DeoxIT and spray it on there:

that's the best stuff you can get for keeping your contacts in order. 
I'd go through and spray that stuff on *all* your contacts.

Yeah, time to change that thing out!

Well, it isn't so much of an issue about pressure as there really isn't 
that much except for the weight of the gas in the tank.  I was able to 
find the same sized hose at a Toyota dealer, but I'm sure you can 
probably source it from other places (boating store maybe?).  If yours 
is still good and not cracking, then you can reuse it.  If it's looking 
brittle, then you probably want to change it out.
