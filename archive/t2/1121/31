Subject: Re: [T2] Attitude adjustment

This morning I was going to take the bus into work. She started fine
and immediately idled low where I set it last night after the valve
adjustment. However, she wouldn't maintain the idle until I turned it
up to where it was a bit higher than normal. Should I expect that
since it had been a while since I had adjusted the valves that she is
gonna need a few more miles than 20 to blow out anything left over
from tight valves or am I looking at a separate issue?

All vacuum lines are in place and there aren't any leaks that I can
find. Should I expect the idle to be much higher until the engine is
warm (though I adjusted it to a nice low tone when it was warm last
night) or how do I determine if the idle isn't telling me there's
another issue to uncover?
