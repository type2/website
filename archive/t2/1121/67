Subject: odd tire sizes

Another question on tires. I got 2 new continental 185 70R 14's ( all I
could afford) on the bus currently are 205 70R 14, can I run 205 in the rear
and 185 in the front for a spell without any major troubles, my inspection
is up in July (this month) so I wonder if it will be a problem there (
Massachusetts)
