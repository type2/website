Sorry, but this is not true.  The main ground consists of 3 white wires 
that originate from the harness and go to a triple post spade ground lug 
that is just underneath the intake manifold.  The CHT is not the 
dedicated ground, and the car will still run without the CHT working 
properly, but it won't run well because the CHT sensor decreases 
resistance with increasing temp - an open circuit essentially looks like 
a very cold engine to the ECU.  This usually results in hard starts and 
an excessively rich mixture, but would not cause the engine to run 
intermittently.
