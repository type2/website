Hi Stan,

 

I believe the red button is the brake fluid test button. I mistakenly
thought it went to a sensor in the brake pads-it does not!

I think there is a sensor in the master cylinder. If you push this button it
should light up, which means you have brake fluid in the master cylinder. If
it doesn't light up, it means you need a new bulb or your fluid is not
getting to the master cylinder(ie you are out of brake fluid, or have a
clogged line somewhere).
