That's kinda odd.  First off you should be able to set the idle and both 
the idle and the timing should stay relatively rock solid assuming it's 
below 1600 RPM.

Soooo... to start, take off the vacuum hose that goes to the distributor 
vacuum can so you don't have any vacuum advance kicking in (probably 
don't, but precautionary).  Now train the light on the timing mark and 
set it so it's at 7.5 BTDC or so.  Your idle will go up or down 
depending on if you advanced or retarded it (advance speeds it up, 
retard slows it down).  Adjust your idle so it's around 900 and then 
adjust the timing again.  Centrifugal advance doesn't kick in until 1600 
RPM, so as long as you have it under that the whole time, you should be 
able to set the time to 7.5 and then dial in your idle to 900 and be 
done with it.

If your timing is hopping around, then you might want to check your 
points or the distributor cam.  Also make sure you have the timing light 
pickup on correctly and you're not getting crosstalk from other plug 
wires.  You might also consider getting a pertronix or compufire points 
replacement and do away with points altogether - so much more stable and 
you practically never have to adjust your timing like with points.

Now, if you're idle is wandering, then you've got another problem 
somewhere else.  So is it your timing that's wandering, or your idle, or 
both?  Have you done a compression test to get a baseline on the engine 
condition?
