That foam is important!  Also, make sure that the heater ducting from 
the heat exchangers is all in good order or blocked off so you're not 
sending heat straight into the engine compartment.

I should probably add that overheating is a cumulative thing - if you 
keep the engine running hot it will tweak the valves/seats a little bit 
each time.  Luckily you can adjust the valves to compensate for that 
particular time the engine got hot.  Now, if you *really* overheat the 
engine, you can do some major permanent damage like burning holes in the 
pistons, which requires a top-end rebuild.
