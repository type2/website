Hi John,

I haul a set of 18 1.5" tent poles on the driver's side of my bay for an 
awning I own. There are six 10' long poles and a dozen that are 7'. The 
carrier was made by Jamie Rivers and it plugs into the jack points. 
Removal takes only a moment; Undo two bolts from each end and the carier 
can be dropped.

You can see the carrier in this pic; my bus is second from the right.

If the owner of that Rivi was smart they could have done the same thing. 
The ad does say they are easily removed.


Happy Trails,
