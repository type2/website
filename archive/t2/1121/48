Subject: Crazy bus attachments-Was "You got to see this (Rivi super

It reminds me of a fully loaded pack mule... I would have been alittle more
creative if I were to bolt something to the side of my bus. 
 
For instance, if I were unlucky enough to have front end fender bender and had
a derranged since of humor, I would bolt one of those public mail drop off
boxes to the front of your bus making it look like I ran into it and it is
lodged in the nose. Cut out an access door and presto, more storage!
 
Really though, Its Friday. What would you like to attach to your bus but were
scared of how it would look or what people would think? This is what I would
do (and might do). Here is a link.

I would make a sliding shower curtain rod around the rear hatch panel. Just
open the back hatch, clip on the shower curtain and insert the toilet seat
into the hitch. To add a shower, get one of those thermal water bags, put it
on your roof rack, run hose to the open hatch and install a shower wand and
you have a complete bathroom that could be easily taken down. I might consider
bringing a bucket to put under the seat, either that or just drive away.
 
I am in a silly mood. I want to hear some of your crazy ideas!

I was about to go look at the thing until I realized it wasn't parked behind
that box, it is attached.  Only in Alaska.
