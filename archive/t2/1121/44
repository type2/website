In my garage in the hot months I just open my attic access (stairs) and 
let the heat rise. It helps.

In the winter I keep it closed (and I could weatherstrip the access door 
if I wanted to) and I can heat it okay. Keep in mind we have TN winters 
- mild by some parts of North America. If it was colder here or I worked 
out there more during cold weather I'd insulate the attic over the 
garage. The house is of course insulated over the living spaces.

Just an idea for y'all.
