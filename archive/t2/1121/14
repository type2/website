Subject: Upper bunk bed for sportsmobile conversion

Hello List,
 
Well, I am underway with my sportsmobile poptop conversion, A list member in
Maryland gave me the pop top and I have been working on it. I am going to
install it on my 68 bus. So far, I have fixed 6 cracks, 2 holes and a chip in
the fiberglass. I am getting it ready for paint as we speak. The canvas is
good although I will have to stich in some new screans.
 
I wanted to make the access hole as long as possible. I want it to go just
past where the top shelf would be over the bottom bed. (I dont have one). Here
is a drawing that I made of the upper bed frame. What do you think? The wood
would be made of IPE or Brazillian Walnut which is very very strong.
 
The idea is to have as much head room over the bottom bed when the top bunk is
not in use. When the top bunk is in use, the wooden slats would be pulled out
and droped in the slots. The slats would be connected with 2 bungie cords.
While driving, I would have the slats in the slots to give support to the
roof. The  cushions would be attached to thin ply wood so you would not feel
the slats.
 
What do you think list? I still have not figured out how I am going to attach
the poptop yet. I don't have the donor bus to get measurements from. Has
anyone else done a sportsmobile conversion? Any input would be appreciated.
Here is the link to the drawing.
