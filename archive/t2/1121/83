I know people think about water in the distributor as a cause of
problems. You mostly see this at the car wash if washing the engine.

But the thing about Water Displacing 40 is that it is also a
conductor. Any chance that the spark can get to ground in the
distributor instead of at the spark plug will make the engine run
badly.

So if you can't afford a new cap and need to recondition the old one,
you can clean the contacts at the towers and clean the inside of the
distributor, but when you are done, you have to use a cleaner that
will totally remove any trace of other cleaners you have used inside
there. Carb cleaner spray also leaves an oil residue which is intended
to lubricate carb linkages. Brake spray will work without residue.
