Subject: extra parts problem

I got extra parts problem. The trailer I was haul extra VW engine parts broke
in Santa Fe NM. I have them in storage until Aug. So here the deal, I decided
give the parts a way to anybody that needs them (donations will be accepted)
in NM. If you are interest please call me at 970-231-3955 or
jed_wubben(-at-)yahoo.com .
 
I will try and check my email but being the road it hit or miss.
 
Thanks,
Jed
