Right there I would have changed the fuel pump out.  If it's never been 
changed, that thing has been through who knows what in the past 30 
years.  If you deflect the AFM door, the pump should *always* turn on, 
rain or shine, without any delays.  If it doesn't, check that there's 
voltage.  If you have voltage, the pump is busted - if you don't, 
something else is funky...
