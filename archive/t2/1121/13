800-950 is good for manual transmission.

7.5 BTDC is correct too.

Your variances should not significantly affect temperature.

How can the engine be cold if you just did a 50 km highway run? VW
indicates that the oil light may come on briefly when getting off the
freeway and waiting at a stop light. Sitting in the parking lot may
generate a temporary increase in temp as the cooling fan is no longer
operating.

If you suspect your temp sensor, disconnect it for a while and see if
the condition is repeated.
