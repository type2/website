Subject: fuel pump

Hi all.
I have a 78 F.I. 2L bus, intermittently there is an engine skip, like the
whole engine turns off for a split second, a few weeks ago i was idling at a
light and it just shut off, it then restarted with the key and I went
home,yesterday I put on a new muffler, and fuel filter, the filter had some
orange stain on the in/out nipples. I cranked it over and it would not fire
up, there was not any real gas smell from the tail pipe. I knocked on the
fuel pump ( electric) and turned it over, it kind stumbled but did not
catch..I have a new pump ready to go in.
A lil history. one time this happened and I was in a parking lot, I was
getting voltage at the pump but it was not operating when I prop the AFM
door open. the pump felt hot. since then recent work is this.
cleaned the terminals on the pump, battery/body ground,FI grounds at relay
on firewall, ground near tail light on driverside, grounds on engine block
under 1/2 intakes,there are no vacuum leaks since I replaced intake boots
and FI injector seals, I have an svda with new vac hoses, brake booster
check valve is good,timing is at spec.hydraulic valves at 1.5 past contact.
So should I plug in the new pump , prop open the afm door and if it spins
this tells me to just put in the new pump?
Or can I run some hot wires to the old pump that is in there to see if its
in the electrical path?
Im trying to get it all sorted so I can be at West River Westies in VT in 2
weeks.   thanks in advance...Joe
