Subject: Re: [T2] Attitude adjustment

Adjusted the valves and she runs like a champ!

I also replaced the engine seal foam with some rubberized foam tubing
I got from Lowe's for $5 and it seems to work just great!

She ran rough right after the adjustment, but about 15 minutes later I
could hear the idle change and hear it smooth out like a fever was
breaking. Took her for a 20 mile drive, lowered the idle and she shut
down sounding better than she has in quite some time.

Thanks Mike and all that gave me the direction I needed!!!!
