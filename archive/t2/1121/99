John,

You are right, the body needs work, but they are solid buses; i've had
i think 
since 91 and had more memories than I can even remember (oxymoron yes
!).

In a way I hope no one seriously responds and I'll be stuck with them;
but 
vacations are limited to 7 to 10 days a year, my boys are 4, 6 and 7;
it's rough 
to go camping on week vacation with the family and have to spend 2
of the days 
fiddling with the bus; i love it; but the boys and my wife demand
more from a 
vacation than i can deliver anymore in a bus; i'm hoping to
sell them off and 
get something that i can spend more time with them.

I love
those buses !

Admitedly the body is rough, I never cared; but i was hoping
there was someone 
that has a magic hand with a torch and could give them a
good home !

hopefully I'll just have to tell the wife, "sorry, honey, I''ll
just have 
to garage them for awhile" !

Stay strong and live smart !

bob

Damn that is an
understated add.  Body needs work???  On the '77??? 
Admittedly not super
great pics, but in an east coast sense, that would
be quite a bus even if the
nose is whacked.  And the sunroof has a full middle
seat, too cool.
