Subject: Half an engine

Hey guys, looking for suggestions on what to look for, Tigger, my 
Campmobile, has been sitting down at a friend's place for the last 8-9 
months so it wasn't parked on the street where retards couild do anything 
to it, he's been driving it around town every now and then , no big 
trips, hasn't noticed anything wrong.

Today I took a new brake master cylinder down to fit, because I was 
taking her down to Poli town (where I'm working) to cart a bed etc down, 
fitted teh master cylonder, bled the brakes, everything seemed fine until 
I drove her home, she was backfiring a lot and way down on power, up the 
hill from his place, I pulled in to get some petrol, in case he was 
feeding her low octane (she needs super), filled up with 98 octane, but 
it didn't help anything, while I was monitoring it, driving home through 
the traffic, I noted that idle was down to about 500 rpm and rough (but 
no nasty clattering sounds and oil pressure light didn't come on), when I 
got home and checked the engine bay, everything looked fine, checked 
underneath, right side was hot as expected, but I could hold my hand on 
the tim under the left hand heater boxes, which seems to say that the 
left side of the engine wasn't working at all????

Amny suugestions on what it's likely to be, and/or what I can do in a 
hurry to fix it?

Thanks Guys,
