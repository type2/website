Subject: re:oil drain plug

Am I missing something here.or are you referring to a different type of
engine? In my '65 and in my '69 I always drain from the center plug on the
oil plate on the bottom of the engine, am I supposed to be using a different
bolt?

 

Was writ:

"never ever take the center bolt out of the bottom of the engine it looks
like where you would drain but it is super easy to break and never wants to
seal correctly always use the actual drain plug a 19mm just to the rear and
right of that center plug. this is tough bolt and is the real place for
draining the oil.

 

that center one is the oil pick up and can be broken very easily and if
broken means a major engine repair."
