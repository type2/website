Never make a decision like that to consciously go with insufficient
oil. The system takes only 3.7 quarts as it is. The add line is only
1/2 quart low compared to modern cars with a 1 quart tolerance.

In aircooled, oil is part of your cooling since there is no water. I
wouldn't chance it with less than one quart low.
