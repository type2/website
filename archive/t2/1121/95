Subject: Bus Clearance, 69 sunroof and 77 Westfalia

It's time for me to clear out of VW's; i'm not sure how I'll live without
them, 
but after 10+ years of owning them and more fun than any vehicle i've
ever had, 
it's time to move on.  I can no longer keep them up, and they are
no longer 
functional for family camping (3 kids and wife who craves comfort
and 
reliability).
 
I'd love to just sweep the garage clean of everything for
6K.
 
69 Sunroof bus
77 Westfalia camper - Automatic.
all parts and vw
specific tools [not many but some]
 
I've posted on samba, but thought someone
here on the list might be interested 
too:

Mechanically both
are nice, body wise both need work, solid floors and beams, 
cancer in the
usual places.  Pictures in the ad speaks for themselves.
 
I'm hoping to raise
enough funds to purchase a 21-25' travel trailer to tow with 
a chevy express
van I recently purchased; i thought about listing on scumbay, 
but I just
can't do it...
 
Private email me if interested, bobh(-at-)lifeasbob.com
