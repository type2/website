I've never seen a pressure regulator fail, but then again, who knows ;) 
  If you haven't already checked, you should grab a fuel pressure tester 
and check it out.  I'd recommend finding an inline fuel pressure tester 
fitting from a Ford or something like that and put that in the fuel loop 
somewhere.  Sooooooooooo much easier to attach the fuel pressure tester 
than having to unscrew the little bolt on the fuel rail.
