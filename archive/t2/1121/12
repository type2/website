Subject: over heat 1978 CDN

I had a rather strange thing happen to me.

Last night we did a highway run for about 50 km.

I dropped in the look at a bug. Turned the engine off and I ended up
with the oil light on.

My oil light also does a crude over temp of the # 3 cylinder.

It is a Bimetallic switch that actuates at a certain temperature when
placed on the tin of the #3.

So, I had two shorts. The Bimetallic and the oil temp sensor. I kept an
eye on them until they let go.

Then I checked the tach, around 850-950, digital meter moves around.

Dwell 44-42.

Timing 5 or less.

OK, I was listenning to my mechanic, but I think it has to be....

tach 875-900

dwell 44 to 50 deg, I usually try to get 52

timing 7.5 deg

I guess here is my question at the current settings is the bus likely to over heat and if so, what of the oil sensor?

The condion lasted about 15 minutes, engine cold.
