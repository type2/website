Subject: Re: fuel pump

So I came home this evening and pulled off the air box and k/n filter i love
so much and turned the key then used a dowel to push in the afm door, there
was no click, then i pushed it in again, click...ok...heard pump also, did
some wire wiggles to see and found that the connection to the afm was a lil
weak, so i started the bus and it sounded great with the new muffler and
valev job..ok let it run to pump up the lifters and burn off the toxic fumes
from the muffler.
maybe 15-20 minutes, shut it off, then went thru the same procedure with the
dowel and the dual relay is functioning fine..the pump is hot and will not
work..I tried taps and reversing polarity, nothing, so I am currently in
waiting while PB Blaster does its job .
Question.
the fat hose that goes from the fuel filter to the pump, should I re-use
this or get another, I do have a piece that is the same diameter ( there
abouts) but am not sure if its for fuel injection or can handle the
pressure, its new and seems like it will do the job. Joe
