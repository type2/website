Thanks List!
 
Thank you to everybody that responded to my questions about my Sportsmobile
pop-top conversion. I am thinking hard about adding structural support
especially if I make the hole larger than stock. I would have to make a frame
out of steel tubing to go around the opening and weld it into the sides of the
bus. This should not be too hard. I do have some steel sheets that are much
thicker than sheet metal that I could cut to profile the roof line. I do have
a large section of roof from a sunroof bus. It is not the whole thing but it
does have plenty of support material that I could fabricate.
 
On a different note, I took the advice of Uncle Joel and called the
Sportsmobile office in TX. I spoke to one of the founding members, Charles
Borski. He did not have any templates left, but he did have some pictures that
he is going to send me as well as 2 new Sportsmobile decals and enough pop-top
seal to do the whole thing! I told him that the old seal was toast and he
joked that it was still under warenty. He says they use the same seal now as
they did back then. All he asked in return was that I email some pics to him
once I get it finished. That is awsome!
 
I will keep the list updated with pics as I go along. I can't flake out on
this project.
 
Take care and thanks again!!!

you might want to check with the sportsmobile people and see if they would
send you any old documentation, copies of plans, etc.
