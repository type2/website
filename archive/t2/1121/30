My bus (1978)  didn't have a thermostat or flaps or that pulley when I bought
it.  I went to one of the local Tucson VW yards and found a steel pulley and
bracket (only somewhat rusted) still attached to a Type IV motor that was
sitting in the elements.  I imagine it was from an earlier year of bus but I
don't know for sure.

I also used bike cable when I installed the thermostat stuff.  My bike cable
was also salvaged, but this time from a bicycle I had sitting next to my house
for several years.
