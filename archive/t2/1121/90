The existing nib on the fuel rail let us to fit a hose with clamp over 
it and have a fuel pump on a hose (about 8") one could read while 
cranking or running.  I cut the existing pressure tester hose to allow this.

regulator.  He gave me the part, and I tested it with a compressor and 
gauge, and sure enough it maxed to the pump pressure.  I threw it on a 
concrete floor and it then tested fine.  The moral here is to always 
test a part before installing it!
