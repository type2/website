Subject: Re: fuel pump

Ok the update is in...
Came home and took out the old pump, I had been to the flaps ( Car Quest)
down the street and got the worm drive hose clamps and hose, installed the
new pump and initially it would not start, but that was prolly since the
pump was dry, but i got it running, and it seems the problem is solved..til
something else fails..Im guessing the fuel pressure reg is next.
Anyhow. after all the F.I. refresh and new fuel lines and vac lines and a
new muffler, dang it sounds good and runs great!
So I went to cruise night and got a burger and a soda and looked at other
peoples cars, and they looked at the bus ad it was like a lil piece of
summertime heaven.
Thanks for the support everyone. Joe
