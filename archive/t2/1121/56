Type4 crank. I don't seem to remeber taking one off of either but the rebuilt
book I have shows one. That brings up a question: If they do does someone have
a spare they'd sale me?

To my knowledge the oil slinger is only to compensate for the lack of
a sand seal at the pulley end of the crankshaft. The parts list only
lists a slinger for Type 1 engines:
