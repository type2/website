Yes, it is a good idea to change it out (if it's in-fact broken).  And 
like the other listee mentioned, they did make a metal wheel that you'll 
have to source out from the juckyard.  Just so you know, the subject is 
kinda misleading for discussion about the flaps and thermostat - it 
should really be "overcooling".  If your flaps aren't working, the 
engine will not heat up as quickly when you start it cold.
