Yeah, checked all the spark connections when I stopped, found nada, 
should have mentioned that it was dual carbs, sorry, all of our's were, 
even the '79 DC I got.

initial carb setting procedure.

Have a look tomorrow when I've got light, thanks for the tips (no room in 
the "garage" to work on her with the door shut). IF I can find/fix the 
issue in the morning, I'll take her back to Canberra, if not I'll tuck 
her away in the garage and take the Nissan back, fix her when I have 
time.

gas squirting everywhere would have gotten your attention if that had 
happened.

I was half expecting to find that when I checked the engine bay when I 
stopped, had it happen before (other carb), but no, and the fuel pouring 
out the bottom of the engine is a giveaway.

Thanks for the help
