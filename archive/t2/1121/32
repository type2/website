The valve adjustment change is instant - there's no "breaking in" needed.

Do you have (or can you get) a compression tester.  The reason is then 
you have a baseline for what's going on inside your engine.  If you have 
low compression on a cylinder or two, you're going to have weird issue.

Other than that, what years is the bus and is it the stock engine.  I 
can't remember if you mentioned this, but is it FI or carbs?
