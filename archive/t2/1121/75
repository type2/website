Subject: Missing/Backfiring

1979 2.0 ca Bus
    At times when driving my bus will all of the sudden start missing and
backfiring . No warning when it's going to happen and no idea what's going on.
I replace the fuel filter and spray some contact spray on terminals and some
W-d 40 in the dis. cap and it will run again. How long ,I never know. Anyone
know what is going wrong?
