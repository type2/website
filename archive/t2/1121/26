Subject: Re: [T2] Garage Discussion with DIRECT bus content

If a person poured a floor with two grooves in it to lower the roof - 
how would they get under the bus for repairs? The floor of the bus would 
be closer to the floor of the garage?

Suggestion ramp the grooves up once the bus is inside the garage.

Yeah you could put lumber over the grooves and jack on those or scrounge 
up some heavy steel plate to put over a groove to jack on. Could also 
make sure your trolley jack fits in the groove.

Just thinking about the interesting suggestions...
