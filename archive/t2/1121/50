Subject: Couple questions

I have a '69 SC and noticed located on the right side of the instrument panel
is a red button with a "B" on it with wires connected.  Is that an indicator
for the hand brake?
Next, the vents above the rear wheel on the passenger side are dented in.  Is
there a way to straighten them or are there replacement panels out there?  I
looked around and didn't see anything except for the splitties, would those
fit?
I don't have a photo of them on my PC (at work now) but can post one later.
Tks
Stan
