Subject: BusZilla II Updates for Burning Man 2010

Hey everyone! - first off, sorry for the cross posting, I know there are
several people who have been watching for updates on this project and wanted
to catch them all :)

Just wanting to put an update on what I'm working on for BusZilla II, still
so much to do and lots to figure out.

Here is the blog:

Here is the sketches for the costume changes this year:

So, still looking for people to help build, specifically people who are
interested in:
 - bending conduit for structure
 - cutting fitting plastic tubing
 - welding
 - general fabrication (drilling, mounting, brackets, hinges etc)

For those that are new to this project, I am located in Portland, Oregon,
near Jesuit high school - just to give you a rough idea of where I'm at!

Materials:
 - conduit
 - stretchy fabric (for nose)
 - more shade cloth
 - 12v bright LEDs (need
 - clear tubing for ribs (notice the ribs will be going from roof line to
close to the ground to cover the sides)
 - stereo headset (may be purchasing soon) - going to be setup for MP3 CD's,
iPod and gonna have my satellite radio installed too
 - speakers


And as always - we used up all the donations from last year on lights, so if
you cant make it to work on her, and want to donate, please go to:
https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=3817689
(if that link doesn't work go to: http://mutantbus.com and click on donate
on the right side of the page)

Also - taking applications for people who are willing to train to be a
COMPLETELY SOBER BusZilla driver at BURNING MAN (please be warned that i am
kinda specific about the drivers, since i am completely responsible for
EVERYTHING that happens to the bus on playa, even when unattended) VW
experience a must, mechanical experience a plus... please private message me
(mutantbus(-at-)gmail.com)

Note: still working out the details on how a driver might be able to get in
contact with me specifically while at the burn... any ideas?

Thanks everyone! So excited, and ONLY 58 DAYS TILL THE MAN BURNS!!!!!
