Subject: Re: [T2] fuel pump

Something that most people miss when there is a "hiccup" or hard/no start
is the 
cylinder head temp sensor at #3 cylinder.  This is the main ground point
for the 
FI system and will cause intermittent running, mixture and starting
problems that
might seem like a fuel pump problem.  
The CHTS is a critical part of the FI system, as it is the metering point
for the trasition
between cold and hot mixture, as well as providing a dedicated ground for
the computer.

The CHTS comes loose on my bus every once in a while and gives the same
symptoms
you mention.  It is a little hard to get a wrench on it I use a BOX end
13mm that has been 
ground down to a smaller diameter on the box end.  I unplug the wire to
the sensor, slide the 
wrench down the wire and "snug" the sensor in place.  It is NOT a good
idea to use antisieze or
thread locking compound on the sensor threads.  The torque for the sensor
is LOOOW or you
will snap it off in the head........ not a good deal.

Just somehing else to look at.  And while I am sharing this,  remember
that ANY car that has 
Bosch AFC has a CTS or CHTS somewhere in the circuit and these things are
a source of missed 
diagnosis for many cars.
