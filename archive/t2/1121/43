I mean the actual ceiling and the garage is too large to be air conditioned - it would bankrupt me.  It's not insulated either.  The structure is the same as a standard garage just with an extra 2 feet of space above your head, which I guess gives the hottest air somewhere to go.  I didn't expect the difference to be that dramatic but it was.
