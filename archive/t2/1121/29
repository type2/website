Subject: overheating

Last night I thought it would be a good idea to check the thermostat
wire or wheel or whatever.

There is a little plastic wheel for the cable to wrap around to the
flaps from the thermostat to the adjustable flap.

Does anyone have any thoughts on the replacement component for that
little wheel?

It was white plastic and something awful brittle the last time I looked
at it.

I used a bicycle cable to fix mine last time.
