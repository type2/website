Subject: [T2] re:oil drain plug

 Hello,
 
I have a type 1 motor and I usually drain the oil by removing the center bolt
first, then I remove the round plate. Once the oil is completely drained, I
use some degreaser on a towel to clean the sealing surfaces. I use some
permatex non hardening gasket sealer on both sides of the new gasket and on
the sealing surfaces. I always use new crush gaskets on all the bolts
including the center bolt and bolt everything back together. I only snug
everyting and give it an extra half a turn. I just feel for the crush gaskets
to "crush". So far my engine does not leak oil when I do this method. There is
a bit of a pucker factor when tightening the bolts as I know I don't want to
break anything. I dont know the torque specs on these bolts, but using a
torque wrench is not a bad idea. That is just my 2 cents worth.

Am I missing something here.or are you referring to a different type of
engine? In my '65 and in my '69 I always drain from the center plug on the
oil plate on the bottom of the engine, am I supposed to be using a different
bolt?

"never ever take the center bolt out of the bottom of the engine ...
