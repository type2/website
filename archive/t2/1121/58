With dual carbs I'd bank on the left carb being at fault. If it was an
ignition problem, I'd expect one of the cylinders on the left to be
working and causing it to be hot.

Check that the linkage is still connected on the left side. If
everything looks like it is working normally, you should go through
the initial carb setting procedure.

Of course, if dirt got into the carb and the settings are correct, you
will just mess up your settings by trying to adjust it while it isn't
working properly.

Disassembly and cleaning is the normal procedure, but if you need to
postpone that, you can try a couple of things to see if you can get it
going again.

One is lightly tap the top of the float bowl to see if you have a
sticking float.

The other is to rev up the engine to a high rpm and suddenly block the
left carb with your hand to see if engine vacuum will pull any dirt or
gummy residue through.

Hoping your fuel line to the left carb hasn't come off, but I imagine
gas squirting everywhere would have gotten your attention if that had
happened.

Also check to see that your idle cutoff solenoid hasn't come
unscrewed, or had the wire come off.

Good luck. Keep us posted.
