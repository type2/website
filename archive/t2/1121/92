Yeah, but that still involves putting the pressure tester over that 
nipple on the rail and what-not.  Using an inline screw-on fitting 
(which looks like an over-sized bicycle schrader valve) allows you to 
use your standard Craftsman fuel pressure tester and just screw it on 
and off by hand - no tools or clamps or hoses needed.  Quick and simple 
and no mess, hence the reason they put the fittings on modern cars.
