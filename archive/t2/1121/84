Ninety mostly Ford vehicles fit this external inline pump- note Amazon 
list.bought one at a FLAPS ($99 then) when mine failed, had to use a 
standard (nice transparent why aren't ours transparent??) filter (though 
the fat tube can be clampted over nib) and it has spades, not screw 
terminals.  Same fit into the bracket. Got me home with a very blocked 
fuel tank (tank liner delaminated-had to blow air up constantly) and 
this pump strained to let me do 25 mph home the back way from Ohio to 
NJ!  Still works but is "noisy" and remains my spare.
