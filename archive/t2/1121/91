Subject: '78 won't start after I gassed it up, stuck in Yelm, Wa.

Hey guys.  Here's the story:

tl;dr: 1978 bus won't start, at gas station in Yelm.  Please call if you can
assist: 206-250-4355

On the way to Oregon Country Fair.  Engine working great, as it was just tuned
up.  My wife needed to make a bio break, so we pulled off in Yelm, and I
decided to top off the gas while waiting.

Start up the engine, and it sputters sputters a few times.  Then it won't fire
at all.  Uh oh.

I do some basic diagnostics.  I'm getting spark at the distributor head.  I
don't have a gas pressure gauge, but I remove the screw to where those hook
up.  As I'm taking it off (with the engine still off), a burst of gas sprays
out, then nothing.  I wipe up the gas, and ask my wife to start up.  Nothing;
there's no gas at all coming out when starting the engine.

I haven't checked if the fuel pump is running, although it's never had a
problem before.  I also haven't checked the fuel filter for clogs.  But I'd
really REALLY appreciate some knowledgable assistance, as the sun is beginning
to approach the horizon.

If you can offer assistance, please call 206-250-4355.  Thank you very much!
