Subject: Adjusting timing

I know this is a pretty basic task to ask about, but I am having one  
Hell of a time trying to adjust my '76 FI.

After adjusting the valves, I went for the timing. Found a vacuum leak  
and fixed it. Now I'm having a difficult time balancing between  
setting the idle and timing. Seems that when I set the idle low and  
adjust the timing properly, it start jumping all over. Then I boost  
the idle up a little, rest the timing and the same thing happens! I  
have no idea where I'm at since I can't get a straight idle long  
enough to set timing. I set the timing, leave it for a moment, then  
listen to the idle go up and down with light "drum beat" sounds from  
the exhaust which tell me the timing is still off!

What am I missing here????
