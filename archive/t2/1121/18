Subject: Attitude adjustment

Hello all! Took a big hiatus from the list, but decided that my  
eduction was in need of a few refreshers, so I came back to further my  
studies.

Here is my issue...

I've been pulling a small motorcycle trailer with my bus for a little  
over a year now and without a single issue. I am finishing up on  
fabrication a new one (since the other one is borrowed) and it's a  
great trailer. Problem is, since I started working on the new trailer,  
my bus is seemingly very unhappy with the new addition since it is now  
idling very rough, stalls (but will start right up again) and just  
seems to be lacking the overall fluidity it had before I started  
working on this trailer! If I give it gas, she seems to run fine,  
though she does hiccup every once in a while.

Plugs are clean
Cables are working fine
Dizzy is alright
Fuel filter is flowing
Negative lead for L-Jet is secure
AFM is in good shape.

Does this situation hint anyone out there of why I am suddenly getting  
this occasional hiccup and poor idle?
