Subject: Re: [T2] Half an engine

> Have a look tomorrow when I've got light, thanks for the tips (no room 
in the "garage" to work on her with the door shut). IF I can find/fix the 
issue in the morning, I'll take her back to Canberra, if not I'll tuck  
her away in the garage and take the Nissan back, fix her when I have 
time. 

Checked over all the easy to get to things, and the linkage, wiring etc 
is all in place, tried tapping the float bowl to see if I could free it, 
still nada :o( 

Got the gooseneck off the towbar so I can squeeze her into my "garage" 
and she's safely off the street, I'll try and sort out a way forward for 
her during the week, I should be able to limp her over the VW specialists 
who built the engine a few years back next Saturday, they'll be able to 
sort it out if I can't come up with a better course by then.

Only thing I can think of to cause the problem is that she's hardly been 
run in the last 6 months, and then only to putter around a little down 
down at the river, so she was never openned up, but to get her home from 
there I had to take her out on the Freeway and climb 600M in about 6KM, 
so she was asked to deliver real power for the first time in ages, if the 
left carb was a bit dodgy it may have packed up then n there.

Oh well, hopefully get her sorted out next weekend.
 
Thanks again for the help
