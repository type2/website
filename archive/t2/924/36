Volkswagen marketed it as a "station wagon" in the U.S. to skirt the 25%
import tariff on imported trucks (which was levied in 1963 due to a trade
dispute over chicken exports) . That tariff (still referred to as the
"chicken tax") exists to this day, thanks to aggressive U.S. automotive
industry lobbying.  Japanese companies skirted it by importing their trucks
as "components" and doing the final assembly (i.e. bolting the bed to the
chassis) in the U.S.. But Volkswagen didn't have a U.S. facility to do this
in (other than their short-lived Rabbit plant in Westmoreland, PA), hence no
single-cabs and crew-cabs since 1971.
