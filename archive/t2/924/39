Subject: Re: [T2] Shipping costs

I have noticed that shipping & HANDLING has gone
sky-high as the unscrupulous vendors often charge more
for handling than for the product. It used to be that
the cost of packaging was a regular business expense
and amortized into the gross sales but now I suspect
that is still done, with the individual paying a
worst-case-scenario handling charge for his individual
item as well, without consideration of it being all in
the normal days' work and already absorbed. -BaH
