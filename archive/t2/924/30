Subject: Re: [T2] wiring a 70 bus turn signals without emergancy flasher

Dave asked:

Hi

 my friend does not have the black box on a project 70 bus he is finishing ,
 there are just a bunch of wires from the turn signal switch and fuse box etc,

 how does the turn signal circuit work since the brake lights and turn signals use the same bulb ?
does it go thru the turn signal switch and seperate out there ?

 thanks for your help

The 1970 bus uses a flasher unit. It is in the lower left side of the A
fuse box. Look up above the drivers headlight and the fuse box should be there. Look at the part number across
the top. It better be part number 411 937 505A.  It may be the early yellow one that splits down the middle or
the later white one.
Here is a picture I took of 3 of them. The top left one shows all the relays in the bottom. The black relay is
the flasher. [I sold that fuse box already]  http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/303734.jpg
