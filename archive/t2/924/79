Hi Kevin,

I used a 12" oil pressure hose and this sender:

productid=16276&cat=&page=1

The sender is bolted to the fan shroud just above the coil. This 2- 
wire sender powers the gauge and also replaces the sender for the  
stock idiot light. My gauge originally came from a GTI.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
