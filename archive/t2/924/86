Subject: distributor drive gear backwards situation

Hi All,
  Took a 78 (stock F.I.) with fresh engine rebuild to a mechanic to find out why it wouldn't start. Mechanic charges me to "install distributor drive gear correctly" and "correct spark plug firing order." This cost me 3 hours of labor at $85 per hour. I felt bent-over but paid.
  I parked the bus, never drove it, and a few months later, began other restoration work on it. I found it to not run well. Upon investigation, I noticed that the mechanic swapped the spark plug wires 180 degrees from their correct position and turned the distributor ALL the way counter-clockwise. So, after calling him out on it, he admits that he, in fact, did not install the drive gear in it's correct position. He gave me his humble apologies for lying.  How noble.
  So, as of now, the drive gear is backwards, distributor is turned completely counter-clockwise, and spark plug wires are flipped around 180 degrees.
   
  The engine runs like crap (timing way off) and I can't turn the distributor any more left, in order to time it properly. Turning to the right kills the motor. It will only run with dizzy completely cranked to the extreme left.  Has anyone heard of this "quick-fix" that the mechanic did?  I assume he did it because he was scared to drop the washer.  Will the engine ever run properly with the drive gear installed backwards, dizzy all the way to the left, etc.? 
   
  Thanks, Chris
