LOL! 

Having regularly commuted in a Fiat 500 (a 2 cylinder aircooled micro-car),
an original Mini Cooper with 10" tires, and a motor scooter, my Bus feels
like a veritable tank to me. :-)  It's all relative. Unless you drive a
tractor trailer there's always something on the road that could eat you for
lunch. The best protection, of course, is defensive driving (and a little
prayer if you're driving a micro-car :-).
