Hey, Greg.  What's the best way to put an oil pressure guage on it?  Thanks..KR

You have one of two problems to resolve. It's either gonna be low oil  
pressure, or a faulty sensor circuit.

I would suggest putting an oil pressure gauge on it, and changing all  
the oil to 20W50. This will tell you for certain what's going on  
inside the engine and will verify the signal from the sensor circuit.  
In a worst-case scnario (low oil pressure initiates a rebuild) you  
will have the oil pressure gauge available to help break in the new  
engine.
