This is why it pays to be a educated consumer Richard.

Most of the time with small stuff--demand first class or priority mail
shipping.

If it's under a pound it'll cost $.4.05 for priority, and cheaper yet
for first class.
The transit times are the same.
If you want it insured--add that into it.

And by the time you get all this done you would have saved some money by
buying the parts local.

I do anyway---

The worst place I've dealt with is in  Perky PA---just for getting an
order out in a reasonable amount of time they slap you with some
erroneous expedited shipping charge---
If you don't pay--wait 2-3 weeks for the parts--which I think is insane.
This is how they make up for the cheap pricing on the parts they
advertise.
Add a handling fee--- & make up the difference.

I add to all my order's .50 shipping to cover travel time and gas to
wherever it's going---

Gas ain't cheap--but why gouge folks?

If I ship 10 items a day--I make 5 bucks.

Not a terrible premium to pay over and above the price of the parts. 

I think this is fair---
