Terry spouted his usual BS again.

I mail stuff  EVERYDAY. I damn near have a reserved parking spot.

People get the stuff I mail via Priority Mail 3 to 4 days before I get the check they mail 1st class at the
same time!

I don't read propaganda on the internet, just your rantings.

Maybe it is your post office in Podunk Illinois??  When you take a 1 lb package to the post office, do they
have a screen you can read that shows the weight and $$ for each choice? Look again at the screen. It also
shows approximate travel time. Priority will say 2-3, 1st class will say 4-6. That 1st class may get there in
4-6 days but I doubt it.
If your Priority mail doesn't make it in 2-3 days, then they aren't feeding the horses at your Pony Express
office.

 No Sir.
 Go ask the tootsie's behind the counter at any USPS office.
 No guaranteed delivery times via Priority Mail.

 Take two envelops.
 Put a first class stamp on one.
 Put a $4.05 stamp on the other.
 Mail them both to Bangor Maine.
 They'll both get there at the same time--or the first class will get
 there first.

 Here's another case of believing what you read on the internet Karl---
 Don't.
 It's all Propaganda

 I've been there, done it, and seen it all.

 I oughta file a class action suit on the PO for false advertising.

 Priority Mail isn't what it used to be.
Only guaranteed  next day, or overnight gets there on as advertised.

 Go talk a trip to the PO and ask some questions of your PO
 personel---talk to your postmaster---set the record straight .
