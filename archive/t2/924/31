All the American ads I've seen play it up as a station wagon, which is how
mine are registered in Pennsylvania (so is my Touareg, btw).

On the other hand, nearly all the European ads I've seen have played it up
as a commercial vehicle.

I am curious to know if the type 2  was marketed as a "truck" or as "car"
when
introduced to the US market. I know that the panels would be a truck right?
All this talk of how dangerous they are in frontal impacts has led me to put
mine up for sale, and I am looking for a good Geo metro (or Pontiac firefly
for you Canadians) to keep me safe.

Is there any good sources of vintage ads?


:)

Thanks
