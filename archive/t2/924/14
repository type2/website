We do (we call it a "want list" rather than a "wish list").

First create an account (user name and password) - it can be the same one
you already have, or you can create a new one just for the gift registry.
Then add the items you want to your shopping cart, but instead of checking
the purchase out, save it as a want list instead. (If you are logged in,
this option will apear.) You can even set up multiple want lists and name
each one differently. Anyone who logs in under that user name/password can
now view your want list(s), send them to the shopping cart, edit the cart if
they don't want to buy all of the items, and check out the order. (One note:
purchasing the items will not delete the want list; it remains there until
you, or someone with your password, deletes it.)

Details are at: <http://busdepot.com/help.jsp#WANT%20LIST>

As an alternative, we also sell gift certificates.
