  I *think* (ouch) the "binding" Jason's talking about is the inability to turn the dizzy due to the vaccum  can hitting (Ratwell mentioned).  If it wasn't for that, I'd leave it as is.  But, I can't turn it any more counter clockwise and that's what it needs in order to be timed right.  My next stupid question is, can I pull out the drive gear and put it back in without the washer?  Only reason is that I'm afraid I'll drop it.
