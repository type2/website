Hey guys.  I may have a problem.  A couple of weeks ago I  reported that I drove up Lookout Mountain a quart low on oil and the  oil pressure light flashed on and off.  I put a quart in at the  top and it stopped it.  So yesterday it happens again.  I was  late to school (CPA) and tossed some oil in.  I noticed that the  dipstick wasn't in right.  The spring part of the stick was  hanging out and it had pushed up an inch or so.  So I figure, aha,  I've leaked out enough oil to get the light again.  Well, I drove  about a mile to the park-and-ride I use and it went off for a second  but then came back on.  I took it easy.  When I got back from  school, I dug around and found another quart of oil I'd forgotten  about.  Tossed that in and drove the mile or mile and a half back  home.  Light stayed on!  I didn't push it.  So this  morning I checked the oil.  About a half quart over-full!   Drove it a mile or so to Walmart and the light occasionally flickers  off but mostly
 stays on.  
  
  So what to do?  Change the oil and filter?  Are clogged oil  coolers common?  Bad sensor?  Pump?  I don't feel  comfortable at all driving it as it is.  Please help!   Cheers...KR
