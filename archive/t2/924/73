Hey guys, I learned to drive in Naples, Italy in a Fiat 600 (yeah,  
screaming HP compared to the 500) and my mom's 124 Spyder.

Good times. Great mileage. Hills taken in first gear!

I would kill to have one back, but am content to keep my eye out for  
my old 57 Nash Met.

Safety in those vehicles is always suspect...but that is what  
defensive driving is all about, right?
