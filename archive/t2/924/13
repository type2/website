Subject: wiring a 70 bus turn signals without emergancy flasher black

 Hi
 
my friend does not have the black box on a project 70 bus he is finishing , 
 
there are just a bunch of wires from the turn signal switch and fuse box etc, 
 
how does the turn signal circuit work since the brake lights and turn signals use the same bulb ?
does it go thru the turn signal switch and seperate out there ?
 
thanks for your help
 
dave
