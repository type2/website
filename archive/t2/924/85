Well, it is required unless that filter is speciffically designed to
seperate water from air. In most cars, the booster is located under
the hood and is high enough to not become submerged (under normal
driving conditions). If the chamber fills up with water you'll have
trouble for sure. Stick to your guns and get that part!
