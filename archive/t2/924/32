Hiya Dave,

Instead of trying to bypass the flasher unit, why don't you simply go out and 
get a flasher unit?  The VW parts number of the flasher you are interested in 
is 211-953-215C.  They are easily found at most VW shows and swaps.  I have a 
bunch of them (I've got two 1970 production year VWs) and none has cost me 
any more than $5.00 and most less than $3.00  I would imagine that these would a 
pretty easy score at a VW boneyard too.

And if there are no VW boneyards near you and the VW swap season is over in 
your neck of the woods, try an online junkyard like WayOut Auto Salvage.
