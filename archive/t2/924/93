Mike I don't believe this is correct. The distributor drive key is 
slightly offset. It can be made to fit as some people have attested to 
getting it to fit, but it should be causing some binding and I imagine 
it's far from optimal. The only real way to fix it is to do exactly what 
the mechanic "said" he did and orientate the gear to the correct place. 
It's a HUGE PITA, but it can be done.
