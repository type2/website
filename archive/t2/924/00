I had a automotive machinist tell me to do the same... it didn't sound like 
a good idea to me.. but I wasn't doing the work,, or paying for it.. all I 
was doing was driving the car.. and if he could put me in the money.. Great!

Yup.. many things taught me he was correct after the thought was in my mind!

And I also realized pressure didn't mean anything........ I had loads of oil 
volume to lubricate that engine...

a racing engine and a street engine are 2 different things though.....
