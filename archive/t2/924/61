Richard,

Correct you are!  Also noticed the same thing and I pick carefully
off that infamous auction site for vendors who charge *no* shipping or 
*exact* shipping.

After reading the other replies about shippingtimes and such, here is a 
really good one.

I got a large heavy package from a supplier on the west coast that was 
shipped on Thursday via USPS on Monday!  I'm betting that the cost was 
about the same as for UPS or others....

I've noticed local folks that need to send something minor have started 
using the USPS again instead of dropping it off....even tho gas prices 
have gone down.

Cheers, dave
