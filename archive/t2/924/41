Subject: Re: [T2] Hankook RA08 Report

Years ago - when I was even stupider than I am now - I
felt I needed to "get by" on cheaper tires cuz I
didn't have the $$ for proper tires. When I tried to
get them mounted, I was told by two different tire
shops that they would be breaking a federal law if
they knowingly mounted less than a class "C" tire on a
VW bus wheel for use on a VW bus and they refused to
do it. You probably could have gotten a free set of
proper tires from Les.

I'm interested in how much sidewall flex / how harsh
the ride with the Hankook "D" ratings compared with
say, the Cooper or Goodrich load range "C" tires.
Anybody care to try to quantify the difference? -BaH
