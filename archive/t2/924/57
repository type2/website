Chevy Sprint, Pontiac Firefly and Geo Metro were all a rebadge of the Suzuki
Swift.

I had one for a while too.  If you think this is more dangerous than the
bus, where does that put my '79 Mini?  It makes the Geo look like a
stationwagon.

I still have the Mini, and the bus.  Maybe I'm attracted to unsafe cars.
