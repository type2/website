Subject: 68-71 Heater Tube Refurbish

I decided with all of the talk about asbestos, that I would post a tutorial
about replacing 68-71 Heater Tubes. This works like a dream and has given me
a noticeable heat improvement over the 38 year-old stock units. It also
makes me "breathe" easier.

Enjoy and send me edits and revisions off-list. I apologize if this tutorial
has already been written somewhere

P.S. I have not posted in a while since I have a new Son that is keeping me
very busy indeed.
