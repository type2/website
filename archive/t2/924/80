Yeah, it leaks about a quart every two weeks of daily driving.   Never have figured out where.  Just changed the oil.  No  help.  I'm thinking it's the sender because it tends to go off at  low RPM as often as at medium RPM.  That wouldn't make sense if I  really had a pressure problem, right?  I'm not going to push it  until I figure it out.  My local Autozone, which normally has  parts that I need in a crunch, was out.  But they've got one at  another store I may go get.  Until I can get a better one from one  of our favorite vendors.  But I got the best electric fuel pump  from them that I've ever had on this bus, and I've been through  several.  I may go ahead and put a guage on it.  I figured  out how but I'm starting to hate any job that involoves wiring.   And I'm a ham radio operator, ha.   Thanks...KR

  Do you have any oil leaks?
