I have an experience I can share, i recently went to Les Schwab and bought 6 ply tires with an aggressive tread 1 size bigger than what was on there, I thought I would be giving up quiet tires going from the 2 plys that were on it when I bought the bus, it improved in every imaginable way, quieter, better handling, my speedometer is correct, and it serves as my ORV now.

Les Schwab can't get an 8 ply light truck tire anymore they said, but the 6 plys I bought certainly made my life much better.

BTW, I destroyed a tire driving along the Siletz River, I didn't have many choices in Newport, Oregon on a Saturday and I didn't want to buy 1 new 2 ply tire.

Thanks,

James
