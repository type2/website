Subject: Re: [T2] Shipping costs

Richard, I've noticed this increasingly lately.  Since Ebay  started, a lot of the vendors have actually made their meager profits  off the shipping and handling.  I think a lot of the other online  vendors are catching on to this.  Generally, shipping is a trade  off  against sales taxes.  But I'm always careful now to  compare.  A $5 item with a $5 shipping charge is a 100%  markup.   Better to pay $7.50 locally and pay the sales  tax.  
  
  I've always enjoyed VW's advertising.  I don't know who does them  or even if they're still using the same ad firm but those ads a few  years ago where some loser kids were driving around and found a couch  on the side of the road that they tried to cram in the back of a Jetta  - hilareous.  I think the catch line was something like 'get a  life, get a volkswagon'.  Some of VW's ads have had me ROFL!   The best car ad was a Ford ad that featured John Coltrane (great jazz  saxophonist).   They ran it about twice.  Guess art  doesn't sell pickups.  
  
  A VW builder friend told me yesterday that Meximotors are about  gone.  If anybody wants one, you better grab it now if you can  still find it.  
  
  Cheers...KR

One  order from CO was for a few rubber grommets that weighed no where near  1lb and the charge was $9.59. Another package came from GA was again a  small plastic item and the charge was $10.50. Both times the part were  put in a box that was too large but the parts arrived safe and sound.
