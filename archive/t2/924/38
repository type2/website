Fiest class, I thought, was for envelopes, not packages?.  Priority can 
be anything (try to fit 4 lbs into that 8x10 envelope' lead or gold, 
maybe?  For stuff I mail to our daughter (N J to Ga, 1st class and 
priority is same time, and you have to weigh the flat rate priority box 
to decide if you want to use it or pay by weight in a different box.
