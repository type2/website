Hey Jon,
I have some extra tubes and the bubble wrap already so I figure I'll do 
this project.  airheadparts doesn't carry the parts any more, but I 
think bus depot has them.  Are these the correct parts:

http://busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=113255292P
http://busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=111819945

I'm not sure about the second one.  Hopefully Ron will be able to 
confirm that the second item is in-fact the part that replaces the 
asbestos collars as described on your site.
