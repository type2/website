Subject: hYDRAULIC LIFTERS ON SOLID LIFETR CAM, LOBE PROFILES

I was talking to a fellow VW Bus enthusiast/mechanic, and asked him about
hydraulic lifters on a solid lifter cam profile.  He said "doable", but lots
of "clatter" on cold start up and there would prolly be some loss of lift due
to the hydraulics.  Other than the "fluid" interchange in the lifter, and if
it is primed, what possible loss could there be, and does the cam lobe know
the difference between a hydraulic and a solid lifter?  opinions gladly
endorsed and appreciated!
