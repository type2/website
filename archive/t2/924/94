When the dist is 180 degrees out, you can correct the firing order by swapping the cables but then you loose the ability to adjust the timing when the vacuum can collides with something. If you don't have a vacuum can dizzy, you can get away with it.

Right. It's safer than trying to remove the gear and washer without it falling into the case but it's also a pain to remove that little pin.

You could try to pull out the drive pinion and hope the oil keeps the washer attached to it (or the base it sits on). I think there was a discussion not too long ago that said the washer normally falls into a "safe" region of the case. If that happens then you need a spare washer and some practive runs with the washer and some grease with the washer will help you set the pinion right (the gears are helical so you have to put the gear in offset and watch it twist into position).
