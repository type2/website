YES, I AM STILL HERE!
Bad news is: they only last 1/3 as long. And they don't fit your bus
anyway.
Good news is Chevy V8 parts are cheaper yet. Bad news is: The chevy V8
doesn't fit your car either. (It certainly could be made to, and the
results would be impressive.)
I really do have a 215 Buick that I was always saving to put in a bus.
Hobert Kennedy said that was the best engine for the job. Light at 300
lbs. I can pick up the short block with one hand a little bit. Compact.
Much smoother than a four.
I'll just never live long enough to finish all my projects at this rate.
Got several old Porsches, a 60 Corvette (it's mostly done- just needs a
repaint now), a 56 single cab, 58 Deluxe-23 window, 67 bug convert, 67 bug
sunroof (metal work mostly done- needs paint and reassembled). I just
don't have the time for engineering stuff to fit.
If I bought a 74 with an original 1600, I'd probably just rebuild it with
88's (1776), jet the carb, and put it back in and enjoy. But to do the job
right is a MAJOR PITA!
The mustache bar is different, the throttle linkage is different, the air
cleaner, the trans ratios (I think). Possibly heat exchanger connections.
Electrical system. Evaporative emission stuff. Hell, the sheetmetal is the
easy part. furnace tin, self-tapping screws, weather strip will get you
there.
You are talking about  the difference between survive and thrive. I like
to drive cars that thrive! Please no wired on throttle linkages for me. I
get one damn thing not working right on any of my cars and it bugs
me.(Possibly just my brain chemicals, but  I KNOW I can do better.
You're right! Rattle my cage and I'll growl!

69 double cab with Chevy V8?  (Well, it's hauled few!)
