Hi Jim

I was wondering where this rule of thumb comes from,, what difference does it
make to the trans or axles if they are turning while being towed??

Naturally you have to put the trans in neutral, and I know that the auto trans
in a North american car doesn't like the lack of lubrication while being
towed.... 

I was under the impression that the final drive in a BuS or BuG automatic trans
is the same as the manual and it could be towed safely as well...

Anyways,, I have towed both Auto and manual ACVW trans for hundreds of miles at
a time using a tow bar,, and never had a single trans/axle issue,,
