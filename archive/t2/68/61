Subject: Re: [T2] another emissions question

Hi Folks,

Here in the mountains of Colorado they only do the tailpipe test, and I 
managed to pass my 79 Westy by changing the fuel/air mixture.  I drove it on 
the highway for 15-20 min to get it hot, then parked it a block away from 
the inspection station.  I leaned out the mixture with the AFM screw until 
it barely ran, drove it down the block, and it passed with flying colors.  
The inspection guy even said, "Wow, I've never seen a VW that runs so 
clean."  I paid him, drove on, reset the mixture, and have had no worries.  
Granted, I'm not being very environmentally friendly, but now I'm rebuilding 
my engine, so my Bus is currently a Zero-Emissions vehicle.

Good luck to all who have to pass more stringent emissions tests...

Jason
