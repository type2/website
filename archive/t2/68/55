I wish I were so lucky. I am in the opposite situation.  We live in a rural
area of Pennsylvania, among lots of farms and only a few modern
"neighborhoods" so far. Our nearest cities are smaller ones (Reading and
Allentown), where insurance is cheap and there is no emissions testing. But
despite our close proximity to those cities, we are (by 2 miles) within
Montgomery County, a large county that extends all the way to the border of
Philadelphia an hour away.  Because our county borders on Philadelphia, the
state considers us to be in suburban Philadelphia, despite the fact that we
are nowhere near it. So I pay twice as much for insurance as I would if I
lived 2 miles up the road, and have to pass rather stringent emissions tests
each year. :-(
