Subject: Re: [T2] another emissions question

I have run my other vehicles though and they run them for 5-10 minutes. I am just worried about my bus. I was
there with my F*rd a couple of months ago. Until Bob's post I never thought about that damn fan! On another note
I went through inspection with a friend and his single cab(they check safety not emissions). The inspector looks
underneath and while knocking on the heater box says," cool, duel cat converters".
