I set off on a cross country tow under the same circumstances with a 74 bus.  
I decided I would give it a try and check things after a few miles.

I stopped within a half hour and the transaxle actually felt hot.  Though it 
may have been fine in this condition for the rest of the trip, I decided 
Montana was a long ways from the Ohio/Pennsylvania border and pulled the 
axles.  

It was just_too_easy to do it and thus not risk the_potential_wear that might 
have happened because I couldn't get clear answer then to the same question 
asked now.

A bumper sticker we'd like to see on the next gas guzzling SUV with an 
american flag on its antenna -..... "I Just Don't Get It!".....
