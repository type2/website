Hello Guys & Dolls    Intead of bitching about GEX let's help Bob salvage 
what he has.  The weak point on type 4 motors is the pic-up tube mount, held 
in place by a bolt thur the side of the case, which will break the case when 
overtigthend . Two things to do get a little longer bolt cause there are some 
unused threads left, measure this and don't get it too long I think about 1/8 
inch longer. After makeing sure it bottoms on the case , Take J B weld and 
put on the threads and up at the head of the shaft of the bolt , install and 
let it set.What  do you have to lose? A GEX motor!  :)      Mark Dearing
