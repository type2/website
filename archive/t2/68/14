Quick rule of thumb: if it has constant velocity joints on the wheels that
are on the ground when you're towing it, remove the axles (none of this
unhook the wheel end and tie it up crap either; unhooking both ends takes
very little extra time, and you'll be sure the balls aren't going to fall
out ten miles from your destination), put them in garbage bags and stick 'em
somewhere safe. This goes for Buses, Bugs, Hyundai Elantras, Oldsmobile
Cutlasses, anything.
