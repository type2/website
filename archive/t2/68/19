Nicholas:

I think you need to take the vehicle to another test station and try again.
In some cases I've had inspectors actually test the EGR and in other cases
I've had them just look to see that it's there.

I'm not sure where you started from when you "pushed the valve all the way
to the full throttle position, the engine
speed would rise,"  but the test the inspectors perform (I think) is to
disconnect the linkage and then move the arm on the EGR to the "mid
throttle" position; the engine speed should *drop* indicating exhaust gas is
being re-circulated.  The EGR valve should not allow exhaust gas to enter at
idle and at WOT.
