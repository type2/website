Subject: Bessie--Limited Edtion Matchbox Bus

Here is the other Limited Edition Matchbox bus that we had made.  It's a
replica of our hippie bus "Bessie".  The pic shows both sides of the bus,
which are each different.  If you would like to purchase one (or two) of
these, the price is $15.00 each including shipping within the USA.  You can
pay by check or money order. If you want it right away, please send a money
order, I hold orders paid by check for 2 weeks from the date I deposit the
check in my account before shipping. Send payment to:
Melissa Jess
3121 East Yucca Street
Phoenix, AZ 85028-2616
