Subject: another emissions question

After reading Bob's post about the fans not reaching the air intake I
have a question. I am going for  emission testing next week.
In Connecticut they put your car on rollers and take it up to about
35mph(not sure that real speed just a guess) with a probe in the tail
pipe. They have a fan mounted on a gate like setup they just swing out
in front of your car. If they test my vehicle on this set up
the fan will be useless for my bus? Should I not worry about it or could
this overheat my bus? Any CT listees been though this?

Thanks,
