I never took my bus through the CT inspection because it's over 25 years old.  As I recall, the dyno test takes less than one minute.  I doubt that your engine would overheat in that amount of time.  

In response to Bob's comment, CT is a lot different than CA.  CA has state licensed emission station "boutiques" that will try to sell you parts and services if they can.  CT is state operated.  You either pass or fail.  If you fail you get it repaired or get a waiver from an auto repair shop stating that the cost of repairs will exceed a state set amount.  Pretty cut and dry unlike CA.
