Subject: free muffler/heater boxes

I have for free a decent muffler and set of heater boxes off a 75 bus.
They are a little rusty, but still solid. I also have the rest
pipes that are maybe usable. The flanges are rusted pretty good. It's
only for pick up in Mystic, CT. E-mail me off the list
if you need any info please.

Thanks,
