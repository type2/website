Subject: Re: [T2] another emissions question

My solution was pretty simple: I register the Westy at my farm, 120 miles
from Dallas TX.
I get about 65% insurance discount and no tailpipe inspections. I'm the
topic of conversation while I'm in the station with everybody coming over
to take a look at the engine and Westy conversion and they normally fill
my LP tank for free since their minimum sale for LP is 5 gallons. I buy a
tank of gas (overpriced) to help them feel better about giving away 75
cents worth of LP. I consider I'm lucky if I don't have to pop the top
and light the stove for the spectators or is that spelled (spectater?).
