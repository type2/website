here in Maryland it is a State inspection station, pay once get two tries

there are some advantages, I have hand controls and any vehicle with
modified driving controls is exempt from roller test, so I only get
tailpipe test.  only failed once.

I just completely blanked mine off so it shows no trace of ever being
there.  not one has even ever opened the engine bay door.   do check my
gas cap and exhaust system. then the tailpipe probe.

another problem here that helps the older aircooled buses, the fans for
the cooling air while on the rollers won't reach the air intakes. so they
usually just say the heck with it and list it "unable to test" and just do
the tailpipe, but it is a crap shoot there.

one of the advantages is that the check station is prohibited from doing
repairs or even telling you what you need, just hand you the printout
from the computer with data of test on it.
