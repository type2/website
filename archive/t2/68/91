Don't know, John. What I do know is you can fill the crankcase with oil and
hit the starter and you will surely know which is which when the gusher
gets going. I suspect that if you don't have a bench adaptor to put a
starter on it, you could pour oil in each of the holes to prime them, then
turn the motor over by hand to see which one is which.
