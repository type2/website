Subject: 74 bus questions

Hi,
I am looking at buying a 74 westy that is pretty nice.
The only thing that is wrong with it is that one of
the PO's put a 71 dp 1600 in it. There is no rear tin
or anything. Does anybody know of a source for tin for
the conversion? The other problem is that something is
draining the battery if it is not running. What are
some obvious things to check? I noticed that the
fridge doesn't work, could this have something to do
with the battery problem? If there is somebody in
colorado with an extra T4 engine and tranny that are
correct for this bus I will possibly trade 2 running
71 engines and a 71 tranny. Thanks in advance for your
help, 

Thanks,
Tyler
