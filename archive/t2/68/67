Subject: Re: [T2] auxiliary air regulator help

Sorry to hear that, Mark. The only service I have done to those is flushing
them out and picking loose any crud with a small screwdriver or dental
scraper, without taking them apart. I haven't a clue as to how you would
put one back together. They just aren't designed to be taken apart. Unless
you can figure out how, best get a replacement.
