Q: Remove the parts, clean them out with gentle reaming tools and elbow
grease- 
R: Strange as it seems............ use EZ Off oven cleaner on the EGR
Valve, Rod and through the round connector pipe and it will shine that
baby like new and remove all the carbon buildup. Careful, don't get it on
your skin and you will probably need some brushing action or several
applications. Let it be known  NEVER use EZ Off cleaner on Aluminum
parts.

Q" My filter is now an empty can- all the filter steel wool inside it has
long gone- 
R: If the canister has holes in it you can rough up the outer surface and
use Muffler Sealer for a very good patch.
I grind them with a rough sand paper on my 4" grinder and lay a piece of
fiberglass fabric next to the metal, then smooth the muffler patch on in
very thin layers. Thick layers develop bubbles. After it is cosmetically
nice I bake it at about 300 degrees in the oven (eliminates about three
days of curing time and brings out flays in  your patching).
