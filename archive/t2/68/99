In response to all the questions about "why pull the axles?" let me explain.

First, I know lots of people have towed Buses, Porsches and so on with the
wheels on the ground and the halfshafts hooked up and not damaged the
vehicle. I've done it too.

OTOH, there's always the chance (no matter how slim) that the Bus has iffy
CVs, or something's not quite right in the transmission, and towing it will
screw it up. Can I guarantee you're going to damage the transmission by
leaving the CVs on? Or the CVs? No, but I can guarantee that if they're off
you won't damage them.

Also, taking them off gives you a good excuse to inspect the CVs and boots
and replace things as necessary.
