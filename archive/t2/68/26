 the automatic is different, VW says not to tow very fast forget the speed
or very far.

Bentley manual, Chapter 7 page 4
bottom of first column it says

"Caution
 Never tow a car with automatic transmission faster than 30mph (48kph) or
farther than 30miles (48kmph)  bearings can be damaged by lack of
lubrication.  If you must tow the car farther, lift the rear wheels or
remove the driveshafts that connect the rear wheels to the transmission"

lucky.

I would not tow my automatic with the wheels on the ground, on a trailer
or a rollback
