5-8 foot wide plywood is avaliable from specialty providers, it is much
more expensive but for one or two pieces it should not be
burdensome. (were talking $25-30 instead of $ 4-5 for 1/8 inch thick)

I have gotten it from a company called "Harbor Sales" but they only
ship/deliver to the Mid Atlantic region
