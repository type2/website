Jim (and others),
Why is this?  I towed my '79 Westy from Alexandria, VA to Springfield, MA on
a tow dolly behind a U-Haul truck.  I had the front wheels of the Bus up on
the dolly and rear wheels on the ground.  I put the transmission (manual) in
neutral (of course!) and off we went.

I don't see any obvious reason why you should disconnect the driveshafts
when towing, UNLESS it is an automatic transmission vehicle.  In an auto,
the hydraulic pressure to operate and lubricate the transaxle is only there
if the engine is running, so it would be a bad idea to tow an automatic Bus
(or automatic anything) with the drive wheels on the ground and axle shafts
connected.

But a manual transaxle is basically lubricated as the gears inside spin
through the oil, which still happens when it is being towed in neutral.

Towing with the front wheels up and rear wheels on the ground doesn't put
the rear suspension or CV joints/axles at odd angles, it just puts the Bus
in a nose-up attitude like you're driving uphill.
