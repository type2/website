Subject: Re: [T2] Westy Interior Panel Patterns

If we were to make patterns we would have to show the holes and the spacing
for them. That is why I was saying it would be best for someone to test the
drawings before they are released to the community. The last thing I want is
a thread about "those poor drawings for wood paneling" next year!

I am not sure what a person would do about the grain and size issue.

Thanks for the 2 cents!!!  All the comments and suggestions are welcome. The
more input the better the product should be.

I just remade all the interior wall panels on my '72 Westy Poptop.  Used a
simple 1/8 inch ply (mahogany.)   Looks great with the Redwood stain (sorry,
no pics yet.)
I reused the original ceiling panels.  Just sanded off all that ... uh ...
white wash looking stuff that they covered it with.  Nice wood underneath.
Stained it, etc.
I hit 2 problems on the way.
1- The ceiling panels are just over 4 feet wide and a standard sheet of ply
wood is 4 feet wide exactly.  How is this a problem, you ask?  Well, the
grain on the sheet of ply runs length wise (8 foot) and the grain for the
ceiling must run front to back in order to bend the piece into place.  Ever
try to bend wood against the grain?  Yes, it can be done but it is a
p.i.t.a.  So you can't cut the 2 large ceiling panels out of a standard
piece of ply due to the grain.  I suppose you could special order the wood,
but who knows.  I'm sure someone here will have some great solution.
2- Not a great problem but appropriate to the AutoCad program/ pattern
thread.
The panels are screwed to the side of the bus (not the door panels, of
course.)  The holes must be drilled in precisely the correct location.  Not
such a big deal with the smaller pieces, but with the larger one behind the
driver you can't see to line up the holes.  My holes were drilled correctly
and I still had a little trouble.  So when making the pattern, take careful
measurements for those screws.
Then again, you could just try drilling NEW holes into the metal walls.  Not
something I would want to do though.
Just my 2 cents.

Good luck.  This pattern would be great for the library.
