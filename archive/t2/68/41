sounds like the same system used in Maryland.   Not sure how to deal with
this but I checked last time I was there (last Jan) and the way the fan
fits I doubt very much it would have any effect on cooling.  I would
suspect that if it was cold and it was for a short (2-3 minutes) would
probably not have an effect, longer times etc might cause
problems.  Wonder if Doc Tim has any information on this.  I know the fans
here would cool my sparetire/emblem on the front effectively but not much
else.
