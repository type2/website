went out this morning to do a regular oil/filter change.  pulled the nut
off the strainer and drained the oil. looked ok, looked at strainer and
there were two good sized hunks  of metal, knew instantly what they were..
  they were curved and sort of triangular.  and had threads on the inside,
it was part of the boss that holds the oil strainer stud.....this is not a
fresh break, happened sometime in last 4 months since last oil change,
don't remember anything happening when I put the stainer back on then.

  checked it and sure enough the strainer will wiggle slightly...put it
back together and it torqued down nicely to spec.  refilled and run the
engine.  everything is normal, put cardboard under engine,  nadda not one
drop of oil in over an hour.

   I guess I know the answer but I have to ask...is there any way at all
to fix this without spliting the case????  this is a DAMN GEX case, last
remanant of the disaster I had with them years ago.....they are a curse.

  this is my 1.5 year old two liter rebuild, it is finally running really
sweet after lots of tweaking it up....got gauges and presure is up.  guess
until ???   I am driving a time bomb, have AAA gold and guess I will get a
buzzer on my low oil presure switch to warn me when it 
fails.  10min/10days/10months/10years?????
  
what a holiday present
