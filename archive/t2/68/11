Al,

I whole-heartedly agree that the d-jet FI is a bit antiquated and the L-jet 
(AFC) or some of the newer aftermarket setups are certainly better (by far in 
some cases).

The 3 reasons I went with d-jet are #1 I know a lot about how it works and how 
to trouble-shoot it while my experience with l-jet is zilch.  #2 I just 
happened to have a complete d-jet setup along with lots of spares from when I 
figured out how to make it all work on my 914. And #3, with both motors running 
the same setup I figured I would be able to do swap-out trouble shooting if I 
had any problems on either motor.

Best solution?  Probably not.  Best solution for me at the time?  You betcha!

P.S.  I've been toying with the idea of installing a d-jet setup from a 1.7 
type IV motor onto my 1776 type I in my 58 single cab.  Wouldn't take much 
engineering and I've got most of the needed parts.  Anyone ever try it?
