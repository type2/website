Subject: auxiliary air regulator help

So, I was wondering why my idle was low at startup, and I probably
should have checked the regulator way back when..

I tried blowing through it and it didn't let anything through, even
though the engine was cold.

So, I took it off and took it apart and got the little flap moving
descently.  I'd like to take it apart and regrease it, but it looks like
it's pressed shut, so there isn't much I can do.

One thing I'm trying to figure out is if the opening is wide enough.  I
took two pictures:


This pic with the smaller opening is how it is when the metallic strip
is holding the flap open.

This pic with the bigger opening is me holding it even wider with a
screwdriver.

Does it need to open as much as it is in the second pic, or is the first
opening ok?  Does someone have a cold one that they can compare to?

Thanks,
Mike
