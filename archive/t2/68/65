There is only one good thing about your situation.
If you keep your rear window clean you'll see the oil loss there before
it shows up on your gauges or idiot light.
I believe that you could make a yoke/crossbar that spanned the strainer
opening inside and add a small amount of insurance but I don't see a fix
with splitting the case.
