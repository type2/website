Subject: Re: [T2] another emissions question

The type IV 2000cc engines tend to oveheat and drop valve seats if you
lean them out too much. I just shoot for spark plug burn that is the
color of coffee with cream and I've never lost a head in seven years.
Please note this exception;  the original heads had detonation damage and
both had intake and exhaust seats dropped in additioin the had cracks and
leaked. They were actualy still running but not rebuildable when I pulled
it down and rebuilt the top end.
