its like everything else, all depends on who you go to. 'Supposed' to pass
visual inspection and then the roller test. I don't know why he'd even
bother with testing an egr valve, can't reach em on most cars to check the
plunger. Having been the victim, I mean customer of a few check stations,
look for one that'll do a pre-test, not just charge you everytime. FWIW,
don't know on VW but many are rebuildable, mostly decarbonize them.
