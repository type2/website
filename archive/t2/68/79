I hope it's not fried already.  Good news is 1600
parts are 1/2 to 1/3 of type IV parts.

The european guys have access to genuine VW tin

Too bad you're not closer.  I have exactly what
you want and you have exactly what I want.

How did they rig up the rear engine hanger on the

how the 71 mustache bar would fit without major
fabrication to the 74 body?
