Nothing else is GEXed up in there because nothing in there is GEX, just
didn't have a case when I did the rebuild year and half ago, the case was
thourghly inspected but obviously missed this.....I put almost $2,500 into
this 1gram balance rebuild, mahle piston, new cam, etc, etc, etc  really
can't afford to do this every year or so.

they are a long haul from the East coast, wonder how much they would
charge to do a rebuild using these components on a new case???  since
every thing in there should be in good condition, heck had the heads
dang near blueprinted with diesel seats etc.
