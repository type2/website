I just remade all the interior wall panels on my '72 Westy Poptop.  Used =
a simple 1/8 inch ply (mahogany.)   Looks great with the Redwood stain =
(sorry, no pics yet.) =20
I reused the original ceiling panels.  Just sanded off all that ... uh =
... white wash looking stuff that they covered it with.  Nice wood =
underneath.  Stained it, etc.
I hit 2 problems on the way.
1- The ceiling panels are just over 4 feet wide and a standard sheet of =
ply wood is 4 feet wide exactly.  How is this a problem, you ask?  Well, =
the grain on the sheet of ply runs length wise (8 foot) and the grain =
for the ceiling must run front to back in order to bend the piece into =
place.  Ever try to bend wood against the grain?  Yes, it can be done =
but it is a p.i.t.a.  So you can't cut the 2 large ceiling panels out of =
a standard piece of ply due to the grain.  I suppose you could special =
order the wood, but who knows.  I'm sure someone here will have some =
great solution.
2- Not a great problem but appropriate to the AutoCad program/ pattern =
thread.
The panels are screwed to the side of the bus (not the door panels, of =
course.)  The holes must be drilled in precisely the correct location.  =
Not such a big deal with the smaller pieces, but with the larger one =
behind the driver you can't see to line up the holes.  My holes were =
drilled correctly and I still had a little trouble.  So when making the =
pattern, take careful measurements for those screws.
Then again, you could just try drilling NEW holes into the metal walls.  =
Not something I would want to do though.
Just my 2 cents.

Good luck.  This pattern would be great for the library.
