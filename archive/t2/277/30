Yes.  In an earlier posting a while back, my "dwell went south" and it was reading between 11-21 on my dwell meter.  Idle was fine but it would clug terribly under acceleration.

As a side note, I discovered embarassingly that my bus will idle without the connector from the ECU to AFM attached but it will conk out once you apply the slightest amount of gas pedal.
