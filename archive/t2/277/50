I forgot to add (embarrassedly) that in my most extreme case (leaking cold
start valve plus a cold day)  I actually got out of my subdivision and
about 1/2 a mile to the freeway before I discovered my mistake :-)  yes,
the AFM tells the FI computer to inject more fuel when the buttterfly
opens and yes, if you leave the plug off it won't do that and will lean
out and die as you open the throttle butterfly, but....  if you are
running really really rich, you can get to a fair speed before that
happens.
