Charles, I have never tried to run one that far out, but IMHO the answer
would be "NO!!!"  I would bet money it would not idle at all, much less
"well" and would put a gentlemen's bet on it not starting/running at all.

Again, thank you for the equation on dwell.  I am OK at jack-leg stuff and
continuity checks, but beyond that, I get lost fast.
