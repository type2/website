This was posted to the Vanagon list, but given the approaching cold weather,
I thought it might be appropriate to cross-post it here.

Before I started the Bus Depot, I tried one of these inline heater blowers
in my '77 Westy, but the results were poor.  Yes, it moved more air. But
since the air was sucked through the heat exchangers more rapidly, the air
didn't have as much time to heat on the way through.  The result: more air
volume, but since the air was cooler, little or no actual heating
improvement.  Also, the blower (one specifically sold for this purpose,
although as noted it is basically just a marine bilge blower) did eventually
melt from the heat.

I then put a small BA4 (from a Type 4 car) gas heater booster inline.  This
noticably increased the heater temperature, but there was still not enough
air movement, so what came out was hot but not enough came out.  So I tried
another bilge blower, thinking that this time, with the gas heater booster
keeping the temperature higher, the air would still be warm even after the
blower made it pass through the system faster (unlike last time).  I don't
know what I was thinking.  It worked great for about a week, by which time
the heat from the BA4 turned the bilge blower into a melted mass of plastic.
If you think burning-off oil smells bad when it gets into your aircooled
heating system, try burning plastic!  In retrospect I'm only surprised it
didn't happen sooner.

I then located a used BA6 heater booster, which was the optional one used in
both later Busses and aircooled Vanagons, and put it in place of the BA4.
Bingo! What a difference!!  Instant, hot heat.  Better than any watercooled
car.  It was immediately obvious why VW chose these for use in later
aircooled vans; they work like a charm! These heaters can be hard to find,
and installation is not particularly easy because there are many parts to
them, but it's worth it if you can find one.

With regard to the comment about a bilge fan that sucks air into the heater
channels potentially causing carbon monoxide to be sucked in, while I didn't
notice myself this it certainly does make sense.

Other options for improving the stock heater include carefully sealing every
seam in the heating system and adding insulation (basically making the
system airtight), which will improve the heating capacity noticably (but
still not always sufficiently for the coldest weather), or putting a cab
divider (i.e. clear plastic sheeting ;use multiple layers for better
insulation) behind the drivers seats during the coldest months and letting
the heater heat only the cab area (for which it is more than sufficient).
Of course the latter method can be quite cruel to any back seat passengers.
