FI bus Bus will not idle with dead fuel pump.  The idle bypass curcuit
lets it idle, but opening up the throttle without the connector to the
AFM prevents any signal of airflow change (the resistance read from the
little wiper arm on the resistive track) reaching the ECU.  IE, lots of
air, no corresponding fuel=lean, dies!
