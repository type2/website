This is the easiest way but it's a two person job if you want to do it
quickly and with minimum effort otherwise you'll be under the van to torque
up a bolt, get out from under it, take off the brake, rotate the wheel, pu
on the brake, get back under (do this 15 more times).

The joints are attached to the axle with a press fit.  The bolts hold the
joint to the transmission flanges and the torque of the engine goes through
those bolts which is amazing.  Remove the bolts and the joint will fall off
attached to the axle.

You really need to take the whole axle off: your leverage under there will
be horrible at best and the CV joint most often will require a puller to
remove it from the axle and a press (or hammering technique or some kind) to
put it back on the axle.

Combine this with messing with cv grease (Sean Bartnik says to burn your
clothes after but I managed to get my overalls back from the dry cleaners
clean) and you'll save yourself a lot of hassle and mess by getting the
assembled unit. I takes a long time to grease the joints right and install
them onto the axles.

I have no idea where the complete axle with joints are made. I wanted german
cv joints and the experience so I did it the hard way.  Two german joints
and two new cv boots run about $80 so $120 with the axle is probably a good
deal if it's german considering the labor you will avoid.
