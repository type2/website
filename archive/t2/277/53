Don't bet the farm. The dwell TIME at 4000 RPM and 50 degree dwell is a 
little over 4 milliseconds. The dwell TIME at 900 RPM and 15 degrees dwell 
is 5.5 milliseconds.

In dwell its TIME not angle that gets the coil magnetic field built up. If 
there is enough dwell time to run at 4000 RPM and 50 degrees dwell there is 
enough dwell time to run at 900 RPM and 15 degrees dwell.

I run at 38 degrees to get RPM limiting when I screw up by being in the 
wrong gear when trying to get on the freeway.

BTW the equation for calculating dwell from voltage readings should read

dwell angle(degrees) = 90 [1-{Vave/Vcoil}]

rather than

dwell angle(degrees) = 90 [Vave/Vcoil]
