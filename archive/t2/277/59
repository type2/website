Subject: Clutch Replacement?

I am presently working on the installation of a new 1600 DP longblock in 
my 71 camper. I had replaced the clutch et al. on my old engine about 20k miles 
ago. I was wondering what are the mechanical reasons why a clutch cover 
requires indexing when removal from the flywheel? I assume it might have to 
do with mating wear surfaces or spring tension fatigue when matched with the old flywheel. If this is a significant concern, would it be a better idea to just put on a new clutch on my new longblock (and flywheel) and minimize the likelyhood for future clutch problems?

Thanks,

Joe Delecki
