I don't think the pump always needs to run in order idle after start.

For one thing the open temp sensor in the AFM will give a strong request for 
a rich (long) pulse to the injectors. Also the pump charges the fuel 
manifold during the start cycle to get things going.

In addition a normal vacuum of 14.42 in Hg is equivalent to a 7 psi fuel 
pump.  20 in Hg is close to 10 psi.

As to the safety hazard if the pump isn't running it shouldn't be a problem 
but I haven't verified that the pump is dead in this idle mode.
