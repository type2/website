Richard,


In my opinion, 2.4qt/1000miles would be the absolute max.

My rule of thumb on a t1 engine is 1qt/3,000 miles(driven hard).

If it gets to be where it uses more than 1 qt between oil changes, then
you have a serious rebuild coming!

I don't remember what my last t4 engine did, but I can't ever remember
having to add oil between oil changes.

Cheers, dave
