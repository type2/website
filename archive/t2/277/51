Subject: distributor post

Volks,

I know I promised a post on basic distributor diagnosis and it has not
appeared :-( My sister is getting married this weekend and I have been
dragooned into the process.  I just got done with a bunch of stuff and
will be offline until Sunday after this.  Sorry :-( I have started it, and
will finish and post, I promise!  I *hope* on Sunday (if I am sober enough
to drive home :-)
