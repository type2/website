Vespas are $$$ if you buy them vintage. I don't know if you can buy a new 
one in this country though I know they are still making them. Italy is 
covered with them. Every kid in my neighborhood seemed to have a scooter 
when I lived there. Of course at $5 a gallon of gas not many Italian kids 
playing with big block Chevy Camaros...

<grin>

Went to the local Kawasaki to get a part for my Honda (much cheaper there), 
and they have scooters called "Expresso" that look just like the Vespas in 
Italy but much fancier (chrome, two tone paint). $1K-$1.5K

I'd also look into electric scooters if your expected distances are small. 
Electric conversion bikes will run about 12 miles at 12 mph and quiet.
