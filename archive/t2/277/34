Subject: CV joint replacement question

Hey all-

Excuse this post if the info is already available in archives, but my search 
for "cv joint replacement" yeilded mostly posts pertaining to "ball joints", 
which to my understanding are more a part of the suspension and not the cv's. 
What I'm looking for is - Just how difficult is it to swap out an old one 
with a new one like the one sold at bus depot - Axle Shaft with CV Joints and 
Boots, brand new, ready to install (68-79 bus w/manual trans) $119.95  211 
501 203 -
I HAVE read my manuals on this one (Bentley, Hanes, Muir), but am still 
having trouble discerning whether or not I need to take the joints off of the 
axles to do this or just remove the six hex bolts holding each side of the 
axle to either the tranny or hub and slap the new one in there... I'm sure 
there's an easy answer for this, as it is a pretty common procedure, but its 
my first time with it so if you have some experience, please share kindly. 
Thanks!
