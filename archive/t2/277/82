Baby BMW K-series... Nice.

Glad scooters are gaining popularity again. I ride year round an '81 Honda 
CB 900 Custom (light touring motorcycle) and except for the Harley's it is 
pretty lonely on the streets.

If it's aircooled, or rear engined, or a two wheeler with a friendly rider, 
they've got a friend in me. I'm not a Harley guy (nor do i want a Harley) 
by any stretch but I don't care what you ride.
