If it doesn't say "M+S" on the sidewall, it isn't legal as a snow tire.  I
got caught out that way with Hercules tires, where the passenger version
is M+S rated and the C and D rated versions (same tread) are not.

There are a lot of goods coming out of China these days and quality is
quite variable.  Some of it is great, others abysmal.  I'd let others test
it for me first!  :)
