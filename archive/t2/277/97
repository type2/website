A friend of mine races a late-model Cobra Mustang in SCCA events and has
good things to say about Kumho's race tires.  Kumho is a Korean company.
The other brand he uses is Hoosier.

I've posted this before, but a while back, I wrote lots of tire companies
asking them what "modern" size/model of tire to use for my '64 Bus.  I
put the results here: http://members.cox.net/mattroberds/tires.html
IMHO it is good to support companies that are helpful to potential
customers.
