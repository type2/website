Hi Casey,

While I don't have much mileage on my latest rebuild, I'm VERY happy with 
it.  I got it from Jake Raby of Raby's Aircooled Technology in Georgia 
(www.aircooledtechnology.com), and have put almost 10,000 miles on it since 
February.  It was a little pricey ($3k range), but it's powerful, strong, 
and I have had NO problems with it since the break-in finished.  Jake is a 
stand-up guy who does careful work (like Boston Bob), and (even better) he 
specializes in Type IV engines.  If you can save up the cash, it's worth 
some consideration, especially if you don't want to deal with rebuilding 
your engine for 150k miles.  You can buy a cheap rebuild that lasts 50k and 
replace it 3 times, or you can spend the money now and get a good rebuild 
that'll last.  Pay now, or pay later.

Good luck!
