You can get Vespas brand new in the US.  Here in 
Portland, OR and new Vespa dealer just opened up a few 
months ago  They are selling like hotcakes.  I was 
hoping to get in on a 02 when the 03's came in but I 
don't think there will be any 02's left to move.  

You can get the ET2 (good up to about 
35mph) for about $3100 out the door and the ET4 (up to 
65mph) for about $4200.  Check out www.vespausa.com.

Cheers,
