The dial may be labeled in amps, but the output it determines is obviously
in volts.  Amps is a measure of the number of electrons that are pushed
though the wire, so if the output were truly controlled in amps the extra
leads wouldn't change the current.

What is happening is that the welder supplies a voltage to its output
terminals sufficient to push the desired amperage through short leads and
the work.  A lesser current will flow through the higher resistance of
longer leads, but it doesn't mean that current is leaving the circuit.
Reduce the lead resistance (larger wires or less resistivity) and the
current will go to its original value.
