Subject: Re:2000cc Engine Mileage Poll !!How many miles on your rebuilt

Casey,
    Sometime late in the last century the engine in our '77 bus needed
a rebuild.  At 132,000 original miles the rivets that held the cam
gear onto the cam shaft sheared.  I rebuilt the engine myself and it
lasted over 100,000 miles.  I had to finally take the bus off the road
due to rust in the frame and axle beam, but the engine was still
running strong.  As for cost, I don't have the slightest idea..
