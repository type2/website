All VOM's of any quality at all come with complete instructions to make 
basic tests. Some very few current digitals might not have a dwell setting, 
but most do. They measure time and display the on/off ratio as a percentage 
of 1. A chart or simple math will give you the dwell for various numbers of 
cylinders. Most meters designed for automotive use will let you set the 
number of cylinders and do the math internally and readout direct dwell.
