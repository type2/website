Howdy,

I may be able to help out on both of these issues.
I run a '84 Rabbit GTI in SCCA autocross and have had great success with the
Kuhmo radial tires, Victoracers(185-60-14).  These are a DOT tire but with a
very sticky tread compound, made to heat up quickly for an autocross run.  I
also have a set of street Kuhmo's on the GTI, and have been very pleased
with them.  

As for Bus tires, I went to  www.tirerack.com and found some really great
Dunlop SPLT5 185-14 tires, that are 4 ply, truck tires.  They have
blackwalls and are very beefy looking tires.  

Hope this helps y'all out,

Gary P Alexander

A friend of mine races a late-model Cobra Mustang in SCCA events and has
good things to say about Kumho's race tires.  Kumho is a Korean company.
The other brand he uses is Hoosier.

I've posted this before, but a while back, I wrote lots of tire companies
asking them what "modern" size/model of tire to use for my '64 Bus.  I
put the results here: http://members.cox.net/mattroberds/tires.html
IMHO it is good to support companies that are helpful to potential
customers.

Before the tire FART gets cranked up again, I'll throw in a plug for
