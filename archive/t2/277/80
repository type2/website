Subject: MY travels continue

well, we have put 8500 miles on the 74 westy so far (since July 15) and 
everything is still pretty good -- I have a leaky roof I need to repair (I 
think some fiberglass paint will help, if not fix)

we are now in southeast Indiana (my wife's sister lives here) -- I was 
wondering if anyone knew anyone in this area that might take a look at my 
bus -- just to check everything over -- I think we will be hanging here for 
awhile...

the town is Seymour, In -- any help would be appreciated.

TJ
