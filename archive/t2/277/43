Subject: Fuel  by other means.

On my 1977 bus, if you remove the the ECU connector from the the air flow 
sensor the fuel pump can not run except in the start mode. Check the 
schematic. The fuel pump interlock circuit (pin 39 and pin 36)is open with 
out the connector in place.

My bus has started and ran with this connector disconnected.
