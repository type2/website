Thanks for the reply.  How does it account for the fact that the stock pulley behind the fan uses a special narrow fan belt and the Sanden compressor's pulley uses the typical (wider) fan belt?  I was hoping the kit had a new pulley for the wider belt.  The thin belts are rare, expensive and I'm told they break easily hence my reluctance to use them.
