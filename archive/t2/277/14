I think they are looking at the square wave from the points and averaging 
an AC voltage from that which  they then translate into Tach/Dwell 
information and then read it out to you so you are happy with the numbers 
and switch settings.

Analog is a simple deflection of a needle. Digital is a Digital VTVM. I 
take it the cautions are due to the fact a digital VTVM has a 9 Volt 
battery in it to check for resistance checking and could perhaps cause a 
small arc that could blow one of the transistors or diodes in the computer 
control for the vehicle. It is likely early CMOS in there. Back when they 
were learning lessons the hard way.

Just my thoughts as an electronics tech.
