Not hard at all.  Remove 12 bolts using special triple-square driver
socket (also available from Bus Depot), remove axle, install new axle,
replace bolts, torque to (IIRC) 24 ft-lbs.

Easiest to do if you lift the wheel just off the ground with a jack under
the shock mount.

Make sure the CVs are well greased, and keep everything clean to prevent
cross-contamination.
