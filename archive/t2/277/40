Subject: Re: [T2] 2000cc Engine Mileage Poll !!How many miles on your

On the 17-18 I normaly get well over 100K, when to
rebuild for the third time is when the engine starts
to use more than 1qt of oil per 1000 miles. My 2.0 L
is yet to be tested, I have rebuilt 8 or so in my shop
for people, only had them come back for normal
maintance. the one I have built for myself I am having
trouble with it, I know better but I'll skip a
procedure or try to save money(Like a dummy) and end
up costing more on mine. A 2.0 L should get over 150K
with good maintence.  Phil
