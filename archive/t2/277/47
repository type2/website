So have *some* of mine.  Others will not.  I think it is a flaw in the AFM
or in the double relay.  I also think it is a safety hazard, as the design
shuts off fuel in the event of the engine being not running and the key
being on (after an accident, say).  At the same time, I have to say
(guiltily) that I have never bothered to fix any of mine that ran with the
AFM unplugged.
