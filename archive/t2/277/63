No question, anytime the dwell is changed the timing must be reset as well.  
Resetting timing does not require resetting dwell of course.

As the fiber block wears the dwell increases and timing is retarded by 1/2 
the the increase in dwell. If the dwell increases from 50 deg to 52 deg the 
timing would change from 7.5 BTDC to 6.5 BTDC.

Due to the saturation characteristics of the coil the spark does not get 
hotter with dwells longer than the minimum required. Dwells longer than this 
minimum simply heat up the coil and points to no advantage. My guess is that 
the minimum for my bus (1977) is 3 milliseconds.

With a 50 degree dwell, the dwell time at 5000 RPM is 3.3 milliseconds.

With my dwell set at 38 degrees the dwell time at 5000 is 2.5 milliseconds 
and spark is starting to be reduced. I consider this to be desirable but it 
is a matter of personal choice.
