Pacific Northwest listees:

Cascade Kombis is a friendly local bus club, meets first Tuesday every
month,
See our Website: www.cascadekombis.org or p-mail me for more info.
We have been meeting since 1988, put on the annual NW Vintage VW Meet in
July,
in fact we save "some" of the proceeds to buy pizza for the club every
month,
but, you have to buy you own lovely beverages.
We started as a camping club, NEATO chapter, but anybody that has an
interest in
air cooled VWs should have fun.
