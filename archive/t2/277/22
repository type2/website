Before I bought my $15 Sunpro ("accept no other substitutes!" or "as seen in the Steve Dolan butt-crack photo") I was researching other automotive multi-meters and re: Fluke I found out that the 78 does dwell but the newer 88 only does duty cycle.   Instead they provide a table in the printed manual to help you convert to dwell.  Annoying considering the price you are paying.

Anyway, to the original poster, in the archives you can find posts about "poor mans' dwell" like this one:
