Drat! Caught again!  My thanks to Charles Watson for his equation and
explanation.

While this *will* work, presuming that your alternator/generator and VR
are working, and I *have* set dwell this way, it is *not* the best way to
set dwell.  Of course, if you can afford it, buy the Fluke meter!  No
doubt about it, they are the way to go.  OTOH, if, like me, you can't
afford the Fluke, the sunpro does the job just fine. Lastly, however, if
you are (a) a starving student or (b) broke down away from your dwell
meter but with a VOM then the 6.67VDC reading will get you home.
Interestingly, if you are going for the VOM method, the cheaper the meter,
the more likely it is to work.
