Subject: Re: [T2] HELP! rear end droning noise

I have to agree with Chris.  Sounds like a bad wheel bearing.  I had the 
same thing happen to my '70.  Thought the tranny was going to fall out.  As 
it got worse, I thought it would be my teeth.  Seems the P.O.(my dumba$$ 
brother) had put ball bearings on the inside and outside of the rear bearing 
housing.  On top of that, he "forgot" to clean and repack the bearing when 
his wheel cylinder exploded, so what grease there was left contained a rusty 
sludge.  You never know what people will(or won't) do when faced with a 
challenge.  If you're going to have to look at the bearings on both sides, 
you might as well replace them all.  Use a good grease.  I like the 
synthetics.
