Hi peoples,

Looks like me and Kevin are having similar problems with our carbs.
This morning i was driving to work and noticed low power upon acceleration.
when i got to work i looked at the right side carb and noticed this thick
white film surrounding
the area of the gasket. looks like a mixture of condensation and gas.
What to do?your responses are much appreciated.
Darren
