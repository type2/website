Truly, conversions are no big deal, particularly since duty cycle is the 
preferred mode of testing all frequency modulations in electronic circuits 
which are far more common in todays industry, ergo, industry standard. It 
is no more difficult than converting feet to meters or ounces to pounds. If 
something that simple throws you, you shouldn't be playing with 
instruments. Bottom line, accurate digital duty cycle is much preferred to 
approximate analog dwell.

Before the 98 came out, the Fluke 88 was the best instrument in the world 
for automotive electrics. You can buy a new one today for $400 or less than 
half that on the webauctions. But any of the 70 series with fewer features 
will do quite well for reality at home with your bus, and I've seen some of 
these go for $35-$50. Drop your peghookhardwarestore meter on the garage 
floor once, then think about how you wished you had that $15 back to get 
better value per dollar by facing the real cost of quality results.
