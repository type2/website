Mike B: says "
------------------------------
 Watched the Mythbusters show . . . The flow of that air starts behind the
sharp vertical edge of the cab and is like our busses in the back- the air
drops quickly and rolls from ground in towards the engine lid- so if it is
open, the warm air back there from engine/exhaust will indeed be rolled
right into the engine compartment and rerun by the fan!

Mike, I like your thinking!!

So, our buses are being PUSHED from the back by this airflow??  And the
faster I go, the more I am being PUSHED?!?!?
