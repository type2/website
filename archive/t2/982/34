If it's an early bay like mine, removing and installing the engine and
transmission together is the only way to go!  I can't imagine trying to
mate up an engine to a transmission that is barely dangling on chains or
somesuch.

If you have a floor jack, bolt a foot-square piece of 3/4 or 1" plywood to
the "cup" to provide a flat surface.  The balance point is about where the
engine joins the transmission.
