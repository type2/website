Subject: Re: [T2] Sliding Window Glides?

I seem to recall the ones I got from Karl for my 73 had plastic glides between the sliding part of the window
and the frame. (See the pic.)

They seem to be missing from the windows in my 78 and because they're missing, I can open the windows from the
outside. The latch is never lifted high enough to lock into the notches in the frame.

Yes, the white nylon or plastic slides are gone. They were available from VW but are now NLA.  #19AA here:
http://www.ratwell.com/technical/Microfiche/t207900.gif
for 78/79 bay window sliders. It is NLA for the early Vanagons, i.e. 80-85 but still available for the later
Vanagons, i.e. 86-91 as part number 281 847 723B. You may be able to modify it?

I have about 2 dozen 78/79 sliders. Some have the slides and some are missing. I need to fix the missing ones
one of these days..... before VW decides to make the later one NLA.
