I used a bug muffler for several years and never caught a whiff of
exhaust.  However, I often smell exhaust for a few seconds with the bus
muffler if I start my engine with the heater controls on.

I think that the bus muffler is the way to go, but I don't believe that
you will get significant exhaust fumes in the bus even with a bug muffler.

Somebody creative with a tubing bender could make a pair of way-offset
tailpipes to keep everyone happy!
