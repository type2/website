Subject: Re: [T2] Bay window propane tanks

Stephen asked

Hi folks.
 
The underbody propane tank that was on some bay window
Westies has been NLA for a long time.
 
Does anyone know of a modern substitute that mounts easily,
or if a Vanagon propane tank can mount on a bay window bus?
 
My bus never had one and I'd like to add one to it.

The Vanagon tank mounts on the drivers side.

Here is the original manufacturer:  http://www.mantank.com/products/rv/rvcylinders.htm

I have a couple of bay Westu tanks......
