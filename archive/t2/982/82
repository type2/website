Subject: Re: [T2] is the SVDA still the best?

I remember when the megasquirt was first coming up
here on the list a few years back.

I imagine it is quite advanced now.

The engine im working on i think may have deeper
issues that just lack of suitable ignition and
carbueration solutions.

Runs hot and won't do more than 45mph.

Could be the timing i guess. I know its advanced but i
haven't put a light on it yet.

Ongoing...

Thanks guys.

George - there is an NPR program that credits a George
Lyle as...i think a technical engineer. Is that you?

Thanks again, 
Clark
