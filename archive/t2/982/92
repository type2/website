Subject: Bay window propane tanks

Hi folks.

The underbody propane tank that was on some bay window
Westies has been NLA for a long time.

Does anyone know of a modern substitute that mounts easily,
or if a Vanagon propane tank can mount on a bay window bus?

My bus never had one and I'd like to add one to it.

Thanks.
