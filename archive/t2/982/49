Thanks for the advice all, it helps even with a moral boost. We are moving
aboard our sailboat in less than two weeks and my single cab still has no
interior, no drivetrain, still needs some dents taken care of and a paint
job. Once we move aboard I won't have shop space beyond the parking lot (and
they take a dim view of spray painting). So my blood pressure is a little
high right now. I can now plan how and when to put in the drivetrain with an
idea of how long to allocate for that job (adding 50% for good measure).
Surprising how long it takes to build a 40-year-old single cab...
