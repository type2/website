Yes, they do seem to like PB.

If you have a large infestation, you need a 5-gallon plastic bucket and a
3-pound coffee can.  Using heavy wire, make an axle along the cylinder
axis of the coffee can.  Lay the axle across the top of the bucket,
allowing the coffee can to rotate freely.  Put a
few dabs of peanut butter on the can and provide a ramp to allow the
mice to get to the top of the bucket.  Put a couple of inches of water in
the bucket.

The mice climb up, try to get to the peanut butter, jump to the coffee can
which rotates and deposits the mouse in the bucket where they go to mouse
heaven.  The cool thing about this setup is the trap is never "sprung," so
you can trap a lot of mice.

heating ducts.  Those little suckers have no problem getting past the
grilles and into the ducts.
