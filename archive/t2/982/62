Subject: Sliding Window Glides?

http://www.donimages.com/guacamolebus/photos/photo.php?id=178

I seem to recall the ones I got from Karl for my 73 had plastic glides
between the sliding part of the window and the frame. (See the pic.)

They seem to be missing from the windows in my 78 and because they're
missing, I can open the windows from the outside. The latch is never
lifted high enough to lock into the notches in the frame.
