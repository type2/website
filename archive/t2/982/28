Hi Mike,

There's a wire on the double-relay that goes to the starter. If you  
put the starter button over there then there's nothing to worry about  
during an engine drop.

Bonus: The double-relay is much easier to access than the regulator  
if the bus is loaded full of camping gear....

Happy Trails,
