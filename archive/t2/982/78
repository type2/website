Subject: Re: [T2] Sliding Window Glides?

Guys,

I can verify that the Vanagon ones can be made to work quite well....I 
used them on my Champagne edition restore.  I did have to go back and 
actually use a little glue on them when warm weather came around as they 
kept trying to come out of the frame....I didn't care if they were black 
or white...they were black.

Otherwise, they look great and slide well.

Cheers, dave
