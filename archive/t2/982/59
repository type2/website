Perhaps Too offtopic for the list-but relates to our once used 71 bus..
When we lived in COLD Syracuse I replaced a touchy 34PICT3 with  a Pinto 
2 throat carb on my 71 bus, and the reason I had no warmth problems is I 
used the stock manifold with the preheat pipe and an adaptor to the 
carb...- worked fine, had good "get on the highway or when flooring it" 
power with no overall change in milage.  There was very little space 
above this for an air cleaner, so I used a low toyota filter sitting on 
a plate mounted to carb surrounded by 6 eyebolts and springs that I 
hooked into an upper plate with its own eyebolts- had just enough room 
to slide in the filter with the above plate and hook the springs!  The 
choke was manual, with a cable up to the driver.

  Cold weather is of course the enemy of the weber progressive! I have
  adapted an air cleaner off a Mazda to get warm air in initially as it
  uses a wax capsule to open the cold/warm air flap so I didn't have to
  use vacuum to operate the flap as most air cleaners do. This arrangement
  helps cold running ......
