Working alone, I found it easier to install the tranny with the engine 
when we HAD to swap daughter's 75 bus tranny.  No cursing and rocking of 
engine trying to get the transhaft to slide into the clutck disk. Secret 
is to use a motorcycle jack that keeps it all stable side to side. 
Loosely got the front of the tranny mounted- and only hard part was 
aligning the upper tranny bolts; I made a drift out of a large landscape 
tie nail to slip together one side while lining up the other side to get 
the bolt in.

  would NOT recommend trying to install them together, particularly not
