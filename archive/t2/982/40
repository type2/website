I agree with myself and disagree with none.

The table jack (lift) is a flat metal tough-as-nails table, so it's uses are
diverse. A table lift is a more useful purchase then a proprietary jack that
would be used once-in-a-great-while for most folks.

When I'm not messing around with bus motors and trannys, I use the table
lift for all kinds of shop duties. I call it my Swiss-army table (but I
already lost the tweezers and toothpick).
