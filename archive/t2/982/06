This is almost certainly what the problem is (it's not the 009, I have a 
proper VW vac advance disy) but the muck is a nightmare to shift. It's imune 
to carb cleaner and any other substance I throw at it.

In the end I have to chose between spending more time poking around in the 
carb or shelling out for a new one and getting back on the road. I've 
decided to go for the later as everyones suggestions indicate that I have 
some crud in there somewhere.

Thanks for your help though. It's going to get me driving quicker than if I 
spent even longer fighting with dirt.

anyone wants to see what carb muck looks like.

Rust is a big problem for the accel pump.. a tiny.. I mean TINY spec in the
area of the ball will make it not work.
Do you know what the ball is for...?
It is a check valve..  if the valve isn't seating because a TINY speck of
rust is holding it off the seat.. it just pushes the gas back into the float
bowl instead of out thru the pressurized nozzle.
