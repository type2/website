Mike, that is a great idea.. I always cringe when people use the 110volt stuff
tho... someone "could" plug your switch into a live outlet ,,,,  chances are
slim I know.. but being an electrician..... nooooooooooooooooo!

Here is a suggestion.. you could make up one with a 2 wire plug similar to
this one.

Hope that helps.

I'm thinking of just going to home depot and getting a 110 outlet and
mounting that in the engine compartment and wire it to the starter.
Then, on my remote starter, I'd put a 110 male plug and whenever I need
to remote start, I just plug it in and hit the trigger. This way it
also keeps things a little safer than having a button that can be
accidentally pressed.
