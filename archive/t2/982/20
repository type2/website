Subject: Re: [T2] Suggestion: Remote Starter

I've often considered putting a starter button in the engine
compartment. No need for full wiring, since it just needs to turn the
starter. I'll either jumper to the coil + terminal, or have the key on
up front, or just want to crank the engine, doing a compression test
for example.

These are cheap:

These aren't cheap, but are much sexier (though possibly less durable):
