"""Note: Look closely at the photo and you'll notice  that the tent is
designed to be taller on the side that attaches to the VW.  So please pay
close attention when erecting the poles. The red tape goes to  the VW side.
If not set up correctly you will end up with a lop-sided tent.  """

thinking that it is true, but the four corner poles that adjust  are all the same. 
So the difference would have to be in the bottom part of the  cornor pieces.
