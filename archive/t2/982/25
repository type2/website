i recommend a rabbit-style fuel pump relay, like this:

http://germansupply.com/xcart/customer/product.php?productid=16928

this relay uses a signal from the coil as the relay trigger, and also  
supplies voltage during cranking. it is foolproof and safe. a bit of  
work to install cleanly, but worth the effort to get a nice install.  
when i do them here in the shop i use the wire housing from an FI  
harness, and make a small custom wire loom. i have a circuit diagram  
available for this relay, it is pretty simple,
