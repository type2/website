two major differences for the auto tranny vs the manual.

1) the auto tranny is VERY VERY heavy, about what the engine weighs

2) you don't need to pull the engine way back to clear a shaft in the
automatic, the flex plate and the torque convertor seperate clean and
flat. in fact the lower engine mounting studs are the longest thing, the
biggest thing to be carefull of is to make sure the torque convertor
doesn't fall out when you pull the engine.
