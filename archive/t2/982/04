Hi Nathan,

Dropping the transmission with the engine is no major sweat, but I  
would NOT recommend trying to install them together, particularly not  
if you are working alone. Way too heavy to manage, unless you have a  
particularly good jack available.

If it's your first early-bay engine swap, I would count on it taking  
the whole day to re-and-re two engines. If you don't have to put the  
second engine back in, all the better.

Crusty bolts are your worst enemy. Take a full can of penetrating oil  
and a torch with a full propane cylinder. Don't forget fresh fuel  
lines and perhaps a new filter while you're at it.

A second dolly jack can also come in really handy.


Happy Trails,
