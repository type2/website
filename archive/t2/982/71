Mythbusters is a fun show, but beware of drawing any parallel conclusions
from their data.  Their purpose is to entertain.

A bus will carry a "bubble" of turbulant air along behind it.  Since the
air exhausted by the cooling system goes right into this bubble it is
logical to figure that some of it will reciruclate through the engine lid
door.

Another way of thinking about it:  There was a good reason that VW put the
air inlets way up there and went to such pains to seal the engine and door
to the body!  :)
