I'm thinking of just going to home depot and getting a 110 outlet and 
mounting that in the engine compartment and wire it to the starter. 
Then, on my remote starter, I'd put a 110 male plug and whenever I need 
to remote start, I just plug it in and hit the trigger.  This way it 
also keeps things a little safer than having a button that can be 
accidentally pressed.
