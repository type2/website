And to have the exhaust routed in such a fashion to exit out the side
corner to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning if the upper rear hatch was left
open or the seal had deteriorated to the point of allowing air (or noxious
fumes) into the interior.

Another reason NOT to use a Bug muffler on the 68-71 Bay.
