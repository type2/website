Subject: Mythbusters show related to why engine lid should stay closed

Watched the Mythbusters show related to "should tailgate of a pickup be 
up or down for best milage/air flow?"  The CW said keep it down to 
prevent the up tailgate from needlessly pushing on air and causing drag. 
  They busted that one (opposite is true) by showing how a "bubble" of 
air rolling between the cab and tailgate keeps the majority of airflow 
going over the plane of the whole truck and down to the ground beyond 
the truck.  The flow of that air starts behind the sharp vertical edge 
of the cab and is like our busses in the back- the air drops quickly and 
rolls from ground in towards the engine lid- so if it is open, the warm 
air back there from engine/exhaust will indeed be rolled right into the 
engine compartment and rerun by the fan!
