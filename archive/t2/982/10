Subject: sunroof cables

I hope this is not a prohibited message.  Having recently purchased a '78 sunroof bus with a currently operable sunroof, I have become aware of the rarity of replacement cables for the sunroof.
   
  There is a vendor on the samba dot com that is making reproduction sunroof cables if anyone needs them.  It's under classifieds/parts baywindow.
   
  I read the charter and this message appeared to be ok.  If not, please accept my apologies all.  Thanks, Greg
