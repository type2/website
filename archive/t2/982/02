After struggling with my newly acquired '69 camper, trying to run back and
forth from the key to the carb to get her running, I discovered a little push
button that someone had installed by the battery.  I closed my eyes, crossed
my fingers, and gave it a push.  The engine cranked.  Prolly one of the most
convenient mods I've come across-as long as the tranny is out of gear when you
push it.
