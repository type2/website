James,

Sounds to me like you have a cylinder or something that suddenly started 
working...or an accelerator pump nozzle that finally got unclogged.

The brass one just inside the throat of the carb that look like a U.

Or a spark plug(or wire) that suddenly started working again.

Gas in the oil would be very bad, but if the level is the same and the oil 
on the dipstick doesn't smell like oil, you are probably ok there.

Could be a ton of stuff....

Generally, white smoke when starting up an engine that has sat a long time 
too, or that has some water vapor somewhere.

Not much help, I know, but maybe some....

Cheers, dave

 In the year that I've had it, the bus has always leaked oil, dripping
 from what seems to be lots of locations.  This Spring was the
 appointed time to address the issue.  The bus was always a slow
 poke - no acceleration even for a 1600.
