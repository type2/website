Subject: CA Smog Evasion

Well, I'm now wrestling with the ramifications of
California's recent legislative assault on my bus.
I've been working on a slow resto project (mechanicals
first) since 2002. I was banking on long term smog
exemption, begining in 2007, but now it looks like
I'll be on the smog hook forever...eventually some
critical part will be NLA, and then what?

Since 1975 and earlier vehicles are smog exempt, I'm
contemplating selling Pumpkin II into a bus-friendly
state and buying a 1975 westy (75 cuz that's the
oldest year w/ FI and the youngest year that's smog
exmpt). Does anyone know what is involved in bringing
a smog-exempt vehicle into CA? Would they want to smog
it one time when I register it? Has anyone done this
with a 75 or older?

Thanks,
Rick
