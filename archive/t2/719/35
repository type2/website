Well, I finally installed my Chevy Astro coil-over rear shocks (The coil-overs the PO had installed wore out). The top bolt needed a spacer, I used a large nut and a couple washers. The original bottom bolt was a little too short for the bottom mount bushing on the new shock (besides it was worn out). I think someone on the list had actually dremmeled the bushing on Astro Van coil-overs; it looked as though a good dremmeling on both sides of the bushing would work, but I decided just to find a longer bolt. After a futile tour of San Diego's hardware stores, I went online and found Maryland Metrics:  http://mdmetric.com/
 
I called them up, asked for two partially threaded M12 1.5 100mm bolts and nuts, and the guy said they'd ship today. Minumum order $10. If you don't already have a nuts & bolts vendor, add these guys to your favorites.
 
The bus handles much better with working shocks. Maybe someday I'll adjust the torsion bars.
