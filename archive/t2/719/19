Subject: VW Truck Mirrors

Hello All,

I had once bid on a pair of 70s era VW truck side mirrors (got out bid).  The 
actual mirror was simular to my mirrors however the mount to the door was 
larger.  I think they would even fold in.  Are these still available?  Has anyone 
ever mounted these to their bus?  It seemed like these would really help. My 
baby moon stick on mirrors always fall off.  I would really like to see abit 
more of my backup area. Is there another way of extending your side mirrors 
out? If anyone has a picture of these I would really like to see them again.  
Thanks,
