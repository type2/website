Subject: Re: [T2] Karl von Salzen Day

I have to thank Karl myself. He has sent me a couple of items he only 
requested the cost of shipping for and more recently he is sending me the 
engine tin I need. I finally got him to take some money for his parts!!

He is a great asset to the list and to the community!!

Thanks again Karl!!
