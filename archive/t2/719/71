 >Alright, I took my "new" 1976 Westy into the shop yesterday and
confirmed that I have a dead #3 cylinder.  Mr. Mechanic says that I need
new heads and probably new pistons and cylinders.

I had my engine reco'd soon after getting my bus. There are two things I 
regret. First, not doing it myself. Second, not getting an aftermarket cam.

Mind you, at my rate of progress I would still be doing the engine now, 3 
years later!

Cheers,
