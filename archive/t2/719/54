With all due respect to Karl, whose advise I've consumed both through
the archives and live since joining the list a couple of years ago,
between your website, regular postings both here and at theSamba, as
well as pmails, the coordination of the bulk buy of extinct Koni
shocks, the discovery of Dakota Digital gauges (need I go on?) there
should be a RAtwell day. To quote from theSamba "Richard, you're an
international star!".
Hail Karl.
Hail Richard.
Hail the list.

Obligatory bus content: replaced the ignition wires and we're up and
running again. Dieseled when I got to work and realized I didn't
re-tune the (-at-)#$% Weber after valve adjusting, re-wiring and re-timing.
You (the list) did it again!
