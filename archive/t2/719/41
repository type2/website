Subject: Reccomended fuel line

Hi everyone,



First of all, congrats for Karl. It is very fitting. Secondly, I know
there was a discussion about fuel line manufacturers a while back and
was wondering what the verdict was. If I remember right, it was the fuel
line with the orange pattern on it? I posted this on the Samba but
didn't get any real reply.



Thanks again,



Max
