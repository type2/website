Multiple posts were thanks to Mozilla,
and did not include the revised "sheesh :)"
I just did not feel the need to correct it
for a thousand readers (until now:)!

It's too late to do the shift plate adjustment
because the ($2.00US :) bushing is shot and no
adjustment will correct for it.
Fortunately, it's a very simple repair. Just
study the shifter plate configuration before
you turn the plate over and decide it would look
better upside down and backwards.
Everybody does it, it never works :)
You can inspect the cage, but unless it is broken
don't consider it until the front bushing is done.
