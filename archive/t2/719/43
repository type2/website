Hi Richard,

Excellent idea. Karl's been a big help to me too. But you have to 
mention the ONE THING that MUST NOT BE DONE on KVS day...

"Under no circumstances may anyone post a question about child cot 
poles".

People:  if you absolutely must ask about cot poles, please wait until 
midnight.


Happy Trails.
