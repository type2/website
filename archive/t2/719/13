A possible cause of white smoke is condensation,
from the cylinders and the exhaust manifold, which
became steam instantly when the cylinder(s) lit.
As I now see your new post, this begins to look less
likely,as condensation burns off rether quickly,
but certainly partially responsible. Soggy heat exchangers
will put out a lot of smelly fumes for quite a while,
as oil leaks tend to collect in them.
Instant power on sounds like an ignition defect.
Clogged carb jets is also on the list.
Fortunately, your problem is an improvement in power:)
I would be more concerned with operating the engine
in it's previous sustained deficient state and the
inattention to basic maintenance.
A proper inspection of basic mechanical,ignition,
electrical, and fuel systems is in order.
Gasoline diluted oil will destroy bearings.
Start with an oil change,head torque, and valve adjustment.
Repair oil leaks, resolve the oil dilution problem.
Get the engine clean (car wash)then note all leaks.
Repair them, then reinspect for more.
Begin a system of regular maintenance.
