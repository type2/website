Speaking of messy shops,the mom and pop motor repair shops in my town is so
bad you have to study before you take your next step so you can find a good
place to put your foot down.He has stuff pile 6 feet high.The amazing thing
is he knows exactly where everything is.its mind boggeling.He does fantastic
work though.The only reason the fire dept doesnt shut him down is because he
does all the cities motor repair.By the way he s cheap too.He rebuilt the
starter and generator in my bug for $25 in 1996(he is a family friend though
so I might have got a deal)So you cant always judge a shop by how clean it
is.
