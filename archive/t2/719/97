Subject: First successful drive in my bus

HI,

I just took my bus for its first successful round trip. We made it down to
the gas station and back with no problems.

I'm excited. Spring is here and I finally have a bus to drive around in.

Still so much to do.... replace the floor in the passenger section, rust
abatement, paint, door seals, poptop seals, etc etc etc....

I think I'll stick around for a while :)

peace!!
jules
