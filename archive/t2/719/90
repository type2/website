Subject: Re: [T2] Studs question

Your only option to avoid that (seems like you are refering to case
studs with that theory) is to locktite the exhuast studs in first,
then troque the new brass nuts on. This probably isn't a bad idea to
avoid thread galling, but isn't likely to be a huge issue. Now if the
nut is truely immovable on the stud, and you require more torque than
the 'stop' positon when screwing the assembly back in, yes you COULD
overtighten the stud into the head I suppose. I have never seen this
done.

I had the same concern last year and talked to someone about it
(basically I was ready to order the small parts), but they set my mind
at  ease over this. Now I can't reccomend horsing nasty studs deep
into the head instead of 5 bucks in parts, either..

If you have the time, I would order new. IF not, you can get away with
this with some caution not to brutilize the head. It's all subjective
to where the nuts are on the studs, codition of all the parts, etc...
