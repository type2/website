Subject: My First Gremlin: 1600 DP , Pict 34

Bus doesn't start. It turns over and I verfied that the fuel pump is getting
gas to the carb. I changed the Coil out just to be sure.Still have the issue.

Symptoms: Turns over great, no problem there and I can sit for 10 minutes or
30 minutes trying the key at times just truns over and then right when I am
about ready to give up for fear of draining the battery I release the key (gas
pedal is all the way to the floor)  Release the key and it putters and will
usally start.

1600 DP
Pict 34 carb
SVDA w/compufire

3 years and my first Gremlin....

Any ideas. I think it's maybe the carb. I dont think there are any vacum
issues with a Pict 34. Would the choke be a "person of interest here"

Thanks
