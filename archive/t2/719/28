Hi:

Anyone on the list have experience with Kiptopeke State Park in the 
Virginia section of the Delmarva peninsula? We're planning on attending 
Everybus, and we thought we might spend Thursday evening there. Its 
pretty close to the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel, which puts it within 
striking distance of Everybus for Friday.
