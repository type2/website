From Kevin:


Okay, guys, Jamie has come up with it (I hope)!  I
must have a late-model S-87 starter with a longer
shaft to fit the 228mm flywheels on the late bay
Westy's.  But my engine is  a CB number - 1974.  Would
that work?  I don't understand at all.  All I know is,
my bus is a '76 model with a '74 engine.  And it runs
great but starts most of the time.  Why would I have
that 228 mm flywheel?  Thanks...KR

Because you have the 76 to 79 091 trans. The bellhousing is longer.
You have to use the 228 flywheel with that trans and bellhousing and the longer 
starter.
