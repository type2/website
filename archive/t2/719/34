Rob,

Mark Dearing is right about Virginia State Parks.  For a couple of years
now they have won awards for effieciency and quality depite being below
the national average of park funding per resident.

Bear Tree is a National Forest Campground, but, never-the-less, a
wonderful place to stay at.

As to Kiptopeke, I grew up in Virginia Beach and have been to Kiptopeke in
my youth.  It is a real nice place and now is the time to enjoy it as the
bugs are not bad ..... yet!

First Landing/Seashore is a great place too, but it is WAY crowded every
weekend it is open, not really that quiet either. It is close the Beach
however.

Staying at a campground on the Assateague National Seashore may be
alternative worth exploring as would be staying at one of the Campgrounds
at the Kerr Dam reservoir (Army Corps of Engineers owned) or the state
parks (Staunton River state park, Occonochee).  Both cool places too.
If you had the time, Merchants Millpond State park off Rt 32 (south of
Suffolk) in NC would be a GREAT place to stay.  Not busy, a wonderful
place to canoe.

I have many more ideas, but no need to flood the list with any more.
