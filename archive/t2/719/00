Steveo,

Trim strip ***always*** goes in first and the windshield is then put on 
the car.  They *are* flimsy, but if the factory could do it, then you can 
too!

Check the pics here...http://www.shockwaverider.com/newbus/

I did all of these *except* for the front windshield on the final 
assembly.  I had already done it once, and the painter broke the 
windshield and destroyed the trim...even tho he assured me he knew how to 
do it.  :-((  He bought me a new windshield .  I did all of the rest of 
the windows including the one from hell...just behind drivers side door.

You only want to do this once!  Buy the best and go from there.

Cheers, dave
