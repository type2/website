I think you have an ignition switch problem,, it is giving power during "run"
but not "start"  to the coil..

Take a jumper cable,, from Bat + to the Coil + terminal..effectively hot wiring
the engine ...  then hit the key to start.... if it starts and runs,  you have
proved you have an ignition switch circuit problem.

Hope that helps
