Subject: Re: [T2] windshield trim strip on deluxe

I found the only way I could do it was first install the rubber seal on the 
glass, then
press the trim into the seal being careful to center the strip when you start 
so the
connecting piece is centered.. What makes the job a real pain is that strip 
is very hard to
press into the strip.  You have to press very hard with your thumbs and only 
about 1/4
inch at a time seats in with each hard press of the thumbs.  By the time you 
get it in
completely around the window you thumbs will ache.  I took it to a windshield 
shop
to have them do it;  the guy there fussed with it about 5 minutes and the 
declared
it was the wrong seal and refused to try anymore.  He just didn't want to 
bother with
it.  I took it home and did it myself.  I think it was the hardest thing I've 
ever done with
my bus. Maybe there is a tool that would help but I found my thumbs to work 
best. Heat
 the seal with a hair dryer to make it more flexible when you do it.  Be 
patient and don't
give up.  It can be done.............
