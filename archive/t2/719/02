I'm converting to the non-metal insert version of the
window seals.  They are all flat black.  Have a rear
window, and one rear side to go, and all of my window
seals will be plain black without need of the metal
trim strip.  I also like the look better.  But be
careful, some of the window seals are from Brazil;
quality will suffer.
