Okay, guys, Jamie has come up with it (I hope)!  I
must have a late-model S-87 starter with a longer
shaft to fit the 228mm flywheels on the late bay
Westy's.  But my engine is  a CB number - 1974.  Would
that work?  I don't understand at all.  All I know is,
my bus is a '76 model with a '74 engine.  And it runs
great but starts most of the time.  Why would I have
that 228 mm flywheel?  Thanks...KR
