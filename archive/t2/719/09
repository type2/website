You were probably operating on 3 cylinders and didn't know it. 1 came to life. 

You aren't complaining about more power are you??? <grin!> 

I'd guess the smoking will go away in a few miles. Take the long way home at 55 mph and once it gets hot everything with "cook" out. 

For giggles you might do a leak down test to check the mechanical condition of your engine. Eliminate valves, pistons and rings from any troubles - not that I think you have mechanical troubles.
