Thanks, Greg - a new engine would save lots of hassle and probably a few
knuckles, but as far as money goes, the lowest-priced rebuilt engine I
have found is around US$1200.  I figure about US$800 for rebuilt heads,
new pistons/cylinders, and a gasket kit, so significant savings.

Of course, there are benefits of an *entirely* rebuilt engine that might
make it worthwhile...  I might just end up taking your advice, along
with Chris M's, Rick's, and Arnaud's (pm), who all recommended replacing
the entire engine.  When I think about possible additional problems
inside the case, I get worried, you know?

Arnaud recommended finding a "local guru" from whom to buy parts, so
does anybody in the Seattle area have any good guys to recommend?  A
coworker of mine recently bought an engine from Bow Wow in Lynnwood, so
I might have to check that out.

Thanks all!
Jeremy

Hi Jeremy,

Sounds to me like a BusDepot AVP longblock would save a lot of $$$ and
hassle.

Happy trails,
