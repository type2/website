Hmm... didn't work.

I took the bus out for a trip to the doctor's, and just couldn't get it into
3rd or 4th.  It finally popped into 3rd after a quick grind into gear, but I
couldn't get it back into 3rd for the trip home.

I'd noticed that sometimes in the recent past it would occasionally grind a
split second as it went into 3rd, but only sometimes so I thought it was
probably my own shifting and not the bus.

I've been under the bus and found the front bushing is gone or wallowed out,
depending on your preference.  It never really bothered me to have a
slightly sloppy shifter, so I did not repair it the last time I was under
the bus.

I didn't know what to look for at the front of the transmission.  The T-bar
end of the shift lever hooks into that doohickey on the front of the trans.
I'll be looking at the Bentley and Muir books to see what I can see.

Any ideas why it won't go into 3rd and 4th?  Interestingly enough, when you
"shift" into the 3rd or 4th positions on the stick, it goes into 1st or 2nd
respectively (1st=3rd, 2nd=4th).

Up to this incident, I would have said the gears seem bang up, no problems.
Once it got into 3rd on the way down to the doc's, it ran fine.  Lots of
power.

Here's hoping it's an inexpensive fix...
