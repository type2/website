Our remanufactured heads, built by AVP, use specially redesigned valve seats
that are much more resistant to failure than the original design. This makes
them more reliable than other rebuilt heads, and also more reliable than new
heads (which are still made using the original flawed design). Therefore I'd
actually recommend them over our (or anyone else's) new heads, despite their
lower price.
