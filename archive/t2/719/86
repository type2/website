Subject: Studs question

On my 1600 heads there are 2 studs for exhaust port on the front and
two on the back. When I removed the exhaust nuts some studs came out
and some stayed in the head. (Same is true of the intake studs)

Before I reinstall the exhaust I thought I'd put the studs back in the
heads first. How is this done  ? Are the studs torqued into the head
or just screwed in far enough but not torqued ? I did not find the
torque value in Bentley.

Should I use new studs ?
