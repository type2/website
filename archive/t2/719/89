tight is tight thats it... those studs are fragile and will break... a question i had answered for my self with experience....
if you can replace them with new ones go for it but if not tight is tight....

So it does not matter if the stud goes deep into its thread in the

My concern is "steel stud vs. aluminium head" => stud wins and head is
