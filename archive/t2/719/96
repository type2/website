Hi,

I just went through something similar. In my case the problem was spark
(lack thereof). After much hair pulling I decided to pull the plugs and
check them by "turn[ing] over the engine with the plug base earthed" as
Stephan suggested you do.

I found that my plugs were producing a very weak spark. I dug up the plugs
I'd recently removed after a tuneup and tested them out - much better spark.

My bus finally runs. Sometimes it is the simple things and being easy to
check, I'd start there.

Some other suggestions : bad gas? Has the gas been sitting for a while?
After verifying a good spark try pouring a bit of fresh new gas down the
carb and seeing what happens. If it starts then you're looking at a fuel
delivery issue - is there fuel in the float bowl of the carb?

peace
