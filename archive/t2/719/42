Subject: automatic throttle linkage.

I'm still looking for the linkage between the throttle valve lever and
the operating lever for a late (76+), automatic bay. The female threaded
rod section of the linkage is still in place, but I need everything
behind it. The linkage I need is illustrated in Bentley, Section 10, pg 
30. I'm looking for the threaded stock, two nuts, a pivot pin, and a 
spring.

I've been in touch with some of the locals (Utah) and Mark Dearing.

I'll gladly pay for the part and shipping and a sample of local
microbrew if beer is one of your things, or a very decent ceramic piece
of my making if beer is not one of your things.
