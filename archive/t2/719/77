In these situations a wise old man (best friend's Dad, actually) always 
advised the three Ps -Petrol, Points and Plugs. Sounds like you've got 
Petrol and Points covered (unless the compufire is faulty?????). That 
leaves the Plugs - have you got a spark at the plugs when you unscrew 
one and turn over the engine with the plug base earthed? I'm also (back 
to petrol) a bit worried about having the gas pedal on the floor. My 
original instruction book for my 73 (with the same engine set up as you) 
is very specific about starting. The gas pedal should only be fully down 
when starting "A very warm engine".
