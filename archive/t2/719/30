hello Rob  Virginia has the best state parks in the USA   A little 
underfunded at present but everyone I have stayed in were great.  If you are going down 
the eastern shore you should take some time and visit Tangier island  Way cool 
place . There also is a state park in Va. beach  ,First landing state park 
just on the other side of the bay bridge . My fav State park is Bear Treee in 
the mount rogers area also the Breaks interstate park  at the kentucky border
