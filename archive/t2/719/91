I understand that logic fully now that I've been
there.  I didn't know about that place in Red Bank but
we do have another here with a pretty good reputation.
 I didn't use them because they said it would take a
couple of days to get parts and I wanted it done.  

I took the wrong one back (2nd wrong one!) and the
owner at first said they didn't take returns of
electrical parts that had been installed.  But when he
found out that his guys didn't ask me what
transmission I had, he agreed to refund my money.  I
ended up having him get me a Beck-Arnley reman S-87
tomorrow.  $116.  Three year warranty.  I've have
never had problems with B-A stuff, so I'm happy to pay
a little more and not have to wait.  

I'm just worried about getting that little bushing
replaced going into the flywheel.  Jim Lockhart told
me the easy way is to use a 12mm tap and pull it out. 
And then take a smaller bolt than the hole of the new
bushing and tap the new one in.  He definitely
recommended replacing it.  After doing the others one
twice, I'll have it on it ten minutes after I get the
bushing in. That's going to be a job, I'd bet.

Thanks to all of you for the help.  Dig....KR
