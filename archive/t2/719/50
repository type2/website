OK, I'm fed up.  I decided that before a big rain
storm moves in I had to replace that starter.  Like to
have a nice Bosch from one of our suppliers but had to
go to the nearest parts store - Autozone.  $39.99,
lifetime warranty (yeah, right).  Put it on, it acted
like the solenoid wasn't engaging.  Took it off, took
it back, they tested it and it worked.  Compared it to
the old one and the shaft wasn't as long. I noticed
when I put it on that the bolt on top didn't have any
threads - it had a flat side that butted up against a
flat indentation in the starter to hold it.  The reman
didn't have that.  It was for one with threads on the
bolt. 

Went to a foreign car place downtown.  Bought a re-man
Beck-Arnley.  I've used and sold Beck in the past and
have had good luck.  3-year warranty.  Compared them
closely.  (mine is too caked in dirt to see the part
number).  Looked like the shaft was the same length
and it had that indentation.  (Actually a little lip) 
Thought, "aha I'm in business."  Put it on, it does
the same thing.  Spins, but no connection with the
motor.  

I thought the same starter went on all of these late
70's busses with a manual tranny.  They only show two
- for manual or automatic.  What's up with mine??  

Really disgusted and tired of re-doing the same
job....KR

PS...If I was an auto mechanic I'd probably be
suicidal or worse postal!!
