Subject: Rear brake sticking!

Sunday I started up my 77 Riveria and when I tried to move it the rear
passenger side wheel wouldn't roll.

Rocking the beast back and forth from drive to reverse popped the pads off,
and I do mean that I could hear a pop.

I drove it slowly three miles to get it home, and you could smell the warm
brakes on that wheel.  Braking seems fine otherwise, the parking brake cable
doesn't seem to release all the way.

Could this just be a stuck parking brake cable, and should just lubing it
fix it?
