I got a long block from AVP in Sacramento in 2002, and
it's going strong. I did all the work myself, and they
were helpful when I had questions (sometimes hard to
get a hold of). The price was really reasonable, as
was shipping to San Diego. They use some rebuilt parts
to save money, but it all seems to work and hold up so
far. My biggest challenge was finding some of the
little rubber parts that are NLA.  I sent them my
block, since I knew it was in good shape.

Boston Bob and a guy named Raby (on the East coast I
think) do higher end rebuilds if you want
better-than-OEM assembly and all new everything.
