Subject: ignition

I'm starting to think my starter problem was ignition.
 As I said in my last post, my starter started acting
up and when I went to change it the fuel pump quit
working.  I replaced it and it and the starter work
fine.  I've started it 20 times today and it has yet
to fail. In fact, it starts strongly.  And my old fuel
pump is good.

I'm going to change the ignition switch.  Wouldn't
that affect voltage to the starter and fuel pump??  It
sure seems like it.  I know I have a good ground -
battery to the block, big cable.  Any other ideas??  Thanks...KR
