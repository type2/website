Subject: Re: [T2] Studs question

You can just put the nut and stud back in together, or replace both
with new peices.
Either way works if sufficent torque can be achieved.
THe effort to cut the nuts off then reuse the stud is not generally
required, at least in the t1 engine.
Now if you cannot gain proper fastening, replace both items.
