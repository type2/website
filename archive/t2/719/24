Subject: Removing vent grilles

There's something rattling around down in the driver's side ventilation 
passage on my 71 bus when I'm at highway cruising speed and the fresh 
air vent is open. Sounds like a playing card or bat or matchbook cover 
or something. I can't see anything but if I could pop off the round 
grille thing I might be able to fish around down there and find that 
pesky thing. How do you get those grilles off?
