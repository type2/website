Subject: Re: trailer and lights

Hi Karl,

When I built the westrailer I used a bus tail-light housing but wired 
it to a standard 4-wire trailer harness. (Red lights only) That harness 
was connected to the bus' wiring with a $20 U-haul 5-to-4 wire 
conversion harness. Unfortunately the quality of those harnesses is 
pretty questionable... they were failing annually on me. So last spring 
I added turn signal lights to the westrailer and an additional 2 wires 
to the harness, and that works fine. The bonus to that system is that 
when someone with a standard harness uses the trailer the "normal" 
lighting circuits still work as usual.
