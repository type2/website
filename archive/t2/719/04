I got a few suggestions off-list as well as on-list. In summary:
>1) fuel pump pushrod.  They are notorious for wearing out and becoming
too short to activate the fuel pump after warm-up.  

Anything else I should replace while the pump is in hand (other than
the pump:engine gasket)?  I've read in the archive/library that rebuild
kits are hard to come by now. Is this still true? If it comes to that,
perhaps an electric pump is the better path. Opinions?

>2) replace the spark plug wires.
Dats' easy.

>3) check your dwell.
I forgot to mention the SVDA has electronic ignition (Petronix, IIRC),
so I can't really do that.

>4) if the power loss is gradual, look to fuel. If the loss is sudden
look to ignition.
I think this makes a lot of sense. Accordingly, I'll be starting where
I've been looking: ignition. I thought the problem was advanced timing
leading to high temps leading to vapor lock in the fuel pump. Maybe I
have a bad plug wire arcing. Dangerous stuff in a carburated motor. I
should have replaced those wires a while ago. This, of course, doesn't
rule out a bad fuel pump :| nor does it explain the seemingly empty
fuel filter....

Thanks for your responses. I really appreciate it. Btw, it started
bucking like a bronco on the way in to work this morning, so I'm stuck
at home or on public transit until I figure out and fix this. I'll post
when something interesting happens. I plan to buy some new plug wires
and run throguh the tuneup procedure with valve adjustment. At least
then I'll have the engine in a known state for additional diagnosis.
