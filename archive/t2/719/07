Subject: White Smoke - Been to the Archives (longish)

Honorable list,

69, with what I believe to be a 71 1600 sp, Brazilian carb, 009 dizzy.
In the year that I've had it, the bus has always leaked oil, dripping
from what seems to be lots of locations.  This Spring was the
appointed time to address the issue.  The bus was always a slow
poke - no acceleration even for a 1600.

Today:

Driving along, suddenly feel a burst of power.  Strange.  Look in
the rearview and billows of white smoke pouring out of the
exhaust.  A mean a CLOUD.  But man do I have power in first gear.
Stopped, looked underneath, no big oil puddle, checked oil level,
same as yesterday after I put in half a quart.

Drove home with cursing cars behind me.  Let it sit.  Checked the
drips under the bus.  The drips smelled vaguely of gas.

Got online, checked the archives - "White Smoke."  Lots of
returns, but none could explain the surge of power.

Any ideas?
