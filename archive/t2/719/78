Did you try pour a drip of gas in the carburator then start just to check if
it can, at the least, burn this small sip.

If it does, problem is in the fuel supply: clogged carburator, stocked carb
fuel inlet valve (the one associated with the float), water in carburator
plugging fuel passages.  Are you able to check if some fuel spurt in the
carburator when you "pump" your gas pedal.  If yes, fuel is getting in the
carb, inlet valve is then not stocked.

If it does not, problem is with timing, valve adjustment, fire, plugs, too
low compression, craked distributor cap.  Make sure fire goes all the way
down the wires to each plug (install a dummy plug from wire to wire making
sure it's grounded).

You don't mention if you had or see this motor run before.

Give it a try !

Bus doesn't start. It turns over and I verfied that the fuel pump is getting
gas to the carb. I changed the Coil out just to be sure.Still have the
issue.

Symptoms: Turns over great, no problem there and I can sit for 10 minutes or
30 minutes trying the key at times just truns over and then right when I am
about ready to give up for fear of draining the battery I release the key
(gas
pedal is all the way to the floor)  Release the key and it putters and will
usally start.
