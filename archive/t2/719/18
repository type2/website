The problem is definitely in the shift linkage.
To start, replace the defrctive bushing, it's shot. Sheesh.
The "doohicky" at the front of the "T-bar" trans shift rod
is a replaceable bushing and cage. The cage can be cracked,
and the bushings can be worn out. The set screws are likely
to be rusted shut and not this problem, but more likely the
next one, as they will have to come out to replace the coupling.
There is also a basic adjustment of the shift rod (plate
under the shift rod cover) which will need to be done
when the bushing gets replaced. If it were not for the worn-out
bushing, this alone might have made the correction, but not now.

Remember, reassembly is the reversal of removal:)
