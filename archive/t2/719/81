Subject: jerky bus driver : short story

so this morning im driving through rush hour to work n miami - I95 - past
downtown - us 1 ....
I see a nice 69 or 70 red/white bus pass me on the left. i give the smile
and hearty wave and an older guy with long grey hair waves the return.

i remember i still have some "save the bays" stickers so i dig through the
glove and find one and a few lights down im just 4 or 5 cars back of him
at the red light.
I jump out and jog up to him, tap on the window which was closed and wave
the save the bays sticker with a hi-ho grin on my face. i see the
surprise and then nastiest pissed off face, the light changes, he never
rolls down the window or even tries to see why someone would be bothering
him, so f-it. jog back to my bus and forget it.

the guys first response after the surprise was to be pissed off and I dont
know wtf he was saying because his windows was up but the look on his
face was enough.

what-ever. ill remember to give him the dukes welcome and pass him by if
I ever see him broken down.

guy, if youre on the list, sell your bus you dont suit its personality.
