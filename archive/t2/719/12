Subject: Re: [T2] White Smoke - Been to the Archives (longish)

What would a gas scent in the oil indicate?

I went outside,started her up, still smoky.  Drove around the
block a couple of times (like Mosquito Control here in NJ!)
still puffin'.  Smelled the dipstick.  Gas, I think.  Not pungent,
but I'm no oil connoisseur.  I need another set of nostrils
to remove paranoia.

A couple of folks thought that maybe a cylinder may have
come to life.  Or a clogged carb burst forth. Make sense?
I'll have to dig around to figure it out.

Question:  is there peril in letting it idle and smoke in my
driveway to see if it will "cook" itself out?  Do I risk
overheating?

And Chris, no way am I complaining about added power - just
really perplexed!


  James,

  Sounds to me like you have a cylinder or something that suddenly started
  working...or an accelerator pump nozzle that finally got unclogged.

  The brass one just inside the throat of the carb that look like a U.

  Or a spark plug(or wire) that suddenly started working again.

  Gas in the oil would be very bad, but if the level is the same and the oil
  on the dipstick doesn't smell like oil, you are probably ok there.

  Could be a ton of stuff....

  Generally, white smoke when starting up an engine that has sat a long time
  too, or that has some water vapor somewhere.

  Not much help, I know, but maybe some....

  Cheers, dave
