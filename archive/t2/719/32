Happy KVS day!

If you remember last year, someone thought it was a good idea to proclaim so
I thought, why not make it a yearly tradition!

I've lost count of the times that Karl has provided some useful tidbit no
one else knows or perhaps you've received a rare part in the mail from him.
Karl is a true blessing to this list and he's very much appreciated by all.

Wondering how exactly to celebrate, Jason "Faster-Laster" and I came up with
the idea that Karl really deserves his own place on the main Type2 page.

I'd like to suggest "Karnotek" to join "Bartnotek" and "Ness-tek" because
his contributions are truly in same league.

But low and behold, as much as Karl has conttributed to the list he's only
got 3 articles in the library! *gasp* So I started to go through his
postings a few nights ago to collect his wisdom in one place for all to see.
Here's what Ive got so far:

Once the Type2.com admins get around to reading my emails I'd like to move
those pages to the Type2.com server and add some more of his posts (I'm only
about half way done).

All of course, if Karl himself doesn't mind. *blush*

Happy KVS day!
