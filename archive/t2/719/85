Subject: Re: [T2] CA Smog Evasion

Apart from the VIN that can be read through the windshield and the
odometer mileage, the DMV checked nothing when I brought my 71 in CA
last November. Now that I think about it is a bit scary because the
car was pretty unsafe at that stage.

The DMV officer was standing in the front of the bus kind of waiting.
I asked the officier what the officier was expecting me to do (to not
use he or she..) . The officier stared at the front panel and asked me
to open the hood in order to check the engine serial number.

Later we went to the back and because it was hard to read the engine
serial#, the officier just wrote N/A on the application.
