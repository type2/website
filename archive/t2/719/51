Subject: I need new heads! (advice?)

Alright, I took my "new" 1976 Westy into the shop yesterday and
confirmed that I have a dead #3 cylinder.  Mr. Mechanic says that I need
new heads and probably new pistons and cylinders.  Quoted cost is over
$2200, which is almost $800 for heads and around $250 for Ps & Cs.  And
of course about $1200 for labor.  I'm no stranger to engine work, so I'm
thinking about doing it myself.  I know there are plenty on this Type 2
list who have done the same, so I'm looking for advice on choosing parts
from what I have found online.  Please advise if you have experience
with any of the following, or any others I missed, as I know I had to
have missed some suppliers.  This is a 2000CC type IV engine, by the
way...
