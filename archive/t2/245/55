Jon; 

as far as I understand, it does mean that the diaphragm in your vac can is
shot. Same thing happened to the vac can on my 1971 Westy.

However, you don't need to replace the distributor - it'll be hard to find
a new one the same - check around for the matching vac can. Go to the
oldvolkshome (or something like that) website and check out what the
proper dizzy part numbers are for your bus (see the type2.com archives for
the proper URL here), and check for the right vac can on ebay or as an NOS
unit in some shops. You might get lucky, and just have to stick on a new
vac can and you're away. 

Check also that you actually have the proper distributor for your van.
Timing specs will be completely different for different distributors, and
many different distributors could run your engine. Cross reference with
the oldvolkshome parts page to make sure. If you've got the right dizzy,
then try to find the right vac can! 

Cheers
