Bob, you are quoting what Terry wrote as though I said it!!!  I did NOT
say/write that. You cut off my reply to Terry.
Here is what I wrote AFTER Terry's section:
"On any fuel injected vehicle, the main electric fuel pump is ALWAYS below the
tank and is gravity feed. The pump is a pusher, not a puller.

Slide under any VW bus or Mercedes and look where the pump is mounted."
