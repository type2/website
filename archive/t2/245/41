Subject: Re: [T2] Driving a Hi-top Bus

>The questions I have would be what would I give up?

Getting through drive-thru windows, parking in parking decks and 
garages. My A-wagen is 7' 11" tall.

>1) I get 22 mpg with my 1600, would the mileage go down?

A little but not much.

>2) Would it get blown around more in windy conditions?

It is a bit of a challenge to drive in the wind but what bus is not? 
Suggestions to even the score- Get stiff load range D tires, upgrade 
to larger front anti sway bar, add rear anti sway bars. If you do not 
already have them get some stiff KYB shocks. Make sure everything in 
the steering section is tight, steering box, drag-link,swing-lever 
bushings, tire rods and ball joints.

>3) Which hi-top is nicest.  I liked the look of the sundial.   Can 
>you sleep up top with any of the hi-tops?

Adventurewagen, Safare, and Contempo Campers all made hi-tops with 
sleeping accommodations upstairs. A-wagen also made a hitop that did 
not allow sleeping upstairs but had great interior and exterior 
storage.

>4) Would it be hard to attached a hi-top?  Removing the old top is 
>easy since I have done that once already when I replaced the canvas.

Fixed hitops are usually attached via screws thru the fiberglass into 
the sheet metal of the roof. They do not weigh much and two people 
can remove one and reinstall without much trouble. When you put it on 
use stainless steel screws and 3M 5200 marine adhesive to bed it down 
to the roof it will not leak or come off. In fact the 5200 is a 
stronger fastener than the screws once it sets up completely.
