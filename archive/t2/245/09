Subject: Was hard to shift

Since I changed my transmission fluid I've had a hard time shifting into
2nd. The shifting before was really sloppy but at least it was easy in all
gears.

I thought I'd inspect the shift rod to see if anything was wrong and I
discovered a missing bushing under the skirt at the front:

Every gear is fine now.  Amazing what a different a small piece like this
makes.  I have no idea how long ago the old one rotted away and fell off.

Question: is the end of this tube supposed to be open?
