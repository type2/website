Subject: Oil filler tube

I was doing an underbody inspection today and noticed a few things:

- missing a tiny piece of the heater box tin below the alternator. That's
where the air is leaking out.

- drop of oil hanging from bottom of oil filter. I assume this is because
it's hand tight.

- outside of the oil filler tube is oily. Question: Is this because some can
leak out between the plastic opening and the metal tube? It's only clamped
with that ring. I haven't spilled any recently and I thought I cleaned it
before I put the engine back in.
