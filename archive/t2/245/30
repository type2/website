Subject: Looking for rotted westy tent

I'm looking for a rotted westy tent because I need to find the rubber straps
and plastic hooks, the rest of the canvas is not needed.

Does anyone have or know of a tent that is not worth salvaging the canvas?
I don't need the frame either, just the hooks and bands.

Thanks for your help.
