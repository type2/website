i have recently installed a rotary/electric fuel pump .. 3 1/2 lbs of fuel 
pressure .. do these pumps suck gas from the fuel tank or do they use gravity 
to get the gas and then pump it out to the carbs?  reason i ask is i mounted 
the fuel pump in the top of my engine compartment.. should this be 
acceptable? thanks for the help.. scott
