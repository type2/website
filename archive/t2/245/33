Further,
When you pierce the lid and can now "suck" the water from the jar.
The longest "suck" that can be performed is an accepted design value of 34 ft.

Voiding the straw of atmospheric pressure, allowing the outside atmospheric 
pressure to replace same, will calculate to:
14.7 PSI atmospheric pressure is value at sea level
2.31 linear column water = 1 PSI at the bottom of the column of water
2.31 * 14.7 = 34 ft

Up in the mountains you will not be able to raise the water 34 ft.
The value will be something less due to lessened atmospheric pressure.

No matter how hard you "suck"
No matter how hard your best old time girl friend can suck (sorry)
All that can be done is a drop in pressure so as to allow 14.7 PSI to 
replace what you have done.
14.7 PSI will raise a column of water no more than 34 ft.

Pumps do not suck.................. Pumps impart energy.
It is up to outside pressure to force the liquid into the pump so that the 
pump can impart that energy as a function of the pump's design and 
operating parameters.
