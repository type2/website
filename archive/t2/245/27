If there isn't a transfer pump involved to get the fuel to the secondary
pump, as in the case of the Vanagon, or a Bus the pump does both--it
pulls as well as pushes.

Where did you come up with this stuff?

On any fuel injected vehicle, the main electric fuel pump is ALWAYS below the
tank and is gravity feed. The pump is a pusher, not a puller.

Slide under any VW bus or Mercedes and look where the pump is mounted.
