Subject: probs adjusting valves


Hey folks,
Well, my engine is finally in need of valve adjustment after first break in. 
It is a 71 dual port 1600. I went to the Bentley manual as well as the list 
library. I adjusted #1 with the rotor just above the notch in the dist. 
body. No issues. In moving the crankshaft pully 180 degrees 
counter-clockwise, and rotor just before #2, I find the rearmost valve 
looking like it is compressing the spring. The one toward the front of the 
bus, which I am assuming is exhaust, is much less compressed.  The feeler 
guage will not go in between either. Seems like the pully has to be in some 
odd position to keep the springs decompressed.  Am I missing something? 
doing this wrong? smoking too many banana peels? Any advice would be greatly 
appreciated.  Thanks
