Subject: Re: [T2] 78 engine/tranny swap into a 72

As they say, anything is possible. I have a '71 bus with a 2L type 4 motor
and the 2L Trans. in it. I only bought it for the motor and trans, so never
paid much attention to the mods made to fit it in. It seems to be not to
difficult a swap, with the main mods being to fit an engine seal back in
(i.e. convert a type 1 engine bay to seal around a type 4 motor).
