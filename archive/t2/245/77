I am more concerned today : (      At idle once the engine reaches operating 
temperature, the pressure at idle drops to 10psi or lower and the idiot light 
is coming on.  Before the engine warms up, the pressure seems ok.   I didn't 
measure the oil pressure relief valve or pressure regulating springs at 
rebuild that I remember but the bores on both of them seemed ok (and I hope I 
didn't mix up the springs.)  Barring a faulty oil pump, what else should I be 
loooking at?  Hopefully there is a way to shim up the oil pressure regulating 
spring or something.  I really don't want to pull the engine back out!
