Hi John,
First off, the fuel is not sucked into he carb.
The fuel pump does the work of getting fuel to the carb.

Air bubbles in the fuel filter would seem to indicate that there is a 
restriction in the fuel INLET side of things --- perhaps not the line, but 
maybe in the small sock filter at the bottom of your tank that does the 
initial filtering as the fuel leaves the bottom of the tank (where the bad 
stuff accumulates)

Although the air bubbles are not a problem in themselves, they do indicate 
a cavitation problem to the fuel pump, and typically should not exist -- 
although I bet there are lot of buses running around out there that have 
the air bubbles visible more times than not.

Try an alternate fuel source as the feed to the pump, if you can.
Maybe that will reveal something to you.

Keep a fire extinguisher handy, as always.

Aren't you from Cincy ??
I think I remember that as being the case.
