Subject: Re: [T2] electric fuel pump.

So what you are implicating here Bob is that the holley fuel pump that
was on the firewall of my 64 421 Bonneville was using barometric
pressure so suck the fuel 15 ft. from the gas tank to the tri power?

I don't think so.

The pump performed two functions--pulls the fuel to the pump, and then
shoves it to the carbs.

The transfer pump in the tank of my 325 BMW does just as it says--it
draws the fuel from the tank to the pressure pump to the injector's---

If there isn't a transfer pump involved to get the fuel to the secondary
pump, as in the case of the Vanagon, or a Bus the pump does both--it
pulls as well as pushes.

Where did you come up with this stuff?

Later,

Terry

Haven't you ever used an electric pump to draw (suck) fuel out of a gas
tank inlet into a gas can without a prime? The common fuel pumps I have
used for this will lift fuel a certain height.

Yes, that is "sort of" right, but the pump STILL does not suck. 
The pump uses 14.7 psi atmospheric pressure " 1 BAR" as an initial inlet
pressure number 
(minus)
altitude correction
(minus)
pumpage vapor pressure
(minus)
elevation lift
(minus)
inlet side fuel line friction losses
(minus) 
inlet side fuel filter losses .................. so as to yield a number
equated in linear dimension value or psi equivalent that is calculated
and called NPSH. 
This NPSH Net Positive Suction Head is a positive number. If there is
not sufficient NPSH as a function of the pump or pump impeller design,
there will be no pumping. 
In many cases, the pump will prime and it will still pump with inlet
pressure less than 1 BAR, 
but this may not always be presumed. 
The attached URL will show you some pretty nice "fuel" pumps, BTW. :-)
