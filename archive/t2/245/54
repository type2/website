Subject: re: Re: [T2] Frozen Brakes!??

Volks,

Thanks for all the pointers.  This evening I removed both rear
wheels and learned that
it was the driver's-side wheel which was seized.

Rather than start whacking away with a hammer, I decided I would
first take the
drum off and take a good look at what might be causing it.  I
removed the two 11mm
screws and pulled and pulled and banged a little and pulled some
more, and that sucker
wasn't coming off.

I then crawled beneath to try and back the shoes off a bit, but
alas!  Those adjusting stars
were going **nowhere**.  I didn't want to use undue force, as the
metal backing plate was
starting to "tear" with each new attempt.  So I banged the crap
out of the drum, all around
in a circle, with a keen rubber mallet.  Still no joy on removing
the drum - but suddenly I
could turn the wheel.  I'm not sure why I couldn't get the drum
off... I replaced the brakes
some 2kmiles ago.  Shouldn't be rusted already, which leads me to
think the shoes are
lipping against the drum??  All things returned, I took her for a
test drive.

Damn.  Idiot break light is on - but strangely, only when **not**
applying the breaks.  If
I apply the breaks, off goes the light.  I didn't get a warm
fuzzy from this, so here's my
pleading for help... I'll retire for the night and hope some
stranger in faraway lands
unlocks the mystery while I sleep... and I can wake tomorrow with
new direction and
confidence.
