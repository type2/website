They do have what I consider to be an excessive rate of bad stuff out of 
the box. There are a hell of a lot of low paid immigrants on the assembly 
lines these days, and it shows. Likely, they will be happy to keep giving 
you another under their "lifetime" warranty, so all you are out is the time 
to keep replacing it until you get one that works. At $74 per hour, I can't 
afford to waste my time with high volume, designed to be cheap, rebuilds. I 
use only genuine new ATE master cylinders for that reason. No comebacks at 
all is in the end much cheaper if you value your time, more especially if 
you hope for others to value your reputation.
