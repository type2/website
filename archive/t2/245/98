An engine without flaps will never warm up and will ruin itself before it's 
due time - dies an early death. However I can assure you that it will be 
after their warranty runs out. Put those flaps in - I HAVE NEVER had flaps 
stick shut. All major name aircooled engines are equipped with thermostats 
designed to fail with the flaps OPEN.

Install a cylinder head temp gauge and/or an overtemp light. You'll know 
when the flaps fail (NEVER).

You'll also want that engine to warm up enough to warm up your toes!!!
