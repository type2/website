Subject: uncontrollable idle!

Engine: Fresh rebuild with 23 miles clocked. 1977 2.0L FI GD motor with
hydraulic lifters, very mild cam.

Symptom: idle is too high. Cold engine idles perfect at ~1000. When warming,
engine idle advances to near ~1800.

Tests thus far: Timing was set at 950 rpm at 7.5 BTDC. Valves adjusted 2 turns
in (-at-) TDC. Dwell is 50. Everything is NEW and its drives like a dream.

There are no air leaks as ALL hoses were inspected and clamped before install. I
suspect the Decel Valve per bentley. But the one thing that isnt mentioned is
how much a BAD decel valve will increase this idle.

 Does 800+ rpm at idle increase over norm seem like a decel valve problem?
