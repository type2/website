Subject: transplant success!  (am I going backwards?)

Hey list, today I successfully completed the replacement of my dual
weber 34 ICT's with 32-34 Solex PDSIT's  (74 single cab sans smog
pump).  I can't believe how much better it runs already  even though I
haven't driven out of the garage (haven't replaced the accelerator cable
yet).  It starts just by reaching your hand through the window, idles
beautifully, timing advances perfectly, doesn't miss a beat!  I must be
going backwards because I remember in my younger days replacing my dual
PDSIT's with a weber progressive (bad mistake back then) and hearing now
of so many people putting on dual kadrons, webers, etc., to replace the
solexes.  Just thought I share a success story (because we all seek
advice for our bus challenges here) and say thanks to the many folks who
helped coach me through this (Chris Mills, Karl...et al).  First road
test tomorrow night!  Greg T.
