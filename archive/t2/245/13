With a properly maintained system, 2 pints will get clear fluid through all 
wheels (and the clutch if you have a Vanagon). Twice that at least if the 
fluid is filthy black. If it is filthy, know that flushing with new fluid 
will act as a solvent and start dissolving the crud in the system. This can 
lead in short order to leaks what weren't there before.
