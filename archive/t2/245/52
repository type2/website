Subject: 81 vanogon in North Carolina -- for sale

Hi all,

Please reply to jkling(-at-)nasw.org rather than to the list.

I have a 1981 Vanogon that is currently in Mt. Arey, North Carolina,
about 30 miles or so north of Winston Salem. The problem is, I'm in
Washington DC. I got stranded last weekend when it died on me, and the
auto shop there was not able to fix it. They have graciously agreed to
continue to work on it, but it doesn't look good. There seems to be some
problem with the fuel inlet system (don't ask me for details, I'm not a
mechanic), and it may be a wiring problem.

At any rate, my problem is: I can't fix it and it is no longer where I
live. Therefore, it's time for me to sell it. I'd like to find a VW
afficionado in southern Virginia or North Carolina or somewhere else
nearby who could take it off my hands (it will have to be towed). I'd
like to get a little bit for it, but that's secondary, really. I'd
accept whatever someone is willing to offer.

The van: a blue, two color '81 aircooled. Approximately 150k (the
odometer broke). The interior is in very good condition (with power
seats), the exterior is in good condition with a couple of minor dings.
The other major issue it has is that the entire exhaust will likely need
to be replaced if it is to pass inspection somewhere.

Again, please email me at jkling(-at-)nasw.org if you are interested, or know
someone who might be.
