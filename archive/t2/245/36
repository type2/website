Good info--
Makes sense-
And as ole Paul Harvey say's--"And now I know the "Rest" of the
story"---:>)

Congratulations. 
It really is a difficult concept to immediately grasp, but once
understood becomes one of those items that makes total sense. Before
grasping, it sounds ridiculous.

But let me figure ths one out--- 
Attach an inline pump to a power source and lay your pinky on the inlet
side--- 
Why is there suction?
And I'm talking about an unprimed pump.

Depending on the pump design, and construction tolerances, there will
still be sealing at the inlet of the rotating component and it's housing
(volute).. 
The rotating member of the pump lessens the pressure on the inlet side,
and that is what you feel when you- plug with your finger. 
The finger has a lessened pressure where you place it on the pump inlet,
and the pressure felt is the difference between atmospheric and
something less than atmospheric as created by the pump component. 
This is the design concept of as "vacuum" pump, rotary compressor, and a
fan, be it propeller, turbine, 
turbine vane design, or mixed flow blade design blade.
