=========================>
Yes, that is "sort of" right, but the pump STILL does not suck.

The pump uses 14.7 psi atmospheric pressure " 1 BAR" as an initial inlet 
pressure number
(minus)
altitude correction
(minus)
pumpage vapor pressure
(minus)
elevation lift
(minus)
inlet side fuel line friction losses
(minus)
inlet side fuel filter losses .................. so as to yield a number 
equated in linear dimension value or psi equivalent that is calculated and 
called NPSH.

This NPSH Net Positive Suction Head is a positive number.
If there is not sufficient NPSH as a function of the pump or pump impeller 
design, there will be no pumping.

In many cases, the pump will prime and it will still pump with inlet 
pressure less than 1 BAR,
but this may not always be presumed.

The attached URL will show you some pretty nice "fuel" pumps, BTW. :-)
