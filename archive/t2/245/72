Verify spark energy at the gap. Should be blue/white with an audible SNAP. 
If yellow and goes "fffuutt", spark energy is low and you have something 
foul somewhere up line.

This is a symptom of a problem with the ignition module and/or coil and/or 
aftermarket parts. First verify the coil HT lead, that there is not a 
corrosion problem. If there is corrosion in the center terminal of the 
coil, it should be replaced as it cannot be cleaned to the point that it 
won't come back to haunt you in short order. If you replace the module, 
spend the extra bucks for a Bosch unit which is a more robust design with 
protection against surges. Also, verify the Hall sensor terminal housing. 
They will break when the plastic gets hard and the wiring can short to 
ground, which will kill the stock modules.

The burned cap/rotor is a sure sign of excess resistance somewhere. Be sure 
to use a Bosch cap/rotor/module as I have seen this problem far more often 
on generic cheap parts and with the stock Fairchild or Telefunken modules.
