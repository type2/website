Howdy all-

In the course of pulling my motor yesterday, I had opportunity to look
closely at my rear brake lines, something I hadn't done in a couple of
years. 

YIKES!!!

Huge aneurisms! It would be nothing to pop these with my fingernails, no
lie. These are apparently the original (ATE) lines from 1982. Needless
to say, I ordered a set this a.m. along with the junk for putting  my
motor back right. do yourself a favor, and check your brake lines. 

Stopping on a dime, I am,
