You are sort of on the right track.
You should have a dual vacuum unit dist, correct?
Moving the breaker plate and capping the nipple on the advance unit is not a
very good test. You may be moving the plate the wrong way and capping the
wrong nipple.
Not sure where Muir came up with 7.5 after. No fuel injected 1800 [ED engine]
ever timed at that number. The correct figure is 5 after. BUT this is only if
the retard side has vacuum and it is at idle.
DOES the inboard pointing hose have vacuum at idle?
If no, trace the hose back and find out why.
If yes, does the timing change when you disconnect it at idle?
If no, then you have a bad vacuum unit.
