That's a new one on me.  Never heard of anyone's flaps sticking shut before.

If you want your engine to last a long time and function as it should, build
it to spec.  I'm with VEGE here.  You are building your engine now so you
can take the time to make sure the mechanism is moving freely and the return
spring is good.  After that, you should have no worries.  You don't say
which engine you have, but with the type 4 engines it's easy to check that
the thermostat is working properly by looking at the operating arm, and
giving it a wiggle every now and then.
