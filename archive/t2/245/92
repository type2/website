Hiya
I have a type 2 which is hard to get into gear.. I think I have heard it is=

'normal' to find 2nd and Reverse rather too close together - so I got a
Quick Shift plate from www.justkampers.co.uk <http://www.justkampers.co.uk>=

which is supposed to fix it...
 
It has made it better.. but I am looking for someone to guide me through th=
e
best way of finding the correct position for the plate.. 
My Haynes manual says put into 2nd and then move the plate hard over - but
which way?
 
I can move the adjuster plate about 1cm in total, and every position seems
to make at least one gear hard to get into...
so any tips?
 
thanks in advance for any help you can be :-)
 
Andy
