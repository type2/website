A good reference book is latest edition of "Hydraulic Institute Standards"
It covers rotary, diaphragm, and centrifugal pump design parameters as well 
as operating physics.

The idea that pumps do not "suck" can best be shown by the following:
Take a glass of water.
Put a tight lid on it.
Pierce the lid with a straw and seal the entrance.
Now then, try to "suck" the water out.
Can't do it.

Now then.........
Pierce the lid so as to allow atmospheric pressure to be imposed up on the 
water.
Now you can "suck".

Actually, what you are doing is dropping the pressure in the straw,
and allowing atmospheric pressure to force replacement water into the straw.

That is what a pump does.
The impeller or pumping member drops the inlet pressure to impeller.
The driven vanes of the impeller blade or gear pump lobes impart energy to 
the replacement fluid, and the fluid is then expelled out with added energy 
from the rotating impeller.
