Subject: Distributor Vacum Advance(Is this correct)??

Hi List,
I'm new to this list and new to type 2's in general. I purchased one about a 
month ago and have been struggleing with poor performance since. It is a '75 
Westy. Could someone please comfirm I'm on the right track...When I bought 
it the timing was 12 BTDC, according to Muir it should be 7.5 ATDC but when 
I set it at that my milage and power was horrible. As I advance it the van 
runs better but never great. Rght now it is back at 12 BTDC. When I move the 
points and plug the hole on the diaphram they move back to their original 
position...does this mean the diaphram is broken?? I just wanted to get a 
second opinion before I replaced the distributor.

Thanks a lot
Jon
