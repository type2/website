No, the atmospheric pressure on tha outside will push your finger against
the inlet.  We live in a pressurized environment.  The fuel pump creates
an area of reduced (not zero!) pressure by moving the air from the inlet
side to the outlet side, but fuel pumps are not very good at moving air.
They may not be able to produce enough pressure drop at the inlet to
cause fuel to be pushed by atmospheric pressure from the tank to the
pump.

Fuel pumps are also not good at moving vaporized fuel, which is why vapor
lock occurs on hot days.  To cure this, modern cars put the fuel pump in
the fuel tank so there is no chance of air or vaporized fuel being present
at the inlet.

VW's cure was to put the tank above the pump, so fuel is gravity-fed to
the pump.  This works fine as long as there is no restriction between the
tank and pump.

As I say in class:  "Physics does not suck.  Nothing sucks.  It's all
about pressure!
