Congratulations.
It really is a difficult concept to immediately grasp, but once understood 
becomes one of those items that makes total sense. Before grasping, it 
sounds ridiculous.

Depending on the pump design, and construction tolerances, there will still 
be sealing at the inlet of the rotating component and it's housing (volute)..

The rotating member of the pump lessens the pressure on the inlet side,
and that is what you feel when you- plug with your finger.

The finger has a lessened pressure where you place it on the pump inlet, 
and the pressure felt is the difference between atmospheric and something 
less than atmospheric as created by the pump component.

This is the design concept of as "vacuum" pump, rotary compressor, and a 
fan, be it propeller, turbine,
turbine vane design, or mixed flow blade design blade.
