If your brakes are adjusted correctly your drum will never come off in this
manner. Unless you hit the drum so hard you brake the linings off the shoes,
and even then I dont know if the drums would come off.

You should try a penetrating oil on the stars, it will loosen them up. I use
the GUNK brand, available at Lowes and Home Depot.

You probably got the one shoe that wasnt retracting to move back enough to
release the drum.

The shoes were still preventing it.

Did you also replace the wheel cylinder and all the brake hardware? Whenever
you work on a van that you have no clue about it's history I find its better
to overdo it, and replace EVERYTHING, ESPECIALLY on brakes. So what if the
wheel cylinder didnt need replacing, it will one day, and you will already
have a spare.

Did you bleed the brakes correctly?

I am sure they are.

Sounds like you need to try bleeding your brakes.
