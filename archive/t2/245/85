Subject: WTB: Westy Camping Stuff ('68 and '60)

howdy volks,

looking for the following for my '69 westy:

rear cargo netting/webbing

used awning - open to anything, but would prefer
something relatively sturdy, something that could
switch to and from my vanagon readily, and something
that i didn't have to drill into the gutters to
mount...  (open to suggestions on what fits the bill,
even if you don't have it for sale!)

also looking for the following stuff for my '60 westy.
 (please pmail off list if you've got any of this, or
have some leads as to who might!)

front curtain rod (behind bench seat)
2 child's cot "hooks" (chrome I believe...)
2 coat hooks (B pillar)
1 rear webbing hook
rear webbing
2 wedge pillows (red/black or ???)
water nozzle
german camp stove
wash basin
1960 bus owner's manual
"sloper" roof rack
westfalia (or non) tow hitch
pair of >60 windshield arms/wipers
cargo door side step  (any type)

THANKS!  ~john
