Subject: 81 ignition & running probs

Hi,

	I'm back on this list after an absense.  I have an 81 Cal. edition Westy
 (F.I,  breakerless ignition) that's running rough.  Engine has run fine
for the approx 7,000 miles since being rebuilt a few years ago.  I pulled
the cap and found it to be burned along with the rotor.  Thought they
should last longer than 7K, but I replaced them.  The van was still down
on power, so I pulled the cap and rotor again (About 100 miles later) and
they were starting to get slihgty burned again.  Check the wires (new
Bosch when rebuilt), looked OK, pulled a plug and it was fouled.  Drove
to a friend's garage and found that I had not tightened the plug that I
checked.  It was now clean.  Changed the plugs anyway, but they were
pretty clean.  Still low power, some roughness and would not idle. 
Friend adjusted the throttle by-pass screw and changed the, changed one
of the two fuel filters - idles nice, but still low on power and
roughness remains.  Checked timing - seems OK.

There seems to be a vacumn leak but I can't quite find it - but that
would likely make it run lean, and not foul plugs - right?  Anyway, what
could be the source of the iginiton parts wearing so quickly?
