Subject: Carb balancing

Hi,

I have a 74 engine with dual (split) PDSIT Solex 2/3 carbs. Idle is
correctly set to ~900 RPM but the right hand side is pulling more air
than the left ! I have no adjustment on the left to bring it up (it is
fixed) and the right has no adjustment to go down? Ideas? I am very
new to this.......

yours
