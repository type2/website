Update on extremely high oil temperatures & cetera

So here's the latest on my struggle to lower my oil temperatures from 260*+
to something tolerable.

To recap, I fixed everything that could be fixed with respect to oil and
vacuum.  Redid the complete oil system including pump, cooler, seals,
screen...  Refreshed all the engine FI gaskets, hoses, tubes and seals.
Plugged all the engine compartment holes I could, including the weather
stripping.  Ended up replacing a lot of FI components while I was at it.
And why not?   Half the work is in gaining access to them!

All that dropped the temps around 20*F or so, down to 250* on a typical
Interstate drive, or just sitting in the driveway, idling.  With heavy oil,
the pressure stayed passably high.

Well, there was a piece that I missed:  the hose from the Intake Air
Distributor to the Power Brake Booster.  Looser than a worn-out Beetle
shifter.  Put hose clips on both ends until the Bus Boys replacement gets
here, jerry-rigged the CO according to Nick's post from Aug 27, 2002 and
guess what?  

Dropped the temps another 25*, now down to 220 +/- despite a mid-80s temp
today.  Have yet to take it on the Interstate.  Still, I ordered an oil
cooler with fan setup from Aircooled.net.  I'm tired of hot oil!!!
