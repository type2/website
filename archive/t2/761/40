Subject: OT Friday Herbie report

Saw Herbie at the Drive-In with kids last night.

Fun, gratuitiously silly and NOT a comedy of demeaning errors, movie.
:D  Herbie did a great job of potraying an "attitude" (usually
defensively) WITHOUT being a smart-alek!

...still trying to figure out that oil leak issue. Between toddlers
and poor granularity on the screen I don't think the new beetle oil
cooler (??) would've fixed it, but then, I coulda swore I saw duct
tape flapping on that valve cover and I'm only familier with pancake
engines...and it was amazing that the shop didn't have the parts but a
NASCAR repair truck did! :D
I think they should've called AIRS.

My wife and I conclucded that the "soul" of Herbie is in the cyliders.
