Subject: Re: [T2] running great. but why?

Yep, knew these kind of messages were going to start sooner or later as the group knowledge and expertise got better. 

Yep, runs right now and it scares me... 

-or- 

hasn't broken in 8K miles and I'm getting bored with this reliability thing. How can I add more excitement to my VW Bus adventures... 

-or- 

I'm going to sell my VW Bus and buy a HONDA b/c I want the chance that I won't get to my destination on the first try. 

-or- 

My wife won't let me drive anything BUT the bus when we go on long trips. She says the Roll Royce isn't as safe, secure, and reliable... 

-or- 

At what point does the maintenance schedule restart? I rolled over 575,565 miles yesterday and I'm wondering that since I haven't fixed a thing in 300K miles, what should I be inspecting? Or EX-pecting?

<grin!>

Seriously sounds like the front shocks are shot. Also check everything else - tie rods, ball joints, etc. Also switch the tires around and see if the bad behavior goes with it. 

As for the engine adjustments, seems way off in several categories telling me that 1 adjustment was off requiring a whole other bunch of adjustments to compensate. Check those injector seals and EGR valve too. Mine were bad throughing everything else off too. Start with mechanical adjustments (linkages, valves, distributor drive verification) and then move to vacuum system integrity and then finally adjustments to timing, dwell, and fuel.
