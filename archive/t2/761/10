Richard,

I have Bently and read it all (not in the best environment with 2
under fives in tow) and my right carb has no where to go. If I remove
the rod with the lock nuts etc it pulls more that the left carb. Are
you saying that the right carb can be adjusted further back from the
postion with no adjustment rod attached? I did not try that....?

As to the 13mm nut.......? Nothing like that on the 74 carbs, the only
adustment according to Bently is the rod with the lock nuts.....? ( I
think )

yours

Charles
