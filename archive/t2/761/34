Good shocks are expensive.  My Audi quattro's are more like $120 each for
adjustable red Konis, slightly less for stock gas-charged Boges, plus they
are a real, genuine PITA to install.  So much so that I pay a mechanic
another $150 to do it for me instead.   But wait until my T'reg's air
suspension goes.  Yikes I hope it's under warranty...

I picked up a set of Konis from BD and will be installing those this week,
along with new ball joints all around.  A few weeks back I got a set of the
Hankooks in 185C.  I did not like them at first; got blown all over the
road!  Turns out the guy who installed them maxed-out the pressure!  Set it
to specs and it was pretty good.  IT took a few hundred miles for them to
settle in, and now I am quite pleased with them.  Very quite, stable.  They
replace a firestone SUV tire in 205/70.  They became very noisy and the
rears rubbed on the inner wheel-well lips.

So the original equipment ones from Germany are not as good? How much better
are the Koni shocks?

>Cheap at that price,,,,...you get what you pay for

$100 for a shock is cheap? Wow, I don't think I have ever paid that much for
shocks for any vehicle. I guess it is one of those things that you don't
know
until you try them. I would love to, but not at that price and it looks like
this is the last chance to get a set.
