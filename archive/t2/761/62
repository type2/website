Subject: Oil burning off of exterior of engine

I just picked up my bus from my great mechanic replacing the pushrod tube
seals, and installing a new master cylinder.  I had the pushrod tube seals
replaced because I burn alot of oil off of the exterior of the engine. 
Well I thought the problem was the pushrod tube seals......

On the way home, it appears to burn as much oil off as it did before.  My
wife was behind me and swears it comes off of the right more than the
left, but I sure did see alot from my left mirror.

It is not being burned IN the engine because it is not coming from the
exhaust.  It just pours out from the engine at speed (above 55)

It doesn't do this the whole drive, I would say that it goes for about 3
minutes of clear driving then about 1 minute of pouring the smoke.

So I guess I am asking if anybody has any ideas...  The bus has oodles of
power, it cruises well, I don't thrash it and I always run premium in it.

The engine is a 2 liter running a weber.

Help before I get depressed about the whole thing!
