Subject: Re: [T2] Solar Power and Second Battery

I used the first circuit on the following web site to connect a second 
battery. It only connects when the engine is running. Very cheap and very 
easy to do. You can join the battery up like this in addition to a solar 
panel with no ill effects.

I only have a small panel on my bus to keep the main battery topped up. A 
small panel (<10w) can be directly connected to the second battery. 
However, a larger panel will need a regulator to prevent the battery from 
overcharging. Be warned though that gel cell type batteries generally 
cannot be charged to the same voltage as wet cell lead acid batteries so 
your regulator must be suitable for the type of second battery you install.

PS. The voltage regulator won't overcharge a gel cell battery, if you were 
wondering. They actually don't fully charge a wet cell battery
