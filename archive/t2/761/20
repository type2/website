Subject: Double Cab Door For Sale

I have a pretty rare 68 only Double Cab 3rd door for sale. It is in great
shape for being 37 years old and has complete glass, door handle and trim.
Just want to offer it to y'all before I throw it on the Samba. (I have the
matching pass/drivers doors as well)

I also have a pair of 79 full sliding windows which I understand are pretty
desirable. I also have tons of 79 transporter parts plus the straightest
rust-free chassis I have ever seen.
 
350 for the door (obo)
400 for the windows (obo)
??? For the other stuff (best offer)

I'll ship it anywhere at buyers cost (except the chassis).

Let me know if my prices are out of whack. Still new at the VW parts game.

BTW, this is a great list and great people. What a find!
