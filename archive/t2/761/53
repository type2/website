Subject: mechanic in SoCal??

Hi folks!

I just moved from Montreal, Canada to San Diego, CA. I did all that by driving a
1977 2000cc fuel injection Bus. Now, I need to get it inspected in order to get
th CA lincenses. Before going to the final test (mechanical and smog) I'd like
to get it pre-test and fixed (if applicable). I live In La Jolla/UTC. Any
suggestions?

Thanks in advance

Anton
