Uh, seems my price for the 79 sliding windows was a little high (thanks
Mike!). How about $150 for the pair plus shipping. I'll ask $175 on theSamba
so act now!

Free undercoating and tire rotation for life. Ask about our warranty
program! We finance anyone! Just look for the huge gorilla on the roof...:)
