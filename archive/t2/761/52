Subject: Thank you Las Vegas

Sorry it took so long to answer back, I didn't had any access to internet for
the past week. Last week I had a starter problem in Vegas and I finally endup
installing a Hot start relay. Cheap and works great. My new starter is on it
way and I'll be repairing that soon.

Once again thanks a lot Vegas VW buddies
