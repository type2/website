Do not touch the linkage for idle adjustment. The linkage comes into play
for sync at higher RPMs.

On my carbs (36-40 PDSIT w/o central idle) idle speed adjustment is done
with the throttle plate stop screws. Probably different with stock 32-40
PDSIT as my books say not to touch throttle plate gap on these.

But the basic idea is the same: get idle perfect without linkage and then
use the linkage to even out acceleration. I.e. you need the linkage
adjustment to stop the engine shaking at certain RPMs.

The problem with my carbs is when I follow the instructions:

Volume screws 2.5 turns out.
Set screws 1.5 in after contact.
Adjust right linkage until both carbs are in sync.
Verify sync at 3000 rpm.

At that point the idle mixture does nothing. I've been thinking about
leaning out the volume screws to see if that does it. But I dunno. I am a
mile high though, so leaning them out may be just what I need, but without a
CO meter I'm a bit nervous...

OTOH, they're running sweet so I'm not in any hurry... heh
