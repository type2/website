Subject: marking ignition wires

A simple question.   When I mount a new set of ignition wires, I like 
to mark both ends to make it as difficult as possible to stick the 
wrong one on a plug or in the distributor the next time I have to 
push the wires out of the way to change the points, replace a fuel 
pump, adjust the carb, etc.

I've tried those wrap-around electronic wire labels with the numerals 
1, 2, 3, 4.  They lend a real professional look to things. For about 
a week.  They then unwrap and fall off.

I have painted stripped bands around the wires  with a white 
permanent marker pen.  These look great too, until I have to grab the 
wire; the marks flake off with the slightest touch.

Suggestions for neat ways to identify these wires?

Jack
