Subject: Re: [T2] Carb balancing

The problem with my carbs is when I follow the instructions:

Volume screws 2.5 turns out.
Set screws 1.5 in after contact.
Adjust right linkage until both carbs are in sync.
Verify sync at 3000 rpm.

At that point the idle mixture does nothing. I've been thinking about
leaning out the volume screws to see if that does it. But I dunno. I
am a mile high though, so leaning them out may be just what I need,
but without a CO meter I'm a bit nervous...

OTOH, they're running sweet so I'm not in any hurry... heh
