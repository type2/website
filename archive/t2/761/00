Subject: Parking Brake is now sticking

Volks,

After lube-ing up everything nicely underneath our 69 Westy while on 
the rack, it has just today decided to start keeping the parking brakes 
ON even after releasing the handle.

My father-in-law did squirt some liquid wrench on those lines for good 
measure, which made the operation smoother, but today when I went to 
get some tacos the car would barely move off on its own after releasing 
the parking brake.

What should I look for?

Thanks!

Anton
