Subject: RE: [T2] More KONI's Now Available!

What is the big deal about these shocks? How much better are they than the
other ones Bus Depot normally sells? BD sells oil filled ones from Germany and
Mexico, KYB gas-adjust shocks and GR-2's. All for much less than these Koni
shocks. $100 for each shock seems like a big deal for shocks, are they really
worth that kind of money?

Thanks,
Corbett
