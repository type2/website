Subject: Re: [T2] running great. but why?

The FI busses have dual advance- vac and centrifugal.  Do you have the 
proper stock dist.? If it runs well at 20 deg BTDC it sounds like what 
the 009 distr guys do- set it for proper FINAL ADVANCE to get full 
power.  Check your total advance by using a strobe- it should go to 
about 45 deg advance  FROM the initial timing you set.  I had poor 
running once and our mechanic whiz said the weights were sticking, 
sprayed something like WD40 down there and then the advance worked fully.
  >>then tonight i moved the timing back up to 20
btdc.  sounds and is way wrong but the bus runs well here.
