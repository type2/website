that is a key factor in any decision,  what are you using your bus for,
how hard are you using it, how long will you keep it etc

in my case it is a daily driver, it is my only vehicle and I've had it for
13 years now and plan on keeping it as long as I can. so putting a few
bucks into is for me a good investment, other folks will have to make
other decisions, this goes not just for shocks but for everything you do
with your bus.

  is it a "trailer Queen"   or a "rust Bucket" or somewhere in between
only you can decide how good is good enough, just err on the safe side
when it comes to safety issues
