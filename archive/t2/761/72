Thanks, Hal. Your comments echo what some p-mail has said. I'm going to
drive Hapy a bunch this weekend to shake out the cobwebs (he's sat
since mid-April). I'll do what you suggested (oil, timing, etc), and
cancel the mechanic unless something goes sideways. It has been
suggested that the less maintenance you do before a trip because you're
going on said trip, the less likely you are to breakdown. Odd bit of
Murphy law there, but I can dig it.
Hal, we'll have to hook up when I get back so you can see how the
interior turned out, and how much quieter he runs. Is the DDB gonna do
the ACVW weekend thing this Summer?
Thanks for the vote of confidence. Oh, you left out one thing from the
packing list: AIRS list :D
