Subject: More KONI's Now Available!

As I said when I wrapped up the Koni group buy on Monday, Koni had promised
me an undetermined additional quantity as my "last shot" of them, to be sent
to me at an undetermined time.  On Monday I promised that when this
happened, I'd make them available to the list on a first come basis.

This morning I called the Koni rep to find out if I could pin him down to
specifics, since several list members had emailed about it. I was completely
shocked (no pun intended) to be informed that they are already on their way
to me, and I should see them just after the 4th of July weekend!  Based on
previous conversations, I hadn't expected to see them for at least another
month or more!

So as promised, they are now available to list members who missed out on the
group buy. For Type 2 and Samba contributors only, there will be a special
pre-order price of $99.95 each throughout this holiday weekend.  At some
point on Tuesday July 5 (which is about when they're due to come in), the
price will go up to $109.95 for any that are not already spoken for, and
availability will be opened up to the general public.

When these are gone, that's it. Koni has a new CEO who doesn't want to do
any custom runs anymore; he only wants to sell shocks that are in their
current catalog.  We literally got in just "under the wire" before they
changed their policy. Just after the factory confirmed our order, they
started turning down other orders for custom runs. So, barring another Koni
regime change, the ride is over.

Please order these online only, as I will be tracking online orders by date
stamp to make sure we don't oversell them. Here are the links (front and
rear):
