Subject: Re: [T2] More KONI's Now Available!

Thanks Wayne, for the response.  About 10 minutes after I typed the message
I found an old email where Richard gave the part numbers.  They're going on
a Splitwindow Bus with a Bay frontend (79 Spindles) and Bay IRS rear.  Hope
they are as good as everyone said (don't doubt it, never been steered wrong
here), they cost more than struts for my Intriped.
