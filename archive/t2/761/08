It's a balancing act: you raise or lower one relative to the other then adjust the idle speed afterward if necessary.

Bentley shows how to adjust the 74 version.

Usually if the idle is too high and unbalanced, you would want to adjust the rod with the two lock nuts. Undo the nuts and lower the idle until it starts to increase. Since your idle is already about right you can skip this step.

Adjust the large 13mm nut on the linkage that is used to sync the two carbs together.

Unfortunately I only have photos of the 72 carbs but if you can read though my long winded article you might learn more about them in general:
