Subject: A strange question

Since it is Friday...

Anybody else highly allergic to gasoline and gasoline vapors? Every time I
come in contact with gas (like working on a van yesterday) I get a bloody
nose, throte and mucus. It is often followed by sinus cold.

Now I know not to drink or breath gas, but accidents happen. Anyone have a
homeopathic remedy to counter the effects?

I am a big fan of electric or fuel cell cars, no more gas fumes.

Jon
