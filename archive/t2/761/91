Karl was out in the sun too long and wrote the gibberish below.
D'OH!!!     Karl forgot that the lower shock stud is ON the spindle.
Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.......

I was out in the sun swapping cases in my 67 bus. The case cracked behind the flywheel at the #3 webbing. Only 
a 4" long crack! Even 40w oil will leak a quart a day when it is 100 degrees out.

 The only bay front beam that fits a split bus, with the correct bolt pattern, is the 68-69 beam. Is this the
 one you are using with disc brake spindles?

 If yes, then the front Koni shocks will not fit.  The lower studs are smaller in diameter, 10mm.  70-79 beams 
[and Koni lower shock holes] are 12mm.
