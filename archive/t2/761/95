I'll chime in and second the "Murphy's Law" reference here; I
purchased a 77k-original mile '79 Westy in Wisconsin last month and
drove it back to Oklahoma over Memorial Day weekend. There was almost
a month between when I sent the deposit and when we actually flew up
to collect the bus, which gave me plenty of time to get all worked up
about what might go wrong during the (almost exactly) thousand-mile
trip home.

Part of this was due to the fact that I would be traveling with my
wife and three-month-old daughter, so there was alot more at stake if
we broke down on the highway somewhere. Buying an old bus long
distance and then making a leisurely road trip back home was something
I've always wanted to do, but I came close to ruining it for myself by
worrying too damn much. Should I demand a compression test? What about
electrical gremlins and hidden rust and rotted tires and gummed-up
injectors or a trashed lifter or... or... or...

In the end, I decided to play the odds, which in my case have NEVER
involved a highway breakdown, and that's something to say after 29
cars. So. I bought the plane tickets and packed every tool I could fit
into a smallish soft-sided toolbag that I checked at the baggage
counter, and off we went. In the interest of brevity, we drove the bus
from north of Madison to St. Louis on Friday, around St. Louis over
the weekend and back to Oklahoma on Monday without a hitch. It ran
like a Swiss watch, and has continued to do so in daily use since I
got it home. And I haven't checked the compression or even changed the
oil yet! Maybe tomorrow...

All that said, good luck and I hope you have as good a time as we did!
