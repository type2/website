Subject: ign switch quest

hello list. i'm sure many of you have seen all of my questions regarding
correct year & setup WRT ign switches & housing.

well it appears i finally have all of the parts together for the
ignition/key return-to-stock goal on the 69. i would like to thank everyone
who provided me with answers during this time. & thank you Steve Dolan, who
displayed for me the proper technique for removing/installing a housing &
lock at EB04 IIRC.

also, i want to give a huge A+ referral to anyone on the list who is having
lock problems. contact Steve at Steve's Lock Shoppe. excellent customer
service. he will go the extra mile to make sure you are happy.

finally, in my quest i purchased lock cylinder 113 905 853 w/ 2 keys. i
don't need them. i'd be glad to send that to someone FREE as long as you
promise to make a donation to T2. its not an expensive part so just give
whatever you can give. pmail me if you want it.

i might have an electrical question next week during install.

happy 4th,
