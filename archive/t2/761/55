There are no safety inspections in CA that I know of, just smog testing.

Rather than pre-test spend the money to get it tuned up at a shop with a gas anlyzer. If you go to your pre-test and fail you haven't learned much except that it's out of tune to pass the test.

Because you've come from out of state and your VIN isn't in the smog system (unless your bus was once tested in the past) you will probably have to make an appointment with the smog referee ((800) 622-7733). At least I had to when I moved to CA.
