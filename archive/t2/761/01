Subject: Re: [T2] Parking Brake is now sticking

Hi Anton,

How long has it been sitting in one spot? If my bus sits more than a  
week in damp weather with the parking brake on, sometimes the shoes  
rust to the drum. In order to get rolling I have to dump the clutch  
in first gear or reverse.

When buying a used car that has sat for a while, sometimes I find  
that this doesn't work either. In that case it usually helps to hit  
the drum with a hammer as the driver is letting the clutch out. It  
usually lets go with a bang, after which everything works just fine.


Happy trails,
