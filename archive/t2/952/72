As Karl has essentially said, the 0231 168 005 (021 205P), while the
original unit, is interchangeable and replaced by 0231 170 093 (022 205S).

Practically all of the listings up through 1979 for the USA apply to Canada
as well, thus my site is basically for the North American market (excluding
Mexico)  Based on my research, ignition systems in Canada tended to diverge
on certain models starting within the 80s, based on differing smog
requirements of the two countries.
