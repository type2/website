	    I'd be grateful for interpretation of these key signs on 
my 1600 DP.

	AS439055   (I'm ready for the possibility that's Brazilian)

      dizzie:
	JPUD 4  <--
	(Chow character) 0231 180001
	(VW  trademark)  211 905 2025

Any info would be most welcome e.g country of mfr, year, whether I'm 
cursed with the dreaded '009'.


cheers
