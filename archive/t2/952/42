Subject: Repairing the drive-away Westy tent...

So we were finally able to put up the circus tent that we picked up a few
weeks ago.  I did a short blurb.... http://calivw78.com/wordpress/?p=15 .The
test run went quite well and the whole package seems to be a very solid
start.  There are a couple items though that need repairing and I am having
a hard time finding info on what others may have done in the past.  The blue
peg hole inserts that go around the perimeter of the floor...I have one that
is defunct.  Any thoughts on repairing it or should I just leave it alone?
It's only one and won't by any means prohibit it's use. There are a few pin
sized holes and a zipper or two that need replacment also, but we should be
able to handle those.

Also, in the following picture, you can see several loops that are on the
inside of the tent....opposite of its outside counterpart for attaching to
the poles.  They seem to be at every attachment point.  Were there any other
rods that possibly went through these to allow for hanging of lanterns or
various objects, or did the user always supply their own means of
attachment?

Peace, Troy
