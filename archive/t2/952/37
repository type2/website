Subject: pet odor

I know when my German shepherd got acquainted with a neighborhood skunk, the
only thing that would get the stink under control was the peroxide bath, IE:

1 FRESH bottle 3% peroxide
1/4 cup FRESH baking soda
Good squirt dish detergent

Mix ingredients and apply while foaming while giving the pet a warm bath. Do
not store  the mixture in a sealed container. Anyway, if this works for
skunk odor (which it does, I swear), I don't see why it wouldn't work on
other pet odors. I would test for colorfastness in a hidden area to make
sure it didn't mess with the colors of the upholstery though.
