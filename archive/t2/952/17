Well, the distributor was not the right way around.  The key was definitely 
on the right.  I swapped the wires around, went to crank it, and it fired 
immediately, but then died.  A lot of junk blew out of the rusted tailpipe 
just before it died.  It hasn't started since, but at least I feel like I'm 
on the right track.

Just to make sure I'm doing this right, the firing order should now be 
3-2-1-4, correct?

Also, at one point while turning over the engine I heard a pop, went back to 
check it out and a lot of the vacuum lines were blown off.  In fact it blew 
the part that holds the air filter off the s boot, and it was on tight. 
What might cause that?  It only happened the one time then and hasn't 
happened since, and I've done a lot of cranking.

I'm going to buy a timing light today to see if I'm at least in the ballpark 
timing wise, we'll see how that goes.

I'm also not convinced that something isn't up with the fuel pressure 
regulator, I guess I'll add a pressure gauge to the shopping list.  The 
never ending list.

I just thought I'd let everyone that has tried to help me out know where I 
was.  The saga continues...
