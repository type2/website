Subject: Suspension differences '74 vs '79

Can anyone tell me if there are differences in the
suspension between '74 and '79? I guess I'm most
concerned with spring rates. I love how my '79 handles
and want to be sure before I spend a ton of time on
the '74 (replacement)that it will be the same. TIA. - BaH
