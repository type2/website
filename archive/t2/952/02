Subject: Re: [T2] Stinky Upholstery

Don, I'll bet most of that smell is in the padding.  You'll probably want to replace that with the nice horse-hair stuff from Wolfsburg West.  You'll like it a lot better than foam.  I did and am very pleased.   As far as the upholstery, any good upholstery cleaner should get rid of whatever smell comes from it.  You probably have foam padding and it really soaks up the dog piss.  Believe me, I know.  I had to have a couch redone.  New puppies can get expensive.  But I've got her well trained now.  Cheers...KR

upholstery is in good shape, and the foam is still intact. They were
dirty, but I figured a few hours of quality time with the Little Green
Clean Machine would take care of that.

Well, I got them to look reasonably clean (some stains that I could
still work on), but they STINK. I think the guy had a dog that peed on
them and it soaked into the foam. There was quite a bit of short fur
in the cracks.

Any suggestions? Or should I toss them?
