The nada values on most Bay campers is actually already higher than most
models of splits, assuming they are a top condition bus. Seems splits sell
over lately and bays creep toward a mark already set. I think the important
part of high value is unmolested originals or accurate near #1 cars, both of
course with fresh road dust on them...
