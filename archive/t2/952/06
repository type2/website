Don, There are quite a few enzyme-based products that will get rid of the 
smell. Before our GD Cat was fixed, we used "Nature's Miracle" for his 
territory marking. You can get it at any pet supply store, or online.

For your purposes, I'd go for the 1 1/2 gallon bottle and really soak the 
seats. You can even use it on the seats, wait for it to soak in, then re-try 
the little green machine. That size will run you about 30 bucks. A 24 oz. 
bottle should be 6 bucks. I guess it's worth a shot before junking or 
re-doing the upholstery. At least check it out on the web.
HTH -
