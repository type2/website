Subject: Oli pressure switch light still on

Have tried to track wire from oil pressure switch to front of bus..    
It leaves the pressure switch as grey with a green line
around it (not along the wire).  Can't find same colour wire under  
bus in bundle of wires that enter the tube under the
right hand side.  Have tried to create a circuit  by plugging a wire  
into the oil pressure switch wire via a multi meter and
using a test light to pierce likly coloured wires as they enter the  
tube.  So far nothing.

I removed the dash to check wire colour onto idiot light.  It is blue  
with a green stiripe running the length of itl

With no continuity of wiring colouring, I am not getting anywhere.   
All suggestions welcome.
