Jon,
Which carb are you running ? IMy wild guess is a lean condition when the
choke goes off.

If you have a 34 pict there is a famous vacuum leak developed when that
penny-sized crap-cap starts to wiggle off its bore. Hard to explain better,
but look for loose stuff at the back of the carb, in the middle. JB weld.
