Subject: Oil change gasket set - $2.79

WTF?!?!?!

I needed a set.  Pep Boys didn't have them.  I didn't bother with Auto 
Zone, Advance or O'Reilly.  NAPA has usually pulled through for me when 
others were empty handed, but $3.05 with tax is just a little 
far-fetched.  It says "Made in America" and I'm grateful for that fact, 
but I don't think that 3 times the price of imported products is 
reasonable.

I just bought a bunch of these from one of our online vendors for 89 
cents each.

Thanks for the bandwidth.  I had to rant.
