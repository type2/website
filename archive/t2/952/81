Thanks, David, and everyone else for their insights. I think I'll try out
the 5 rib 002 tranny and see how it goes.

I think some of us might be getting confused between the 5-rib 002 trans 
and the 6-rib 091 trans.  Here are some easily-verifiable facts:

3-rib 002 Trans from '73 bus has 5.375 final drive and .82 4th gear = 
4.4075 overall highway gearing.

5-rib 002 Trans from late '74-75 bus has 4.86 final drive and .889 4th = 
4.318 overall highway gearing.  That's a 2% difference or "Virtually 
identical".

6-rib 091 Trans from 76-up bus with 2.0 engine has 4.57 final drive and 
.889 4th = 4.064 overall highway gearing.  That's substantially "taller" 
than either of the above 002 transaxles.

The original post asked for a comparison between the two 002 transaxles 
listed above, not any 091 transaxle.  I stand by my statement that on 
the highway the three and five-rib 002 have virtually identical gearing, 
with the five-rib being ever-so-slightly taller (about 1mph faster at 
60mph).
