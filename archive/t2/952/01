Subject: Re: [T2] Stinky Upholstery

My suggestion would be to either reupholster them (and replacing 
everything that isn't metal) or get rid of them.
I've had more experience removing pet urine than I would like.  I've 
tried every product out there.  Some will help, but I've yet to find one 
that is good enough to recommend for your situation.  Even if you could 
get them "fairly" clean, I would bet that after sitting in the sun for a 
few hours on a humid afternoon, you would smell "the smell" when you 
opened the door.  No thanks.  :-)
