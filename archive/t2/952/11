Subject: RE: [T2] Will type 2's ever get there?

I think Double Cabs will get there first and then '71 & '77-'79 Westys. Give
em 10 years or so. Everybody keep your Bays nice! They will pay off someday!
Or keep them and keep on loving them and pass on the passion.

The #300079782203 on "that auction site" is someone's passion that got a
little too optimistic though. That is a nice 7K Westy though! Maybe Art in
Iowa lives a little too close to some crop circles... I dunno it does have
and AVP engine... :)
