Subject: Rough running issue solved

List, 

 

 

Today finally got above 40 F here in nw IA so I decided to head out and
stick my head up the rear of my bus and give'er one more try. For those who
don't remember my posts from a couple of months ago I had rough running
issue with my 77 with EFI. Originally it would run fine until it warmed up
but then would start running so rich it would just shut off. Long story
short I started replacing a bunch of stuff in hopes I'd eventually hit the
jackpot and replace the right part. Well today I was out fiddling with the
wires around the dual relay when it briefly started running good. I started
wiggling all the wires around that area to see which one it was. I grabbed
onto the fuel injector wires for injector # 3 and bingo it started purring.
That what it was all along folks. Bad connection on injector # 3. 

 

Hope it helps someone else with the same issue
