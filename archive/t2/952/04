   Dream on...That was an auction...Prices at those "events" are wildly
divergent from prices of real cars...Unless it's a vehicle that was rare
to begin with, those prices don't translate to what YOUR vehicle might
be worth...Check prices on the online auction site for comparables...
and see if even they actually sell...You can ask whatever you want for
anything...
    Besides, how much do you think the seller already has spent on that
$41,000 VW...Including the trailer (it sure wasn't driven to the auction)
and garaging (it doesn't see sunshine much less snow...?-)
