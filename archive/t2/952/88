So I was at the new mega-mart liquor (total beverage) and came across 
the following.

Of course I had to buy a 6 pack.  It was really good, and I ended up 
drinking a couple more than I usually do.  Have any of the Denver crew 
been to the total beverage yet?  It's in our neighborhood Jon.  You 
gotta love a place where you can buy single bottles of probably more 
than 1000 beers.

peace.
