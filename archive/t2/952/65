The lister observes that the coil wire is being ejected from its seat in 
the coil, and we are asked to consider what forces might be responsible.

I suggest that heated gasses could build up pressure in the boot, and pop 
it off, carrying the coil wire with the boot.  If there is a gap between 
the coil electrode and the coil wire, then an arc would accompany each 
firing and that arc would heat any air or moisture in the boot.

The lister could test this hypothesis by making sure that the boot is not 
airtight and the coil wire is not jammed into the coil nipple so tightly 
that it would prevent the escape of any gasses. He might eliminate the boot 
entirely during the test, and if the wire did not leap from the coil while 
the engine was running, he could conclude that a solution would involve 
venting the trapped hot gasses, perhaps by cutting a vent in the boot, and 
by making sure the coil wire firmly contacted the coil electrode at all times.
