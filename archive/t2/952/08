I would toss the condoms for sure Greg, they're really tough to wash 
properly. :-b

 I've had great success by washing cloth auto upholstery in the washing 
machine on gentle cycle in cold water.  Came out like brand new (westy I 
bought that had dog hair, condoms, incense etc. throughout.)


 Any suggestions? Or should I toss them?
