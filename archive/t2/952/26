As Mike said, the intake valve was open when the spark fired.

Double check the movement of the valves with the distributor but I suspect that your timing is too advanced now...

The drive pinion has to be precisely position at 12 deg at TDC #1. It has 12 teeth which will add or subtract 30 degrees to its alignment with the case parting line (42 degrees, -18 degrees, etc).

If it seems 180 degrees out and you simply flip it 180 in this situation then your distributor will have to be rotated to compensate. Sometimes because of the vacuum can there is no room to rotate and it will seem like you are in the neighbourhood because of that.

Good idea.
