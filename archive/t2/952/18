Subject: EveryBus 2007 T-shirt Pre-order info

Howdy all. It's coming up on EveryBus time again, and once again I will be
doing the official event shirts and dash plaques. Although I will have a
few for sale onsite, you can save a couple bucks pre-ordering, you can get
long sleeve shirts or sweatshirts also, and it also makes it a lot easier
on me financially. The deadline is March 9th, and I can take paypal in
addition to the traditional mailing of the check method. Information &
pics are on my site:

And Chris should be updating the official EveryBus site soon.

as always, feel free to email with questions.
Thanks,
