Subject: stock 77 Distributor no's?

Hi, I have a Canadian 77 Westy, with a stock distributor. I can't get in there
to really see what all the no's are, but I do know I see the VW and Audi
symbol on the side of it. According to OldVolksHome it should be a VW
021-905-205P but that is for the U.S. 49, and doesn't mention Canada. I can't
make out the no's cause I had to use a mirror to even see this much. I KNOW
it's the stock dizzy that came with the van and it's 2L F.I. mechanical valve
engine. It has a small vacuum can and a single vacuum line to it. I am
assuming it's not a Bosch, since I've never seen a Bosch dizzy marked with a
VW symbol, but hey, I could be wrong. :-) and they may have done that.
I have an XR700 ignition system installed and need to verify the no's so Crane
cams can send me a new shutter for the dizzy. They want the dizzy no's to be
sure.
Thanks in advance,
Courtney
