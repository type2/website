Subject: checking links and such

HEY!  we don't  all have dsl, not all can go to any event, or have 
much spare time to follow up on posts with no info.

PLEASE put DATES and LOCATION into a posting  for events,

PLEASE put subject  and/or  short summary into "Check this link"

much easier for everyone. and very considerate.  Don't be lazy.
