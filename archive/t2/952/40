Unless I'm missing something really obvious, how could they be 
independent of each other?  They both actuate the same lever.  Plus, 
they would both have to be sealed from both the atmosphere and from each 
other, meaning that plugging one of the holes would create a vacuum or 
pressure on the plugged side, which would in turn affect the other 
side's operation.
