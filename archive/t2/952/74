I jumped to the wrong conclusion here. One of the clips that holds the 
distributor cap onto the California distributor was occupying the position I 
needed to for one of the screws used to attach the can to the Federal 
distributor.  I thought the clip was permanently attached to the vacuum can, 
but it's not.  Underneath the clip is an already-drilled hole that lines up 
with the threaded portion of the Federal distributor.  I think I *can* 
attach the California vacuum can to the Federal distributor.
