Subject: Strange engine: Update

This morning I went outside and started diagnosis.

Kept the Hot Spark in.
With the MSD Blaster II coil and resistor, I was getting the same results.
With a test light on the + side of the coil, the motor quit without
test-light going off. Power always stayed on. I tested the other terminals
and they were OK.
Pulled the MSD coil and put the original "027" Bosch Blue coil back on.
Now I can't duplicate the problem!
So I warmed up the motor, tuned the carburetor and now she purrs as well as
an Empi 34 PICT 3 replacement carb can.
So, I "think" the issue was a loose wire at the coil, either the coil to
dizzy cable or the - or + to Hot Spark wires.
It was one of those, "unplug everything and then plug it back in and it
fixed itself" deals.
I'd dig deeper later, it got cold outside. I'm not going to rule out the
carb or fuel pump though...It needs some more driving opportunities for the
problem to show up again.

The best thing I found out from this little challenge: Roy from Hot Spark
followed this thread and offered a replacement unit if I found that mine is
bad. Talk about a really cool guy and great customer service! Thanks Roy!
