Subject: Can I switch Vacuum cans on these distributors?

Hi all:

I believe the vacuum can on my 1982 (Federal) Vanagon is bad.  I happen to 
have a good vacuum can from a 1981 (California) Vanagon.

Looking just at the advance specs in the TypeII library I read:

Vacuum: 9-12deg Adv (-at-) 8.2 In. Hg (Cal)
Vacuum: 8-12deg Adv (-at-) 7.9 In. Hg (Fed)

Is there any reason why I couldn't just put the good California vacuum can 
on the Federal distributor?

Thanks.
