Subject: RE: [T2] Oli pressure switch light still on

The color combinations are more important than how the color is placed on the wire.  it would not be inappropriate for a "blue wire with green running the length of it" to connect with a "blue wire with green running around it".  
   
  The diagram for a 76 bus is at:

  although the colors are a little squirrely looking in places

  I suspect that what is now a "grey with green" wire was at one time blue with green and has faded due to engine heat. Greg


.....Have tried to track wire from oil pressure switch to
front of bus.. It leaves the pressure switch as grey
with a green line
