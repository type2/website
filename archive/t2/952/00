I had the same issue.  AFAIK, the "-A" suffix simply denotes plugs made
for a single special purpose or customer, in this case VW de Mexico.

What you want are simply BP5ES plugs,  They will work fine.  They are
available at any well-stocked FLAPS

Set the gap to whatever your ignition system requires.  The spark is
provided by the coil, not the engine!
