I would stay away from the Airtex. When I put my 72 together, we put
in a brand new one and took the bus on the California coast tour. I
wasn't but a few hours up Hwy 36 when it failed. Luckily a wrecking
yard was just around the corner from where we broke down and we got a
generic electric from a Nissan or something.

 I may pick one of the $40 ones up just to keep in the bus as a backup
 for the Denver trip...
