I'll be combining the two.

Relay solenoid (+) will come from coil (+)

Relay (-) wil be connected to oil pressure idiot light sender. 

Key will have to be on AND OP sender failed closed to leave the pump
running when the engine isn't. 

That's the quick simple fix. I'll probably investigate a coil (-) fired
setup later.

And considering the fluke accident that ate my engine last time I'm
probably going to add a level of complexity to the VW design and set up a
coil power cutout using the OP sender. Oil pressure goes away and the
engine dies -- immediately.
