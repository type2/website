Subject: Denver Trip - My website and trip plan

I wrote it yesterday morning, but didn't get a chance to upload it
until just now.

It describes my trip to Denver from SoCal in the GWB and will
(hopefully) be updated every night during the trip. I'll be taking
lots of pictures and taking my time, figuring an average speed of
45mph will allow time for traffic, inclines that slow me down, and
stopping for food and pictures.

GWB is running sweet (except for a nagging idle issue that really
won't affect highway driving) and I think he's as excited about
hitting the road as I am.

For those of you who don't know, my bus was a Tourist Delivery
vehicle. It was purchased in Germany by an American who drove it
around Europe before shipping it back here to the states. Judging by
the papers and souvenirs found when ripping the interior out, this bus
has been all over the country as well. I found unmailed postcards from
Niagra Falls, Key West, and Texas. So it's safe to assume this bus has
lived a large chunk of its life on the highway.

I plan to let him return to the highways as frequently as possible.

Both the bus and I are itching to leave. The last things to do now are
the tires and a final oil change, valve adjustment, new fuel filter,
and tune-up. And find out why the idle keeps dropping.
