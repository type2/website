Similar to that would be Airtex p/n E8012S -- most anyplace can cross-refernce that number 
and it's a fairly common pump.  I ran a non-brand (Amgauge) version of that for *years* and 
never had a problem.  Still worked when I sold the car .. couldn't say the same for the engine 
that went in at the same time. :-(
