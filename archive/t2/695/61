Scott,

No : the core is for sure 73 and later, it has two bleeder screws. A red 
plastic cap is inserted on the upper inside part of the caliper, right above 
the piston. That is the only place were the hose can be connected.

The rebuilt caliper box says 251 615 108X, which is front right caliper, 
73-79. I still do not understand why the pistons cutouts are on the top. Did 
the cutouts position change between 72 and 73 ?

So I MUST get a correct (thin - one bleeder screw) 71-72 core unless I 
change both calipers, which seems useless to me.
