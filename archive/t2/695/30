Subject: Rotary fuel pump for carbs

I'm getting tired (after several years) of the clattering of my Facet 
electric fuel pump.  I would like to replace it with a quiet rotary-style 
pump.  I've been told that this type of pump is available at the FLAPS for 
a very reasonable price, if you know what to ask for.  I don't know what to 
ask for.  What I'm looking for is something like this:

If I have to pay $60 for it and wait for it to be shipped, I will but I'd 
rather find it locally for a bit less money.  Anyone know what kind of pump 
this is, or what type of vehicle originally used it?

How about the Carter P4070 - anyone use that one?

Thanks,
	-David
