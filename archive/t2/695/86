I try to buy the best I can afford but am careful to buy quality and not name. I went through a period in '91-'94 where I was buying tools from JC Whitney and Harbor Freight! Man those tools were JUNK. After replacing tools 2-3 times in 6-7 uses it becomes obvious that these tools were false economy. Especially when the tools are so cheap they are not finished, just black... <grin!> What is worse is dealing with ruined fasteners because the tool I used was not up to the task of anything more stout than Jello. Totally false economy. Screwdriver = $1, ruined fastener $.50, trip to store for new fastener $1 in gas, time = ???, cut on finger = ???, etc. Had I bought a good tool that would have lasted 10 years the fix would have been free b/c it would have just worked the first time. 

I have bought cheap drill bits with nice hinged cases so that I could replace broken drill bits that I knew would last a year or two at my slow pace of wear so I could put nice bits into the case as I needed to. However cheap cutting tools now really get my goat. I want to good stuff. Best would be better but my budget won't do everytime.
