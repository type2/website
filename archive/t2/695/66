Subject: re-key door handle

i am taking my first stab at vw locksmithing. i have a couple donor lock
cylinders out for parts. i have an almost ready cylinder standing for
installation except one problem - the key doesn't go in all the way. about
1/4 to 3/8" is sticking out. the key i'm working off of is a 69, and i
wonder if this sticking out business has anything to do with possibly
different cylinders after 1970? maybe i re-keyed a 71 or later lock
cylinder? anyone have a reason why the key sticks out?  - steve
