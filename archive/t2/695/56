That's the one I got. 4 - 6 psi and most sites I've found say to NOT use a
regulator http://www.racetep.com/webfuelspark.html#webfuel

High volume, low pressure.

It cost me $79.99 locally. You will find you generally pay MORE locally
than mail order. The shipping costs bring the two prices closer together
but mail order will usually win out by $5 or $10 if you're willing to wait
for it. The P4070 can be had for about $59.99 mail order and figure about
$10 for shipping as it's not exactly a light package.

I can't really give a noise report because mine is on the Rivi in a 10x20
storage unit with every door, window, and hatch open on the bus. It sounds
LOUD in there -- but it's not the clattering loud of the Facet. In fact, I
can hear the hiss of it sucking air around the unsealed fitting threads
quite clearly <grin> Gotta fix that. It's not leaking fuel but I bet it's
blowing bubbles into my float bowls. ;-)

The metal bracket is also mounted right to the firewall. I will probably
need to isolate that with rubber mounts like the ones on the pump itself.
I'm sure the vibration is being amplified by the "drum like"
characteristics of the firewall/fuel tank bay combination.

I need to order some relays and wire it up to the oil pressure switch too.
I'm really uncomfortable with an electric fuel pump that runs when the
engine isn't turning.
