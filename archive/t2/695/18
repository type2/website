My thoughts are that you need a mix of both "quality" tools and the cheapies 
too. In my opinion for those of us who only work on our own vehicles, it 
pays to buy good tools in certain catagories such as sockets and wrenches 
which at times have a great demand put on them. Just the other day I was 
trying to get out a stubborn temp sensor (in my truck) and it wouldn't 
budge. I ended up breaking the cheap extension I had grabbed out of my tool 
box. Now if I had grabbed one of my Craftsman extensions it may or may not 
have broken, but my tool would have been replaced and I feel that the tool 
would probably not have broken, meaning less down time and saving a trip to 
the store.

On the other hand, tools that you only use occassionally, such as a 
compression tester, don't have quite the physical demand on them and if 
stored properly should last a long time.

If I was loaded with money I would buy everything Craftsman. As it is I have 
a good base of the Craftsman tools and a few odd sets of cheaper tools I 
have picked up or been given. I have learned that cheap vise grips  or 
pliers aren't worth a darn and will always break.

I ended up using a Craftsman wrench (instead of a socket and cheater bar) to 
get the sensor out, which required PB Blaster and banging the wrench with a 
hammer.

I have to be candid and admit though that I am a sucker for a good Craftsman 
tool. Even though I don't use my tools as often as say Mark Dearing there is 
something about owning a good quality set of tools that appeals to me. I 
have often found Craftsman tools at yard sales. The person usually wants 
more for them, but they are cheaper than new and garaunteed for life.
