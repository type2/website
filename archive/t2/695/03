Subject: Spare your zapping finger

TR,

Thank you for your enlightened counsel, based on two weeks' 
acquaintance with the list. Tell you what. I'm unsubscribing. I will 
spare your zapping finger. I asked a question, and I got a response.

I know who to go to for answers to my questions. Had you had more 
experience with the list, you might know that I've been here for about 
eight years. I've gone months and years at a time without posting 
anything at all. At the moment, I am rebuilding an engine, and trying 
to make it the best I can by seeking advice from more experienced 
people. That doesn't make me a junky. It makes me a student, albeit a 
critical and sometimes difficult student.

Before I ask anything, I consult Bentley, Muir, Wilson, Hoover, the 
type2 library, and the archives -- at a minimum. Only it those places 
do not provide a satisfactory answer do I bring things to the list.

I make it a rule never to subscribe to a list where people don't want 
to use it, and don't want other people to use it. Didn't know this was 
one of those lists until today.

Mark
