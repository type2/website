Just the excuse I've been looking for to buy one of those things.  Dave,
are you making more than one?  I'd like to order up a doublecab...

I'll go buy one if that's your plan.

Does anyone have a ZipZap?  If you do give me a measurement from center
of
rear wheel to center of front wheel.  Also width of front and back
wheels?
