Subject: Re: [T2]  Oil pressure WAAAAAAY too high

I think you are right.  After taking the relief valve out TWICE and re 
installing the oil strainer, I decide to check the easiest, and first 
suggested by the Electrician, Teddy Bear, I looked at the wiring, and yes 
the sender wire was loose.
I tightened it, and after awhile the pressure subsided.
The good news,  I learned how to clean the relief valve, I now know that may 
be a future issues, I also learned the value of proper oil changes.
Soooo, thank you to all who offered valuable advise.
Mar Dearing, that dang emory cloth scared me....scared my relief valve and 
really made me test my faith (I chickened out and did not clean the shaft, 
too scared to scratch the walls).
Next......
