Subject: Re: thread sealer (was Rotary fuel pump for carbs)

I found a roll of thread sealer right next to the white Teflon stuff in Home
Depot.  
PTFE Thread Seal Tape: Yellow Gas Line, in a yellow plastic roll.  It's
rated for "gasoline, petroleum oils, propane, butane, naptha, benzene,
kerosene, natural gas(pressure not over 100psi)". 
You wrap the threads twice and screw 'er together.
I was working on BN4 gas heaters and found out the Teflon stuff leaked with
gas.
Good luck,
