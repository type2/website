Subject: Re: [T2] Compression tester hose

Odd. My compression tester is like 15 years old. The hose is 12" which
is perfect for my bus. And the hose pops straight as soon as I pull it
from my toolbox. I bought it at (at the time) Chief Auto.

I can't suggest anything for an extension, but your hose can be
disconnected from the guage, right? Maybe warming it up in a pan of
water then hanging it up with the guage or some other weight attached
to the bottom end to pull it straight?
