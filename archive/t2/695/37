Hmmmm...I still have all the messages from 1/22 to present, and this was the
only message from you during that time. Im guessing it was your first post
to the list period.

Most of us have been here coexisting for years. You join and 2 weeks later
you're some sort of self-appointed list-Nazi?
Give me a break....

It seems obvious that you will not be happy reading this list, I suggest you
unsubscribe and move on to something else.
