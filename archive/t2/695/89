Hopefully this is NOT the Bus I visited at Pick-n-Pull in San Jose last
year. The one I found had been a very nice '69 before it was destroyed in
a front end collision. I salvaged a gorgeous brown front floor mat, front
door panels, slider door panel, and a brown spare tire cover from it. It
was sad to see such a beautiful machine there but since I had been looking
for some of these exact parts for years I was at the same time very
grateful.

> In Dec 1999 we were transferred overseas and had to sell our old friend "The
School Bus".   She was a Brown and white (picture here -
http://www.aircoolers.org/images/09-14-2004smaller.jpg) 1969, nine passenger
bus that we had been in our family for over 15 years.  We adopted her in
1985 from her first and only owner, a minister, in Visalia, California, and
her California license Number was XML 726.   We had to let her go, she had a
few dings, but was complete and well taken care of.   A Navy Family adopted
her in December 1999.  We have been back in the states (Lemoore) for a year
and have not seen her, so I don't think she is still in the Lemoore,
California area.   I understand the family was going to make her a "Hippy"
or "Flower Child" Bus and paint her with wild colors and flowers, but I'm
not sure if that happened.
