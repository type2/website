Mark,

I really hope you don't let one idiot spoil the list for you. 

The Urban Dictionary defines a Troll this way:
----------
troll
1. A large, brutish creature of European myth, often lacking in
intelligence. Sometimes compared to the Japanese oni.
2. A dumbass who makes idiotic posts in message boards newsgroups for
the sole purpose of pissing people off, often lacking in intelligence.
Sometimes compared to people who pass you by on the sidewalk then grab
you in inappropriate places.
1. "AAAAAAHH, it's a troll!"
"Protect the women and children! Grab your torches!"
2. "AAAAAAHH, it's a troll!"
"****head... we banned him five times and he keeps making new accounts
about how he pwns all and that he>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>j0 0!"
