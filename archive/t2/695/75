Subject: Re: [T2] Asian tools

     I LOVE Craftsman tools!  As far as how they feel in my hands, well I 
guess it's only good, not as great as they could be.  For me though, they 
represent a form of success.  My first tools were an Asian brand, and I'm 
not talking about anything good either, I'm talking chromed wrenches that 
after two or three uses you could see copper wash underneath?  They had 
CHINA stamped on the side, and they were about as useful as twigs and rocks 
for working on VW's.  I got them at a farmers market, I didn't know any 
better then.  I destroyed probably half the nuts and bolts I went after with 
them.
     I feel that spending time learning, and using crappy tools, I deserved 
a set of good tools.  Having a garage now, and good quality Craftsman tools 
is reward enough for me.  Every time I see them lying there all clean and 
shiny in their Craftsman tool chest, I know they are going to give me good 
consistent service, and it makes me smile.  If the strange squarish ratchet 
handle bites me just a bit when I'm really pulling on it, I just wrap a rag 
around the handle and keep right on smiling.  For me, a home mechanic, I 
don't think there is a better value.  I've bought all of them on good sales, 
so I spent little if any more money than I would have for tools at Lowe's or 
maybe even Target.  The few that I have had to take back to Sears have been 
replaced right there with as good or often better version of the same tool, 
no questions asked.  I haven't even been able to break very many of them 
yet.  Once I took back a screwdriver, and they didn't have that screwdriver 
handy in loose form, so they guy handed me a 5 pack set that had one very 
close to what I was returning and said 'have a nice day'.  They really do 
back that guarantee.  It was a nice day :-)
     I still have some cheapy pliers and other items but I am slowly and 
steadily exchanging them for quality Craftsman tools.
     I know they are not the right tool for a real shop, but for me, they 
are truly perfect.  I don't buy any other kind of hand tool now.
