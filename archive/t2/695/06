Subject: Re: [T2] Too many questions?

TR What's the problem? I've been subscribed to this list since 11/2002 and
have over 40,000 messages in my folder covering just about everything bus
related. I don't every post for sure, but I don't recall anyone else
complaining of "List Junkies" asking questions besides you!?

If you don't want to read a bunch of questions from him just don't read
them, you know who he his is, just look at the from line and subject matter
and don't read it if you don't want to. I may not read his questions now but
the answers he gets might help me next year when I'm searching my achive of
posts trying to figure something out.

If you don't want to read a bunch of talk about fixing T2 buses I'm puzzled
why you subscribed?
