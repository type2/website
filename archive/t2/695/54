Frank: First of all, if it is not moving freely in the bore, then it 
is probably not serving its purpose of regulating the oil pressure. 
So you are right to give this your attention.

What have you been doing to try to withdraw the valve/cylinder?
Grab it's recess with needle-nose pliers operated in reverse?
Shake the case?
Squirt a lubricant up the bore to minimize the possibility of the 
valve grabbing on its way out?

I have a magnet on the end of a telescoping rod that does a nice job 
of grabbing this valve and withdrawing it.
I have also taken a wood dowel and a spare valve and trimmed the OD 
of the tip of the dowel so it is a really snug fit into the recess. 
Then I jam this into the problem valve and rotate/withdraw/ coax etc.

It is possible that a tap might have just the right OD to grab the 
valve ID, but this would be a lucky coincidence. Try the dowel method 
first.
