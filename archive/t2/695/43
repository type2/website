Subject: Re: [T2] Asian tools

Ahhh... I love quality tools. They truly are a joy to use.

My favorite ratchet set ever I bought when I was 19 from the Matco
truck. That $120 common 3/8" ratchet was heaven in my hands. Blew away
the SnapOn and Craftsman tools the rest of the guys in the shop used.
 
Of course, I lost that thing years ago. :-(

Craftsman tools really don't do anything for me. Most of their hand
tools are decidedly uncomfortable in my hands. Their sockets are
decent quality though, so I buy those. I just bought a Taiwanese
ratchet from Home Depot yesterday. It's their Husky brand. 3/8"
ratchet, 2 joints in the handle so it can make a cool z shape if
needed. It was only $20 and feels sturdy. I used it yesterday when I
finally got to finish my brakes.

Napa tools are a ripoff. I couldn't find my 11mm flare nut wrench
anywhere, so while I was at Napa buying hose and such I picked up one
of theirs. It wasn't until I got home that I discovered that they
charged me $15 for the thing. The friggin handle isn't even finished!
Just a rough casting pattern with "Napa" stamped into it. (And I won't
be going back to that Napa either... Clerks there were all surly and
unfriendly. Bleh.)

I've got some cheapie wrenches that have never given me a lick of
trouble. I've cracked good quality sockets (chromed sockets and 14mm
Volvo head bolts don't get along... took 3 before I gave up and bought
a 1/2" drive impact socket to get the (-at-)#%#$^^ things out), and I've
stripped good and cheap ratchets.

I'm not sure what my point was here, but my interest in tools is how
they feel in my hands and whether they'll be able to handle the work
I'm giving them. All else being equal, I'd prefer US made tools. But
all else is rarely equal.
