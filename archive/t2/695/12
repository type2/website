Phil,

Very well said. (Coming from a guy who has Tools from Snap-on, but
prefers his sockets from Wright Tool!)

My dad, who was a body shop guy before he became the USAF's version of
The Great Santini, was very specific about buying good tools. He said
the same thing Muir did. And he has never rounded off a bolt or screwed
up a fastener to this day.

And I still love my Beta tools, even though rumor has it they are now
being made by Fagom...which got bought by SK a few years ago.
