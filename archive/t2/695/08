Subject: Re: [T2] Too many questions?

Well, the response TR wrote about someone being a "List Junkie" 
certainly seemed like an unwarranted attack to me.

Pretty unreasonable behavior, IMHO.

As long as we do stay on topic (LBC - My bad!) I would imagine there 
are no bad questions.

Marks eloquent reports are more than just a casual read, but in them I 
have already found some good intel/info.

If you choose to "zap" a specific person's postings, that is entirely 
your prerogative.

Posting to the list that you consider someone to be a List Junkie is 
just sort of bad netiquette, I feel.

My 2 cents.
