If this is the same Dr. Tom that teaches at City University in the UK
(http://www.city.ac.uk/mim/hennessy.htm), I'm not sure if he might have
responded to the wrong list.  He appears to be a learned man, not someone
who might be predisposed to trolling.

Then again, the email ID might just be misleading and the actual
"t.r.hennessy" is someone else entirely.

I too though his reply a bit harsh.  Hang in there, Mike.
