This is a big concern with aftermarket electric fuel pumps. Hence the
various multi-kill wiring schemes.

I remember going through the same thing with my old Chevy Vega. The
fuel pump was triggered by an oil pressure switch that had failed on.
So I was going nuts trying to figure out why I had to replace the
needle and seat valve every 2 weeks. Once I found it I wired it to a
relay triggered by the coil + side. Never had a problem after that,
though a stall would leave the pump running...
