Subject: Compression tester hose

Today I struggled to thread the whip hose that comes with my compression and leakdown testers in the 72 bus with no overhead access hatch. Even with the hatch on my own bus, I find the the length and curvature of the hoses make is very difficult to thread into the spark plug holes. The hoses become curved after sitting in their packaging. Even if held straight they are often too long so you need to bend them while threading which complicates the threading.

Has anyone located a suitable extension to use? What I'm looking for is something long enough (say 6") to clear the engine tin (front and rear) with the correct thread size (M14x1.25) and hex shape so I can get a wrench around it to snug it down. What would be ideal is M14x1.25 on one end and 1/4"-NPT female on the other so I could fit an air hose coupler fitting.

There must be such an adapter used on even harder to access vehicles...
