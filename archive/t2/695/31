Subject: Re: [T2] Rotary fuel pump for carbs

I bought a rebuildable Carter. It cost me closer to $90 locally and took
some digging in the paper books at the counter to spec out. All the
paperwork is in the bus. I'll get it and post a part number and the specs
later. I'm stuck in the office until midnight.

If I have the digicam in the truck I'll snap a couple of pics also.

the type you link to is what I was originally looking for. The one that was
sitting in the Rivi when I bought it was trashed. They use rubber vanes and
if they sit with old fuel in them they sieze. I tried to cross the numbers
on it at a couple of places and never could. Was going to have to contact
carter directly so I just tossed it and went searching at the FLAPS with
nothing but specs in hand.

I still want to add an external regulator but I haven't found a local shop
with a Holley Red in stock so I'll probably have to order that. Everyone
has the crappy NAPA disk style adjustable regulators like the one I just
removed because it was leaking like a sieve.
