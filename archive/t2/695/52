Subject: Re: [T2] Too many questions?

	As another long time listie I would be very sorry to see us lose 
Mark's detail driven and thoughtful descriptions of his trials and 
tribulations.  Its critical to the expansion of everyones knowledge to 
ask questions and muse on the work at hand, our busses. If everyone sat 
quiet, asked no questions and communicated none of their thoughts, we 
would live in a dim, dark world.

	I often reside at the other end of the spectrum from Mark, losing 
patience and end up doing a job 3 times over before getting it right. I 
find great value in Mark's posts as they on occasion force a rethink on 
my behalf before I button everything down. Those of us who sink into 
despair at our bus troubles are picked back up by the knowledge of 
others and their meticulous approach (Don chime in here;) ).

	While I may not have FI in any of my vehicles and I don't have 
anything with hydraulic lifters I still aim to learn all that I can to 
help a stranded bus brother or sister who does, listening to the 
experiences of others is the perfect way. Don't start zapping post you 
don't think are topical to you, you never know what you might need to 
know later.

	The type2 list has the fortune to be made up of some unique and 
wonderful characters who share their thoughts and passion for these 
vehicles, that some of us may not agree with, but can certainly gain 
something from. The beauty of this list if the amount of knowledge, 
thought and care that flows from its subscribers keyboards, sharing 
their love of vw's ... of course with the occasional scrap of effluent.

Well, sorry for the wasted bandwidth.
Steve
