Dear Volks!

Never too many questions.  And when we signed up for Type 2 we were duly 
warned it is an active site.  Today was my first day out after my 
surgery and guess which vehicle I drove?  And I smiled all the way.  If 
I had not asked "too many questions"  Leisl would still be in the 
driveway or worse.  Don't change a thing.  Mr. Hennessey, I suggest you 
try Digest format or check the list out through the website archives by 
topic of the in-box is too full.  We like Type 2 just the way it is.  So 
hang aournd and get to know us.  You might find you've misjudged a fine 
group of people who drive the world's most unique vehicles.

Peace,


BEN
