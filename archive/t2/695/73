Additionally, you will run into this problem: If there is not enough fuel in 
the carb bowl to start your car, you may never get enough in there unless 
the starter is putting out enough oil pressure to start the fuel pump. If 
the engine is warm, that may not happen. You could crank forever and not get 
enough to start the engine. 

Additionally, you may need a diode for the oil pressure warning light to 
prevent it from running the light at 1/2 bright because of the voltage drop 
across the relay.
