Gerald,

Consider this long and hard before you do it.  While the instinctive
reaction should indeed be to kill the engine the minute that light comes
on, given the choice of "your engine or your life" the choice should
always come down on the life side. In rare instances, you may choose to
sacrifice the engine rather than die in an accident.  I'd recommend
leaving that option open.

OOK!
