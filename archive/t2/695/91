Subject: Hazet T-Handle Wrenches

     A good friend of mine has a set of T-Handle wrenches made by Hazet.  
They are really well made and tough, and they are particularly useful on the 
VWs.  They don't do anything that you can't do without them, but they do 
allot of things faster and easier than you can with your normal wrenches and 
sockets (tranny nose cones, dizzy clamp, etc, etc).
     I was envious of his set and went digging around for them.  They are 
kind of hard to find, but I actually found a place right down the road from 
me that sells them!  The place is called Maryland Metrics.  They also have 
just about everything else metric you can imagine.  Here is a link:
http://mdmetric.com

Here is the Hazet tools catalog from their site:
http://mdmetric.com/prod/hazet/hazethdr2.htm

Click on "Sockets and Socket Sets Manual Operation" and then on "With 
T-Handle"
The 428 is the normal length, and the 428 LG is longer in length.

Here are their prices and part numbers for the LG's (which is what I 
ordered):
13.04	428 Lg-5.5
13.99	428 Lg-8
14.60	428 Lg-9
15.50	428 Lg-10
15.90	428 Lg-11
17.41	428 Lg-12
19.66	428 Lg-13
20.81	428 Lg-14

     I only ordered some of the most common VW sizes: 8, 10, 11, & 13.  
Don't expect these quickly.  Some of the sizes are stockpiled here in the 
US, but some of them have to come from Germany.  Of course, one of mine was 
not in the US so I won't see my set of four for over a month, but I can't 
wait!  They have all kinds of neat Hazet tools, as well as other metric tool 
brands.
     Anyway, I am pretty cheap and I find it worth shelling out around $70 
for, so I thought somebody else might be interested as well.  No, I'm not 
affiliated with either company :-))
