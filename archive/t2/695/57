Subject: Re: [T2] Oil pressure WAAAAAAY too high

Hello Fraank  How ya doing ole buddy  Check both of the pressure relief 
valves , sounds like one is sticking . If they are reversed the oil pressure will 
be way too high  Ask Waldo he put them in backwards on a motor and the pressure 
was over 100psi . I had a motor brought in the other day that had no oil 
pressure and it turned out that the relief valve at the crank pulley had been  
left out.    Remember the short spring goes at the flywheel end  and the cup end 
of the plunger goes down later and have fun  Your friend in DIXIE   Mark
