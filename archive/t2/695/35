OK, the fittings are NPT so they really should only need a "filler" to
seal properly, right? I shouldn't need an actual "sealing" compound like
permatex? (Yes, that's a question)

They're brass fittings and I have some copper based anti-sieze (high-temp
-- not needed for this but what the heck). The metals, from most noble to
least noble are: 

Gold, Platinum, Carbon/Graphite, Titanium, Silver, Chrome, Inconel, Nickel,
Monel, Bronze, Copper, Brass, Tin, Lead, Cast Iron, Steel, Iron, Cadmium,
Aluminum, Zinc,  Magnesium

(Darn, I guess the gold and platinum trim for the old magnesium bug motor
is out of the question!) ;-)

Copper and brass are right next to each other so using the copper based
anti-sieze on the brass fittings should be safe from inviting "dissimilar
metal" pitting, right?
