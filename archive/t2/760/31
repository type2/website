Speaking of USPS and low cost methods of shipping, I noticed that USPS has introduced a service called Priority Mail flat rate. You can ship up to 70 lbs for $7.70 which seems like a great way to get small but heavy bus parts over to the west coast quickly and inexpensively.

I would much prefer this service to UPS Ground. How about it Ron?

The Priority Mail Flat-Rate boxes are available in two shapes:

11-7/8 inches x 3-3/8 inches x 13-5/8 inches
11 inches x 8-1/2 inches x 5-1/2 inches.
