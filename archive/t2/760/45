Dave,
Where do you live? What are the smog laws there? Anything new in the 
works you might have to deal with later?

You'd never get away with it in California unless it's older than '76, I 
think. You can't even legally change the distributor here. They change 
the rules all the time. I bought a couple of '79's thinking the rolling 
exemption that _was_ the law, anticipating they would be exempt by the 
time I got done redoing them. Now they'll never be exempt, and Arnie 
wants to do away with gasoline cars in Cali all together! Guess I'll be 
moving back to Texas after all....
