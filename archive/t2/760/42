Arnaud--sorry to lead you astray. . . sounds like the 205Q vacuum can is 
not the one we want.  more vac advance required for that scenario.   I 
guess for that particular dizzy you need retard to get the range you 
need.  If it were me I would just find that sweet spot without ping.  
actually I am about ready to buy a new ACN one with pertronix to make 
life easier. points never want to stay still for me.

make sure you're not giving it too much idle mix either that can bog you 
down, did that myself last weekend.

good luck and sorry again.
Will
