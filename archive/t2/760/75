I think it's because that particular conversion fits into the vanagon body, and doesn't fit well enough into the bay that they sell them for that, so they didn't go through the hoops to get it approved for that application.

Seems odd to me. It must have something to do with the body style. Or 
perhaps they are just ignorant and think that the 80-83ishs are water cooled 
like the laters.Hmmmm any thoughts.
