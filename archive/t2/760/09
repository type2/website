Subject: re: [T2] messed up brakes when fixing idle?

Anthony,

don't worry about separating your MC from the booster just yet. from your
description of things, it sounds like your entire brake system could use some
maintenence.

take the entire booster assembly off the bus, with the MC attached. i believe
there is a place in TX that rebuilds them. 'H&R Booster' or something like
that. search the archives for their address/phone number.

while it is off the bus & being repaired, go ahead & inspect the entire
brake system. especially check the rubber flexi-hoses. they are not very
expensive or hard to replace.

good luck,
