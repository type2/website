    Hate to be a fiscal conservative, but...If you put anything other than
a VW engine in a Bus, you're gonna be owning it forever. Even if you
do or have someone do all the mods and it looks and runs fine, a po-
tential buyer won't be familiar with them...(Even if you document all
the mods)...Most mechanics won't touch it, so maintenance will be the
responsibility of the new owner and those kinds of buyers would be
hard to find... ;-(
