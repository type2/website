"Most mechanics won't touch it"

Mechanics work on old VW's?? I thought all the work had to be done by yourself
anyway? Maybe it is different in other parts of the country :) We have one
person in a neighboring county that works on buses, but he restores then and
only wrenches on them in his spare time..... Which he has none of.

But I agree, selling it is going to be hard. Never thought about getting rid
of my bus, actually trying to figure out how to get them to bury me in it :)
