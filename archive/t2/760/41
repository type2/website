Hi Will,
I took your advice and tried to disconnect the vacuum retard, plug the
port on manifold and time dynamically at 5deg BTDC (and 8 BTDC on the
next ride). Warmed the beast and went for my test-hill-drive. I was
not impressed, neither by the power, nor by the "flat spot".

The dizzy is a stock for a 71 bus (205Q) . According to Oldvolkshome
it has minus 11-13 degrees of vacuum retard and plus 2-5 degrees of
vacuum advance. The total range of advance/retard is about 13 to 18
degrees.

I think that by not using the vacuum retard the range of the
advance/retard is reduced from about 13-18 degrees to about 2-5
degrees. I verified the very little range of the vacuum advance by
sucking in the vacuum advance hose, with the vacuum retard port open
in the air. It barely gave 2 degrees of extra advance off idle.

That mod makes the stock dizzy behave more like a 009 than a real
vacuum advance dizzy. I come from 009 land and want to avoid returning
there.

John C. Wondering what is the vacuum advance range of the ACN SVDA ?
