Subject: VW Themed Chopper bike FS

I apologize for this marginal content, but there are
several actual VW Bus parts on this bike, so thats bus
content ;^) Anyway, I am selling my hand-built VW
Bus-themed vintage-looking chopper bike (that's
bicycle, NOT motorcycle!) This is the bike you need
for tooling around at the next VW show or VW bus
campout, here's the link:

As always, I am open to VW air-cooled trades!

Peace, John Baker
