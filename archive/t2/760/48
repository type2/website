JD,

Here is what I would do.

Wire brush it, paint it with por-15.  Let sit for 24 hours.

Put masking tape over the holes from the bottom side.

Lay 2 layers of fiberglass over the inside.  Since it is a horizontal
surface, you can make the fiberglass look very nice.

Let cure for several hours...remove duct tape.

Total cost including all the por-15 you have left over and the fiberglass 
you have left over....maybe $50.  

Do *not* use the "mat" fiberglass, but the finely woven stuff that looks 
like "cloth".

Once done on the top, wirebrush the bottom and paint it with por-15.

Your "patch" will still be there ***long*** after the rest of the bus is 
gone<grin>.

If you haven't ever done fiberglass before, it is extremely easy.  
Practice a little first...and read the mixing directions!

Oh, and don't forget to buy a couple of 2" 50 cent throwaway brushes.
Do *not* mix fiberglass in styrofoam or anything with wax in it...my 
favorite are  the plastic margarine tubs.

Cheers, dave
