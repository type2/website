The camper itself has no earth ground, except what is provided by the 
three-prong receptacle in the wall.  The ground of the outlets inside 
your van should ground well to the body.  Thus if an appliance shorts 
hot to ground (or metal case), there is a path to trip the breaker or 
GFI.  Polarized plugs insure that the neutral side is also the ground 
side.  I have a GFI that is not a cord, just a little box with male and 
female ends, that acts as a GFI go between. I believe West Marine  had it.
