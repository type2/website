Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Overheating / to those who use Gene Berg,

The alternator belt also takes more load before it slips, which is why VW
change the belts with the alternator/doghouse combo. The gen belt slips much
sooner then most would care to know about, and this results in hotter
running temps with a gen belt instead of an alternator belt. IMO, if you
have a doghouse fan OR an alternator, you need an alternator belt.

You also need an alternator belt (shorter) if you have a non-stock pulley.
This includes "stock sized" aluminum pulleys, which are smaller (and more
slippery) then the stock steel pulley.

Folks would be surprised if they saw how much belt slippage they had, and
how much the fan/crank ratio can change with different belt sizes. I'm in
the midst of writing an article on this subject right now.
