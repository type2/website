Hi Karl,

It used to be mentioned on their website. I originally found out about it
directly from them. I remember it took them several years to get the
approval.

Hi Richard,
     
    We now have approval for California and are taking orders for the engine
conversion. Delivery will be about 6 weeks for now as initial demand is very
high. Please contact me if you have a more urgent need and it may be
possible to sort something out sooner. Thank you for you interest.
  
Kind Regards,
 
Peter Broemmelsiek
