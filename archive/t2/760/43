What breaker, Mike?  I'm a ham operator with some
electrical knowlege and have been intending to figure
out the circuitry (wrong word) of the bus. I know I
need a GFI.  And I definitely need to get the relay
and a second battery.  But I wouldn't just use it for
the refigerator.  I've got lots of other plans for
that.  I don't know if my refirigerator even works.  I
didn't think it did, but somebody said you have to
leave it turned on overnight to even tell.  I haven't
tried that yet.  I was surprised to find that I had a
full tank of propane and the stove works fine!  So
maybe I'll get lucky.  Pitifull little refrigerator it
is.  Icebox would definitely be the wrong word.  What
do you use it for?  Cheers...KR
