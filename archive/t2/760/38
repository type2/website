The switch supplies power for both high and low beam so it must be ok. It 
could be the headlight relay. Get yourself a multimeter or one of those 
continuity testers (like a screwdriver with a light in the handle) and 
trace the system to work out where power stops getting through. Don't worry 
you wont zap yourself.
