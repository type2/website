Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Overheating / to those who use Gene Berg,

Vac advance can be up to 15 degrees, depending on the engine, carbs, and
elevation.

It's amazing the # of guys I tell to change the belt to help cool the
engine, and they give me gasps of disbelief. All the "experts" have chased
around for months on other "problems" and seemingly overlook the obvious.

PS: Busses should also use an Alt belt, they are already on the ragged edge
of keeping cool, better safe then sorry. I use alt belts on everything, they
are cheap insurance to keep the engine cool.
