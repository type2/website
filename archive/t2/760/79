I was once out of official lighter fluid for the grill so I substituted
some 87 octane.  I survived the resulting fireball with most of my arm
hair intact.

A quick Google gives the lower explosive limit for gasoline at about
1.4% by volume and the upper explosive limit at about 7.6%.  The ideal
fuel/air mixture for an engine is somewhere around 1:14 (by mass) or
about 7.1%.
