Subject: re: Leaky valve covers

Hi Ian,

I used silicon sealer on the cover side of the gasket for a year or so. It worked great at stopping the leak but was a real PITA to clean off when changing gaskets. I am currently using Permatex Hylomar HPF on the cover side of the gasket as suggested by others on the list. It stops the leak and is easy to clean up when changing gaskets.

What do you guys do about a leaky valve cover?  My 3,4 valve cover is
leaking quite badly after scraping the old one out and installing a
new one.  Should I use silicone gasket?  Should I use glue?  Should I
put two gaskets in there?
