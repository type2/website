In a 14" size, our Hankook 185R14's will handle just under a ton per tire
(1874 lbs; 2000 lbs is a ton). It also happens to be an excellent tire, very
highly rated in the German press.  I have used it personally for years and
recommend it highly. Availability has been a problem, as Hankook can't keep
up with demand, but I just got 60 in today and have about 4 sets left after
filling backorders. Hankook also haa a 195R14 version that handles 2094 lbs
per tire, although at the moment they are on backorder.
