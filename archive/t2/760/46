I have heard, and believe, the above things, and if somebody comes along
with a cig when you've just poured the gasoline on the driveway, it's
probably fine.  The problem is that the point of the exercise is to
evaporate the gasoline into the air, which is sort of the same thing
that a carburetor is doing.  After a bit you will have a nice cloud of
air laden with gasoline vapor over your driveway, and having someone
walk along with a cig at that point could get very interesting.
