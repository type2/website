I do keep my gas jugs outside - next to the (brick) house, but at least
not in the garage.

I don't think that would be a problem.  The main problem is probably
expansion and pressure buildup inside the container.  Most gas jugs are
actually bigger than they are marked to allow for expansion of the fuel.
On hot days, I have seen square plastic gas jugs doing a credible
impression of a sphere due to internal pressure.
