Subject: Re: [T2] 120 connection question

The fridge is long gone (it adds heat in summer) as we put in a triple 
seat bed where the double was.  See 
http://www/geocities.com/mike_benthin for what is there now.  We use 
either a portable cooler or a 12 volt Coleman fridge for long trips.

Re breaker; the stock wall outlet under the seatbed has a built in 
breaker (15 amp curcuit), but it is not GFI.  The GFI breaker is a 
separate deal you can buy that plugs into a standard 3-prong outlet and 
should have good contact to the ground plug (which BTW, also connects to 
the neutral white wire in breaker boxes of a house).  I've seen rare 
campgrounds where there is no ground plug and these should be checked 
that the NARROW side of the polarized socket is hot, and fixtures that 
use nonpolarized plugs, if light bulbs, should have the center contact 
of the light be the hot one (check its continuity to which prong and 
mark it HOT side).
