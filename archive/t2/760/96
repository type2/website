Harbor Freight has a 12 volt solar charger setup that is $249.  It is
constantly in their magazines that is mailed to me, but, I just tried to
find it online and was not successful, hopefully someone else will give
the part number.

It uses 3 -15 wat cells and it has stands.  It also has a charge
controller and what appears to be some compact flourescent bulbs fixtures.
 The material didn't say what those were for, but I suspect they are used
to "bleed" off electricity if it isn't being consumed/stored fast enough.

I plan on getting this setup for my bus.

I currently use a 5 watt panel from harbor freight with battery clips on
it.  I am not sure what the amp rating is, but it worked mostly ok at
Natural Bus this past year.  I hung ot on the side of my van and moved it
as the sun moved around.

Regards,

Mark
