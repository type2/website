Subject: Re: [T2] messed up brakes when fixing idle?

I experienced a similar problem. When I bought my bus, there was a type 1 
engine in it. The PO replaced the type 2 and so had to disconnect the brake 
booster.

I replaced the type 1 with a type 2 and reconnected the brake booster, only to 
discover that as I drove, my brakes would gradually begin to apply. Also I 
began to notice that suddenly my brake fluid began to disappear as well.

I discovered the brake fluid was (it seems) being sucked into the brake 
booster. I sucked the brake fluid out of the booster and disconnected and 
capped off the vacuum line and now all is well again (braking is a little 
harder now ;)

Also my fuel economy has greatly improved and my bus doesn't run as rich 
anymore.
