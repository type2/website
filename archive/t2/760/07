Subject: Want to buy a bus in Boise, ID area.

 I'm looking to get a 68 or 69 camper style, with a pop-top if possible in
the boise area. I've seen some trick ones as old as '63. I want an older
style, up to '71, HAS to be camper-style though. Do you know where I should
go, who I should call in the area, who to talk to? I'm getting some serious
cash, so I'm making a Huge Dream come true, getting my bus, trickin it out,
and hitting the road, so it has to be very road worthy. I know a good
mechanic shop in the area. I was hoping you could help me in the bus hunt.
Thanks...
