How do you know this?    :-)
In my estimation,, they can not be too tight,, as they will be set at .006 "  on
the base circle..... but,, they may not be .006" at the "ignition" timing
mark...
all this means is the "valve" timing is a tiny bit advanced... in relation to
the ignition timing ,, but the clearance is still .006" ....... correct?
