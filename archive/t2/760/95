Subject: Re: [T2] sliding door roller

Hi Rob,

In my "rust-belt" Ontario experience, it isn't usually the roller  
that's the problem, it's the corrosion of the track under it.

Clean out and degrease the lower track as thoroughly as possible. If  
there are any pits or low spots they will need to be repaired. I have  
seen good results filling smaller pits with JB-weld epoxy. Then  
repaint the area and regrease before putting the door back on.

In a dryer, less salt-encrusted environment it might be possible that  
the roller could be the problem, but in my experience it's always  
been the track at fault. YMMV.

Happy trails,
