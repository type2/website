Thank you, Thank you, Thank you ....Now I am half way there to being a happy 
Koni owner.  I got a pair from Tim at Classic Garage, now all I need is a set 
of rears and I'm a very happy camper.  BTW, I saw that the rear set is for the 
'72 to '79, and my bus is a '71...will the rears work on a '71 bus ?
