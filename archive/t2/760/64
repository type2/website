Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Overheating / to those who use Gene Berg,

To back John's claim up: I now have ~500 miles on the alternator belt
and the sides look  flat black, like they were on the new belt. Tells
me it does not slip.

Both generator belts I tried got the shiny sides rather quickly even
though they were tight.

John, could you tell us the range of the vacuum advance on the SVDA
you sell ?  Maybe it is top secret :-)
