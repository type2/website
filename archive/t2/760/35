Gary,  I don't have the most recent CSA Canadian Electrical code book on hand,,
but C.E.C 18th ed. C22.1-98 /70-126(1) reads:
Grounding and bonding, All major exposed metal parts that may become energized,
including the water, gas, and waste plumbing, the roof and outer metal covering,
the chassis, and metal circulating ducts, SHALL be in good electrical contact
with one another and with the termination of the grounding conductor of the
supply circuit at the disconnecting means for the purpose of grounding and
bonding.

Interpertation,
This is the MAIN reason for grounding ... to ensure ALL the conductive parts of
the vehicle are kept at the same potential as the earth ,,, and to ensure the
operation of the <fuse> protection ,,, with out the ground circuit, when a fault
happens, the current can travel thru any conductive item that may be in the
circuit..  >YOU< if you happen to touch the door handle and are standing in wet
grass in your sandals....  or in the rare circumstances,, it "could" conduct
thru the tires,, and they can catch fire...   this is a situation that has
occured ,, but the fault current was caused on a higher voltage than 120v.

If a ground wire is present and working,, when a fault occurs, the current has a
low impedance path thru the fuse, the fault, and back to ground,,, so the fuse
will operate quickly and diminish the amount of energy allowed to pass.
If there is a poor path to ground,, quite likely the fuse will not operate.

This is why *I* recommend a GFCi as the feeder to your camper,, and a 3 light
tester plugged in to alert you to voltage present, and in good working order.

Dave gave out some really great words on the GFI ,,, but if it is a GFI,, and it
trips... NEVER plug the [ apparently offending ] appliance in "somewhere else"
always try that gfi receptacle with a known good device that is simple,, like a
night light,, or a table lamp
---Trust the Gfi...--- consider it telling you that what ever you plugged in was
defective

If the device you plugged in was allowing current to pass through your body,,
which
tripped the gfi,, then plugging it in elsewhere will allow current to pass
through
your body without protection and possible kill you

Back to the real question,, the reset button is the circuit breaker in a '71
[later models had a toggle type handle, earlier ones have a push button reset
breaker]
So, If you don't have power, I suspect that you have to take things apart and
look for a loose or broken wire
First check the extension cord is plugged in at both, the house and the camper.
"Is it plugged in Sir?"  Plug a test light into the extension cord to prove it
*IS* working,, then plug in the camper again,  still no power at the receptacle?
UNPLUG  the cord, and start looking for that loose or broken wire in the camper



Back to the safety sermon about GFCi's [GFi's]
I have seen too many campsites that have the receptacles wired backwards,, or
the camper is wired incorrectly,, and it ends up giving the people a "tingle"
One case I measured 120 volts from the door of the camper to the ground ... or
in other words, from the little girls hand to her feet,, follow that path, it
passes through her heart!
I unplugged the camper, looked where the owner had "repaired" the cord, and
found the wires connected reversed polarity, and the ground wire not connected.

Please... Please, if you ever feel a tingle, unplug the camper right away, and
find out how to solve the problem without hurting yourself

I Carry a simple device with me,
http://www.testersandmeters_dot_com/IDEAL-ez/products.nsf/ItemMasterLookup/p61-035?OpenDocument
always plugged into the receptacle, that has 3
small neon lights, It will tell me if I have any faults. the faults are
described on the side of the unit.
 In fact, simply,It tells me if I have power.
The first thing I check when I plug in is the "tester",,, Yup! Got power, then I
flip the fridge to AC....

If you want to go one step further, buy a GFi cord, It is a very short cord that
you plug into the power post, then plug your extension cord into that.
If a fault ever develops, it will trip, saving you!

I think I will heed my own wisdom. And buy a GFi cord.
It is a requirement of construction workers in Ontario to use a gfi protected
outlet,, here is an example of a portable one you can carry in the Camper..
available at most Home Depot type stores etc
