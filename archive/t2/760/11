Check out roadcow.com. He has some good info. I think this bus is still
around. Check the archives, you might be able to find the current owner. I
have talked to him once, but it has been many years. The radiator is probably
the hardest problem to overcome. The Turbo is probably not the way to go.
Their are other ways to make you bus go fast, check out Jake Raby's website if
you just want it to go fast.......
