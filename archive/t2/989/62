Subject: westy project continues

I hit a major milestone on the green westy project today.  After 
replacing the fuel pump the engine fired for the first time since it was 
removed from the donor bus.  It was a major success.  A month ago I 
wasn't questioning if I could do this or not.  So now she fires, and the 
todo list is growing shorter.

replace the 4 rubber brake hoses which i have on hand
bleed brakes
inspect and if needed replace pads and shoes
put the last half axle back on.  CVs are all cleaned.
install front seats
install steering box and drag link
new tires and an alignment
go camping

I don't have any of the hardware to mount the steering box to the frame. 
  Does anyone know the size of the 4 bolts in question?

TIA,

dan
