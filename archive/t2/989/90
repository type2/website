What is the low voltage problem?
Are you experiencing start/running difficulty?
Are you reading voltage with accessories
(anything other than ignition) engaged?
What is the voltage at the battery after overnight rest?
Fully charged batteries will display your indicated charge rate.
Try turning on headlights and other accessories.
Does it charge at 14v now?
