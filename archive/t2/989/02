Well, they're going to total my bus because of the relatively minor front-end damage.  Anybody remember the link to sites that have blue book values for old vehicles?  I Googled and didn't find it. He said I could buy it back.  Looks like I'm going to get the drive shaft up the exhaust treatment.  Thanks...KR
