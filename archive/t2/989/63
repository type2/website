Eddie,

I don't know how much you know about wire-feed welders...so this is just my
opinion.

You are right, flux-core welders are really difficult to use in most
situations.

I have a Miller Pulser MIG dual process welder and a Lincoln 185 TIG. Both
are superb machines and I recommend both brands. I have been using welders
for years and a Dual voltage welder is going to get you the best results.
This will allow you to re-wire between 110v and 220v. 110v for the field and
220v for the shop. The best gas to use is Silver Shield AR/CO2 which is a
less expensive mix that works extremely well for mild steel. Straight argon
is typically used for TIG welding aluminum and mild steel.

As for your question, the Lincoln 175 HD has a good track record for simple
shop repairs as does the Millermatic Passport. Too high of a duty cycle will
blow breakers but gives better weld quality.

Obviously the best welders for sheet metal are TIG welders, but TIG is
neither quick or efficient. A possible solution is using a MIG welder with a
TIG spoolgun attachment. It does sheetmetal much better than a straight MIG,
but that is a different subject all together

Good luck!

Jon Stiles

I am in the market for a new welder. I learned to weld on some of the best
industrial MIG and TIG machines out there. I have owned a craftsman
flux-cored welder for home projects, mostly on my '74 bus. It was given to
me. It is good at what it does, but flux core welding just plain out sucks.

I have a major restoration project staring, a '62 bus. I am looking for a
portable 110v Gas shielded mig welder(wire feed). I want to run an argon mix
(probably a C20).

I am looking for a unit in the $500 range. The models I am looking at are
Lincoln Weldpak 100HD ($369 + $69 for the gas kit).
Lincoln Pro 140C ($499)
Lincoln 175 HD ($699)

does anyone have any experience with these models?

The majority of my work is going to be on VW body panels and some *cough*
older GM cars.
I have limited experience with the consumer market welders. I am looking for
clean consistent welds on sheet metal. I know you get what you pay for so
I'm assuming the 100HD is not the best unit for me.

Any advice?
thanks
Eddie Goodwin
