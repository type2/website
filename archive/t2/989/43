i have not used the bus-boys tool. it looks very well designed and  
made. i made a similar tool for doing this job in our shop. after  
removing a set of bushings once "by hand" i decided never again and  
made the tool. i can't imaging getting the bushings in and out  
without some kind of tooling, and it needs to be pretty robust to be  
up to the job. the biggest problem doing the bushings with a hammer  
and drift of some sort, is that unless you are on a hoist, there is  
no room to get a good swing on the hammer. the best drift is the old  
pin with the head almost completely ground off , so that the OD of  
the step on the drift is just a fraction smaller than the OD of the  
bushing. this you can beat on with another smaller drift and they  
should come out, eventually. yes, the bushings are tight and you have  
to move one of them quite a distance, part of the distance it is also  
pulling the other bushing - twice as much friction.
