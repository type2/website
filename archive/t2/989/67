<<Obviously the best welders for sheet metal are TIG welders,>>

Not really Jon.

The Tig weld is much harder than the Mig, and a bitch to grind clean
without warping the metal in the process.

A light tack with a Tig is good--then finish with a mig stitch weld for
a no distortion welded surface, that's easy to clean up.
