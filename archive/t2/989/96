No. I didn't get all the way through the bushing with the saw. I didn't want
to score the bore, so I stopped when it appeared I was through, and then I
wnet to work with the hammer and screw driver.

There was maybe 1 mark in the bore, but with the way the new bushings fit, I
am pretty sure it will not be an issue.

I am just happy the damn things are out.

Next time, I think I might try a sawsall with a fine blade.
