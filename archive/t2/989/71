Hi Glenn,

A very quick number-crunching tells me that one motor per rear wheel  
gets you 20HP total power available. I don't think that will be  
sufficient to move a 3,000lb vehicle with a relatively high  
coefficient of drag at typical commuting velocity. But I could be  
wrong; maybe there's someone else here with more knowledge about  
electric motors.

FWIW, there is an electric VW Bus on eBay right now that has a motor  
rated at 23HP, and it has a rated top speed of 48MPH. See item  
#320137127199 for additional specs.
.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
