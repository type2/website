<< but I've twice wished to date that I'd paid the bit extra for the
next model up.>>

Most of the time this is the case.
You buy what you think is going to be the cat's meow, and you'd wish you
had bought some more horse power.

<<Also, if you can wait for/catch the Miller roadshow at a local dealer
during the summer, the pricing when I purchased my unit (2004) was
better than I could find online via auction sites or otherwise.>>

Bingo---

I picked up my tig welder at the Miller road show at my local welding /
paint supply store--I saved almost $500.00 from the normal retail price.

Auctions are an excellent place to pick up on any kind of welding
equipment.

Trucking outfit's, excavating outfits, Farms, manufacturing places of
business have going out of business auctions all over , most every
weekend, and you can but a dandy set of torches---tanks and all- plus
AC-DC buzz boxes, Mig, Tig, Plasma cutting equipment at a large savings.

If your looking for some nice stuff, there's all kinds of ways to get it
very resonable, besides buying low end consumer intended equipment.

And be awfully happy you did.

Check out the welding supply places od business--they usually take trade
in's on new stuff-- recondition the welder, and give you an almost same
as new warrantee for pennies on the buck.

Open eyes, do some snifiing, and ask some questions.
There's all kinds of high dollar stuff out there for short money.
