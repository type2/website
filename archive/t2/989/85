Subject: Re: [T2] Electric conversion -- resources?

There's actually a lot of information out there. I
can't seem to locate my big list of EV links, but
Google will certainly help you along.Many, many VW
conversions and quite a few bus and vanagon. Some of
the lighter vehicles have tire burning torque, speeds
over 80 and ranges up over 100 miles; some over 200
miles with good drivability. Not an inexpensive
plaything though - easily a $10,000 expenditure doing
it right!  My buddy is converting a Jeep for about a 5
mile drive to/from work. Work has charge stations for
EV's that don't yet exist - he will likely be first.
Yes, it's a govmt job, so we the taxpayers will be
paying for his "gas"! Not a bad deal. The bus could
work out for short trips as you will use it for.
This link may get you on to other links. There is
something like AustinEV - try to find that and you'll
get a lot of info. -BaH

 Any volts-wagen enthusiasts??  I've got a pretty
 nice 1969 Bay that would be 
 used mostly for short commutes, maybe 7 or 8 easy
 miles each way.  Saw some 
 surplus 10 hp DC motors, very reasonably priced, and
 thought with fifteen 12 V 
 car batteries, which would fit easily in the cargo
 area, I might have a plan... 
 except of course for the CONTROL SYSTEM.  I'm going
 to work out some rough 
 numbers to see if this makes sense.... meantime
 would like to hear from anyone 
 who could point me to articles, references, sources,
 etc.
 
 Thanks, and have a great day!
