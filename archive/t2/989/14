Subject: lincoln welder comparison.

I am in the market for a new welder. I learned to weld on some of the best
industrial MIG and TIG machines out there. I have owned a craftsman
flux-cored welder for home projects, mostly on my '74 bus. It was given to
me. It is good at what it does, but flux core welding just plain out sucks.

I have a major restoration project staring, a '62 bus. I am looking for a
portable 110v Gas shielded mig welder(wire feed). I want to run an argon mix
(probably a C20).

I am looking for a unit in the $500 range. The models I am looking at are
Lincoln Weldpak 100HD ($369 + $69 for the gas kit).
Lincoln Pro 140C ($499)
Lincoln 175 HD ($699)

does anyone have any experience with these models?

The majority of my work is going to be on VW body panels and some *cough*
older GM cars.
I have limited experience with the consumer market welders. I am looking for
clean consistent welds on sheet metal. I know you get what you pay for so
I'm assuming the 100HD is not the best unit for me.

Any advice?
thanks
Eddie Goodwin
