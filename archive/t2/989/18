You checked lots of things, and that's great....but I didn't read that you 
checked and replaced the flexible fuel lines on your newly-acquired bus. In 
fact, you didn't say anything about the fuel system.

Whether or not you get it running, you don't want to have it catch fire and 
burn to a cinder. Too many buses have done that.

Leaking fuel lines are pretty common on old buses, and everybody (including 
rookies) needs to be aware of the age and condition of their flexible fuel 
lines, so they can replace them before they start leaking.

Tell me yours are OK.....and be sure you also have a good fire extinguisher 
near by when you try to start your bus, regardless of the condition of the 
fuel lines.
