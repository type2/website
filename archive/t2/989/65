Subject: Jerome Jamboree  AridZona

Our signature event, the Jerome Jamboree is held each September in Jerome,
Arizona where we raffle off a restored split window bus, donate the proceeds
to charity and start all over again. 

The 2007 bus is a 1963 Standard donated by Billy Donnelly out of Silver
City, NM. We're hoping to restore it and install a camper kit. Dates for
this year's event are September 14, 15 and 16 2007. First-time Jeromers are
encouraged to come to a meeting to get a better feel for the Jamboree; we
want you to have fun and come back every year!

University and Hardy in the "Strip Mall' ? got to luv that. Lots of cool
raffle prizes, Please bring something Please. third Wednesday of the month
