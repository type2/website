<< it's biggest problem is that it has a low duty cycle, and it will
shut down itself if you work it too hard.>>

A decent Mig set up should have at least 60-80% duty cycle.

Without at least this your stuck in the everglades with no 4 wheel drive
& 4 bald tires spinning your wheels.

It no good for much more than 16 ga. sheet metal,and that'll be for
not much more than stitch or spot welding.

<< the quality of the weld is much more the skill of the weldor than
anything else.>>

Huh--

A Weldor.
I learned a new word.

You can give a guy with 50 years experience one of the 110v Lowe's, Home
Depot  consumer low duty cycle welder's and he'll lay beads that  looks
like pigeon droppings on a bridge beam .

Weldor--

Isn't that a new found planet in another galaxy ?
