Subject: re bad coil?

HI, I finally figured out what went wrong when I put in a new coil! 
Don't know why but the points had melted half away. Put in a new set and 
the tack is rock steady again. Don't know how it affected it or 
anything, just works again so I don't have to worry, on the quickly 
coming up road trip. Thanks to all that replied.
Bernie
