I have the weldpak 100 with a gas hookup (25%argon)
it is an adequate consumer level welder..  it's biggest problem is that it
has a low duty cycle, and it will shut down itself if you work it too
hard. but the quality and ability to produce is more than coompetent to do
everything I have asked it to do.  the quality of the weld is much more
the skill of the weldor  than anything else.
