Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for a voltage regulator in Oregon - 0 192 062

Call Larry at:

Import Parts Center
2295 N Pacific Hwy
Medford, OR 97501
(541) 773-4240

I'm not saying he has it in stock, but can probably get it quick.  Tell him
Jim from VWG sent ya (and tell him I have not forgotten about the Ghia sheet
metal he wants either).

0192 062 007 = Bosch Short Number 30 048

The original Bosch Long Number is 0190 600 016.

I have used both on my 72 411 wagon - they use the same connector and in
most cases, the alternators on both the 411 and Type 2 are the same.
