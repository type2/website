I built a dune buggy that way, never broke in half so i guess it worked.

I use a generator...no power at all in my garage.

and that is the reason most of us, especially those who are not into this
as an occupation cannot justify that much money.   I went to buy more gas
this week (and I only use the 80 bottle) and it had been 2 years since I
last bought gas..  so a little prudence is in order too.

my suggestion has always been "buy the best you can afford for the job
your going to do"  wasn't going into production, will only weld on MY bus
and some hobby type stuff for the house/garage.  not production type work.

big or important jobs I hire someone to do....I'm a better grinder than
weldor....

 Now my eyes are more important and spent almost as  much for mask as I
did for welder..
