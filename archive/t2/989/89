SUCCESS!!!

I am sure that I made more work for myself than I needed to, but overall, it
was relatively quick.

I purchased a small hack saw from Home Depot - the kind that has the blade
sunken into the handle so it becomes like a hack-saw knife.

I cut both sides of the bottom bushing basically to cut it in half.

After I got cuts made, I beat the HELL out of the bushing with a flat-head
screw driver and 4lbs. sledge. Eventually, it came out.

Next I took a 21mm socket and slid it into the hole with an extension
attached to it. One again beat the HELL out of it, and the top bushing
popped right out.

Cleaned out the hole, applied grease and inserted the first bushing using
the sledge first, then the socket and sledge. Nice thing about using the
sledge is that one you get to the top, it is easy to nudge it to the right
position since it is so tight.

Once again greased the hole and applied the same method to get the lower one
in.

At this point, all I have to do is polish off getting the washers and
linkage on.

It was a bitch getting that lower bushing out, but cutting and pounding went
a lot faster than any other method I have tried.

I am sure that if someone tried this themselves knowing exactly what they
were going to do, this whole process maybe took 3 hours.
