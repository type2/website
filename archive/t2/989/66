Well boys, I tried it. The bushings did NOT budge.

I got a 24" pipe and created a tool to keep it centered on the bushing. I
slowly lowered each side to keep everything steady and with the whole weight
of the fron tend of the bus on the pipe, the bushings did not budge.

I assured that the angle of the pipe stayed perfect with the angle of the
bushing as well.

Here is a picture of the pipe in place and another of the bushing after I
decided to quit for the night.

As for the idea of renting a tool, I really cannot afford it at the moment -
hence the reason I am trying other alternatives.

Frankly, if the weight of the whole front end cannot budge this, I cannot
imagine a tool being able to do it.

What about using a drill to wear down two sides and try to cut it into 2
pieces?
