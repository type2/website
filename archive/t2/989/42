Subject: Re: lincoln welder comparison.

I have 2 Miller 130's and 1 weld pak 100, plus a 220v miller 250, all on
75/25 mix gas. Also a Craftsman stick welder. The weld pak is great for
sheet metal up to 16 gauge or so . On 18 and 20 gauge and butt welding it
does great, just the right heat on 2 or so for skip welding till you get a
solid weld. Duty cycle doesn't really affect it that way. If your running a
solid bead nonstop  it'll eat up the duty cycle fast. When that's the case I
move to the miller 130's they do better on thicker material, burn hotter it
seems even on lower heat. They can do up to 12 gauge satisfactory to me. Any
thicker that that I break out the 220 and blow the dust out of it for some
kill zone welding. I don't weld anything much on a bus with the 220 unless
for some reason all the other welders are down. The millers do frames and
the weld pak does the thin stuff. The millers will do the thin stuff as well
but it seems the weld pak is just a bit better to me. 

To sum it up the millers are long lasting and best all around. All of my
welders are over 9 years old except the weld pak and its around 7.  Even
though the weld paks are cheaper they are  still a good welder just limited
somewhat. 

That's my .02 and there are some who disagree, but to each his own. I'll not
make this a pissing contest. Later
