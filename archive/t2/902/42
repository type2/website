Bill not sure how bad your ignition was, but I was experiencing real  
problems
with having to crank the key hard over.
Decided to strip the electrical switch down after removing the switch  
from
the back of the ignition, I dismantled the electrical switch, cleaned  
all the
parts, used Petroleum Jelly to reassemble where grease had been before,
put everything back & suddenly had 'normal' starting again.  Total  
time was
about 2 hours.

Maybe that is all that is wrong with some other switches.
