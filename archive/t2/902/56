Subject: silly oil leak

Yesterday I changed my oil in the 74 westy
And I figured why not do the screen too.
I got the gaskets for it and presto.

I now have an oil leak from the screen thingee.
I dumped the oil again (saved it) and tried again.
It's still leaking from around the edge.

What am I doing wrong?
Is there some secret dance I am supposed to do
around the bus or something?

James
