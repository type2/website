Subject: Bizarre dwell? - Resolved

Swapped points. Old points were odd, as I mentioned before. No pip on the
pads, but the pads weren't aligned when I pulled the distributor. But no
difference.

New condensor and coil at the same time (limited daylight). Idle
smooooooothed out. So it was either the coil or condensor. When I get home
and have time I'll swap them one at a time and see if I can reproduce the
issue.

The coil was the old Bosch original black one. I got a new blue from
vwparts.net (Vee Dub in Huntington Beach) along with the condensor.

Interesting anecdote: This is the same shop I went to last trip that told me
coils either work or don't, not fade as my Autozone one did. This time all I
asked was "What coils do you carry?" and he said "Bosch". Even though there
were MSDs up on the wall, he didn't even mention them. Good. So $40 for the
coil and condensor and I'm good. The coil is a Brazilian blue coil made in
2000 according to the label on the box.

One last issue is the intermittent miss at light throttle. That may be
mixture. Maybe at altitude it'll smooth out. The light gray plugs tell me
that it's too lean. Without a gas analyzer I don't want to mess with the AFM
adjustments. Maybe I'll make a run to Big Bear one day. heh

(OH! The dwell still shows 90*. Bad meter. Bad. ::smacks cheapo meter::)
