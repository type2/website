Subject: Corvair Notes

Hello everyone.  I have been answering some questions about my  
Corvair powered Bus and not all of my information made it to the  
list.  I'd like to add a few things.
     The parts for my conversion came from Clark's Corvair:  http:// 
www.corvair.com/user-cgi/main     This included engine mounts, wiring  
harness, axle adapters (that make use of the VW axles and CV Joints),  
and vague instructions.
     You must use the Corvair transaxle because the Corvair engine  
rotates in the opposite direction from the VW. (a Corvair engine can  
be made to run "backwards" with a new cam etc., a lot of money and  
trouble).
     Weight is similar to VW so the suspension is fine.
     Corvair engines usually outlast the Corvair so you can find  
them.  VW Buses in junk yards with usable engines don't exist (that's  
why they're there).
     Corvair engines are good to use because they are remarkably  
similar to VW engines (you already know how to work on them) and they  
are air cooled. Tin is one thing but putting a radiator somewhere is  
not going to be easy.
    The problems with the Corvair engines relate to the poor quality  
control at GM in the 60s.  The castings are rough.  The carburetors  
are junk.  Overall not the quality of VW.
Best to get started before the cold weather returns.
