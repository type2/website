I've tried it, but not on an engine...  IR from the LED's gets reflected
at different intensities, relative to the heat of the object that reflects
the IR light.

I used a standard CCD camera, a LARGE IR illuminator
(50 IR LED's, built myself)...  I could see warm, hot spots
at night..  people skin shows up "brighter" than clothed
parts...  car hoods are brighter... yes, it works fine
