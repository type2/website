	That's only the start of Ford's offences at Jegwore.
	They deep-sixed Jaguar's air-injected V6 using Ralph Sarich's 
well proven "orbital" method {an unhelpful name] to increase power & 
economy  -  see 
http://www.orbeng.com.au/orbital/directinjection/technical.htm . 
This is the next motor  -  obviating poppet valves, camshafts, 
cylinder head gaskets {yes, I know VW did that too}, cylinder heads 
{no, they didn't do that}, most of the pollutants in the exhaust, a 
lot of weight, etc.
