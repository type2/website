I wasn't so worried about overheating as I was about the fact that one
side of the head is being heated by combustion, while the other is being
heated a lot less by pumping air.

This is just academic speculation, though.  Obviously these compressors
are working and working well.  Very elegant adaptation of existing
hardware.
