Well, when Ford bought Jaguar they found out that there was a law in  England that if a British company could make a particular part or parts  for an automobile you had to buy from that company before  outsourcing.  That meant that all British cars had to buy their  electrical components from Lucas.  For the first few years Ford  put up with it, though lobbying the government to allow them to use  Bosch.  The Brits said, 'No way, buy Lucas.'  After a couple  of years of problems, Ford threatened to close Jaguar down altogether  if they didin't change their law.  Faced with that possibility,  they relented.  Now Jaguar has one of the highest customer  satisfaction ratings of any vehicle.  Ford saw that Jaguar could  no longer hand-make vehicles in place (as mine were) and compete with  the Americans, Germans, Japanese, Koreans, etc.  Ford installed  the first assembly lines at Jaguar.  But I wouldn't call them  crap.  They are making more reliable vehicles now than ever 
 before, if nothing else because Lucas is out of the picture.  Sure  the bodies aren't the masterpieces they once were.  But they don't  drink nearly as much gas as they once did, either.  Life is a  series of compromises.  And I'd like very much to have a Bentley,  thank you very much.  Cheers...KR

I think the same thing happened with the Forduars after Ford
bought Jag.

And I personally swore of Bentleys after they were purchased by VW...  :)
