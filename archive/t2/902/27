Subject: Re: [T2] VW powered air compressor

Wow! I have never seen a setup like the 'done right' one!
Here in Australia many were used through the 60's/70's, mainly by council workers 
and the armed forces who needed compressed air on site. They were modified 
industrial motors (mostly SP 1500's). (They also had many other things VW 
industrial motor driven like generators etc).
Unlike the done right though, they completely replaced on head for one with 
poppet valves. This meant No 3/4 cyl's ran the motor and cyl's 1/2 were the 
compressor. They still occasionally pop up for sale and were quite good in their day.

I'll have to see if I can dig up some info.
