Subject: RE: [T2] Ign. Switch replaced, now starter failing

Dave,

Just replaced the ignition switch, battery about a year old, new
transmission ground a few years back, showed 12.5vdc at the ignition switch
terminal 30 when I was installing the switch.  Solenoid seems to be doing
it's thing, as I can hear it.

Since I can hear the solenoid, that means everything up to that point on the
circuit is functioning right?

So is it mildly probable that it is the starter motor? 

Billy

As usual, one part at a time.  Eliminate the ignition switch as a problem by
using a manual one and see if it helps....bridge it, junp it, buy a manual
starter button.

See my electrical rant from several years ago about cleaning *all* your
electrical connections....including the transmission ground strap, both
battery terminals, the wires that actual go to the starter, the starter
contact lugs...etc.

I have found that my 78 FI starts incredibly well if the battery is really
charged up properly.
