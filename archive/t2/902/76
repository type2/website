Subject: Re: [T2] VW powered air compressor

I was just trying to be funny.  The image of fire coming out of my paint gun struck me as hilarious for some reason this morning.  This type air compressor seems a bit over capacity for painting, more for tasks along the lines of sandblasting.  I think the diesel powered sand blaster compressor that I used says 384 CFM on the side of it.  I am not sure if it has a tank at all, if so, it has a small one.

I would think that the VW engine compressor could be used to pump up a big tank that would thermally normalize the air.
