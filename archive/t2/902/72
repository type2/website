An  electric compressor of similar CFM (58CFM at 100PSI) capacity would be
a  very expensive proposition and impossible to run on household power.   A
typical electric 5HP compressor will produce 15.3CFM at 100 PSI and  runs
on 17 amps of 230V power.

If you need to run air tools, an  electrical compressor would be a better
deal, but if you need to run a  sandblaster for big jobs the Volksair is
about the lowest cost  alternative.




hello Guys  george hit this exactly right. It is the most cost  effective 
portable air compressor for the amout of CFMs you get.  greg said  they were loud 
and they are kinda.  Mine came with 2 of the biggest  lawnmower mufflers and 
it still is kinda loud. But when sandblasting it doesn't  matter. Only other 
problems is the the air gets hot and I had it blow some of  those cheap skinny 
curly hoses and it does stink   later  Mark d  .
