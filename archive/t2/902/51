Robert,

Ummmmmm....can you be more specific?

The actual nozzles, I am going to assume?

Reach up under the dash and take a good look with a flashlight.

They have two little pastic legs to grip the sheetmetal.
Squeeze them and push toward the outside of the bus.

Once outside the sheet metal, the tubing is much easier to work with.

Cheers, dave
