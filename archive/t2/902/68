Subject: RE: [T2] silly oil leak

I read Muirs before on this. And I know I didn't break anything.
Didn't overtighten it.
And yup, all the old gasket material was removed.
I think I will redo it <again>
and make sure that I got all the crud off the edge where the
gaskets seal to on the case.
Try Try again.

Didja get the old gasket off?

The secret dance can be found on page 83 of the Muir book when you read it 
backwards with a German accent.
