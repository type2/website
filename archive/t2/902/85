List-
Once you have the Corvair transaxle installed you may want to  
consider attaching a Chevrolet 350 V8 to the front of the transaxle.   
This would now be a mid-engine application.  Parts are available for  
this as well, but, the people who sell them make it clear that you  
are "on your own" so they don't send an instruction sheet.
Here is how it has been done:

Let us know how it turns out.
