hello Guys  I have one of these but I only use it for  sandblasting.  
58cfm,120psi all day till it runs out of gas.  A friend  who I help build a show 
winning bug with won thw base kit for best in show at  Circle yer wagens and gave 
it to me. I built the comprssor part and then bought  the tank, filters ,pop 
off valves from dunn right. Has some problems with the  air beiing hot and 
residual from running that will gum up air tools. I have mine  mounted on a 
trailer and it does work real well for sandblasting   later  mark dearing
