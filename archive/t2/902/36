If you pull the plug and turn it over (the plug on the
CDI unit) it reverts everything back to normal and
totally bypasses the CDI. Pull the plug out, turn it
upside-down from how it was, plug it back in. That
should get you home where you can do everything else
you want to do. If it doesn't, you probably have other
problems. -BaH
