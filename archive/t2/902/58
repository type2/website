unheard of  -  WI decreases temps without changing mixture  
(if put in after the petrol, which is where I do it)

no hint of harm to rods, so we're  slapping in new big- & 
small-end bearings, i.e. rebuilding the rods  ourselves





hello Robt     You will find rebuilding the rods  yourself way more time 
required than buying ones already done.  Air  blockage probably didn't cause this 
problem.  Laws of probality says  anything is possible therefor it is possible 
WI caused problem, might be a  slight chance but still possible after all it 
does clean all the carbon off  everything also. I haven't even seen a picture 
of the piston's hole but I do  know what causes this to happen  later  mark
