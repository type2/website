Well in terms of dollars per CFM, pretty darned efficient, particularly if
you happen to have a VW engine sitting around.

The kit includes a camshaft that modifies the valve timing to make the
pumping cylinders work every stroke.

An electric compressor of similar CFM (58CFM at 100PSI) capacity would be
a very expensive proposition and impossible to run on household power.  A
typical electric 5HP compressor will produce 15.3CFM at 100 PSI and runs
on 17 amps of 230V power.

If you need to run air tools, an electrical compressor would be a better
deal, but if you need to run a sandblaster for big jobs the Volksair is
about the lowest cost alternative.
