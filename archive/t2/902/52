Subject: Re: [T2] Koni Shocks Question

Emerson,

You asked, "Is there a practical modification  that will permit the
Koni front shocks for the 70-79 models to fit a 1969?"

Yes, you have to use the lower control arms off a later bus. That is the
easiest way unless you have some mad fabrication skills. That is what I had
to do on my 68 Double Cab and it works nicely. Busted Bus has them used.
