I wonder  how they handle the differential heating of the  heads?




hey George  the only problem I have had with mine is getting the rings  to 
seat. Doesn't seem to run hot at all, I am using a doghouse oil cooling  system 
on mine . The best thing about these is that everything is stock VW. the  
manifolds are stock dual port ends that you cut, block  and weld an  addapter that 
comes with the kit to. The cam is a really neat as it has double  lobes so 
that the thing pumps every stroke.  Later  mark  Dearing
