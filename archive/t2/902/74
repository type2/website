Eliminates that baking step when using it for painting (pre baked paint), I bet, assuming it does not ignite the paint in the gun, which, if it did, would probably lead to a new type of custom paint effect (you call those flames) or stories at least (let me tell you what happened when I used that old VW engine air compressor fer to paint my bus ...)
