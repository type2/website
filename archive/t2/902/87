Thoughts?

"Welcome to the metaphorical hamster-wheel of 30-year-old vehicle  
maintenance."

My bus always seems to have at least one little issue waiting for me  
to get around to it... So far this year it's been the horn wiring.

When you fix one issue it seems to send the bus a signal that it's  
time for something else to break.


Happy trails,
