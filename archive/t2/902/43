Subject: brake problem

74 Westy -1800 -carbed, daily driver now.

I haven't driven my bus in a week. After reading Steve Dolan's archived post 
about the brake warning light I am scared to. I have got to figure out if I 
have a problem in the system (and what it is) or in the warning light or ?

Here is my problem: Twice on a pretty steep incline, after stopping and 
after sitting for a few seconds or minutes my brake warning light came on 
and stayed on until I released the brakes. The brakes didn't seem any 
different while the light was on, although I was quite nervous about hitting 
the car in front of me so I pulled the emergency brake on too. This is the 
only time the light has come on, except at start up (normal for a '74). The 
brakes seem to be just fine, although the bus has only been on the road 2 
months. I can't find any visible brake fluid leaks anywhere, the reservoir 
level was correct and unchanged. Could sitting on the incline be an 
indicator of a small leak in the master cylinder or brake booster? What else 
would cause the light to come on like this? So far I have checked everywhere 
for leaks and can't find one. I do hear an audible clicking when I apply the 
brakes (all the time) that sounds like it is coming from the brake pedal. 
Any help is appreciated as the bus is my only vehicle.

Note: at High Country I told everyone that the vacum to the servo was 
disconnected and connecting it back resulted in no brakes at all. What I had 
in fact reconnected was the vent on the front side of the servo. The vacum 
to the engine has been connected and still is. Disconnecting the vent side 
again, the brakes seem to be ok again. I don't know if this would be related 
or not.

Thanks,
Rob Henley
