   Seriously? It was amazing! We have a six year old son and by the end 
of the trip we had no problem letting him go play with the other kids at 
the playground and various camps of the friends he made. There were kids 
activities on Saturday with crafts and a scavenger/word hunt.

   You can take a look at Jason Laster's photo gallery from the event 
and get a pretty good idea of how family friendly it is:
