Unlike  the done right though, they completely replaced on head for one with  
poppet valves. This meant No 3/4 cyl's ran the motor and cyl's 1/2 were  the

their day.

I'll have to see if I can dig up some  info.



Hello richard  It is Dunn Right named after the guy who designed the  special 
cam. these run on the #2,4 clys and pump air on  every   stroke on the #1,3 
clys. It has special valves in the  tank that controls the pressure at 120 psi 
and bleeds the excess out the intake.  You have to use a dual port engine and 
modify the intakes,  I have been  very happy with mine but I was lucky that I 
got my kit  as a gift and had  all the parts to build it  later  mark dearing
