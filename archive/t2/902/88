NO! 
70 type 1 is a single port one piece intake.
71 type 1 is a dual port single carb intake with
aluminum ends that do no bolt up to a type 4 head.

You will need 72-74 dual carb intakes.

But..... this begs the question "Why in the world do
you want to down-grade the fuel system??" FI is a much
more efficient system.

 fit on a 78 2.0 L for a
 Fi to dual carb conversion?
