Subject: Re: [T2] intake questions

Hi Richard,

No chance. 1970 and 71 are both upright engines, the intake system is  
completely different from that used in FI.

Most of the FI-to single Carb conversions that I have seen (blecch  
ptuie) look like they use the  2L FI intake runners.


Happy trails,
