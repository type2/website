Subject: Bizarre dwell? - Update

Curiouser and curiouser.

New points went in. Old ones were, well, odd. The arm moved easily up and
down the pivot shaft. New ones did not. Both Bosch. Sigh. The old ones only
had a couple thousand miles on them.

Plug 'em in and fire 'em up. Dwell at 46*. A bit shorter than I'd like, but
close enough for testing. Idle still rough though. And it seems even worse
actually. Plus it doesn't recover from revving up well, and sometimes
stalls.

I pulled the TSII and let it cool to match the other one I have from the 79
unknown engine. After an hour of both of them resting on the metal of the
bus, I do voltage checks (on the rubber mat... No shorts through the chassis
please!) The one out of the 79 registered 1800ohms at about 78 degrees. The
one out of the Guac registered 28,000. Yes, about 15x higher. I double
checked my work, same results. I put the one from the 79 in. Idle did not
change.

While thinking about it, the dwell meter pegged at 90 again. WTF? Now I'm
really confused. So I decide to check the voltage at the coil. 18v!!!

At this point I'm thinking (hoping?) my meter is bad. So I put a new battery
in it. Same results. Run to AutoZone and buy their overpriced piece of crap
($30!!!!!). Only to find it doesn't come with a battery (nothing at all on
the packaging about that) and the screws are smaller than any of the
screwdrivers I brought with me. They're recessed into the plastic so there's
no way to get a larger one on there. I'm waiting till tomorrow now. I have
to be at work at oh-dark-thirty so need to get to bed.

I'll stop on the way home tomorrow and see about getting a small
screwdriver.
