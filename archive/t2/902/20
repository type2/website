Heard this last night on Charley Rose and had to write it down. 
  
  Shimon Perez:  "You cannot reason with people who are unreasonable." 
  
  What a mouthful.  I'm betting he stole it from Yogi Berra.
  
  I've got a few extra parts that I don't need that I pulled off of a  donor bus.  Some were just laying in the back.   They're  free to anyone that needs them.  But I'm no Karl or Richard.   I don't even know what some of these parts are much less the part  numbers.  As soon as I get my new USB card installed, I'll post  some pics. 
  
  And Richard, I also have pics of my Bridgestone RD-603's I'll send when I can get them out of the camera. 
  
  Cheers....KR
