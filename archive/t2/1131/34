when I turn on the H4 headlights but no other times.

The first thing to do, if you haven't already, is to check the major
electrical connections from the battery and alternator/generator. A lot
of corrosion can build up over 40 years! Clean each connection to bare
metal and coat with some proprietary terminal protector. I did this on
my 76 and increased the voltage to the front by 1V. Doesn't sound like
much but it could be the difference between generator light on or off.
And it's the cheapest option by far!
