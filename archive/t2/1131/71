Subject: Question concerning timing

Hi all,

I just completed a tune-up on my new engine, pretty much a stock
1600dp, just passed the 2,000 mile threshold. Engine has been great
but I reset the points on my aircooled.net SVDA to .016 with a feeler
gauge. Previously, I had just used my dwell meter. Well, my dwell
meter reads 42 degrees, not 50 like I expect at a proper points gap. I
expect my gauge is just not as accurate as it should be.

With the point gap now proper and my vacuum advance diaphragm working
well is it safe to add a bit more timing to the engine. I drove around
for a bit after the tuneup and with the proper point gap it is much
more drivable, and an idle issue I was having is gone too. While I was
first sorting this engine out it would ping between 5-7 BTDC.
Currently I have it timed right around 0.

It is an AH block, dp heads, with an aircooled.net SVDA, and a 34
Pict-3 carb with slightly bigger jets than stock.

I guess my question ends  up being, can a very small point gap lead to pinging?

Thanks all,

Have a wonderful weekend.
