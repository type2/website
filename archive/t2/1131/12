"What is the difference between the spray in foam you are proposing and the
stuff in the aerosol spray cans available at your local home improvement
store? Anyone? Anyone?"

Mainly consistency in the finished density,uniformity of the bubbles and the
fact that it is blown under pressure .It is a 2 part system which,as far as I
understand it, creates its own bubbles as part of the process.H2O is not
supposed to be present. ( I guess that's the kicker :) )
The foam gets sprayed as a dense liquid mixture and then goes through its
chemical process so it can be aimed very well and fill nooks and crannies

(-at-) Kevin Guarnotta-Thanks.
the only observation I have is that with the closed nature of the foam,you
don't get moisture travelling through the foam. Yes,the skin side of the foam
will be colder than the interior, but that's the nature of all
insulation,isn't it?

I think that my real concern is that someone said that the foam would separate
from the body. I don't think this can happen and I have used these products
for years. I use them for stage props but they travel through the Canadian
winters in unheated trucks to no apparent concern, on metal,wood,plastic.
I am very interested in what your foam guy has to say.
Cheers
