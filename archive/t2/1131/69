Subject: Target and buses

Be on the look out for the "plaid" target commercial.  It's got a late bus
painted plaid.

This is the second target commercial
I've seen where they used buses.

First one was a few years ago.  It was a Christmas commercial with a 23 window
bus.

Any other target commercials I've missed?

Richard
