If it wants to stall when you stop it may need a replacement brake servo.
Sounds like it is leaking vacuum.
The 71 is the first year with the power brakes. Try taking vise-grips and
clamp off the vacuum hose to the servo. It comes the full length under the bus
and can be seen coming from the left side of the engine compartment. If it
doesn't stall when you clamp the hose off then it's the brake servo.
If you leave it clamped you will not have and power assist brakes.
I just had my servo rebuilt and new master cylinder at the same time.
As for the alternator it usually has the larger belt and pulley then the
generator.
