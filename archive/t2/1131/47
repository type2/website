Subject: Timing

Trying to figure out a most likely bastardized engine.

Case and heads are both Hecho en Mexico. No other castings that I can
see (at 0400 when I was out there adjusting the valves).

It is a SINGLE PORT engine that was built somewhere around 2001 then
supposedly only had 3000 miles put on it before the bus was parked. No
way to tell if it's a 1500 or 1600.

The pulley has 3 marks like so:

I am assuming that the one on the left is TDC and the two on the right
are 5 and 7.5 BTDC. It was timed to the one on the left and pushed the
bus it's in now fine for 1000 miles like that.

Then it kinda freaked out. Bucking and backfiring through the carb and
losing power. A lot like a dropped or stuck valve. Hence the valve
adjustment. they all looked good for a motor that has had 1000 miles
put on it after sitting up for 7 or 8 years. I could still fit at least
a .004 through all of them. I adjusted them back out to .006 but my
brain is frazzled right now. Many long days at work. I have started
second guessing myself. Should they be at .008 or .006?

And, where the heck should I set the timing? Yes, it has a 009 on it.
I'll use the unsharpened pencil trick later today to determine which
mark is REALLY TDC. But once that's done does a single port get set to
somewhere BTDC or ATDC? 5 or 7.5? I'm using a static light, not a
strobe.

Thanks all,

Gerald
