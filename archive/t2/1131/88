Subject: RE: [T2] Blown wheel cylinder/castellated nut removal

Thanks, guys.

Got the nut loose and the drum off.  Looks like it wasn't the cylinder after
all... it looks like it was a faulty brake spring.  Two, actually.
Interestingly enough, the large spring on the driver's side just gave way a
few months ago as well.  I didn't realize there was a half-life in a return
spring(?).
It overheated the drum to the point that the paint on the drum 'boiled' and
flaked away, the drum itself has blued, and the seal seems to have melted.
ALL of the grease has broken down into something 'not grease'. I bought a new
cylinder, shoes and seals.  I guess it's repack or replace the bearings,
depending on how they look.
Any thoughts?
