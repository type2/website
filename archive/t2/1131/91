Usually whenever I'm going to even look at a bearing (on my bus), I will 
plan on replacing it.  Granted, this is my bus, so it's not that often 
than anyone would be looking at my bearings, and I know the last time 
when I serviced them.  But if you've never looked at them before, you 
can pretty much assume that nobody else has either, so you might as well 
change it, document it, and move on to the next item on the list.  At 
least you can rest assured that that particular wheel won't fall off 
sooner than the other wheels :)
