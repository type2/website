	Martin, the principle you're expounding is IMHO very wise. 
Corroded electrical connections cause bulk harm, and being 
essentially easy to fix should be a high priority in the decadal 
maintenance we're exploring (in a list including preventive 
replacement of accelerator cable  hint hint :-X).
	Just one clarification please: do you mean to coat the 
cleaned metal with anything before clamping the connection?  I've 
always just joined clean metal, and then added on the outside of the 
connection any suitable grease.
	I'd have thought anything in the joint would tend to decreae 
conductivity; and a special grease containing some electrical 
conductor might be OK between the joint faces (for a low-current 
connection) but wouldn't be so good on the outside of the joint 
insofar as it might facilitate shorting when things touch the outside.
