Subject: Update - Buses By The Depot (Sat. in PA)

Just a quick note that all Buses By The Depot campsite assignments have now
been emailed. If you reserved a site and did not get an email, please
contact me.  Weather forecast still looks good; the current rain is supposed
to end around noon tomorrow and then it's sunny for the weekend. (p.s. If
you didn't reserve yet, but want to, it looks like I have 3 slots left at
this point.)
