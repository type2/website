Kevin,

Thanks for the tip from Bentley. Since I don't have one, I did use Graphite. 
I suppose I should take it all apart and clean it out and go with talc.

It says specifically, "CAUTION: Do not coat the rubber bushings with
graphite. It will permit the spring plate hub to turn in the bushings,
resulting in rapid wear. Do not allow multi-purpose grease or other
petroleum-based lubricants to contaminate the bushings since these
substances are harmful to rubber"

I got some baby powder.

The whole process took less than 30 minutes. I probably spent the most time
cleaning the metal covers out, and trying to make the re-install area clean.
I also used anti-seize on the bolts that hold the cover plate on. I figured
it couldn't hurt. I almost got a bit carried away, and was going to sand the
cover plates off, and re-paint them. But they looked ok, and I don't need
the extra work.
