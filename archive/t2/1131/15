Would Rhino-Liner and other bed liner products be equal/superior or 
inferior to POR-40? I ask b/c of a friend who was a big fan until he did 
not prep a surface correctly and had the POR peel off later. (At least 
that is what I THINK he said - it peeled).

My plan is to strip out my interior soon and have the interior floor 
bedlinered white if I can get it that color. I have not determined 
whether I will do it myself or have the local rep do it for me. Have to 
check the cost. We have another competing franchise called Bed-X or 
something like that. NAPA also supplies it for DIY. Good stuff, not the 
weak stuff in a spray can.

Any thoughts from the wise Type II list???
