Subject: Vapour barriers and insulation

I stil think people are regarding closed cel rigid board insulation("pink" or
"blue" board) in the same manner as sprayed foam insulation(specifically the
closed cel type) .
They are not the same.
Sprayed foam is sprayed on like paint and is very viscous and begins to foam
immediately . It adheres like paint and if you have prepped your surfaces well
and H2O is absent it's there for a very long time.
I have a new question; My bus had a nose mounted spare tire carrier and the
nose under it is dented.This is directly behind the heating duct work in the
cab. What are the thoughts on the best way to remove these type of dents?
Cheers
