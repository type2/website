I'm not sure how properly applied closed-cell foam insulation could ever 
"trap moisture".  You are spraying it on top of metal in a continuous 
coat.  It's like a thick, foamy paint.  And lets not forget that no 
water should be entering the wall cavities in the first place (except 
for the doors which need to allow water to flow freely to the bottom of 
the door.)     "Great Stuff" gives an airtight, water-resistant seal. 

I believe fiberglass pink insulation to be wholly unsuitable for a 
vehicle.  It absorbs moisture in damp weather which almost certainly 
will rust out your van from the inside.  No soundproofing and so-so R value.
