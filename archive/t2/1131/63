	Just for any few who may not be aware, that is the Latin (& 
apparently German) name for the metal sodium (symbol for the element: 
Na).  The exhaust-valve is cooled by the built-in heat pipe 
constituted by filling the valve stem with this metal which melts at 
operating temps and convects heat up the stem, away from the valve 
head & seat  -  a well-proven method with no moving parts, going back 
at least to W2.
