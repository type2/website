Subject: Torsion bar adjustment

So with a friend's help, I had success with raising the rear end of my
67 Bug this past weekend - man, the correct tools make the job a snap
(read: sledge hammer and pipe to put the spring plate back on)!
Increased torsion by 1 notch and it made a world of difference.  No more
scraping muffler.  I can actually see distant traffic in the rear view
mirror without hunkering down.  :-)

My 71 Westy has a similarly sagging rear.  I expect there is more
torsion wound into the Bus than into the Bug?  I did not need a chain to
do the Bug, but have heard of using such a device with a Bus.  Are there
any special considerations to take into account with the Westy?  I'm
expecting to again increase the torsion by just one notch.  Any other
differences to note?

Someone suggested avoiding the hassle and adjusting my rear shocks to
account for the lowered ride height in the Bus (I have Konis), but that
seems a little hokey.  Having adjusted the Bug torsion bar only once, I
could probably do it again in about 4 hours, and I'm OK with that on the
Bus if the process is the same straightforward one.  Seems like it might
be a little more dangerous, though.

Thanks,

John
