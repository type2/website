Subject: Blown wheel cylinder/castellated nut removal

Hi guys.  Blew out a circuit on my master cylinder via the passenger/rear
wheel cylinder.  I was driving from Grass Valley back to Chico,Ca and I had to
stop suddenly at a light near the bottom of a steep hill.  Needless to say, I
ned to peek inside and see how much of a mess is in there.  At best, I will
have to R&R the brakes and the cylinder.  At the worst, I will need to tear
the bearings out and repack them.  Problem is(and I admit this sheepishly)
that I can't remember which way to loosen the dammned castellated nut on this
side of the vehicle.  One side is LH thread, and the other is RH.  anybody
remember which is which?  Bentley's a no-go.

Thanks all.

Eron
