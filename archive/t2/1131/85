Actually, wheel rotation does not keep both sides tight.  Driving 
forward will keep the driver's side nut tight, but not the passenger side.

It's really the cotter pin that keeps the nut from coming loose.  You 
tighten it until it stops turning, and then you crank on it with a big 
breaker bar until it lines up with the next cotter pin hole,  Insert new 
pin, and you're done.
