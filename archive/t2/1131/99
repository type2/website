Subject: Bypass ignition switch

Hi everyone,

I left work today, got into the van, turned the key and she cranked
but did not fire. A friend helped me push start the van and I drove it
home. I have a 20 minute drive mixed between highway and city driving.
During the drive the bus acted completely normal.

I parked at home and tried to start it and again the same thing.
Cranks really well but does not fire. I have fuel and since it started
on compression I believe I have spark. My engine has been converted to
an alternator with an external regulator. Reading Muir and the
archives I can find where to hook up a jumper wire to the voltage
regulator, but where do I hook it with the external regulator.

Can I jump directly from the battery to the ignition side of the coil?
I just need a temporary fix to get it to the mechanic.

Thank you,

Max
