> Hi, Was there any mention of the oil pressure and what it is?
Oil pressure in bar is linear to rpm and roughly 1000*rpm + 1000,
meaning that at 3000rpm I get 4bar or 60psi. That is with the big oil
circuit (engine to front cooler and back). The big thermostat/oil
pressure regulator thing that is mounted at the stock oil cooler
location has a big screw on the bottom where the pressure regulating
spring can be changed in order to adjust oil pressure. As a side note,
I've got to use a special fully synthetic oil to keep my warranty
(15W-50 Motul 300 V Competition).

Yep, pump is a bit bigger than stock.

Thanks!
