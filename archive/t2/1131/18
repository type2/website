Subject: Re: [T2] Rust and insulation of steel cage ...with cement? 

There is/was an old locksmith in Boston whose work vehicle
was a VW bus and he had a cement floor poured directly over
the existing floor.  I might be able to dig up some info from
his occasional mechanic, but I am replying just to say that
this has been done at least once.  Someone else on this list
may know more.
