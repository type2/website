I've got a 78 so I'm not sure how much different things are, but I've 
only replaced the front bearings and even though they weren't faulty, I 
did it anyways because I was already doing other stuff up there.  I just 
repacked them with high-temp bearing grease that I got from Pep Boys and 
I haven't noticed anything funny since, and that was at least 60k miles 
ago.  That's really odd that you've had to change them that often.  If I 
remember correctly, the front bearings have a special nut that you 
tighten to about 7in/lbs and then you lock it with an allen bolt.  I 
pretty much tightened it (very lightly) until there wasn't any play in 
the wheel and then locked it in place.  Whenever I have the wheels up, I 
check the play and it hasn't changed at all.

As far as the rears, I haven't changed the bearings, but then again, I 
haven't had any problems.  I did remove the hubs to swap out my rear 
drum brakes with the vanagon auto-adjusting rear drum brakes, but I 
don't think I had to mess with the bearings at all.  At some point I'll 
probably change them just because it would probably be good preventative 
maintenance, but there are a few other items on the list that are ahead 
of that.

As far as your bearings getting messed up, my guess would be that you're 
putting them too tight.  That torque specification is very small if I 
remember correctly...
