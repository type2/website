Any of you that have restored a late beetle, that has the air vents behind the
rear side windows, will be convinced that the foam VW used inside the body
causes rust.   That foam holds moisture against the body and rusts it from the
inside out.  I don't know what type of foam that is, but I won't use foam
inside a body, or next to metal.   I have a friend that sprayed foam inside
all the body cavities of his Thing.  It really did wonders for the sound
resonation,  really made it sound like a very solid car.  I just couldn't
bring myself to do it to my beetle.
