Hi Richard

The foam in the rear of the car does cause rusting from the inside out. I
just had that area replaced on the passenger side and had the body guy
remove the foam. I don't hear any difference. 

BTW...If you work on your own engine, have you had any problems with low
power after tuning up the engine> I reset the valves, the points, and the
timing after replacing the clutch. The car can't get out of it's own way
now.

Bob
