T4 cam wear is an old problem, long predates low ZDDP oil, but I'm sure it
ain't no better today, as flat tappets cams are failing all over the place now
days.  As I wrote 10+ years ago here (valve adjustment section on type2.com)
the fallacy of the T4 "indestructable" bottom end is a fallacy in the fact
that cam wear will begin to get you at 100-125k miles, even though the bottom
as far as mains/rods, will last forever.  As I've said before, good way to
know is just visually inspect when doing pushrod seals with the lifters
pulled.  You will easily see/feel gross wear, and it will be there.  I'll also
plug as always for Elgin cams in CA (though I haven't talked to him in 2
years, hopefully still alive and there) good place for good regrinds of T4 or
any cam.  I've used Dema for 15 years for T4s, 911s, my triumph, he'll never
steer you wrong, he scaled back operations a bit a few years ago, but still
unbeatable, stock or performance.  Listen to
 what he says you need though.

Interesting problem with the worn out cam.

Hey list, could this be the result of not enough zddp in the oil?
