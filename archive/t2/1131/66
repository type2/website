doing them that long.
John, the german company is "Kaefertuning Kummetat" (no website). The
owner (Gerd Kummetat) is one of the three most famous beetle tuners
back from the old days til present. He has been working on the T4 at a
time when everybody else was still that much into T1 cases. Funny
thing is that he now rebuilds the engines for Volkswagen Classic, the
official part of the company that participates in oldtimer racing
events. I'd wish I could afford one of his bigger "everyday driving"
engines, but my credit card limit has already been reached...
