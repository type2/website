Most of the reading I've seen (I'm in the process of - after having finished
rust repairs - soundproofing and insulating) suggests that try as you might
to lay down a completely mated-to-metal layer, you may still have the
potential to trap moisture between the (closed cell) foam and the metal, due
to humidity, window seal leaks, frosty beverage spill, etc.

Almost all of the reading I've done advises against fiberglass insulation.

I avoided both products, altho the ease of application with the spray foam
was really, really appealing.

Cheers, Mike
