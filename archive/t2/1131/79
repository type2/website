Scotchgard


 Same as 'above', but does someone on this list, have a 'way' to make the
 'fabrick', on these 'tents', last longer..or is there a way to 'treat' them,
 so 'they' can last longer? Mine has been in a shop, where they 'radomly'
used
 'particulate' and I am forever getting rid of same,, so thought, now ,
before
 "winter' comes, I could do something, to make top 'better', before having to
 put the entire works, back in "barn'!
 Cheers
