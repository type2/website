Subject: Rust and insulation of steel cage ...with cement?

Hello It may sound crazy , but :
Do you guys think that a thin layer of cement, yes cement used in
construction for concrete ! ) could seal - off any remnants of rust
and prevent from further rusting ? I did use this on a restoration of
old houses , where old steel pipes were rusting . Then I covered it
with base coat paint with some fine sand mixed. other option could be
to put on top of these two layers something more elastic as acrilic
based sealants, to prevent cracking from hits stones etc.
Tehre is my formulae - clean from rust as much as possible , expose
any cavities before that, put basic watery cement with very little
sand, then rust- oleum or similar and finally seal with ruberous
resin.
does that sound reasonable ?

In construction the basic concept of steel reinforced concrete is that
concrete bonds  perfect to even rusted steel and stops the rust, plus
any furteh rust goes slowly into the border zone of the concrete thus
making a smooth fusion with the steel .
