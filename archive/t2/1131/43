  Good point.  I just replaced my rear upper hatch with a better one.  
The previous owner had filled both of those rectangular cavities with 
spray foam.  Just for fun I tried to remove some with a screwdriver.  
Very tenacious stuff.  There was no way any moisure was either a)getting 
inside or b)getting behind.  If I get around to it I might put the door 
under water for a week and then scrape off the foam.  My guess is it 
will be bone dry at the metal.
