Subject: Possible new bus radio?

It's not Friday, but this IS possible bus content!  Porsche has come
out with a new radio specifically for people who aren't giving up their
classic Porsches.  I'm willing to bet these would probably go just fine
in buses as well.

If I wasn't hell-bent on building my own stereo in my bus, I'd be all
over this like Rush Limbaugh on appetite suppressants!
