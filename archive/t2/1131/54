Subject: Fwd: '74 Westy top bunk - hinges??

The '74 Westy seems to have a unique way to 'close' the top bunk.  That is,
a way to make the 2" section overlay the 4" section.

It doesn't 'fold over', like my '78 did, but the '74 has a 'stepped' action,
where the 2" section stays level as it go back over the 4" section, more
like a layered cake than a sandwich.

The layering on the '74 top bunk is (1) 4" wood, (2) 4" mattress, (3) 2"
wood and (4) 2" mattress.

On the '78, it resembles a sandwich, where the two mattress pieces are
touching, with the wood roof sections on the top and bottom of the sandwich.


My question:  The hinged arms (four -4-) each have two base pieces for the
top bunk bed on the Westy.

Are all the eight -8- base pieces located UNDER the wood, or is the rear
most pair of base pieces on the top of the wood (the 4" section of the
wood)?

Here is a picture of a set of '74 hinges onTheSamba.  Hope the owner doesn't
mind.
