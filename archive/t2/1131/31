Subject: Warning light

Hi, I'm new to VW's and currently living in Mexico. I have a 1971 bus that I
just bought from my cousin. The charge warning light comes on when I turn on
the H4 headlights but no other times. The engine also stalls out if I don't
give it gas as I'm coming to a full stop.

1 I think I need a new alternator/generator. Am I right?
2 how do I tell which it is? Alternator/generator?
3 if it's a generator, how difficult will it be to convert it to an
alternator? Is it worth the trouble?

I'm really enjoying driving my new/old bus around, but I'm a little worried
about driving at night with no lights.

Thank you in advance for the help.

Al
