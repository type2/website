Gerald,

To time a 009, you really ought to have a strobe because it
should be timed at full advance. :/  You should be able
to get one fairly cheap...about $20-30...  (I might even 
have one I can send you)

Here's how to time it:
http://type2.com/library/electrip/bosch009.htm

You could probably statically time it around ~4-6deg BTDC just to
move it around, but I wouldn't drive it anywhere until you dial it
in with a timing light.

Valves should be at 0.006, although some folks will do intakes at
004 and exhausts at 006.  You could also do 004 all the way around
but I don't know that you'll get any benefit.  008 is too big.

I can't remember where the marks should be, but they may be the 0, 5,
and 7.5 as you say.  Seems likely, but I'll defer.

Good luck!

Cheers,
   Tom
