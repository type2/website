YAY!

Can you be more specific about the cam, lifters and valve sizes?

I've gone Corvair power in the bus but I could imagine someday wanting 
to go back to VW power to keep it all German. 92Hp would be nice.

~90HP is my goal for my Type IV 2,0L powered Beetle when I rebuild that 
engine.

Thanks!
