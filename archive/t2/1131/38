Just one clarification please: do you mean to coat the cleaned metal
with anything before clamping the connection? I've always just joined
clean metal, and then added on the outside of the connection any
suitable grease.

Robert,

Agreed! Join together the cleaned metal THEN coat with your preferred
protectant.

Hi Folks,

Y'all might want to look up what the manufacturers of contact cleaning and
protection products recommend as their application sequence. YMMV, but these
folks could recommend either (1) clean-assemble-coat or
(2)clean-coat-assemble-(over-coat). As long as you used their products it make
no difference to them.  However, they probably tested and found this (2) way
works best, as related below.  Electrical connectors have wipe contact
pressure, at least any that you are going to meet do.  The contact pressure
removes the grease on the contact surface, and only on the contact surface. 
All other interior surfaces remain coated.  Crevice corrosion is your enemy
here, and coating the outside of the connector "after the fact" does not
exclude moisture-containing air inside the connector spaces.  The micro spaces
directly adjacent to the contact point are where corrosion really gets going. 
Many high power switches and relays operate in an "oil" bath. This
 is for arc suppression but shows that insulating fluids and contacts are not
incompatible.    Petroleum grease will degrade most plastics, as will silicone
grease degrade some other insulators. Use what the manufacturer recommends for
your plastics.  Most of the connectors on my (modern) vehicles came from the
factory with silicone dielectric grease.  Dow Corning or General Electric are
the go-to suppliers for that product, but the Permatex/CRC stuff from your
FLAPS will do just fine. One tube is a lifetime supply. 

NB. Do not get it on any surface you are going to paint or fiberglass.

Cleaning lead battery contacts
Can lead battery contacts be cleaned with
DeoxIT.?  If so, what's the process?

Thanks,

R. Thomas
.....

Yes, it can.  Please treat as follows:

DAY ONE:

Apply original version DeoxIT. spray (D5MS-15 or D5S-6) to contact surfaces,
and allow it to remain on the surfaces overnight.

DAY TWO:

Remove
 all contaminants lifted by the DeoxIT. with a wire brush, then remove
the DeoxIT. with a cloth. If contaminants remain, repeat, as necessary.

Apply
 DeoxIT. L260-Cp (lithium based with copper particles) grease to the
post. Clamp the post in place, then apply more DeoxIT. L260-Cp grease to
 the
base of the post and around the clamp.

For an exhaustive description of what happens inside a connector by another
competent supplier.  A very good product, but good chemistry comes at a
price.
