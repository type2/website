Subject: Re: [T2] Question concerning timing

Excellent information supplied in this thread. Thank you all.

I reset my points gap and it is closer to 50 degrees now. I'll look at
the suggested printable degree wheels and see where my engine is at
with my timing gun later this week.

Thank you all,
