Subject: What do you use to make 'fabric' on "westy' top, last longer

Same as 'above', but does someone on this list, have a 'way' to make the
'fabrick', on these 'tents', last longer..or is there a way to 'treat' them,
so 'they' can last longer?  Mine has been in a shop, where they 'radomly' used
'particulate' and I am forever getting rid of same,, so thought, now , before
"winter' comes, I could do something, to make top 'better', before having to
put the entire works, back in "barn'!
Cheers
Syd
