Subject: Doh! Was dimly lit Battery Light

Turns out when I replaced the battery cables and battery I neglected to reconnect the output wire from the alternator to the starter. Regualtor was showing 14 volts but the battery only 12. I was about to order a new regulator and was forced to do the unthinkable: Tent camping out of my car! Fortunately discovered my error and all is well once again on the 78' Champagne Edition Westy. Now if I could just get motivated to do the paint and body work...
