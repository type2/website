Subject: RE: [T2] Blown wheel cylinder/castellated nut removal

 I don't change out the fronts(bearings) EVERY time, but considering it has
probably been ten years since I did the front brakes, I digress... I believe
there is a washer over the front outer bearing that you are supposed to 'flex'
with a screwdriver to make sure you haven't overtightened the locknut.  I have
had to replace the rears due to previous owner and bad mechanics(my brother).
Doing a bad job(after a cylinder blowout) on repacking the bearings (my
brother) damaged the bearings and he failed to torque the nut properly, which
caused play in the assembly which wasted the stub-axle.  Needless to say,
he'll never touch the vehicle again.
