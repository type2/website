Subject: RE: [T2] Blown wheel cylinder/castellated nut removal

Good advice Mike.

Sadly, I've seen these bearings more than a few times ;^D.  I've owned and
maintained this bus since 1991.  I've been a listmember since 1998(?)  I've
replaced the bearings once or twice(when they looked galled or worn), and I've
repacked the current set(s) half a dozen times already.  I am more prone to
replacing the fronts as opposed to the rears when I remove a wheel, since the
front wheel adjustment procedure is so 'feel' dependant, and they are so
small.  In the rear there's a snap-ring and that beefy castle nut that tells
me all is as it should be once it's tightened.  My quandry lies in which
grease I should use when I do the job.  I DO worry about heat and pressure
causing premature failure of those precious rear bearings.  I've used
Valvoline synthetic as well as every other standard bearing grease I can
imagine. I've even considered marine grease.  Which greases do you prefer and
why?
