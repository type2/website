Hi Chris,
the cylinder heads are modified AMC heads with 42mm intake and 34mm
exhaust (natrium-filled). They have special reinforcements welded to
the lower mounting holes
(check http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/0SKF5T_odBksQHLyVN7EnQ?feat=directlink)
that keeps them from being tilted towards the middle of the engine
(the rebuilder told me about two design flaws of the original heads:
one being the lack of material around the lower mounting holes. The
heads can actually be compressed in this area over time leading to
chages in valve train geometry and finally to leaks where the heads
seal against the cylinder. The other (production) flaw, he told me, is
that the oversize of the valve seats is not big enough leading to
dropped seats when the heads get really hot and cool down afterwards.
He has a special procedure to fit slightly larger seats and he claims
in 30 years they never had a seat drop.).
Another crucial part he told me is the combination of lifters and cam
and he wouldn't tell me specifics of the cam besides noting that it's
a mild Webcam, with slightly more lift than the FI cam and also
slightly different timing. The followers are from SCAT and have an oil
hole right in the middle to reduce wear of the cam.
P&Cs are the Porsche 914 ones with flat-top pistons. I don't know the
actual CR besides that it is higher than normal. The rebuilder
apparently wants to keep the details he learned over the last 30
years.
Hope this helps,
Timo
