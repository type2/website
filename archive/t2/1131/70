That's interesting. The oil engineer I read said 10 psi for each 1000
rpm, being then, 30 psi at 3000 rpm.

If your builder is also specifying the viscosity, he must be expecting
the pressure you report.

I wonder what's special in your oil, besides being synthetic. Probably
more ZDDP in competition oils.
