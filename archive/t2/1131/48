Hi Gerald,

On a motor that's sat for a while, you may get sticking valves that
may free up back to normal after it's run for awhile.

On an 009 forget about the idle timing. It's the max advance you need
to be concerned with. About 27 degrees BTDC at 3500 RPM, which without
a degree wheel is about when the timing mark is at the junction of the
pulley and the fan belt. This may be about 10 or 15 BTDC at idle or
static for your initial setting.

Left mark is TDC, middle is 7.5 BTDC, and right mark is 10 BTDC.

Have fun!

John
