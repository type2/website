What was their logic? At first, I'd think the opposite (think of 
something dragging on the nut while driving - you'd want that to 
tighten it?). Maybe it's a matter of precession (as with a bicycle 
pedal). As tight as our axle nuts are, I don't think much is going to 
move them, barring catastrophic failure of something.
