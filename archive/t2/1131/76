Hi guys.  Blew out a circuit on my master cylinder via the passenger/rear
wheel cylinder.  I was driving from Grass Valley back to Chico,Ca and I had
to stop suddenly at a light near the bottom of a steep hill.  Needless to
say, I ned to peek inside and see how much of a mess is in there.  At best,
I will have to R&R the brakes and the cylinder.  At the worst, I will need
to tear the bearings out and repack them.  Problem is(and I admit this
sheepishly) that I can't remember which way to loosen the dammned
castellated nut on this side of the vehicle.  One side is LH thread, and the
other is RH.  anybody remember which is which?  Bentley's a no-go.

Thanks all.

Eron
