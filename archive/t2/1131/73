The variance you express over a .016 is an error of 0.00256, which is
difficult to achieve even in something easier to work with like valve
adjustment. It's difficult to get the points to cooperate with your
hand enough to set at the correct gap, and even more difficult to
prevent them from moving when you tighten the set screw. So the dwell
meter is better because it tells you what you got instead of
subjectively checking your work with the gauge afterwards and not
being quite sure that the feel of the gauge in the gap is right.

engineering design. In case your distributor isn't 100% on spec, the final max
advance with the vacuum disconnected is more important than the idle. Try for
27 degress BTDC at 3500 RPM. If you don't have a degree wheel, it's about
where the pulley meets the fan belt. There are some printable degree wheels on
the internet that you can attach to your pulley as well.
