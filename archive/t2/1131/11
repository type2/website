There is a free game on Facebook called "Car Town."  Three of the cars
available are air-cooled Volkswagens, a Type I, a Karmann Ghia, and a 1979
Bus.  The bus has tip out windows so it looks like a hardtop camper.

Just discovered an iPhone app with a VW bus.  It is called HeelsNWheels.
The app is free and was developed to raise awareness for breast cancer.
Check it out.
