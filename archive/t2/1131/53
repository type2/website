Subject: Dual batteries. Can I trickle charge reserve deep cycle battery

          I have a 1977 Westfalia Camper. I have installed a second deep 
cycle battery using the Bus Depot relay. My deep cycle battery is low. 
Can I use a low amperage charger (2 amp/deep cycle/automatic) to charge 
the deep cycle battery by hooking the red lead to the deep cycle hot and 
the black lead to the camper body or does use of the Bus Depot relay 
mean I have to disconnect the deep cycle battery to charge it?
