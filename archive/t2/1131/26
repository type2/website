Subject: spray foam insulation

I just spoke with my spray foam guy-he said no problem insulating a bus. He
said all of his trucks use it, and probably all  trucks in the business do
as well. You need to use the closed cell foam. No need for vapor barrier-I
stand corrected. The stuff needs to be protected from UV, as that will
degrade the foam.

I may even have him price out my bus.although I'm not sure what would be
better for sound-which is a bigger concern for me than insulation. I have
all this sound proofing stuff I am in the process of installing. 

I am going to meet him on Wednesday, I'll try to bring my bus to the site,
and talk to him about it.
