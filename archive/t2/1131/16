Rhino Liner works excellent on non rusted steel. I have used Por-15 in the
past and it was excellent. All of the grease and oil have to be removed and
any loose scaling rust needs to be removed. You MUST not use petroueum based
solvents to clean the metal before you apply POR-15. It is best to spend the
money and use the metal ready prep that is recomended by POR-15. I don't know
why this is, but this is what I am told. It is rock hard when dry. It is tough
stuff. I plan to coat the frame of my bus with it as well. That is going to
take awhile. I don't think truck bed liners actually stop rust. The floor of
my bus was coated by truck bed liner or undercoating by the previous owner. It
is rusting underneath it and pealing. POR-15 can be coated with other paints
and truck bed liners.
 
Take Care,

Would Rhino-Liner and other bed liner products be equal/superior or inferior
to POR-40? I ask b/c of a friend who was a big fan until he did not prep a
surface correctly and had the POR peel off later. (At least that is what I
THINK he said - it peeled).

My plan is to strip out my interior soon and have the interior floor
bedlinered
