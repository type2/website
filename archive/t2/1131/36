Just one clarification please: do you mean to coat the cleaned metal
with anything before clamping the connection? I've always just joined
clean metal, and then added on the outside of the connection any
suitable grease.

Robert,

Agreed! Join together the cleaned metal THEN coat with your preferred
protectant.

Martin.
