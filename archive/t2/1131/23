Subject: Sparkplugs removal

I think I've been doing something wrong for ages. Clue me in...

I've always heard that one should remove steel spark plugs from aluminum 
heads when it's all cold.

Then someone who ought o know says the opposite to me over the weekend. 
Claims the aluminum expands more than the steel and thus removing the 
plug would be easier.

Any wisdom you good folks can share either way?
