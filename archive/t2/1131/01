Okay - is the list wisdom that the foam won't lead to trapped moisture
and rust?

Chris in TN
Thank You Chris,
                   This is the info I need.
I am talking about spray foam, not the rigid board that comes in pink or
blue.
The foam I am talking about gets sprayed everywhere and sticks like the old
evil epoxy.
It also has no absorptive qualities to speak of.
In a house it is considered to be it's own vapour barrier.

Thanks a lot everybody,
I think this is a great thread,
Of course I started it,:)
Tim
