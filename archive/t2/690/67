Subject: Re: [T2] Off Topic - Jetta sites

nope, no idea of Jetta sites as I have no interest in newer VW's.

If I want a newer car I'll buy some else like my 97' V-8 Cougar. No brand
loyalty whatsoever when it comes to VW and newer vehicles. ;-)

The longer I look at the old stuff the more I like squarebacks and really
old bugs etc. but the new stuff is no different then every other car out
there, no interest in it. I'd rather buy something else.
