Hey Mark,
           It took me a few seconds of looking, asking "what's wrong with this 
picture?" and figuring out that the little bits were busted rivets.  My first 
question would concern what caused the camshaft to seize, so that the rivets 
got sheared off.  Looking at the elongaged holes in the timing gear, though, I 
wonder if something else was going on.  Can't imagine the factory produced the 
timing gear with elongated holes; so I wonder if the rivets worked themselves 
loose... maybe high friction in the camshaft bearings; maybe a reluctant tappet 
or tappets; or possibly some aftermarket (extra stiff) valve springs...???

An earlier digest talked about VW-Jetta threads.  I can tell you that a large 
percentage of the traffic on

www.tdiclub.com

is related to timing belt replacement, timing belt problems... stuff of that 
sort.  One seldom sees an image like yours.  Can you also advise what damage to 
pistons, valves, etc., you experienced?  Possibly we can converge on an 
explanation.

Finally took the time to split my old case (couldn't remember whether I 
had I windage tray -- I didn't).

Here's what killed me engine:
