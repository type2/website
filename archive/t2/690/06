I can attest to the white-knuckle driving.

On one of my last trips from OC-COS, I was driving a recently purchased 
Saab 900 S 4-door, and while I had basic faith in the vehicle, since it 
was an older model, I was still concerned when I hit that 100 mile 
stretch of "no one home."

Made it to the Springs without major problems, but on the trip back, 
blew the Water Pump (crazy install on Saabies...it goes in vertically 
through the top of the engine) and barely made it home. White knuckle 
driving on the 91.

Yo. Stay as flat as humanely possible.
