Hi,

Went out today with the philosophy: start with the simple stuff and do
everything one step at a time.

Step 1: Charged up batteries. I charged up 2, the one I had been using
and another spare of believed to be good condition.

Step 2: Cleaned up the battery to chassis ground strap. Found it to be
somewhat corroded at the body end.

Step 3: Reinstalled original battery.

She started up! Yay! Now i've got a lot of fine tuning to get the
idling problems solved - as she warms up she stalls out, but I've made
some solid progress.I'm pretty sure the ground connection was the most
recent fault. The temps being up into the 20's (F) (warm?!) probably
helped a bit too.

Thanks,
peace
Jules
