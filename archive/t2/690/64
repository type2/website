Subject: Re: Worst passes

We bought our 2nd bus in Jackson, oh about 7 years ago, and we traveled  that 
pass quite a bit.  It was all about taking it slow and enjoying the  scenery. 
 It really is a beautiful ride.  We traveled long trips all  over the 
country, taking 6-8 weeks at the end of each ski season in Blue the 78  bus, and the 
biggest problem we had was with Blue being a bit hot in Texas and  wanting a 
break on Galveston Island.  She wanted to sit at the beach for a  bit.  She was 
hot and needed a tap from the hammer on the solenoid and we  were good to go. 
Anyway.... we went over many passes in the Sierra's and  Cascade's and 
Rockies, but I do think Teton Pass is the grand daddy of them  all.
 
Just my $.02
 
Have a great day!

I too have taken the Teton pass going west.  I did it alone in  the
summer super early in the morning, brewed a pot of coffee while  driving,
drank about 3 cups with cream and sugar, and enjoyed the serenity  and
the engine temps never got about 240 during the climb.  However, if  you
do it at 5pm, with an anxious co-pilot, the threat of being rear  ended
by a car going 70 mph doesn't really seem so bad.  I think  engine
temperature and stress go hand and hand sometimes...   Additionally, you
can by-pass Teton pass going South of Jackson and it is  much, much
easier on the blood pressure and the bus.

>Have not done  that, but my personal "worst" was the drive from Jackson,
WY
to Victor, ID  on 22/33... Straight UP the face of the Tetons!  I can't
believe I  allowed myself to be talked into that!
