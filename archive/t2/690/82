Hello Mark  Either the cam and crank gears were binding  or the cam bearings 
or bore were bad.  could also just be defective cam.   I have seen this before 
and also seen the cam break right behind the gear . Could also be a problem 
with the oil pump either binding  or the oil flow being resticted . The rivits 
are the weakest point on a cam  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
