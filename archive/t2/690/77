Subject: how do I attach the thermostat cable to the thermostat?

Hello all - 
 
81 Vanagon, working on installing thermostat and flaps that PO took off.
 
Can someone describe how to attach the cable to the thermostat?  I ordered a new theromstat, cable, and bracket from the Bus Depot.  The thermostat has a nut on one end, and on the other a thread that looks like it takes a screw, but no screw came with the thermostat.  Bentley doesn't provide a clear enough picture to give me guidance.
 
Thanks for your help.
 
Marc
