Subject: Take *any* road

High road?  Low road?  I say go whichever way you like, but make sure you're
not in a hurry.  Sometimes we get too caught up in our vehicles' perceived
inadequacies.  These are go-anywhere, do-anything vehicles.  The only catch
is, it's on their terms.

Here are the terms:
1. Make sure your Bus is ready and in tune(*) for the trip before you go.
2. Remember to take it easy.

My strategy for steep uphill grades is simple: never push it.  On a 3rd-gear
hill, my Bus can do 45, but 40 takes a lot less throttle and is much easier on
the engine.  On a 2nd-gear hill it will do 30, but I never push it past 25.
Also, I *never* try to pass trucks -- the slowest, most heavily loaded truck
going up the hill is fast enough.

Also, at this time of year you'll have the heat on, and you will be able to
tell a lot by how much heat is coming out of the vents.  It's a very
noticeable change when you're going up a hill, and even more noticeable when
you push it too hard.

When in doubt, if you don't have gauges, pull over and sniff around in the
engine compartment, do the dipstick-grab test, whatever it takes to figure out
where you stand.  But unless you have a known mechanical problem or an engine
that's due to implode, why fear climbing a hill?

* to me, this means: timing is spot on, oil is fresh, not running lean, every
intake valve set to exactly .06 and every exhaust valve set to exactly .08,
and no unresolved mechanical problems.  also, if I were doing a long uphill
trip on dino oil instead of synthetic, I would change the oil to straight 30
weight instead of 10W30.

p.s. anyone who wants to discuss my oil recommendation, feel free to e-mail
me, but let's keep it off the list.  there's plenty in the archives.
