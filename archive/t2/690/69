Will,

Thanks for your reply!  It makes me feel much more comfortable that others
have had success on 'less than ideal tires'.

sounds like you are in pretty good shape with reinforced sidewall and close
to the correct max rated load at each corner, and also close to the standard
size.  I am not nominating myself the tire nazi; rather I am just pushing
the ideal now that I have figured it out.  I have been driving on less than
ideal tires for a long time, and trying to atone for my ways.
