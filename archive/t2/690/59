So, friends...an interesting discovery today.

While I was pulling off the blanket covering the driver's seat...I 
managed to lift the entire seat up.

Go figure, the seat was just "sitting there" and not attached to 
ANYTHING.

The bus is a 69.

The seat has an adjustment lever, and a round knob.

So...where the heck does this seat attach?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
