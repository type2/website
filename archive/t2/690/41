Subject: RE: [T2] Worst passes

I too have taken the Teton pass going west.  I did it alone in the
summer super early in the morning, brewed a pot of coffee while driving,
drank about 3 cups with cream and sugar, and enjoyed the serenity and
the engine temps never got about 240 during the climb.  However, if you
do it at 5pm, with an anxious co-pilot, the threat of being rear ended
by a car going 70 mph doesn't really seem so bad.  I think engine
temperature and stress go hand and hand sometimes...  Additionally, you
can by-pass Teton pass going South of Jackson and it is much, much
easier on the blood pressure and the bus.

>Have not done that, but my personal "worst" was the drive from Jackson,
WY
to Victor, ID on 22/33... Straight UP the face of the Tetons!  I can't
believe I allowed myself to be talked into that!
