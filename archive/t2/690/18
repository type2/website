I was viting in San Diego when I first did this, so heading back north
made no sense at the time.  Having discovered the route, force of habit
keeps me on it. I like the one you have laid out, tho, and will keep it in
mind.  Max elevation is only 2600 feet vs. 4200 and the slopes look
reasonable.

BTW, I screwed up the pass names, I think.  The one on I-8 is ?El Cajon?
and the one on I-15 is just ?Cajon?  Have I got that right, now?
