Subject: Re: [T2] Need help with the transmission

Dave! 
Thanks for the picture-links, I saved them. 
And thanks to everybody who came up with an idea. Now I just have to 
wait till the weather gets a little more "human", as now it just 
snowing and snowing and my hand almost frozed to the metal body of my 
bus. 
So I'm coming back if I need your knowledge, as soon as I can get my 
hands on the transmission.
