Would that be this Mount Washington:

And if so, then I wonder if anyone has participated in the race in a bus
(any vehicle built before 1970 is eligible).  I imagine an empty 1964-67
delivery van would have little trouble climbing and might even place
decently.  In that sort of event torque and cooling are all-important.  I
see that the list of makes displayed in 2004 includes Volkswagen, so at
least one bug has shown up.

OOK!
