Mark,
    I had the same thing happen to the engine in the 77 we used to
have.  If my memory serves me correctly it happened at about 132,250
miles on the original VW engine.  Once it happened, and I started
mentioning it to people, I came to find that it wasn't all that
unusual for those rivets to eventually fail.
