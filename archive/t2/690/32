Just get a set of gun cleaning rods, mops, nylon brushes, etc., and clean 
it out that way. That, plus a pack of pipe cleaners should clean just about 
any galley. Measure to figure out what size brushes you need for each 
galley. Prob a set of 9mm, 45 cal, 16 gauge and 12 gauge (for the oil 
pickup tube). Maybe some 22 cal brushes for snaking through the lifter 
oiling mechanisms. Don't use the copper brushed on your aluminum case 
unless you use the "spiral wound" kind without the sharp points. Total cost 
should be under $10 and you can use them again and again. See 
www.cheaperthandirt.com for cheap cleaning supplies.

Or, just get some nylon cord in various sizes and send that through there. 
Use a small piece epoxied to a larger piece to pull it through there. 
Soaked in solvent it will clean up most galleys, especially the lifter bore 
oilers where it is hard to get in there.
