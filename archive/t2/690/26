Have not done that, but my personal "worst" was the drive from Jackson, WY
to Victor, ID on 22/33... Straight UP the face of the Tetons!  I can't
believe I allowed myself to be talked into that!

And one trip from SLC over the Rockies was enough for me... when I hit
I-25 I turn right and go *around* those bad boys!

On a "schadenfreud" basis, the climb out of the the Columbia River gorge
on I-90 has always been fun.  Yes, you are in 3rd all the way, but all
those monster trucks towing boats that pass you at the bottom? Well, you
get to see them all again as you pass them, overheated by the roadside, as
you approach the top :-)  It's not very long, but it's VERY steep and you
can't ask a V-8 for 100% power for any length of time, the cooling just
can't keep up.
