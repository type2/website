Subject: Pickups, Storage units, and Volkswagen

Dear Mark,

Enjoyed your article on the new ridgeline truck.  You should know, however,
that Volkswagen had such a feature decades ago on their popular "Type II"
truck, commonly known as the Microbus, Transporter, Bus, Station Wagon, or VW
Pickup.  The pickup was available in single or double-cab configurations and
featured folding cargo bed sides that permitted a flat bed.  Between the
drivetrain and the cab was usually found a gear locker, lockable of course.

Volkswagen was ahead of its time on many innovations taken for granted today.
The VW Type II was the first van-like vehicle to offer a sliding cargo door,
the first to offer dual-side sliding doors (both ca. 1964), removable seats
(they called it the "Kombi" from the German word for "combination vehicle,
i.e., combination work truck/family station wagon), etc. etc. etc.

Sadly for us VW enthusiasts, we lost the bragging rights to these features
because they were introduced so long ago that most of today's automotive press
simply doesn't know about them.

But now you do.  Perhaps you could do an article on just how innovative
Volkswagen was, and remains, with its iconic line of air-cooled people-movers.
The website www.type2.com would be a great place to begin your research!
