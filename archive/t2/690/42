Subject: Re: [T2] How much?

Very good eye!!! I do have the cv boot and 2 new brake lines to do soon. 
Muffler is ugly but doesn't leak so the money will go to new tires.

I spent most of a day sanding little nooks and crannies in the engine 
bay...any grease at all will make the paint fish eye or not stick. Good luck 
with it!!
