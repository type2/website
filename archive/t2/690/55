What is this heat you speak of???? 

I doubt I'll get my heat going before I leave. Heck, I had to stop
working on the brakes today because of a (-at-)#%^^$ toothache. Sigh. I'm
not keen on being on Vicodin while working on the bus. I need all of
my wits about me to prevent another rolling-off-the-jackstand
incident. ;-)

I did get the correct HE's back in, as well as clean and paint the muffler. =D 

Here's pics. Keep in mind that the muffler is only a few months old.
