Subject: Diagnose a Fuel Injection Pump wiring problem

Working on the Green Bus in the Winter storm...(in the garage)
Can anyone lay out the steps to diagnose a fuel injection pump not working.
I have already proven that the pump is GOOD!(I ran a temporary (+)and(-)
lead to it and it went on)  But with the key on and the cover off the AFM, I
should be able to hear the Fuel Injection pump go on and pressurize the
system, when I move the dial inside the AFM.  This does not happen.  So is
it a wiring issue? Fuse somewhere?

Thanks,
John Baird
