Holy Crap, that's a lot of work done to a bus!

It's very nice looking but 25k is a bit out of hand. Maybe for someone 
who just wanted a beautiful, unique ride but then for that type of 
person they should have probably put in a engine that wouldn't require 
much owner attention.

The fire suppression system is intriguing though. Has anyone seen this 
before, or better yet done it?

I'm surprised that didn't have a hard cover for the spare tire... go 
figure :-?
