I forgot to mention in that last post...  DeLorme's TopoUSA software is,
in my book a "must have" for cross country trips.  Hours of fun and you
can discover routes *around* obstacles very easily.  I find the extra time
to travel down to San Diego and thru Yuma and Los Cruces well worth the
low slope. The brutal hill is over quickly and if I have trouble, I am
within AAA towing distance of VW shops.  I woudl NOT do this route after
April, tho...  just too damn hot!

Just playing around, I mapped a course thru Montana/Idaho that stays below
5K feet... I'm gonna try it next trip.  One of these days I *will* cross
the Rockies in fourth!
