In that part of the country, everything is comparative and "friendly" is a
little-used word in so far as the slopes are concerned.  It's friendlier
than other routes I have used.  WAY friendlier than the climb out of the
Colorado valley on I-15 or 40, which is the other choice. About the same
as the trip from Flagstaff to Albuqueque which is the comparative route on
I-40.
