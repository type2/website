Subject: This is strange

Picture of the old case, as split. Grunge in the sump seems right, but 
everything above the camshaft is as clean as the day I put this case 
together. Does that make any sense? There's oil on the crankshaft, and 
it's well oiled, but the area around the cylinders is clean and dry.

Curious.

I didn't use any sealer to seal this case, and it didn't leak. I don't 
know if I've got the guts to try that again.
