Subject: End Bus Snobbery

OK, it's still a holiday here.  A lot of good points raised,
especially that bit about only a POS beater '93 will wave
at you (I resemble that remark a bit too closely.)  But in
an effort to end bus snobbery everyone please fire up a
browser and look here:

http://www.vw.com/eurovan/index_f.htm

This is the VW Eurovan.  If you can get past the annoying
animation and get to the gallery you can watch the TV
commercial.  Note the VW symbol, the raised stiffners in
the roof reminiscent of the Vanagon, the still too flat nose
compared to US mini vans, even with the extended VR6
version.  '93 models are available for as little as $1100 with
blown engines (mine is proof) and off lots for as little as $4000
now days.  That means many of you could in fact sell your
bays or vanagons if you wanted and go buy one if you were
so inclined.  Not that there are any great reasons to do so.
It is however one of the few available US market VW's still
made in Germany (is the Passat still?)  Not that that means
anything either.

END SNOBBERY NOW.

When you see such a van pass you, wave at them.  If nothing
else you will make a yuppie soccer mother uneasy and nervous.
