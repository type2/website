Subject: Crank Shaft Seal Oil Leak

I have a nasty little leak (very minimal,actually, oil level and pressure are 
very much in line) in the crank shaft seal. Can this be repaired w/o pulling 
the whole engine? The shop wants 240.00, which is pretty reasonable around 
here, but good grief!!! Is this a do it yourself job, or should I suck it up 
and pay up?
