Subject: RE: Model name for 71 bus w/large mid sunroof 

hi diana - there is one such bus near my neighborhood. white, 1971, hatch
in the roof with canvas - not a full on pop top. has clean rear facing
seat. no sink, stove nor fridge. 2-seater bench and cabinet in the rear
cargo. needs repair under the windshield; and, the sliding door oddly
enough has bad ass rust under the SLIDER window. sliders on both sides!
interior is sharp. no cuts in the dash nor door panels. has an underdash
pioneer stereo. no major dents though a slight cosmetic ding at the left
front turn signal. an old sign laying on the rear hatch cushion said for
sale $2000, but the nearly bald tires are low, and it needs ALL the
exterior rubber seals replaced! customary teeny weeny oil drip prolly when
running. it is beginning to look sadder each day. without seeing the
engine, perhaps i'd offer a thousand. i'd go for the junkyard slider door
replacement. it is in eugene, oregon. if you're serious, i could further
investigate, or i have a phone number memorized.   -  steve
