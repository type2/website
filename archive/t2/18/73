Craig,
   Not long after we bought our 71 bus I had a similar problem
".....sputter, spit and backfire under acceleration....."
It turned out that the outlet filter screwed into the bottom of the gas tank 
was clogged.   Pull and replace that filter, flush the tank, and replace the 
regular gas filter.  That's what fixed the problem for me.
