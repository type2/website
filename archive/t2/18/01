No apparent fluid loss,  I wish there were, as it would make diagnosis a lot easier.  No fluid present inside the master cylinder boot.  
Bottom of all four backing plates are dry.  Considering that the free play after sitting accounts for at least a few ml of fluid, I'd expect to 
see evidence of leakage.  I haven't had a chance to look at it further, but bleeding the lines is the next step.  I suspect that the additional 
exercise of the master cylinder while bleeding will either cure it or kill it, probably kill.
