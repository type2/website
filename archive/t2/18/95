Subject: Re: [T2] Gas Tank Resurection

Hey Chris,

I had the same problem about a month ago with my 72.  Took out the firewall
(Fun, fun, fun) and low and behold rubber elbow was in pieces.

I looked eveywhere for the replacement part.  Found out that it was a one year
only piece and was no longer made.

Couple of people suggested air clean to carb connecting elbow (021128639).  I
bought it and decided that it would be safer with a piece of fuel line.

I just cut a piece long enough so it could make the turn without kinking.
Pushed it in on top of the tank and closed it up!  It seems to be ok.

Good luck.
