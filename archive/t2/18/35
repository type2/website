How do you open up the AFM cover??
The black plastic "cover" on the top is meant to be airtight, else
the air flowing under the cap is effectively a leak . But if you
have a broken flap, you have more serious problems than a leak.
Don't have any insight on new/rebuilt quality issues.
Good luck, sounds like it is time to warm up the bankcard.
Cheers,
Keith

opened up
the AFM cover and pressed the actuation lever to test the fuel pump,
and it ran fine.  Looked in Bentley to see if they had any ideas
(didn't have an ohm meter for testing) and came across the part which
said the air flap may stick closed after a backfire, and we had had a
