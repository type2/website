Subject: exhaust, EGR

	while driving Jenny (81 Westy aircooled) over the weekend she lost
her exhaust. The u bend from the crossover tube rusted through and the
exhaust broke off. So I need a new setup. The PO took the catalyst out so I
need one too. I noticed that the EGR filter was not hooked up but rather
cloesd off and the crossover tube did not even have a provision to hook up
the EGR filter. A few questions: why would one diconnect the EGR
filter/valve? If I put it back 'correctly' what potential problems will I
run into?
Additionally there seems to be a metal plate (heat deflector?) (attached to
the body above the muffler) (screwed on) and it is gone three quarters (can
you say rust?). The srews are still there. I haven't seen it anywhere at
busdepot etc. Any ideas?

	TIA Karl.
