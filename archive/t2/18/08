I disagree, there are probably darn few cars made today anywhere that will
not make it to 100k miles with little maintenence.

in VW Air Cooled era it was different but not today.  I would almost bet a
Kia, or Geo with oil changes at 25K would probably make it to 100K miles.

That's not the point.  

what is your objective in doing the work.

1. are you "Restoring" an antique. then yes OEM
2. daily driver.  Best value
3. beater.  anything that will keep it running

others somewhere in between.

I would hardly call my 78 pure stock, but it is basically stock in design,
yes I have Vanagon Seats, they are more comfortable on my 50+ year tush.

and yes I have a Pertronix, one of the things I always hated was
constantly fiddling with the points.

mine didn't come with a gas heater in the USA, but I ski and it gets
bloody cold on some of those mountains, I like heat

I plan on putting halogen lights on her too, can't stand not being able to
see where I'm going on dark nights with the puny headlights that were
mandated when my bus was built.

got rid of the Sage Green (never liked that color when new) and painted it
a color "I" like  (Metalic blue and Bright white, absolutely NOT VW color)

put in gauges that VW didn't think I needed either,
got synthetic oil in her too!

does that make it less than stock, well I would lose points in a show but
I drive her every day and I want it my way.  and I want to be comfortable
doing it.  heck that Blaupunt radio they put in em was just plain awful

and if the Windshield breaks (knock on wood) I will probably get PPG or
Safelite too.

all decisions are a "cost/benefit" decision, your values are different
than the kid driving a "Cool" bus to school, or me and my day in and day
out city driving.  Doc you live up in the Pacific NW,  I probably have
more people and thier cars within an hours drive than in your entire state
and the one South of you, I gotta take my bus out and play "bumper
cars" with these idiots every day!

  Driving through a "Not so nice" neighborhood the other night some kids
with nothing better to do threw an empty liquor bottle that smashed on the
side of my van. (good Krupp steel!) couldn't even find the scratch where
it hit... but that is where I have to drive and work...standards are set
by the enviornement one must survive in.  One of my reasons for the bus is
the high front seat, "can see em coming before they get you", defensive
driving is NOT an option in my neighborhood!  (and I'm here by choice, I
would go nuts out there were you live, I'm a born and raised city
slicker!)
