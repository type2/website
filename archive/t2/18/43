I seem to have developed a new problem.  My idle is slow & rough to the =
point of almost stalling & the idiot lights flicker.  The idle speed is =
fine at start up.  As the van warms up the idle gets slower & rougher.  =
When I try to raise the idle speed when it is warmed up it races when I =
start it cold.  The auxiliary air regulator is fine.  Any tip son what =
direction to look.  Thanks.
