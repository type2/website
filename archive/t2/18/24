Hi Will,

I once had a similar problem where all ignitition switched electrical items except the starter refused to work. Turned out to be a bad connection at the back of the ignition switch.

However your problem is all electrics failing including the 'idiot' lights in this case I would check to see if the nut holding the battery, alternator and fusebox leads onto the starter had come loose - after 1500miles  on a new starter the nut could easily have just worked loose.

Good luck
