Interesting.  You would think that in the UK, where you can be hung drawn
and quartered for using non-metric units (I exaggerate --- slightly) metric
sized hoses would be commonplace.  This doesn't appear to be the case.  I
have yet to find a source for any of the correct size hoses for my engine
except for the fuel line and carb-dizzy vacuum line, and these two were from
a main VW dealer.  If you want 1/4 inch, 3/8 etc, no problem.
Why?
