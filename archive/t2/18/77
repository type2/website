Subject: Make your own engine stand

Hi all:

A couple of years ago I rebuild 2 Vanagon engines, using a regular (American
iron, V8) engine stand that I bought for $10 at a garage sale plus a piece
of 1 1/8" plywood.

I cut a large square of plywood and attached that to the engine stand.  Cut
a fairly large circle (5" diameter??) in the middle of the plywood for
access to the flywheel end of the crank.  Drilled holes in the plywood where
the engine bolts up to the trans and they sawed "slots" from the sides of
the plywood to these holes; these "slots" allowed me to slide the two halves
of the engine together while the case was attached to the stand.  I also
ended up cutting some holes in the plywood (2" diameter??) right near the
forward pistons to give me freer access to those piston's piston pins.

For "sanitation" I then taped all cut edges with duct tape as well as the
face of the board.

This setup worked fine for assembly and disassembly.  When I wanted to work
with the engines in the stand with they flywheel attached I added short
pieces of PVC pipe, notched to clear the flange in the bellhousing mating
surface, as "standoffs" that allowed me to rotate the crank.
