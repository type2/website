The library tab on the type2 home page has lots of tire information to
consider. Check it out.
Cheers,

.............................  What do you think?  I have tried to locate
some tires like this with minimal luck.  One quote from a local tire store
here is for some Bridgestone 607V (I think that is right) for about $400 out
the door.  Ouch!  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated since this is
the last think I can think of to correct the front end problem.
