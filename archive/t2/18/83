Go with the linoleum.  My wife and I just took out the carpeting that a PO 
put in and replaced it with tile.  The linoleum will be easier to keep 
clean, and you can always put a throw rug over the linoleum.  We used 9/16" 
plywood.  We used regular grade plywood although the Home Depot guy 
recommended the Floor Grade.  We put on some "Armstrong Fast Setting Patch 
and Skim Coat" (S-184) on the plywood to even out the rough 
surface.  Instead of linoleum, we used tile squares which were 
self-adhesive.  It looks great and was relatively inexpensive.

Hope this Helps,

Joel
