Subject: Alighnment Required?

   Hi All. It's been a while since last posting. I changed servers and am
now back up and running. Went on a 3 day camping trip to Tobermory this
weekend. The bus is running great but I have a problem I need the advice of
the list to help ponder.
  The inner third width of my front tires are starting to wear weird. The
are scalloped and I'm not sure why. I didn't hit a curb or anything. I
checked the toe in and found there wasn't any. I used the two stick method
and after freeing up the tie rod I adjusted what I measure as 1/8" the toe
in. I guess I have to find a camber gauge to check that. I really don't know
what would have caused the wear. The front end is tight, tracks straight and
I never had this wear before.

What should I do? There are few alignment shops around and even fewer VWs.
I don't trust taking it in for alighnment unless they have done buses
before.

Thanks In Advance.
