Thanks Ted, it was nice to put a face with your email too!!  Enjoyed your
bus pendents and good conversation as well.  I couldn't believe I actually
won one of your pendants at the door prize drawing, thanks again!!  Looking
forward to seeing you next year, your right, this is a "must do" event for
anyone near the midwest.

It was too late to think of it, but maybe next year Bill could announce a
"list" meeting off to the side after the awards.  This should be SOP at any
event where they have central meetings.  I'm sure I missed meeting other
list members and would have enjoyed shaking their hands as well.

What a great way to spend Labor Day Weekend!!
