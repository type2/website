Subject: Re: [T2] Broken AFM in 78 FI Westy

A few years ago the AFM on my '76 would periodically stick open.  The 
bearings were going on the flap.  I got one from The Parts Place used for 
about $100.  Just gave them my part number and they sent an exact 
replacement.  Has worked great ever since.  After all,  every part on the 
road is a used part :>)  They guarantee all used parts to work.
