Subject: Boston Bob's Advice?

Volks,

78 Westy 2.0L F/I

Snipped here is a bit from "A Gearhead's View of Hydraulic Lifter Lore":
<snip>
The other problem I have seen is valves that do not close completely. The
symptoms of this are low idle when cold, hard starting, low power, plus the
power (vacuum) assist brakes may not work as well at times because of the
low manifold vacuum.
<snip>

I have these problems, en masse.  Boston Bob goes on to recommend:
<snip>
I set my rebuilt air cooled engines up with the valve lash of .006ths (i.e.
no pre-load). When the engine has run for an hour or two after initial
break-in I then pull the valve covers, bring each piston to TDC, and turn
the adjuster screws in ¼ to ½ turn.
<snip>

Do my symptoms CLEARLY indicate a need for valve adjustment?  Are there
other possibilities?  Consider that I've now about 1500 miles on a top-end
rebuild.  Is this a list-accepted method?

Cheers!
