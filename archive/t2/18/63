Yes, The tranny is off. Just not sure what two holes to use. So far It's been
suggested to use the two hole on the #1 cyl. side. I just don't want to distort
the case or drop end up dropping the thing on the floor. Still not sure If I
trust the
stand yet. Seems like it should have three arms at least. Anyonelse have the
floor stand from Bus Depot?
Thanks,
