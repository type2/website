Justin,

IMHO, guys like the Bergs, Boston Bob, John Connolly, Jack Raby etc. tend to 
lead list thinking because they are actively involved in research and 
experimentation in addition to retail sales and they understand well the role 
of the internet in spreading information AND misinformation.  Over time, 
their results show up in their products/service and word spreads through 
lists, shows etc. as customers start sharing their experiences.  This is 
certainly the case with the Bergs.  

Their work definitely provides an alternative to the local "gurus" who still 
recommend removing cooling flaps and thermostats, try to tell you that a 
chrome .009 magically produces more hp, that fuel injection is worthless and 
that type 4 engines are junk.

I'm following his adjustment procedure on a full rebuild that now has 2000 
miles on it.  I'm simply doing it to try and do everything possible for best 
performance and to give it as long a life as possible.
