The pushrod rests in the cup of the lifter, and is not "slapping" at .006

True, but Boston Bob does not say LEAVE it at .006.....he is just having it
set at .006 to lower the stress on the valve drain and lifter......sort of
like priming a pump.....hot oil is flowing into the lifter, and every now
and then the push rod presseds the lifter, expelling air gradually but
surely.

True, but if you watch your valve train work as you are giving the preload,
you can tell that this in effect is holding your valves open, until enough
oil is pushed out of the lifter to achieve zero clearance.

 Assuming the piston has 2mm of free play before it hits the

By setting the lifters as close to zero as possible, the drive train tension
is minimilized, and I am certain that over the course of time will lead to
longer life of the lifters.


People have been doing it the Bentley way for years..........that is why
Boston Bob's recommendations are to be printed in the next printing of the
Bentley......................no small task to get done...........and also,
Boston Bob has built more of these things that probably the whole list
combined...........he will always get the benefit of my doubt!!!
