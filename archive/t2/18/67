Subject: Re: [T2] oil leakage question

Mike, check the oil pump.  Also the oil filler tube.  If there are leaks
there, the oil will get sucked over the bottom of the fan housing and onto
the mesh and fan blades.  The fan then sprays oil mist over everything.

Contrary to popular belief, you don't have to drop the engine to remove the
oil pump, but you do have to remove the fan housing and loosen the rear
engine support, with the motor jacked up, of course.

Regards,

Grant
