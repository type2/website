Given the fancy cumputerized alignment equipment available today, there
is no reason a shop/tire store posessing such equipment couldn't do the
alignment.  I took mine to Goodyear after noticing excessive wear on the
INSIDE edge of the tread.  Take the Bentley with you so the specs can be
read.  I needed a camber adjustment in one wheel and my self adjusted
toe was too far in.  They had the wrench needed to adjust the camber nut
on the upper ball joint.
   Scalloping can be due to loose bearings, loose tie rod ends or
steering lever, bad steering damper, poor balanced tire, or a
combination.
