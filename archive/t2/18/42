Type 2  Fan's

I am attempting to find a 71 bus with the large mid section sunroof and a pullout bed with cabinets. I owned one 20 years ago and now want to start living my youth all over again. Could any one help me understand which model bus I am looking for. This was not a pop top and did not have a sink or a fridge.Just the rear pull out seat and westy vanity closet.  Any help on model name or location of one in good condition would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you to all

Dana
