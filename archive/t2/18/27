Subject: Maiden Voyage

Hi All!

I took my 71 westy out yesterday on it's first real maiden voyage since the 
engine rebuild. Everytime before I have driven it it has been for short 
distances. 
I got the bus put back together after the paint last weekend, and it still 
has to go to the bodyshop for a quick wetsand and buff to get all of the 
overspray off. 
I am really hoping to make the Busses by the Sea get-together in OC this 
weekend, but think the bus is running too hot to make it there as is. 
Yesterday, on my trip, the bus seemed to be running very, very hot. It 
smelled like it was going to catch fire! When I stopped, smoke poured from 
the back vents, but no fire, just running hot. 
This is what I know. The engine was just rebuilt with essentially all new 
parts except the block and crank. It still has less than a hundred miles on 
the rebuild, so seems premature for the valves to be adjusted, but is there a 
chance that they are not gapped far enough apart and making it heat up so 
quickly?(mind you this was maybe a ten to twelve mile trip yesterday). Oil 
levels are good. Seems to have good power down low, but seems very sluggish 
in fourth. (I haven't driven a bus on the highway before-but this doesn't 
feel like it has nearly the power of my 1500 ghia up top) From forty to fifty 
took miles.

Any thoughts? All help is appreciated. I pulled out the Muir guide and my 
Chiltons, but neither seem to have much on it overheating.

Thanks all!
