Subject: Re: [T2] Bug-o-Rama #48 trip report (pictures, yay!)

Your welcome for the reminder, had a great time.  I saw your posted pics,
and had to comment on the picture of the beater bus with flames.  The
owner of that bus is actually Jason Lang, he races for Bad Dog Racing,
and ran mid-19's all weekend, with reduction boxes!  The dual carb'd
1835 helps ;) He broke the shift coupling in the 3rd round of eliminations.
 After installing a pair of 40 Kadrons, I'm thinking of taking my bay
out for the next Bug-O!


Thanks,
