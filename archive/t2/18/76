Almost has to be gas. Letting it sit allows gas to get past an obstruction
and into the line, which allows the carb to fill and it runs for a while.
Check to make sure the tank is vented, then check the gas line, then
finally the filter in the tank. (That'sn probably the culprit, but it's
also the hardest to check, so do the others first.

82 Westy and a 1978 Yamaha SR 500 which I just cured of a mysterious gas
problem.
