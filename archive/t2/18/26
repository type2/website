Subject: Any listees in Austin, TX?

Hi all (or should that be "all y'all"?),

I am going to be in Austin, TX for a week soon and I should hopefully have a
free day on Saturday September 22.  If there are any listees in the area I
would love to meet up for a chat, beer etc and see what US buses look like.
Please p-mail me if you are interested by the end of the week, because I
will be in Brussels next week and won't be able to pick up my mail.
