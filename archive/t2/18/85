Kevin,
    You said "...with the carpet I probably will just lay it down on the bus 
floor, with linoleum I would put a thin piece of plywood down and the glue 
the linoleum to that) or is this just a personal preference?"
   Well there may be more to it than just preference.  I know in our 71 the 
rear seat/bed and the jump sear bolt to metal standoffs on the bus's floor.  
Your floor covering should be at least as thick as those standoffs are tall. 
  If not there will be gaps under your furnature.
I just made a new floor this past winter and used 11/32 plywood as the 
bottom layer with 1/8 thick masonite as the second layer and glued down 
armstrong comercial grade tile over that.  That came out to just a little 
thicker than the standoffs are tall.  This gives me a floor that is both 
durable and waterproof.
   Hope this helps.
