Subject: Gas Tank Resurection

Took the gas tank out of my 72 bus the other day and found out why the thing 
always smelled like gas.  Turns out the rubber fitting that forms a right 
angle and connects the gas tank to the vent pipe was hard, cracked, and 
leaking.  There was a large stain on the tank where gas would slosh out of 
the vent and drip down the back of the tank.

I am in the process of replacing all the rubber hose conectors between the 
long vent pipes that go up into the air intake vents.  But I havn't been 
able to find anthing that will replace the rubber fitting that forms a right 
angle.  The VW part # is 211 201 157.  I thought of maybe just using some 
rubber fule line hose instead, but it is a sharp angle between the vent 
ontop of the gas tank and the pipe that leads to the vent in the filler 
neck.  It also has to have clearance once the firewall is reinstalled.

Does anybody have any suggestions as to what to use in place of a stock 
part?  Or is this part availale somewhere?  I checked Bus Depot.

Also, the fuel filler neck is in ok condtion.  It is not cracked at all and 
is still semi plyable.  I know I might catch flack for reusing it.  Would 
something from Bus Depot work.  Like the one for a 73, or 74 and up?



Thanks,

Chris

72 Bus
