Subject: How to use engine stand from Bus Depot.

A quick question on how to use a free standing engine stand I bought
from Bus Depot. What two holes do I use to
bolt it up to? It seems that it is not enough support. I am trying to
bolt up a 2.0 from a 78 Westy. Could this be just for
the earlier engines? I have a good used engine I want to redue the
gaskets on and clean up for a quick install into my bus.

Thanks,
