doesn't even matter, The T2 HAD to meet American (assuming you have USA
bus, fill in country of choice here) legal requirements. The glass
requirements in the USA are different than in Germany.  When I lived there
if you wanted to bring a German bus into the USA you had to change a
number of parts to be USA legal, one of them was the windshield.

so I would highly suspect that VW probably imported from the USA the glass
used in export models, or at least made em to USA spec
