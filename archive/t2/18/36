Subject: Exhuast - Manifold - Head studs

I am replacing the exhaust manifold in my 78' bus.  While I'm doing so I thought that I should replace the studs because some of them are so rusty I think they will snap next time I try and remove them.  Some of the studs came out because the nust were rusted to the ends but some of the studs remained in the head... The question I have is, Is there a proper way of removing the studs minimizing my chances of snaping one???  What is the best way??  Thanks, Mike
