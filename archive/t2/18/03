I'm surprised that he did this to someone in the trade.  They usually reserve this sort of BS for private parties.  It's almost SOP for any sort 
of automotive service to have them get into the job far enough that the vehicle isn't drivable and then find "additional problems" to be fixed. 
 There are honest folks out there, but the bill-padders seem to be in the majority.  Then folks wonder why I am loathe to take my cars to 
mechanics.  Unfortunately, the bad apples have tainted the business for all.

He didn't care.  He was gambling with your money.

My gut feeling is that he'll find out what the wholesale price is for the Sigla and then "suddenly find out" that it isn't available.  He'll have 
the PPG glass and his hope is that you will go for that deal.  If you don't, he isn't out any money and he's under no legal obligation to 
provide you with the parts he promised.

They survive because their business isn't one that gets a lot of return traffic.  Their customers need their vehicle and are anxious to get it 
back on the road.  Such people are ripe for plucking.

Seems that there are quite a few auto glass outfits out there.  Have you considered trying a different one?  Better to pay more than deal 
with a liar.

Which the paper probably won't print.  Wouldn't do to offend a potential advertiser, and they open themselves up to libel suits.

Good policy.  I wish you the best in your auto glass odyssey.
