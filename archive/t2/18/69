I share your concern.  When suspending an engine ( 1600 dual port) from the
stand i fear breaking off one of the studs or a peice off the case.  Has
anyone ever broke a case using one of these engine stands, and have any
preventitive tips for us?  

	I can't imagine hanging a 1700 or 2 ltr type 4 style engine on the 2
arms of the stand.  I would definetly set it on the ground or worktable.

The reason just two holes are used is so you can remove 1/2 the crankcase
with the engine attached to the stand. Every VW engine stand I have seen has
just the two mounting points.

Sorry Bill for responding twice but I forgot to CC the list the first time
:)
