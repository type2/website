Hey there Bill,

Yep, if you have passenger tires that's definitely a problem. Get
some 185R14's on the bus and it'll drive better.

I had bought some Yokohama 356 (d rated) 185r14's and put them on my
79. It was a great improvement over the mismatched (all 4 tires were
different brands) that were on the bus when I bought it. I shopped
around for tires, got estimates (~60 per) in writing (computer
printouts these days), and got a set of 4 for $304 mounted, balanced,
etc. Tirerack.com probably has them for around $55 each, but you'll
still have to get them mounted, etc. You can play the same game with
the 607's (pricematching), I would assume that with the trouble
firestone/bridgestone is having, you should be able to get a better
deal then $400. 

Check the type2.com library and archives too. Steve Dolan has a write
up on the different brands avail in the library . George Lyle likes
the 607V's, so search on 185 and 14, and you should find alot of good
reading in the archives.

I didn't see you mention the steering dampner, so if you haven't
checked (or replaced) it, that's another thing to look at. When I
bought my 79 it didn't have a steering dampner. With the mismatched
passanger tires and the lack of the damperner, it was quite a ride !!

P.S. Is your sister Kate single ?? 8^)

Hope this helps,
