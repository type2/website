Yes, been there and done that.  I already sent a reply directly to Bill
about this.  The type 2 and type 4 engines are much heavier than the type 1
or type 3.  Using only two arms, we have seen the case crack due to the
excessive weight of the engine.  Because of this, we use a two arm fitting
to assemble the short block.  Once assembled, we switch to a four arm
fitting to assemble the remainder of the engine.

I share your concern.  When suspending an engine ( 1600 dual port) from the
stand i fear breaking off one of the studs or a peice off the case.  Has
anyone ever broke a case using one of these engine stands, and have any
preventitive tips for us?  

	I can't imagine hanging a 1700 or 2 ltr type 4 style engine on the 2
arms of the stand.  I would definetly set it on the ground or worktable.

The reason just two holes are used is so you can remove 1/2 the crankcase
with the engine attached to the stand. Every VW engine stand I have seen has
just the two mounting points.

Sorry Bill for responding twice but I forgot to CC the list the first time
:)
