Exactly where it should be!

Yup - that's an annoying thing about the 009 - makes hooking up those 
plugs kinda weird.

And it's amazing that people still think the 009 is the best thing since 
sliced bread.  Granted, if you're running around at WOT all the time, 
it's not that big of a deal.  But for drivability, the SVDA wins hands-down!

Hmm... yeah, I'd check into that more closely.  If I remember correctly, 
the wire that runs to the coil also runs up to the ignition switch. 
When the engine was spinning, you were essentially grounding that line, 
and it's not fused.  So you might want to do some continuity checks to 
see if that main ignition +12 line got messed up.

Might have to do with the above.
