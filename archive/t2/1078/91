Frozen selenoid?  They typically fail when they get hot.
They cool off and start working again. That's been my
experience.

Also, I use a remote starter switch for engine diagnosis.
It was always a pain to get under the bus to hook it up.
So I ran a permanent wire from the selenoid into the engine
compartment. It is well shielded to prevent grouding. Now
when I want to use my remote starter, I hook up to this
wire and the battery ground. Voila!
