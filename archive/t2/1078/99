The cables stick in place where the tubes rusts where they were tack welded to
the body. Before getting them out spray the spray of your choice (WD40, etc)
into both ends of the tube before attempting removal and during removal. If
you're in luck they will come out easily. I had to cut a tube and replaced a
section with copper tube and pipe clamps (out of sight!). When you put the new
ones in make sure you've got the left and right cables in the correct tubes!
Also coat the outside of the cable with grease to ease its progress.

To avoid the problem recurring it helps to get some lubrication into the cable
before installation. I don't know what the best way to do this is. Make sure
you regularly work the heater levers during the entire year will also help.
