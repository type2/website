Subject: RE:Bus graphics

Here some ideas: at the Dupil-color
(http://www.duplicolor.com/products/carart.html) website they have stencil to
paint flames, etc. find the graphic you want to do or draw one on the
computer, print them and cut it out, tape to car, spray it out. If you want
different colors you could uses different stencil on the same spot, just
remember that lightest color first.  And to make real fun check out the
discount auto paint at your local auto parts store or ask local body shop if
they have any paint left over. Here in Colorado, where I am at, the local dump
gives away auto paint, if you sign that you promise to use and not sell it.
