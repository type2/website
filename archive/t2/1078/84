Subject: Heater cables

Hi all,
I hope everyone had a great Forth!

I already have my engine on the bench and am in the process of reassembling
it. I notice that the heater boxes were not connected because the cables
going to the front of the vehicle were shredded at the ends and look like
they are frozen in place. Are there any articles on how to replace these and
a source for same.

Thanks in advance.

Bob
