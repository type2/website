I had the same problem with the clutch cable. Make sure you route the cable
the same way as the old one. If you don't you either end up with it too long
or too short. Also, if you removed the arm under the bus that controls the
clutch petal, make sure that is installed correctly. That will also make the
cable seem as though it is too long.

Ok, today I removed the new cable. Cable looked fine.

Put it next to my old cable, same length.

Reinstalled new cable. Put a couple of washers on the bowden tube to get a
more accurate bend.

Checked pedal assembly. Ok.

I'm 95% sure there is nothing wrong with the cable, bowden tube, or pedal
assembly.
