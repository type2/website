You can pay for all the tools and do it yourself for less than a mechanic 
would charge for the one job.  After you're done you will have the 
tools, knowledge and confidence that you can do this and similar jobs.

Dropping a VW engine isn't rocket science.  Set a weekend aside, get out 
the bentley manual and spend some quality time with your bus!
