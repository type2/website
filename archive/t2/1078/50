Subject: RE: [T2] Removing firewall with engine fitted

Hi Dave,

I have a '78 Westy. I took my firewall out and didn't know about the hidden
screws. I had to use a screwdriver to get the top corners started. Once I
did that, it dropped out fairly easily.

Don't cut a hole over the gas float. I've seen some pretty nasty hack jobs
done instead of pulling the engine.

Thanks for all the replies on this.  A lot of you have asked if I have taken
out the two lower screws: yes I have had the firewall out before so know
about that.

What I am doing is pushing the firewall upwards as far as it will go then
pulling the bottom out.  There is a kind of flange welded to the other side
of it that will not clear the top of the front engine tin (the part where
the foam goes).  I am starting to wonder if they changed the design of the
firewall at some point (mine is a '78).

Mike Benthin suggested the 'cut a hole above the tank' method.  Thanks Mike,
but I was kind of saving that for a last resort!  I think it would be
quicker to just drop the engine.
