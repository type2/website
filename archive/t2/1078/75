Subject: new tranny '79

I just had a re-built tranny put in my '79 Type 2. First tranny since I've
bought her, 20 years ago.

This new tranny is very stiff. I'm having the clutch adjusted next week.

Would anyone know if the shifter will loosen up or is this just normal for a
re-built?

I did replace the shifter, shift kit too.



Thanks.
