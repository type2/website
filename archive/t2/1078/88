Subject: Re: [T2] Starter

I believe I just tracked down a similar probablem that I've been having
with my '71 (also with hot start relay installed).  

I think my problem is a bad ground strap.  I came to this conclusion by 
meausuring the voltage: 
  (1) at the coil (or starter), and 
  (2) directly from the battery + terminal (to the chasis)

I noticed a significant (~0.8 or 1 V IIRC) difference in the voltage in 
those two locales.  I have not tested my theory yet (i.e. cleaned where
the ground strap hits the chasis), but it's now on the .todo list.

The odd thing about the problem, however, is that bridging the starter
terminals with a screwdriver *ALWAYS* works (but also always worries
me that I'm going to crush myself by leaving the car in gear or some 
such - therefore, I'm VERY careful when I do this).

Any thoughts or additional theories would be appreciated.

Cheers,
   Tom
