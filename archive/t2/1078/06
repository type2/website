Subject: THE PLEASURES OF A VACUUM ADVANCE DISTRIBUTOR

A lot of people seem to prefer the various vacuum advance distributors, 
but I am  in a peculiar circumstance in that every time I go anywhere, 
it involves an altitude change of 1000 feet.  My suspicion is that 
vacuum advance, or the lack of it when going up-hill, tends to generally 
make things run on the warm side.  I have a '72 bay with a pretty new 
crate engine that I was lucky enough to find (it had been in a warehouse 
for 25 years or so..) and I am using a centrifugal distributor from and 
early porsche 914 with good results.  I believe it is similar to the 009 
with a somewhat longer advance curve.
