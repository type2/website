Subject: 76 bus starts, run 10 secs, dies

greetings,

The subject line summarizes the situation.

Its a recently purchased 1976 bus with a stock 2 liter engine and stock fuel injection.? A week ago it was given a post purchase clean bill of health from a local VW shop.

The bus now runs for 10 to 15 seconds each time it is started, then dies.? 

Can anyone help me "short-cut" the troubleshooting with advice based on experience or heresay?

thanks!
