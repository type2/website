This spring broke on the 75 bus; we noticed it when the pedal would not 
come all the way up.  We put an eyebolt into the wall behind the 
throwout arm and ran a spring between the arm (under the wing nut) and 
the eyebolt. Has worked around 3 years now.

  Oh, and if you replace the fork, replace the throwout spring outside the
  transmission while you are at it.  It's a $2 part and they tend to fail
  as they get old.  They're a bear to replace so if you're going to have
  the fork out anyway save yourself some future grief.
