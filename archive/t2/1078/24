Pedal moves coming out of the bowden tube and pulling on the shift lever.
The shift lever moves only about an inch toward the front, regardless of
how much I turn the wingnut. (I put small vice-grips on the cable to keep
it from twisting.)

Going to remove the cable today and verify bowden tube deflection. I'll
replace the clevis pin too. I discovered I had a new wingnut, clevis pin
and rubber boot after I had put everything all back together.
