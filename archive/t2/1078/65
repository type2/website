Hi Darren,

I just completed a transmission swap on my bus yesterday, so I will chip 
in while the experience is fresh in my mind....

I generally prefer to leave the transmission in place when I remove the 
engine, except when I specifically need to have the transmission out of 
the bus.

Putting the engine back in I find that it helps to remove the two bolts 
connecting the bell housing to the frame so as to lower the transmission 
slightly and make it easier to get the engine to line up with the 
transmission. I don't worry about the front transmission bolts or the 
shift linkage when doing this.

Happy Trails,
