Subject: Re: [T2] carb leaking

Hi Tom,
there could be two causes: First I would check if the float valve is not
working, resulting in the carb being flooded with fuel. If you run it on
idle, throttle plate will be closed and the excessive fuel is draining
out of the throttle shaft. Other reason could be that the throttle shaft
bushings are worn out so you got excessive play at the shaft. This
results in either fuel draining out of the carb or air being sucked into
the carb. Either is not good and you should replace the bushings. Be
careful, if it was your float valve not working: It could be that a lot
of fuel has been dripping into the combustion chamber even after
shutting off the engine. Fuel in your oil will kill your bearings in no
time! So better change the oil than be sorry.
Cheers,
Timo
