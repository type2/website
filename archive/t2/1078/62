Hi Bob,

I most always cross at Fort Erie. Niagara Falls usually has much longer 
lines. Ganonoque is another easy crossing point if you are coming in 
from the east of Toronto.

I have never been hassled by Customs and Border Services, nor have they 
ever given my bus more than a cursory look-see. OK, one time they did 
pick through my cooler with a fine tooth comb, but that was in Port 
Huron, and I don't usually cross there.

But... I have always traveled with the whole family. Single males 
usually get more attention as a rule.

Leave your guns and non-prescription pharmaceuticals at home and it 
should be smooth sailing.



Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
