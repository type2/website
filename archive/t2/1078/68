Hi Adam,

I got that once when crossing at Port Huron, MI. Probably would have 
been fine if we had been able to answer the guard's question about what 
we had in the cooler. But because we'd already been camping in western 
Ontario for a few days, we really had no idea precisely what was inside. 
So we waited for someone from the US Dept of Food & Agriculture to 
inspect our cooler, confiscate some malicious fruit and send us on our way.

My return trip has pretty much always been a breeze. Not too surprising 
though; considering my ride:
