Unfortunately I don't, but honestly, it's not that hard (besides the 
fact that you'll spend hours under the bus).  Just pull out as much of 
the old heater cable and then stuff something else in there see if you 
can figure out where the "clog" is.  Then just cut that section out and 
either clean the existing tube out and then put it back in, or replace 
it with some comparable copper piping from Home Depot.  You'll need a 
good hack saw the cut through the pipe and/or a dremel tool or some 
kinda cutting tool to cut the welds.  Make sure that if you replace any 
of the piping, that it ends up being about the same length as the old 
piping and just zip-tie it in place.  If you cut a section out, just use 
some clear hose that fits on snug to seal the junction and put some zip 
ties around it to keep any water out.  There's no need to put grease or 
anything in there as you're just going to end up sliding the new heater 
cables back in there and then hope they last for another 20 years.

We used a similar method for my friends clutch cable tube.  It got some 
kinda nasty grease clog in there so we figured out where the clog was, 
cut that section out, cleaned it, and then put it back in with some hose 
over each cut and zip-tied it on.  Worked like a charm.
