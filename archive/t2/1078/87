Subject: Starter

1977 Westfalia, already has a starter relay.

My bus has had an intermittent starting problem for a few years, it didn't
want to start 2 or 3 times a year after extended drives, over an hour
without stopping.

Now it does it every time I drive for an hour and it needs a long time to
recover, twice it hasn't been enough to leave it overnight, it had to be
push-started the next morning......Soooooooooo.....I guess it is time to fix
it.

Can somebody please tell me what they know is wrong so I can skip the whole
diagnosis step, I am a horrible combination of busy and lazy right now and I
am leaving for the Oregon Country Fair in 3 days.

Thanks,
James
