check it step by step.

. when pedal is pressed does the front end pull the cable (take the
cover off under the pedals)
. does the cable move at front but not at back?
. does the cable move at the back but not move the shift lever on the
side of the tranny.

just follow the problem from the front to the back.  I doubt it is the
bowdon tube because it worked before.  personally it sounds like a
pedal or cable issue.
