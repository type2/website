Hi Martin,

There's a very talented fellow on the www.fullmoonbusclub.com site who 
goes by the name "paintedbus". If you do a search there you can see his 
work and learn how it's done.

Short answer: Diligent prep work + good quality enamel + clear coat.

Your local sign shop can point you to a supplier of quality lettering 
enamel that make custom graphics much easier to pull off.


Happy Trails,
