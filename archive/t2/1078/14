I found some small truck ramp stands at Pep Boys and put a big block
of wood inside the opening also., (said I was paranoid about this)
the blocking is 4X10s I found being thrown away and cut to about 2ft
lengths and put these under the center rear of the van just in front
of the front tranny mount. (I do have a lowered floor van so this is
easier)

and of course all wheels are blocked.

if I jack up one side I also wrap a cable around the door post and run
it back to a garage beam so it can't tip over.

be safe

Bob
