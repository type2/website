Yes.

No.

Pedal moves cable at front, as evidenced by observing it before it goes
into the cable tube at the front of the bus.

Pedal moves coming out of the bowden tube and pulling on the shift lever.
The shift lever moves only about an inch toward the front, regardless of
how much I turn the wingnut. (I put small vice-grips on the cable to keep
it from twisting.)

Going to remove the cable today and verify bowden tube deflection. I'll
replace the clevis pin too. I discovered I had a new wingnut, clevis pin
and rubber boot after I had put everything all back together.

When I first put the new cable in, everything worked great. I just kept
losing cable tightness.
