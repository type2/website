yes many times. at least 8/10 injected buses that see our shop need  
these mounts replaced. i can't count how many buses have zip ties  
holding the pump to the frame because some owner or mechanic is too  
lazy to fix this properly. they are not easy but i have never yet  
been beaten by one. you need a 21mm wrench iirc for the mount, if the  
stud breaks sometimes you can bend the bracket on the frame to get  
vice grips on the other side. heat it dull red, penetrant and it will  
come.
