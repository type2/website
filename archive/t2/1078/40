Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Welding Question

John, I think I HAVE that Century welder. :-) It has a high and low setting 
only, and then wire feed speed controller, and is set up for gas. Sound the 
same? I was wondering if I could get good welds with it, as I've only played 
on a piece of angle iron with it set up with flux-core wire? Someone told me 
it was junk, so I was a bit disheartened.
