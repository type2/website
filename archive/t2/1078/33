Subject: Re: [T2] Update: Clutch problems

This definitely indicates something wrong inside the bell housing.   
With the engine installed on the transmission (and assuming nothing's  
broken on the inside) it would take superhuman fingers to move the  
clutch arm by hand.

As George already pointed out; pulling the engine isn't that bad.  The  
first time is the most exciting; after you've done it a few times  
you'll wonder why you ever hesitated.  It helps to have a couple of  
strong friends with you, by the way.

Good luck!
