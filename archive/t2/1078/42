Subject: Removing firewall with engine fitted

Some time last year I was asking about changing the fuel sender with the
engine in, and Bob (accessys) kindly sent me some tips on how to do it.

Well I have finally got round to doing it, but I am having trouble getting
the firewall out.  I have removed all the screws and the foam engine seal,
but the bottom edge of the firewall just won't clear the front tinware, so
of course I can't then pull the firewall down clear of the metal tabs at the
top.  Any ideas what I am doing wrong?
