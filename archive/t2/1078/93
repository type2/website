I'd try cleaning all the connections and make sure they're pristine.  
That includes battery, starter, grounds, and the ground strap that runs 
from the tranny to the chassis.  If you still have the old starter cable 
that runs from the starter to the battery, change that out.

Like someone mentioned, a remote starter is handy for diagnosis.  If you 
get to a situation where it won't start and the remote starter doesn't 
kick the engine over, then you know it's either the starter or the 
wiring running from the battery to the starter.  If it does kick over, 
then it's probably the wiring up front not being able to supply enough 
juice to the solenoid.  However, because you have the relay, my guess 
would be old wiring and/or starter on its way out.

Regardless, you can always push the bus ;)
