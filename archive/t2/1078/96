Subject: Re: [T2] Urgent Generator help needed

Did you charge the battery with a plug-in charger, after repairing the

The generator will try to charge the flat battery and many old units  
with overheat with the load. Hence what my grandfather used to say, "a  
jump-start is only to get to a service station to get a full-charge".
