Subject: Bus steering boxes

Was just reading Mark Paxton's entusiast's restoration manual,....Volkswagen
Bus, and in the section on "steering Box"...he explains availability of
steering boxes for 'Bays", then states "a steering rack conversion is now on
the market".  Has anyone ever heard of this setup for a "Bay"?  Thanks.
