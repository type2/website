Well, I've got my ATV jack and today I embark on my engine removal.
This may be a (VW) religious opinion. Some say lower trans with the
engine, some say not. Which is easier?  If I lower the rear of the
transmission with the engine, do I just have to loosen the front
transmission mount bolts? Or is there more to it?
