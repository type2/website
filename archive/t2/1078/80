Subject: Re: [T2] Update: Clutch problems

I'm advocating for removing the transmission along with the engine.   
This requires removing from the transmission several parts: shift rod  
coupler; nose cone mounting block; reverse indicator switch wires;  
ground strap; CV joints; and upper bell housing mounting bolts.  The  
Haynes manual has a fantastic write up on how to do it (although they  
fail to mention the upper bell housing bolts).
