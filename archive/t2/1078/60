I know very little about welding, but when my friend let me borrow his 
small 110v wire-feed lincoln welder, I went to town with it.  By the end 
of the day I had a 2ft tall structure of all sorts of metals welded 
together and managed to finish all of the gas as well.  Some of the 
steel was thick, some thin, but the welder never had any problems 
keeping up.  I think that thing probably ran him around 400-600 bux or 
so.  I don't know exactly what model it was, but it was a small one.. 
but it worked great!
