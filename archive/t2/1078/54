Subject: Bus graphics

I have a 71 Westfalia, Feelmore, that I want to add some graphics to...

http://picasaweb.google.com/T2Wagen/Feelmore?feat=directlink

I have thought of painting them on (I painted him in these pics) but was
thinking that if I painted them on it would be easier to brush paint the
graphics.  Not ever doing brush paint graphics before, I am not sure what type
of paint to use and what type of prep (other than a good paint prep cleaner)
would be recommended.

Another idea would be vinyl graphics.  But this is a fun vehicle and I don't
want to spend a huge amount of cash on the project.

Any suggestions, ideas, and advice any of you could give would be greatly
appreciated.

Thanks,
