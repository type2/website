Subject: Clutch problems

While driving home the other day, it became hard/impossible to get into
1st/2nd gear...clutch pedal felt different. Figured it was the cable.
Replaced cable and bowden tube. The transmission mount was cracked,
but the way it is installed, it is solid and does not move.  Had to use
washers for spacers because I ran out of thread adjusting the cable.
Everything installed, adjusted. Drove around block fine, but adjust was
not where I had it. Re-adjusted, drove about a mile or two. My adjustment
had changed again (clutch engages as pedal is just off the floor).
Went to change from 1st to 2nd gear, felt a pop, pedal to the floor, no
clutch. I figure it was the mount or cable. Looked underneath and
everthing was solid and looked just like I left it. However, the pedal
goes to the floor. I adjust the cable again...even more spacers, but
pedal still goes to the floor and wont disengage the clutch. When a
helper presses the pedal, the clutch lever does not move as much as
I expect it should.

I wonder if my bowden tube does not have enough bend in it. Any ideas?
Is this a more serious clutch issue, requiring and engine drop?
