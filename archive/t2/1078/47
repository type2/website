There is a lot of difference in the MIG wire brands.  I recommend, and use
Rockmount -Nassau.  Yes, is is much more expensive (3x-5x), but how much wire
and rare sheet metal do you want to waste using cheaper stuff.  Sticking globs
to body panels and having the wire feed without arcing, spraying impurities
all over the surface, etc.  Using good wire is the least expensive part of the
process, and it makes a great deal of difference in ease and quality of the
weld.  Run it through a Miller and it will make you look really good.  The
reps are very helpful and will often have samples if you need to try something
different for a special project.
