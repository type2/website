Regarding the thread on nose-mounted spare tires:

To answer the question marks,

Imagine getting hit across the shoulders with a 2 x 4 (You know, like  
in one of those stupid "pro wrestling" shows). It would hurt like a  
blank, but you would survive, like the wrestlers do. Now imagine  
bolting a billiard ball to the 2 x 4 and getting hit across the  
shoulders. It would break your spine and the 2 x 4 instead of  
displacing the force across your back and across the length of the 2 x  
4.

The spare tire is the billiard ball, the 2 x 4 is the nose of your bus.

Graphic, but relatable if anyone has seen a WWF wrestling match...

With all the talk of gas prices and mileage, every 1/8 of a mpg  
counts! :) ROTFLMAO2
