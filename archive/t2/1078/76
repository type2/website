When replacing or even removing and reinstalling the shifter it will most likely not go back in in the same placement. I have found shifters are a pain to get them aligned so they shift nice. It may take some tweaking to get it aligned ..

Also look at the shift plate to ensure its not cracked or bent.

Happy bussing!

I just had a re-built tranny put in my '79 Type 2. First tranny since I've
bought her, 20 years ago.

This new tranny is very stiff. I'm having the clutch adjusted next week.

Would anyone know if the shifter will loosen up or is this just normal for a
re-built?

I did replace the shifter, shift kit too.



Thanks.
