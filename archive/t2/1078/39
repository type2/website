I agree.... a couple years ago, I needed to pull the engine in my 74,and I 
was suffering in the lower back area... so I had my 18 y/o daughter do the 
work.
She did everything .. I handed her the wrenches. but she had to work the 
jack and all the heavy stuff..
she was done in 45minutes.. engine out from under the bus,, in a gravel 
driveway 

She did  not touch the axles, but we did lower the engine and rear of the 
trans before we undid the upper 2 bellhousing bolts... then separated them 
and slid it out leaving the trans hanging..
