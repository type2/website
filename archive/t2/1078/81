Subject: firewall removal

I have heard the bottom screws of the firewall are the hardest to remove.

I fear I am getting dust into my EVR system from bad lines as part of my clog problem.

It needs to be done anyways.

Anybody have trouble with these, or techniques? Where do I get the right pitch and depth of a screw driver for the job?
