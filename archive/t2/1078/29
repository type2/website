Hi Darren,

In short: Yes; you need to drop the engine to figure out what is going on.

Either the clutch disk or the TOB have failed. Or, another possibility  
is that the slider tube that the TOB rides on has come out of place.  
That happened to me back in 2004; when the bolts that hold that tube  
to the bell-housing worked loose. Quite possibly the only 11mm M7  
bolts to be found on a VW bus, BTW. Certainly the only ones I've  
encountered. I drove about 100 miles without using the clutch to get  
to a campout where I was able to repair the bus the next day.

Good luck!

Greg
