Subject: Ecology yards in Chula Vista

I went down to the two Ecology pick-your-part yards in Chula Vista  
last week, and I was underwhelmed by what I found there. One WC  
Vanagon, two AC buses at the all foreign yard, nothing at the Brown's  
Field yard.

I've never seen so few buses there. Was this just an odd day, or is  
something going on?
