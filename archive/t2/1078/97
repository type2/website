Subject: Power amp install

I want to put a subwoofer power amp in this 74 transporter. In another bus I
had,  the power cable was run straight up from the engine compartment,
through a hole drilled in the rear deck and then ran down behind the rear
seat to the amp which was under the rear seat. 

Anyone have any better ideas for installing a power amp?

 

Thanks!
