Jack,

Thanks! I would strongly recommend a MIG (Metal Inert Gas) / GMAW (Gas  
Metal Arc Welding).

ARC or "Stick"  or SMAW (Shielding Metal Arc Welding) is far too  
inaccurate and is mostly "brute force" welding for outdoors.

TIG (Tungsten Inert Gas) / GTAW (Gas Tungsten Arc Welding) is  
wonderful, but expensive, slow and takes a whole lot of practice. Also  
the weld area using a TIG often harder than the metal welded, making  
it difficult to grind smooth.

I prefer TIG, but use MIG almost exclusively when doing panel repair.

With a little instruction, a bunch of practice, a helping of patience,  
and the right equipment, you will be welding like a hero in no time.

And it will make your garage the most popular in your neighborhood.  
Get used to hearing, "Can you weld this? My <insert any family member>  
broke this while <insert any activity not designed for whatever is  
broken>."

Best,

Jon Stiles
