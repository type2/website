Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch problems

I had a clutch cable stretching inexplicably one time.  I was totally  
mystified and had no idea of the cause of the stretching until I  
pulled the cable out entirely.  It turned out that the individual  
strands in the cable were breaking one by one and the cable would  
stretch a little further every time another one went.

I'm a little hazy on the details but I think that the cable was  
inappropriately routed through the frame and was rubbing where it came  
out.  It was really easy to overlook the point in the cable where it  
was breaking but after I pulled the entire cable out the problem was  
obvious.  A brand new cable routed properly and the issue was fixed.
