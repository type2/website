Subject: Re: [T2] Removing firewall with engine fitted

Thanks for all the replies on this.  A lot of you have asked if I have
taken out the two lower screws: yes I have had the firewall out before
so know about that.

What I am doing is pushing the firewall upwards as far as it will go
then pulling the bottom out.  There is a kind of flange welded to the
other side of it that will not clear the top of the front engine tin
(the part where the foam goes).  I am starting to wonder if they
changed the design of the firewall at some point (mine is a '78).

Mike Benthin suggested the 'cut a hole above the tank' method.  Thanks
Mike, but I was kind of saving that for a last resort!  I think it
would be quicker to just drop the engine.

Dave
