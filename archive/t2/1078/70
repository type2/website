My experience is with early bays that lack the upper transmission mount, 
so I generally pull the whole thing.

In this case it wouldn't hurt to pull the engine by itself and see what is 
happening.  A late model is unlikely to have the bearing fall off of the 
fork, so I'm pretty sure that he'll find a broken fork.  If that's the 
case, stop and decide whether pulling the transmission might give you a 
bit more working room.

If you do replace the shift fork, do yourself a favor and get a heavy duty 
fork or just weld a regular-duty fork all the way around at the base of 
both levers.  The little spot welds tend to break.

I also use thin safety wire to make sure that the snap ring inside the 
bell housing doesn't come loose and allow the shaft to slide sideways.

Oh, and if you replace the fork, replace the throwout spring outside the 
transmission while you are at it.  It's a $2 part and they tend to fail as 
they get old.  They're a bear to replace so if you're going to have the 
fork out anyway save yourself some future grief.
