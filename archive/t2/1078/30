Subject: Update: Clutch problems

Ok, today I removed the new cable. Cable looked fine.

Put it next to my old cable, same length.

Reinstalled new cable. Put a couple of washers on the bowden
tube to get a more accurate bend.

Checked pedal assembly. Ok.

I'm 95% sure there is nothing wrong with the cable, bowden tube,
or pedal assembly.

I think my issue is with the throwout bearing or the forks.
Without the cable attached, I can pull on the clutch lever a good
bit. I would expect it to be harder. It also does not return all
the way...like it's hanging on something. I can push on it slightly
and it will pop back vertical. The spring is fine.

I now have to decide if I should drop the engine myself or have it
towed to a mechanic..that I dont know/trust. *sigh* My work is cut
out for me.
