Can't argue with those points...

Ever have duty cycle problems? As in overheating the machine? I did with my 
little off-brand 110V machine but I question everything about that machine. 
During some extended welding session I'd get the machine pretty hot and it 
would turn off until some temp switch reset. My Lincoln has a fan I think. I 
suspect alot of better quality machines would regardless of the voltage feed. 

A good quality 110V machine ought to be better than my little off brand 
machine in every category... Just don't know if you'd run out of duty cycle 
on heavier steels. No, don't expect you'd have a problem welding on any part 
of a VW. 

Keep going John. You're talking good sense.
