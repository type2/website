Subject: Re: [T2] Removing firewall with engine fitted

I discovered one of these in my bus after buying it and driving it
home.  I had even pulled up the back carpet to get a look at the
engine through the hatch I just hadn't pulled it back far enough to
see the hole with duct tape holding the cut out pieces in place.

I ended up cutting a chunk of that engine deck steel from my parts bus
and fashioning a really nice bulkhead over the hole.  Now I have easy
access but it took a day's worth of work, some dollars worth of
parts, and a whole lot of exasperation to get the job done.

I think keeping hole-cutting as the last resort is a good decision.
