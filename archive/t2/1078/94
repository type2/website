Nope, has nothing to do with it - unless there is a short that is 
causing some other kinda problems.

I'd get yourself a remote starter switch and do some tests that way.  I 
think you'll either find a stop-gap method on how to deal with it 
temporiily, or you'll be able to fix the problem.

I had a similar problem as you.  I changed out all the fat wires and now 
the thing starts like a champ every time.
