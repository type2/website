Subject: Urgent Generator help needed

Hi everyone. 
I was trying to resolve what I thought might be a charging issue tonight, as my generator light keeps coming on dim. 

I started by pulling the pos. lead on the battery and cleaning the connections there. Lots of blue, yuck. Then I cleaned the connections at the voltage regulator. No blue, but still needed some cleaning. 

Hooked it all up and immediately I noticed the gen light wasn't on. Awesome. 
Went to the back to check the voltmeter, it was going nuts. Put a finger on the pos. terminal of the generator OUCH! HOT!!!
What the heck!

Pulled the pos lead off the generator, and then started it again. According to the volt meter it's generating 35.7 volts at idle, 53 volts at higher rpms. 

This seems a little high to me.

What's going on!!??

Thanks for any help I can get!
