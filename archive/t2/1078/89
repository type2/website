Tom, I am also a IHC Scout geek and every time I buy a Scout I replace the
12 gauge ground wire with a huge cable equal to the ones on the battery, I
think this makes the whole truck function healthier, it seems to smooth it
out and it makes the starter spin over better, but I have never thought
about doing this with my bus.

I guess I should just add a huge ground and see if things improve, it
certainly can't hurt.
