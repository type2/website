Darren,

I experienced some similar problems when my throwout bearing was 
loose on the shaft in the bell housing - I had to adjust the clutch
multiple time and often.  I fixed the problem the next time I pulled
the engine.

As far as the feeling the pop and having the pedal go to the floor,
this would be consistent with not having a throwout bearing installed
or the bearing coming off the shaft.

It can also be indicative of your clutch disk breaking into 8 or 10
peices (ask me how I know).

Cheers,
   Tom
