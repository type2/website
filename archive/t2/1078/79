I'm almost through removing everything to drop the engine. Just have
the starter, heater cables, and FPR fuel line to disconnect.

It's been so darn hot here, I've taken my time disassembling, taking
notes, and labeling wires.

Now when you guys are saying drop the transmission too, are you saying
just lowering the rear? Or actually removing the trans. Right now, I'm
proceeding to lower the engine keeping the tranny in.
