I was working under the Exploder a couple weeks ago. My 4-leg
expensive stands were in the back of the garage, and my cheapie 3-leg
stands were easily accessible. So I chocked the wheels and put the
truck up on the stands.

I was really leaning into loosening an exhaust bolt and the (-at-)#$%RY&$
thing rocked. The 3 legger fell right over and the truck came down
hard. With me underneath. Luckily that thing has enough clearance that
I wasn't hurt, but I did have to change my shorts.

The cheapie stands went straight into the trash and I dug out my heavy
duty ones.

The lesson is: Never trust your life to saving $10 on a pair of jack stands.
