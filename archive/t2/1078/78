Subject: Re: [T2] Update: Clutch problems

I think you will find that there's no clear answer on this.  Just a  
few days ago I reinstalled the engine and transmission in my 79 and it  
was gloriously simple.

Until this last go-around every time I've removed the engine I've left  
the transmission in place.  When doing this it's always been touch and  
go where there's only JUST BARELY enough space to pull the engine back  
far enough to clear the transmission input shaft.  Also, when putting  
the engine back in, every time the biggest pain has been simply  
getting the engine and trans to mate up.  The splines on the  
transmission input shaft have to line up just right with the splines  
on the clutch disk and then you also have to get the studs on the  
engine to line up just right with their holes on the bell housing.   
It's been a pain every time and there's always some cussing and  
worrying and general stress involved.

This last time I removed the engine and transmission together and it  
was wonderfully easy.  Removal and installation were both far easier  
with the two already mated together.  One word of recommendation: It's  
easier to get at the passenger side upper bell housing bolt (one of  
the two that hold the bell housing to the frame) with the starter  
removed.

Also, in order to accommodate the engine and transmission on my  
motorcycle jack I used some 3/4 inch plywood to build an extended deck  
on the jack.  This extended the deck 8 inches or so forward of the  
front edge of the jack in order to support the transmission and the  
engine.

Good luck!
