Good to know.  I learned a similar lesson with soldering.  There is no 
replacement for Kester rosin core solder.  Way back when Heathkits were 
popular the solder they provided was superior in flow and adhesion. 
Through some detective work I figured out that it was supplied by Kester 
and have used it ever since.  The solder you get at Radio Shack is much 
harder to work with.

Thanks for the info and I'll keep it in mind for my experiments with MIG. 
Pros can do good work using just about any equipment because their 
experience allows them to automatically compensate for any faults. 
Novices do better with high quality equipment.
