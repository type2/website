Hi James,

I replaced my solenoid, for about $10, a year or two ago, after similar 
symptoms. It's a pretty simple job to do. If you're quick and you have the 
new solenoid you could do it in under an hour I guess (there are two nuts 
holding electrical connections onto the solenoid, two bolts holding the 
starter onto the bellhousing, and two long screws holding the solenoid to 
the starter).

Cheers,
Bruce
