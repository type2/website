Subject: Swap pink slips?

Hi,

I'm a long-time type 2 subscriber back in Southern California after a  
life-changing fiasco in Maine. I'd like to get a camper again. The  
straightforward way to do that would be to sell my 2001 VW GTI and  
buy a bus or Vanagon with the proceeds.

But I wonder if anyone has a bus in good condition and wants to do a  
straight pink-slip swap.

The GTI has 110,000 miles on it and got a new timing belt at 103,000  
miles. At least two people, one of them at a VW dealer, have said how  
"clean" it looks for a 2001. Clean title, of course, and registered  
and smogged in CA.

I can send details and pictures if anyone is interested.

Mark
