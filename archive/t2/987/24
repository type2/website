Subject: Update on 78 FI with Pertronix not starting

Hey all,

I wrote about a problem getting my 78 FI Westy with Pertonix started a few
weeks ago. At first, we couldn't get consistent spark. We put in a new coil
and powered it directly from the battery. I could get it to fire over with
starting fluid, so we suspected bad gas. I took a cup out and it smelled
like turpentine, so I returned with fresh gas and prepared to drain it. When
I went to drain it, only about a cup came out. I checked a few things, and
it was indeed empty. I started to fill it with fresh gas and found the hose
between the fuel filter and the fuel pump had cracked. Luckily, I had
installed a marine fuel filter about 10 years ago, and along with it a
petcock. I swapped out the line (I plan on doing replacement lines
throughout, it has been about 7 years) and she would still only fire over
with starting fluid. Found that the fuel pump was not being turned on by the
afm flap. Tested the fuel pump and it is working. So we tried starting it
again with starting fluid, and she backfired and blew the AFM off. This was
pure, dumb luck, as I think the wiring harness on the back of the AFM was
not attached securely, and when I put it all back together, the flap was
triggering the fuel pump, and she started and ran well! So, most of the
glitches got worked out, and we drove her back home.

Here's the only problem: Currently, she will only start with the coil
powered by the battery. She will run with it unplugged from the battery, but
she is not getting enough juice on her own. I suspect the wire from the
ignition switch has too much resistance, but I wanted to see if anyone else
has had this problem and if they just replaced the wire from the ignition or
found some other ingenious solution. I also suspect this is why I was having
trouble in the past with hard starting.

Thoughts?

Thanks,

Ned
