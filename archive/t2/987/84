There  was a guy with a yellow/white splittie at Naturalbus who had adapted  a
Rabbit CIS system for his motor. Very cheap if you can find the FI with  a
junk Rabbit attached to it. Apparently, it only needed minor  modifications:
FI intakes from a late Super Beetle, re-set fuel pressure  regulator (he used
an Audi 5000 one with altitude compensation), two longer  fuel lines, and a
distributor with trigger (he used a mallory).

Very  nice and clean setup and no electric gremlins to chase since the AFM  is
mechanical.




hey marcus  That was adrain pillow But not so good of a system, the  fuel 
dizzys are NLA and are known for clogging up. the injectors are costly and  are 
prone to leakage, the fuel pump is Odd ball also seeing that it needs 65psi  to 
squirt the injectors.  Out dated and not a very good system . Even Vw  
figured this out as the did away with this system in 1989   . Best bet  would be to 
use a vanagon FI system or even a late bay  later  mark  d
