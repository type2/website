Subject: Off-subject but VW Related - Insurance for "Dune Buggy"

I have a Meyers Manx style "dune buggy" on a 1961 VW Beetle chassis.  I
am about to pull my hair out trying to find insurance.

State Farm wants almost $250 for 6 months
Hagerty "doesn't insure dune buggies"
Progressive wants over $370 for 6 months
GEICO want insure it because my wife and I only have one daily driver
that is less than 20 years old
Taylor want even look at an application until you give them a signed
check

Some insurance companies say, "We can't insure it because it can be
driven off-road"
Other companies say, "We can't insure it because it can be drive on the
highway"

There is no speaking or logic with these outfits just "that is the way
it is".  I have tried to explain that a "dune buggy" (their words not
mine) is no more dangerous or different than a T-bucket or most any
other kit car.  (BTW, my definition of a dune buggy is a tubular frame
vehicle used, almost exclusively, off road.

There has got to be a way.

Suggestions...

Thanks,

Michael Martin

PS - My wife drives a 2007 VW New Beetle and my daily driver is a 1972
VW Beetle.  We also have two 1976 VW Transporters and one 1971 VW
