Subject: voltage regulator

I posted about this a few months back.  I thought I fixed the van with a new ignition switch, but I'm having the same problem. 
   
  My car will only start if I hot wire it. The dash lights go on, but I have to turn the key to get it started.  I changed the ignition switch, per a VW book, but it still does not work without the hot wire.  Now I'm thinking that's it's my regulator. The hot wire attaches to the battery connector wire on the regulator - so am I drawing electricity from my battery to the starter? Am I bypassing the regulator and the ignition switch when I hot wire it?
