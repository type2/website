Subject: Re: [T2] Yoko Tires (?)

The Yoko 356D is an awfully hard riding tire, has a really goofy wear
patten, and is real short winded---they don't last too long.

You'll find they prematurely eat the outside tread's of the face of the
tire--it'll have the treads left in the middle but none on the outside
edges, and are pitiful in the rain, snow, or ice for traction.

They are an inexpensive tire, and this is their only redeeming factor.
