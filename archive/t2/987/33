Subject: RE:71 Front Brake Hoses

Doug,
 
Let me suggest one more thing for you to check, besides the hoses.  I offer
the following suggestion  because of a similar problem I had with our 71.
We were several states from home and had a long drive to get there when I
smelled the overheating front brakes.  In our case it tuned out that the
brake pedal wasn't quite returning all the way up.  So after each
application of brakes I'd tuck my toes under the pedal and pull it up the
last inch.  The next day I took the brake pedal assembly apart and it turned
out to be nothing more than 35 year old grease that was more like glue than
a lubricant.  I disassembled the brake pedal pivot, cleaned and regreased
all the parts, and the brakes worked fine after reassembly.  Hope that
helps.
