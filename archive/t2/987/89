Hello,
   
  I am sending this for a family that is out traveling and need some help.  They need a rear wheel bearing for '68 camper.  It started making rumbling sounds in eastern NY and across Massachusetts and made it to Cape Cod  and don't want to drive it back to PA with it making the sound.  They have some tools but not enough to change a wheel bearing-might be mentioned that a campout is happing this weekend in Vermont-they are leaving the Cape on the 13th-but can meet with someone to change the wheel bearing.  Thanks so much for reading this and please call Mark Reed (-at-) 724-525-6469 with any and all suggestions or ideas.  Thanks again for your help-Amy
