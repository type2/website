Subject: Finally ...

got the old girl saftied and ready for the open road!  Thanks for your
suggestions Greg.  It's nice to finally have her purring away again.  And of
course many things left to do and some more important than others!.  But all
in good time ...

Maybe meet some of you in KW Sunday?  Are there normally a good selection of
parts to purchase at these events?
