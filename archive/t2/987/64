I found 3 tiny little cars (2 cars and a truck actually) in the same
area.  They are actually pretty cool.  The kids have them scattered
around the house but, I am just tickled every time I see one of them
laying somewhere.  You wouldn't believe all of the stuff I found down
in beside the bed and under the ice chest.
