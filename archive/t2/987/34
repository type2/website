Subject: installing a new stereo system 

I have been working on my 78 camper bus, and have been considering some 
different things with the installation of the head unit, I have heard that it is 
hard to replace the original because of the modification that has to be done to 
the dash, so I have considered mounting the new stereo under the dash and out 
of the way, if anyone has attempted this, please contact me. 
 
 
thanks, 
 
JAY
