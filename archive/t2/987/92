Was the engine you bought from MOFOCO (or any of the other vendors)
"turnkeys" or "longblocks"?  It seems on the one hand I could save a
good bit of money with a longblock... But on the other... with a turnkey
I would know that I have parts that go with the motor and might "perform
better?"

==> My first was a 1914 from MOFOCO which ... It has performed
flawlessly even when run in fairly extreme conditions.

turnkey?
