Hi Michael. I would agree with Bob. I have rebuilt a couple of engines, but
time is always the thing I don't have enough of. It's fun to build the
engine yourself, but could end up being a project on the garage floor for
quite some time. Last time I had Boston Bob build me an engine. Been great
and been really happy with it.
