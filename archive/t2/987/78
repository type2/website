Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Update on 78 FI with Pertronix not starting

I checked the Pertronix website, which isn't much of a help, but it shows
the use of a ballast resistor in the schematic. The new bosch blue coil I
have in it has the internal resistor. She has been running well. I've been
running with the plugs gapped as per bentley, I think .028. Should I open
these up? Anyone found a good gap?
