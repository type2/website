Subject: Audi rims, Fuel pump block off

Went to the Vw show in Victoria on Sunday, and saw about a dozen "Bays", some
were 10/10!  One had a beautiful set of Audi rims, that looked very fresh, but
could not locate the owner, so could not figure out the year.  They had no
adapters, so think I will cruise the car lots and see if I can figure out what
they were from. Any input on ideas?
Also, can someone direct me to get a fuel pump blockoff plate for my 1.8?

Thanks
Sid
