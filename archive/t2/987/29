Subject: One-piece rear side window needed; parting out '72

Does anyone around DC have an extra one-piece (no pop-out) rear side window?
I need this to get Myonnie's camper ready for High Country.
 
Also, we are parting out a '72 that still has a bunch of good parts: front
doors, rear hatch, engine hatch, 1700 engine with progressive Weber
(relatively recent top-end rebuild), good transaxle, tank, set of
Continental 185R14C on narrow five ('71 - '91) rims, ... Let me know what
you need soon; we may be able to bring parts to High Country. We are in
College Park (Maryland, inside the DC Beltway).
 
Marcus
