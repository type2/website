Anyone here running a stock 1600 EFI engine?

I would love to try get such a setup running on my 1600dp but there's
not really that much info out there (that I can find) about the
subject.

Then of course there's megasquirt.. but how nice would it be to have
an stock bolt-up EFI system designed for the engine.
