If you care about your vehicle I'd recommend that the only way that you
rent it to the film industry is if you are paid as the vehicle's driver
and that you remain with your vehicle all the time.

Living in SoCal, I've heard a number of horror stories about what film
companies do to the things they rent.  Many of these stories involve
hammers and sawzalls.  When a film company has a few dozen people waiting
around costing $$$ and the director decides he needs a little more light
inside the bus, they're apt to just punch a hole through the sheet metal
for the wires no matter what agreement you have with them.  It's
cheaper for them to pay you for the damage they cause than to take the
time to do it properly.
