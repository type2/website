Subject: fitting the SVDA and 2L questions

Hi volks.

Turns out the 'mystery engine' in this 73 westy i'm
r&r-ing for a friend is a hyd-lift 2L VW reman.
I'll post the numbers when i get a chance, but please
someone check me:

Piston is non-conical dish (cylindrical depression in
the top of the pistons)  with "93,97 std" stamped into
the top.
That means 94mm..which means 2L, right?

Note to self: locate dial calipers.

Also, the lifters - if when i look up into the bore i
can see a little wire keeper that appears to be
holding the top part or 'cap' in the lifter, then its
a hyd lifer, right?

Note to self: pick up one of those magnet-parts-getter
things.

ok.


issue 2: 

I will be placing an order for an SVDA dist from
aircooled.net this morning.

Someone said something about fitting them into the
type4. There was something about the position of the
vac can and a relocation procedure?

I hereby respectfully ask for a repost of that info.

Thanks in advance for any and all info.

Clark
