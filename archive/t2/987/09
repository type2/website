Subject: Re: [T2] Dipstick Boot

I always remove my bottom piece of tin that goes between pushrod tubes and ground.
  i also remove my alternator and try to get it set to the side as best i can still leaving wireing attached. Thia makes it easier for me to wrap both my arms arond back of engine and go through the alternator hole.
  ONe easy thing to do is to take the bog part of the bot and put it on your index finger for a little bit before putting on ....
  put the bottom part on first and then fanagle the top part to slip on the small part...(top)
   
  good luck this little job and make for some very foul language at times and other times i can just get them to slip right on...
  peace

  Hey all,

I found an oil leak on my '76 Westy (there may be more). The dipstick boot is
torn. What is the best way the replace this? Do you just remove the alternator
belt and the cover that the tube runs through or is there more to it? Just
looking for advise before I start tearing things apart.

Thanks,
