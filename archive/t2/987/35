Mine fit in the location of the original.  I think I might have had to 
bend the metal a little bit, but ultimately it was a pretty trivial 
installation.  And I have a standard Sony MobileES unit (so no weird 
measurements or anything) and I mounted the amp underneath the front 
driver's seat.

Works great!
