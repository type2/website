Subject: 3 Bus Sighting in Northern MN

Just wondering if any list members were in Northern MN over the 4th of 
July week?  On July 4th I saw a tan colored vanagon & a bit down the 
road was an all white bay, followed by a green & white bay.  I was 
going to take my bus out that day.  Sure wish I would have.  Contact me 
if you were one of the busses. : )
