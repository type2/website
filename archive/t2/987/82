There was a guy with a yellow/white splittie at Naturalbus who had adapted a
Rabbit CIS system for his motor. Very cheap if you can find the FI with a
junk Rabbit attached to it. Apparently, it only needed minor modifications:
FI intakes from a late Super Beetle, re-set fuel pressure regulator (he used
an Audi 5000 one with altitude compensation), two longer fuel lines, and a
distributor with trigger (he used a mallory).

Very nice and clean setup and no electric gremlins to chase since the AFM is
mechanical.

Anyone here running a stock 1600 EFI engine?
