Thanks.  That is very helpful and would probably save a good bit of
money (and frustration) in the long run.  Does anyone have any
suggestion on the motor?  I could go back stock with the 1600 but I have
heard several people say that it was underpowered.  Which longblocks
would mate up to my intake, distributor, carb, exaust, etc...?  What
other "upgrades" would be advisable with a rebuilt longblock?



Thanks,



Michael Martin

>>Personally - I would either go with a brand new mexi longblock or get
a rebuilt longblock and use whatever you can from your old heater boxes
etc.
