Hi Ned,

Use a voltmeter to measure voltage at the battery and at the coil  
before you start the engine. If there is a significant voltage drop,  
check the voltage at the terminals on the ignition switch next. This  
will tell you where the voltage drop is occurring... it's in the wire  
from battery-ignition switch, the switch itself, or the wire from  
switch-coil. Once you have that sorted out you should be OK.

In the meanwhile you can wire the coil to the running lights. This  
will allow you to power the coil on an off without opening the engine  
lid.

Happy Trails,
