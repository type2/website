Thanks for the response, Ned.  I actually figured it out last night.
I found a small vacuum leak that was probably there all along and was
like the contributor to my uneven idle at times.  The bigger problem
was a very big, concealed leak at the back of the S Boot.  I used the
cancer-stick technique that Cliff Rhoton mentioned last summer.  I
don't know if I missed this leak back then but, luckily I had a spare
S boot in the garage.  Swapped it out and put a clamp on the other
small leak and I think I was in bed by midnight.  I believe its
running better than it has the entire time that I've owned it.  I had
already ordered a Pertronix and new Brazilian Blue coil from Bus
Depot.  I've been wanting to do those for a while anyway.  One last
fishing/camping trip this weekend and then I'm going to start pulling
glass, rubber and handles so that I can re-paint it and replace the
canvas.  There is plenty of body work to be done.  I'm not looking
forward to it.

Thanks again,
Ken
