<Anyone here running a stock 1600 EFI engine?>



I have a mexibeetle that I picked up from a local car dealer (its
registered as a composite).  I drove it as a daily driver for about 3.5
years, in all weather (I live in Connecticut) without really any
trouble.  It has a Mexican stock efi motor.  Well mostly stock.  After
about a year and a half, the salt ate away my muffler/catalytic
converter and I replaced it with a bugpack full flow muffler and
disconnected the O2 sensor (hack, I know).  I drove it for another 1.5
years without a problem, putting a total of 78000 miles on it.  Lots o'
zip too!  And I was still getting 26 mpg.
