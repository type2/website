Subject: RE: [T2] Re: Update on 78 FI with Pertronix not starting

Before you do anything else, give Petronix a call and ask a tech what the
nominal voltage is to keep from damaging your ignitor.  Whenever I'm working
with electrical other than ignition, I disconnect the hot wire to the coil,
you can fry your ignitor if you don't.  I would also recommend that if you
have a 009 handy to keep it as a spare with points and condensor and hold-down
bracket allready timed, just pop in and keep going
If you set up a seperate relay, be sure it's continuous duty, like the relay
for a Westie aux battery.  IMHO, finding the problem with the stock harness is
your best and cheapest bet.  When wires fail it is generally at the exposed
ends, not in the middle of the harness, barring external damage from road
debris or wrecks.  If you soldered [SIC?] in a section of new wire from the
wire bundle to the coil in the engine compartment with new ends I bet the
problem would go away.

Also, don't forget to spin your fuses!JT Beaufort, SC Running: 1. 62 404.1
