Subject: 71 REPLACEMENT MOTOR

Owning a stock 71 Westy this engine replacement
tread peaks my interest.  Doesn't the 1914 motor
run too hot for a freeway going bus with its
large barrels?  Would a 2110 with smaller barrels
and 44 Kardon's and electric choke work well I am
wondering?  I supose that a remote cooler is
needed with any motor because my stock (ish)
stepup aready gets up to 230f before I need to
slow down, even without over reving.
