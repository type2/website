Perhaps there was junk in the lines that found its way to the carb.

Pull the carb,  Make sure that it is getting adequate fuel (bowl is full),
blow out all the passages with spray carb cleaner, blow out all the lines
with air and try again.

Another possiblity is that you have an electrical short from when you
moved wires around while playing with lines
