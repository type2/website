I've used a product called Spraylat on aircraft used in movies.  It's
a thin, plastic, coating that is applied by brush, roller or spary and
can be painted over.  When you are done and want to remove the
temporary paint job the spraylat can be peeled off, taking the colors
with it.  I have no idea what it costs, or where to buy it, but you
can check for the details here
