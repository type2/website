Subject: dial indicator - end play

 I've been looking at dial indicators to set the endplay. There is a dizzying variety of models and that's before you consider metric.

I'd appreciate it if someone had a recommendation for the range and accuracy. It seems most gauges are .001 precision but that will mean the needle won't move much checking the endplay. Is more precision desireable?

Another question for current/former VW mechanics? Has anyone purchased US1026 which is the dial indicator available in the VW specialty tool catalogs? It's a metric model with 5mm reading.
