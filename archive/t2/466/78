Subject: new hoses and fuel pump now wont start

I changed all my fuel hoses and the in tank filter but now my bus won't start.
It wants to turn over and if I let it sit for awhile it starts very briefly
but won't continue to run.  Its getting gas to the carb and the spark seems
adequate.  I think it may be my carb.  Any suggestions are appreciated
