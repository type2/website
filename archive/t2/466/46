Subject: Re: [T2] head temp gauge

I added a VDO cylinder temp gauge to my #3 cylinder spark plug...it got it
new in the box for selling a guy's ultralite project for him.  Mine came
from Aircraft Spruce and Specialty and was meant for a Rotax engine.  It
came with a very long extension wire which I have temporarily through the
passenger compartment.  I forgot to drill a hole and grommet through the tin
when I was assembling my engine (was running out of time and wanted to get
it running) so I just slit the spark plug wire boot and ran the sender wire
out the spark plug hole in the tin.

Cheers,
