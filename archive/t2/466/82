Subject: Re: [T2] alternator voltage

Dan,

go to Radio Shack & get a multimeter. you can get a decent one for
about 20 bucks.  use the instructions on reading DC voltage.

with the bus off, the battery should read about 12 V DC.

with the bus running, it should read about 14 V DC.

i'm still a newbie with my multimeter so someone else may
have better insight.

you can also have your battery tested for FREE at most FLAPS to
see if that might actually be the problem.

good luck,

I've got a T4 1700 in my '75 bus. Thanks.
