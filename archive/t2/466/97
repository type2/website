The Bus would pull to the side the bearing is tight ..... and probably all
the time,

when the bus pulls when applying brakes, then you might have a sticking
wheel cylinder, or contamination on the shoes, or a the hydraulic hose may
be deteriating and acting like a check valve, not allowing fluid to the
opposite side it pulls to.

The one side is working good, the side it pulls to... check the other side
for problems.

Better yet, check all your braking stuff!
