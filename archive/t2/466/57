So, exactly how do you put out a flaming Marine?  :)

Yow!  Not a good situation!  Sounds like your axle is rusted out.  Best
fix is to obtain an axle from the arid Southwest.  Second best is to weld
up your existing axle, _but_ make darned sure that the corrosion is only
local to the pivot.  If the tubes are rusty inside, they are toast!  The
vastly preferable fix is to replace the whole axle.

The axle is replacable by normal humans, but set aside a weekend for it.
