You have most of what you need to make one engine. But, and there are always
buts...

First off, the two cases are the same. The cranks and rods of a 1.7 and 1.8
are the same. The tin is probably all the same. Alternator is the same.

The cylinders and heads are different. The 1.7 cylinders will not fit on the
1.8 heads, this is the biggest problem. I would build a 1.8 motor, but to do
that you will need a set of 93mm P&C's. Or you can build a 1.7, then you
will need a set of 1.7 heads.

All that said, I would be really careful using a crank or rods from a motor
that threw a rod, which is likely what happened if there is a hole in the
case.
