>Ideas, something to make halloween a blast please.

I was thinking it'd be cool to put halloween pictures on my bus, like ghosts 
and that sort of thing. But I am wondering what would be the best thing to 
use, maybe masking tape?? I don't want to damage the paint on my 82, it's in 
really great shape.
