If I am not mistaken,, if your talking about the "frontboot" where the rod
enters the booster from the pedal. you shouldn't have any fluid there!

That circlip holds the vent tube connector in place.

I might hazard a guess that the old master cylinder was leaking out the
front, between the master and the servo,, this puts fluid IN the servo,
and should not be there,,

I have always drained this fluid off,, but recently Karl mentioned that
the fluid will cause damage,

My method is to remove the master cyl,  use a steel line with a bend in it
so it reaches the bottom of the servo,, and siphon the fluid out of the
servo..
It has worked fine for me, but I didn't know it was bad for the "valves"
in the servo until Karl pointed that out.
I have drained servo's that had fluid running out the big hole...
