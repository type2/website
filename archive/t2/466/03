I've "seen" it done on a real flash Beetle, but not on a Bus...Unless there's
a kit of some form or other I'd tend to think it's gonna be really tough...
figuring out what will fit...It'd hafta be from something with rear discs al-
ready with some form of emergency brake since swapping out a front disc
would leave you without an emergency brake...Also you probably would need
some way to "balance" the front/rear pressure to keep one end of the Bus
from locking before the other...
