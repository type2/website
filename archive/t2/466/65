The relay is there to avoid pulling the full current required by the 
fan all the way up to the instrument panel and back again.  The lever 
on the instrument panel, when all the way down, makes contact with a 
pad connected to a wire.  Since the lever is attached to the body, that 
wire is now connected to ground, thus completing the control circuit on 
the relay, tripping it, and letting the juice flow from the fused power 
lead in the engine compartment though the switch in the relay and into 
the wire that connects to the fan motor.

I have been having problems with my heater blower, too.  I spent the 
better part of an afternoon the other day diagnosing it (I really 
needed a friend up in the cab moving the lever up and down, sigh).

What I found interesting in my case was:

	- With lever up ("off") and key off or on, I have
	  no continuity between the white/brown wire at the
	  relay and ground.  According to the wiring diagram,
	  this is correct.

	- With lever down ("on") and key off, I have good
	  continuity between the white/brown wire at the
	  relay and ground.  According to the wiring diagram,
	  this is correct.

	- Same test with key on (and thus voltage flowing to
	  the relay), I have no continuity between the white/brown
	  wire at the relay and the ground.  This, to me, feels
	  like I have a bad relay.  At least, I did not expect this
  	  behavior.

	- Under no circumstances does voltage flow out of the
	  other side of the relay to the fan.

I, like you, was puzzled by the blue wire.  In my case, that wire had 
been fiddled with by a PO (another wire spliced into it, then clipped 
off), and so I wrote it off as some weird hack.  I didn't find the blue 
wire on the wiring diagram, but as I've been shown a few times on this 
list, I'm not the best at reading the diagram :-)  (I would pull it out 
and double check it right now, but it's in the Bus, which is parked a 
block away, and I don't really feel like putting my shoes on and going 
out to fetch it right now. :-)

I'm planning on hitting a u-pull yard or two this Saturday in search of 
a relay and a replacement for the red lever I broke while fiddling with 
it :-/
