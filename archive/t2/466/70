There aren't many companies offering covers that are specifically
designed for Busses, which are taller than American minivans yet
narrower than full sized vans. If you look at the general car cover
sites, you'll find that they list their Bus covers as "semi-custom fit,"
which means that they are selling a generic cover made for American vans
or mini-vans that, by the way, can also be used on a Bus. Even the ones
that don't tell you they're sending you a "semi-custom fit" cover are
often sending you just that. (That is, if they list Busses at alll. One
of the major car cover sites only lists "Trans-Sport" covers under VW
vans.  Will you get a Bus cover or a Pontiac minivan cover?)  

By comparison, our covers are specifically tailored to fit the Bus (even
to the extent that different sizes are used for later model poptop
campers versus passenger vans, since they are different heights).  We
offer them in a number of material choices, depending on the severity of
your weather and your budget. 

You can see prices and an explanation of the materials here:

I would recommend going with the Mosom, or at least the Tyvek, as the
low-end Coverguard cover is very light duty and principally intended for
indoor use or very mild weather. If you get severe winters, the high-end
Stormshield is worth the investment, and one of the best covers you can
buy.
