Follow-up:  As suggested by Doktor Tim, I called RIMCO and asked them
(sounds like the obvious thing to do, but it hadn't occurred to me).  They
said they currently do no have a source for the exhaust studs!  Wish they'd
told me that before hand so I could have at least kept my old ones.  I had
asked them to remove/replace all studs and fix the threads in the heads
wherever necessary.  The thread repair they did was fine.  Just wish they
had sent some useable exhaust studs back with the heads.

So now I'm scouring the internet looking for eight M8 x 1.25 x 56mm studs.
Anybody got any or know where I can order them?

Thanks.
