i'd echo what phil says mostly. the magnetic base kit is the way to go. you
get the dial indicator and the base and arm. this works perfectly for
endplay measurements, and the bonus is it will work for lots of other things
as well.

i would suggest mitutoyo or starette. the mitutoyo are not all that
expensive, definitely more than chinese made, but you get what you pay for.
the mitutoyo kit i have has a really nice storage case as well, which may
seem unnecessary, but it is always good to store precision measuring tools
in a safe place.
