Subject: Halloween Van Time

Here's the plan:

Total Hippie-esque in all the right ways.
Planning on letting some kids have fun drawing Peace symbols
and flowers on the van with Water Paints.

Leaving work early and (like ya know) dressed as hippies go
out an drive around handing out candy and playing decent music for the
little kiddies. I have a few friends interested in wearing pimp hats
and afro's.

The sliding door locks in the open position:
Question:
1. Will the sliding door be ok locked in the open position while driving 
around?
No damage to anything?

2. Water paints.. anything preferable or will any do and not damage normal
paint? (The van is yellow with a white top).

3. Taking requests now for music lineup.  Hippie music or halloween tunes.
And I think we will have little hippie kids doing the door to door while we
drive along.

I personally can't think of anything funner than throwing candy at kids from
a hippie van.  Maybe I should bring the pump gun (CO2 powered) and launch
caramels into the air, or puff puffs for that matter. (nothing dangerous or 
silly).
Hmm launching streamers into the air like that could be a lot of fun.

Ideas, something to make halloween a blast please.

Thanks
