Subject: Re: [T2] Rimco - good heads, bad studs

Bus Depot lists them, though it's confusing.  The right part number
(N0146841) is listed as follows:

Exhaust Stud Cylinder Head, 74-79 Bus, 8mm x9mm $5.49 N0146841

However, when I look at the air-cooled Vanagon "head" section of the site I
see:

Exhaust Stud Cylinder Head, 72-79 Bus, 80-83 Vanagon, 8mm x8mm $2.09
N0144277

You might want to call and ask.
