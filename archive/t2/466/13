I will see if I can rig something up (tubular tape -climbing stuff) to 
reinforce
the door. I can't see me driving any faster than 2 mph or so.  We plan on
handing out candy and driving beside our kidlets.

Thanks! I never even thought of tempra paint.. essentially water colors.
Maybe what I will do is (as mentioned) clean and then wax the heck out of
it.  Maybe scuff the wax a little so it isn't really really smooth so as to 
hold
onto the paint a bit.  That should help with taking it off later.

Here's a prelook : http://www.firestrike.net/van/yellowduckie.jpg

Yellow submarine.. meet yellow rubber duckie.. again a name created
by the kidlets :)

Here's another idea a friend told me about: Guy painted his car a flat
black and used it as a chalk board.  Guess it washes off perfect every time.
Not sure if I would like a black van in the summer time though ;)
