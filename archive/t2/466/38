most easily available studs are way too soft for this application, they just
waste away in no time. i suggest getting exhaust studs from the VW dealer,
they are still available afaik, at least i hope they are...

an alternative would be to get a long m8 allen-head cap screw or some other
property class 12.9 fastener (hardness) with enough thread on it, then cut
off the part you don't need and grind the end clean and smooth. for
instance, if you got an m8 cap screw that was about 140mm long, you should
be able to make a 56mm stud.

or this:

134

which is a 60mm long set screw, it will work, it is the right hardness and
size anyhow.
