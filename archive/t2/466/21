Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Cover

Hello,

any suggestion for a source of bus (car) cover for outdoor storage of my 73
Westy.

I am driving it everyday still but it is running a little thin in a big
hurry especialy with the recent floods here in BC.  Great car,, just not the
best winter car maybe.

Regards, Andrea
