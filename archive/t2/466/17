Subject: low idle (hot)

Pumpkin II has recently developed a tendency to idle very low and rough
(sometimes stall) if I start it while hot. After a few minutes of running
this behavior ceases. Doesn't occur cold or when the engine is running at
normal operating temps, only if I restart it within say 30 minutes of being
shut down. I couldn't find anything in the archives; Any ideas?

77 2.0 L FI, stock, recent rebuild, all tuned up.
