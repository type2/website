Subject: Anyone get email from Busdepot in the last couple of days?

Just wondering if I'm being paranoid. I've emailed Busdepot yesterday and today via Ron(-at-) and orders(-at-) etc, but haven't recieved a reply. Perhaps they're just busy. I wanted to ask a question and add to my order, but havne't recieved any replies. I know they're busy so maybe I'm just your typical anxious customer. :-)
