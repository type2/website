Subject: push rod tube seals lasted 16k miles only?

I was reading a road test article at the Vanagon.com site and found some
info on aircooled engines and push rod tube seals. It was really interesting
to learn how soon the original push rod tube seals failed:

"At around 16,000 miles the engine began weeping oil.
Apparently the pushrod tube seals on either side of the flat 4-cylinder
engine frequently become embrittled by engine heat.  Commonwealth
performed a fix using Porsche 911 seals, more expensive but also more
durable than VW's.  This was done under VW's standard 1-year or 20,000-
mile warranty, which, by the way, has been extended for 1983 to one year
with unlimited mileage.  Had the Vanagon been out of warranty, we would
have been charged three hours of labor and $40 for the Porsche seals for
both sides".
