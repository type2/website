Subject: Re: [T2] Spinning Wheel-Wayward Relay Lever

Thanks for the tip Tom. In my case, it hasn't come off cleanly, and is a bit 
mangled. I will take another look in the morning, but I think that it is 
toast. Does anyone know if the Relay lever assmbly is available by itself? 
Also, could you describe these gusset plates you made to me?
Cheers,
Matthew

There is a fix, you weld it back on with gusset plates. A good welder can do
it. I've had it happen before, so have many others. Just be glad it happened
at home, not out on the road with  a transport coming at you. Tom
