Subject: Spinning Wheel-Wayward Relay Lever

Hey-

Sorry about my last vague posting. I am doing some professional continueing 
ed this week and have had a loong, tough day at marine firefighting school.

While troubleshooting my odd steering behavior, I slid under my bus and had 
my wife turn the steering wheel. The problem was as frightening as it was 
obvious: The housing that the relay arm rotates through has twisted away 
from the front axle. Ahhhhrgg.

What now? Is there any possible way to repair this, or does one need to 
replace the axle? How much of a PITA is it to replace the axle? Anybody want 
two (count 'em!) busses in Vancouver, BC?

Cheers,
Matthew
