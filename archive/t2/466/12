It's probably the easiest gauge to install - mine had a ring sender that 
went under one of the sparkplugs - just attach to the plug and screw 
back in - run the wire to the cockpit under the chassis.  I used the 
standard VDO gauge and it works great.  

I'd probably have say that the oil temp. gauge is more useful to keep an 
eye on overheating, so I'd put one of those in first/as well.
