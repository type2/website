Subject: parts bus needs home

i have a 72 parts bus that needs a new home.  about all it has left on it
is a perfect brake system, very nice dash and 4 nearly new tires and one
bald one.  i really don't want to take it to the junk yard when their are
people out there that need this stuff and it is free to anyone who wants
it.  it has a clear title that i'll sign over and you can take her right to
the junk yard when your done with her.  i don't have a dolly or i'd deliver
it to your house so if one of you has a dolly and wants it or wants to rent
a dolly (50 bucks at uhaul) come get her and i'll even give you a beer for
your trouble.
