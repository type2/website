Subject: interchangeable 1800 to 1700 engine parts?

Hello,

I have a complete 1800 (from a 1973 van) complete engine with a big hole in 
the case. I also have a good 1700 case from a 1972 van, but nothing else 
(except for mahle 1700 cylinder and piston set). So my question is as 
follows:

What can I use from the 1800 to complete the 1700? Can I use the crankshaft, 
camshaft, carbs, heads, alternator, flywheel, engine tin etc... from the 
1800 on the 1700?


Thanks in advance, Phil.
