I checked Pep Boys and Advance Auto here in Colorado Springs and both places
recommended me to Home Depot.  Home Depot said, "Studs?  They're in the
lumber department."  So I looked anyway and they didn't have anything
remotely resembling a head stud :(

Also checked with Pelican Parts (Porsche aftermarket distributor) and they
don't have them either.
