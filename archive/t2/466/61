Subject: heater air blower

I need some help getting my heater air blower working. I have checked the fan 
and it works but when in the bus no go. I have checked the ground from the 
lever its good and the red has voltage. I dont get any reading from the blue 
wire at the relay, van on , off and or running. Should this have voltage, is it a 
ground or what. I have check the 3 wires that come out of the wiring harness 
by the voltage regulator. There is a blue wire a black wire and a green with 
yellow stripe. What should these be reading, does anyone know, one thing I 
checked was continuity between the blue wire on the plug for the relay and the 
green wire with yellow they seem to be the same wire or same connection because 
it had continuity. thanks for any help.
Is there anyway to check the relay and what is it there for exactly.
