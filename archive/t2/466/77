A quick way is to take a screwdriver and give the tube a hefty poke with
it near the failure point.  If you poke a hole, you know it's bad!  If
you don't it might still be corroded, but not so bad.  You might also
thump around with a small hammer, listening to the sound.  Rusted metal
will sound "deader" than good metal.
