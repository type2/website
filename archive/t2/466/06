I've done this on several occasions, without any significant problems... 
Make sure you test the door as much as possible, pull on it, hit it, 
kick it... do your best to make it fall... I'm still very cautious when 
i have to drive with the door open... I try to give it a safety catch, 
if possible...  I'd imagine that if the door broke loose and hit the 
ground right, it might just be enough to knock the van over... that 
would suck...  Just be very careful, drive slow, don't touch the door or 
the handle while driving...

When i went to woodstock '99 i painted my van with Tempra paint.  It 
worked really well, was quite colorful, and came off pretty easily with 
water.  I did notice though, that since my paint was very old and faded 
(my bus is also yellow) and there was no clear coat left, there was a 
bit of a shiny spot in the paint after the tempra came off, like the 
tempra moisturized my old paint, and you could still read what it 
said... this has disapeared with time.  I'm sure it won't be an issue if 
you have fresh paint. 

here's a picture of my bus with the tempra:
