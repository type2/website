Subject: bumper reflective tape

I saw two accidents last week and both involved multiple cars rear ending each other. You know the kind: the first guy is speeding slightly and decides not to run the light and the second and third cars get themselves in trouble for following too closely. This is one of my fears driving around (at least their brakes are better if they remember to use them).

Anyway, last night on the freeway I was following a commercial van that had some safety striping and I couldn't take my eyes off of it. I've been wondering how to increase my awareness to vehicles behind me: even though I'm a big white box, the rear lights are somewhat dim compared to new car models.

I found some silver/white 3M Scotchlite reflective tape at home from a previous motorcycle project and I put the 60" roll on the middle part of the bumper (standard L90D bumper, no rubber pieces). The tape is 1" wide and you can get 2" wide strips but you'll need to give it a trim. The middle part of the bumper is about 83" long in total.

This stuff is reflective up to 1000 feet away in clear conditions. Amazing. Most of the police cars around here have it on their bumpers.
