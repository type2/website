Hello Friends!

I have recently adopted a '74 Bay Window from a well intentioned, but not very
mechanical owner. There seems to be some confusion as to which engine is
onboard. The PO thinks that the original may have been replaced with a newer
2000cc, but it appears to me that it may still be the original 1800cc.

I am new to busses, and would appreciate help in recognising what
distinguishing marks to look for. Most of the engine labelling in missing, but
I can see what appears to be "AW-A". Can any of you old hands translate that
for me? To add to the confusion, do people ever bore-out the 1800s to 2000?

Thanks for your knowledge and assistance!

Cheers,
Matthew
