Thanks, Greg.  And thanks to the rest of you who sent similar e-mails to 
me.  I will, of course, stick with my bus.  I love her.  And, yes, I am 
sort of in that "first year" period.  When I bought the bus, it had a 
screwed up exhaust system, engine knock, oil leak, bad electrical system, 
etc.   Slowly but surely, I'm taking care of it, but it has just been kind 
of daunting lately.  Tuition and books drained me of my usual bus-funds, so 
it's been stuck in my driveway for the past month while I pay off things 
like car insurance ;)

Out of curiosity, though, has anyone been in a situation like this and had 
to replace most of the major parts of the car (i.e. motor, transmission, 
etc.)?  If so, I'm just wondering both the best way to do this and how much 
it'll end up costing me.  Also, I currently have an 1800cc engine.  Would I 
get a more reliable performance out of a 1600cc or should the 1800 last me 
just as long?

Again, thanks for the feedback, everyone!
