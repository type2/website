The guy who makes/sells these was at High Country peddling his wares.
I did like the idea, but hated the fact that it put your liquid
beverage right in front of the radio (or worse gauges). The product
was simple enough and seemed sturdy. The only mark against him was
that he made a fellow camper take off her pink fuzzy wheel cover in
her thing for one of the pictures taken [0] :-( and she didn't even
get a free holder out of the deal.
