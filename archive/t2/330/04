Subject: Re: [T2] Buses on very bad roads: fine or foolhardy?

hello All   Buses can be amazing as to where you can go in them . I have 
driven my old 66 westy on some of the damnest so called roads that you could 
imagine .in all kinds of weather  solid ice is the hardest to go on.They 
always do better with some weight in the back of them. If you ever catch me 
at one of the campouts get me to tell some of the  "Tales of the Ghoost" 
after 32 years I have plently of them. Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
