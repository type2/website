Being a backpacker and hiking fool, I have taken my busses down many a
forest road and crossed many a stream.I have even followed my brother in his
jeep down ORV trails here in the national forest before and what really got
him was when we got to camp he had to set up camp all I did was pull my
curtains shut and unfold the Z-bed. The VW bus is truely the first SUV!!
