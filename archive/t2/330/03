The traction is comparable, but not as good as a bug.  It's the weight
distribution that determines traction.

The VW suspension was designed in the mid '30s, when normal driving
involved roads that would cause a current SUV pilot to pale.  Most
non-primary roads were dirt, usually not smooth.  Some complain about the
roughness of VW suspension on paved roads (transmitting small
irregularities, etc) but that was the least of the suspension designer's
problem in the '30s.

Not really.  It's a tough beast.  Be careful of the loose stuff and it
will get you there.

Quite a way, but keep in mind the bus was designed before Consumer Reports
started fixing their lane-change tests.  I wouldn't take it more than 30
degrees from upright.

Very easy, if the surface is loose.  Be prepared, walk the tough spots,
and don't be afraid to say "enough!"
