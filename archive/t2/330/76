Hi Volks,

A hugely important point is raised here: Don't try this without the 
proper rubber on your vehicle. Handling is VASTLY improved when the bus 
is outfitted with tires that meet or exceed the original specs. The 
thought of tilt-testing a bus on single-ply-sidewall tires scares the 
crap out of me.

In 1986 I had a 72 westy with a 914 engine. I used to powerslide the 
corners of deep-woods logging roads in Algonquin Park at 55 Mph with 
the engine screaming at the top of third gear. I had a lot of fun that 
year, until the engine put a rod through the top of the case.  YMMV.

Happy trails,
