Now verify that fuel is getting to the injectors. Verify the pressure and 
volume. If you have pressure while starting and it falls off when you 
release the key, it could be the Air Flow Meter which has a switch to keep 
the fuel pump running. Also, check the red wire that runs from the starter 
to the double relay and/or verify that the fuel pump is getting voltage. 
See the wiring diagrams in the Bentley. If you don't have the Bentley 
manual, do get one. It has all the info needed to sort out fuel delivery 
problems.
