Subject: Camper headliner

 I've been looking for a replacement camper headliner for a long time: nothing at the junkyards and what I have has shrunk from the heat and peeled and is no good. This the vinyl above the cab, the sides and on the bottom on the top bunk.

GoWesty seems to have started selling a kit.  Does anyone know anything about it?
