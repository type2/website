Subject: Starts right up and stalls (still looking)

Hi again volks,

Last night I described what my 75 FI bus was doing and got some suggestions on what to look at. To recap, after changing my clutch cable, I went to start my bus and it started right away and then died within 1 or 2 seconds. This happens over and over. I tripple-checked all vacume hoses (especially the one to the brake booster in the area where I was working) and everything is in place. I also confirmed that there was gas in the tank (you never know sometimes). I thought for sure it was a vacume leak and was chomping at the bit to get home from work and fix it, but now I'm totally bummed. Does anyone have an idea where to look next? I will be out of town for a couple of days, so I will not be able to work on my girl, but I will have email access. Thanks in advance for all the help and good thoughts.

Peace
