Read any good historical retrospective on Ferdinand Porsche and it will mention that before he formed the company his namesake bears he spent must of his time in developing various cars in places like Hungary and Austria where paved roads were the exception. Porsche head designer from 1931-1966, Edwin Komenda holder of the US patent for the beetle body, grew up in Austria and had similar experience to draw from.
