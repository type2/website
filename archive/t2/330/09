Subject: A cc'ing the heads question

Hi all:

I'm trying to cc a set of AMC air-cooled heads.  I've done this before, but
I'm having a problem this time that I didn't encounter last time, maybe
because this time I'm using a burette where before I used a syringe.

Anyway, as you know, the AMC heads have the built-in step around the
circumference of the head; my Plexiglas piece rests on the step.  I'm using
water in the burette, colored red with food coloring.  The problem I'm
having is that I'm frequently encountering bubbles in the shallow portion of
the head resulting from the built-in step, bubbles that I'm having trouble
dislodging even though the head is fairly strongly biased toward the air
escape hole.  I've tapped the Plexiglas lightly with a wrench trying to
vibrate the bubbles free, and sometimes that makes the problem even worse by
breaking a fairly large bubble into lots of small bubbles that *really*
don't want to move.  Obviously the capillary action is fairly strong here,
or maybe a static charge I'm inducing in the Plexiglas because I'm cleaning
it between attempts.

I like using the colored water because it's safe and easy to dispose of, but
I'm thinking perhaps I should use a solvent of some sort - kerosene, paint
thinner, etc. - if it will help eliminate my bubble problem.

Any body know?

TIA.
