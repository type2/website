List,

I just finished talking to the guys out at Weddle Engineering to see if the
rumors of Quaife (sp?) limited slip rear ends for the 091 were true.  Sadly,
they are not but the company is willing to do a limited run of at least
30 units.  If 15 orders for the $1200 unit could be mustered, Weddle might
cover the rest.  So far, there have been less than 5 folks willing to
ante up on this.  Please contact me if you're interested and I'll forward
the numbers on to Weddle.

Here's what's available currently:

1. Lock-Right lockers were bought out two years ago an no longer produced/NLA
2. The guy who sells NOS LSDs only has units for the bug transaxles
3. No Quaife available for the 091 trans.
4. When available, Weddle has ZF limited slip units available for $800-1,000
   but all parts are used.  There are no new clutch packs for these. A NOS
   unit would probably fetch at least $1600!

Quaife anyone?
