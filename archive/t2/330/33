Good morning from New York everyone,
While I have no personal experience with an 009 distributor,  there is
an article at http://www.bostonengine.com/articles/009.html on this
very subject.  It is written by Bob Donalds, of Boston Engine
Exchange, and I've been told that his technique works pretty good.
