Hi Richard,

Thanks, that's a good tip. They use it on some police cars & ambulances  
here too. I can only imagine the number of people who will  
automatically hit the brakes as that bright white stripe is suddenly  
illuminated at the extreme limit of their halogen beams. And the curse  
that follows as they discover it's just a bus, after already having  
tossed something out a window ;^)

Jamie Rivers carries a couple strips of the some 3M stuff in his glove  
compartment that have been applied to some "fridge-magnet" material. He  
often arranges them in a "slow-moving vehicle" pattern when we gang up  
for a carabus, or when a carabus is parked creatively:

Not so permanent, but certainly useful for special occasions.

Happy trails,
