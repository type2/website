Ah ha, I wasn't sure of the angle, thanks.

I'm going to try to make the bayonet-style head work as both a b-style and
as the screw-style mount.  Do the screw holes leave the screws exposed
(heads showing), or do the heads of the screws recess into the screw holes?

Thanks for the info, Andy.  With the measurements I'll be able to match the
length of the stock long stem mount.  Creating a working adjuster on the
bumper thingy will be interesting, but I've got a good idea how to do it.
