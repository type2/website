Subject: Eberspacher BN4 installation

I just picked up a BN4 for my bus, complete with duct work and
wiring. The archives tell me that there were some installation
instructions/temlates floating around but I don't know the
current status. Does anyone have this info? I'd be willing to
pay reasonable copying and shipping costs to get a copy.

I'm also looking for a manual that's in decent shape. I have found
some .tif scans of one online but the quality is not very good.

Thanks in advance for any help!
