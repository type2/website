Subject: Re: cup holders

I bought a pair of great cup holders a few years back from GoWesty... 
They fold up out of the way, have a sticky backing that holds well but 
isn't permanent.  I stuck them on the sides of the seat pedestals facing 
the walk-thru.  Almost invisible when not in use.  Super sturdy...

Search using the word "cup", it's the first of the three shown...
