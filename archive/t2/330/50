Subject: Engine Problems

Hello List,

    I sent a message asking for help on my engine.  I had pulled the
engine to change the clutch.  After putting it back in and reconnecting
everything, the engine wasn't firing.  So reconnected everything and
still no fire.  Everyone that responded to my email, told me to check
the wiring and also that I need to crank the engine to TDC.   When I
pulled the engine I didn't remove the distributor.  So should I remove
the distributor now and crank the engine to TDC then replace the
distributor.  Or should I just make sure the the rotor is firing in the
correct order when I crank the engine to TDC.   I am going to remove the
distributor cover tonight and hand crank the engine to TDC.  I just want
to make sure I am doing this process correctly.

Dean
