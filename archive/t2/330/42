A - 6 3/8" as you have it drawn. The striaght part of the shaft is 6" add
the other 3/8 to the tip of the bent portion

B - 4 5/8" , as A. 4 1/4 to the end of the straight part of the shaft. add
the 3/8 to the tip etc...

C - 1 3/8 center to center.

D - 1 1/8 on the short side (top) like 3/32 longer on the lower side due
to the angle.

E sort of... The older mirror has an oval mounting head 2 1/8 wide by 1
1/8 high. the screws are centered vertically.

hope that helps.
