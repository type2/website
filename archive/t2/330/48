Hate to break the news, but there really is no way to tell with out
doing some serious engine surgery. You can make some guesses and might
be correct, but can't tell for sure.

looks like the AW case is consistant w/ an 1800 stock [0], but an PO
could have made that case into a 2.0L w/out much problems, so this is
far from a sure thing. But if it runs well, I wouldn't worry much
about it, just enjoy it.
