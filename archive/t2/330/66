Subject: Re: [T2] bumper reflective tape

" This is one of my fears driving around (at least their brakes are better
if they remember to use them).
 I've been wondering how to increase my awareness to vehicles behind me:
even though I'm a big white box, the rear lights are somewhat dim compared
to new car models."

I went to a local Farm Supply store and bought one of those metal orange
reflective triangle signs ($7) and mounted it to the rear glass with some
suction cups (Wally Mart, $2) and it was amazing the effect it had:  Before,
18 wheelers would ride my tail all the time... now they give me wide berth.
I suspect that's because the MEANING of the orange triangle is pretty
universal and because they can spot it a mile off. :-)

I also thought that the Cops might hassle me about it... well, so far, so
good... no hassles.
