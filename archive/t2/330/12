Subject: Re: [T2] A cc'ing the heads question

Glad to see someone building a engine right. I use
kerosene myself for doing the cc's, but the
transmission fluid and cleaner sounds good also. Just
get your compression around 7.1 to 7.3 for this cheap
gas that we have. good luck with the rebuild. Phil
