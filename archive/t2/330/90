P.O.?  Parole Officer?  Post Office?

Anyway, from what I understand, you cannot just bring the Mexican Beetles
into the U.S.  Although I know why they are in place, those damned safety
laws are the reason and it frustrates me.  A brand new "old style" mexican
beetle (They call it the Sedan) only cost between $7000 - $8000.  Restoring
one could cost more than that.

BeetleMex  www.btlmex.com is a company that imports them, but I am told that
they find an old bug, restore the pan and attach it to the "new" mexican
vehicle and this allows them to use the oringinal Vehicle Identification
Number.  So you end up with a freshly built Mexican Beetle with a pan from a
classic bug, and on paper, it looks like you own the original - in essence
restoring it.

They are really nice looking and I think worth the $11 large that BeetleMex
charges (pictures are on their website).  But there are a couple part, I
forget what they are, that I was told are almost impossible to find in the
US and a laborer that can work on them is harder still.

I know nothing about bringing buses back.  Plenty floating around this side
of the border, so I don't know why you'd want to.

If you can speak Spanish...
