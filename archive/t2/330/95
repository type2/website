You guys are talking way over my head with this limited slip 
differential stuff, but I do know that I went to college with both the 
Weddles who are Weddle Engineering...I'm going up to Santa Barbara this 
weekend for a little gathering at their house - you guys let me know 
what it is you're in negotiation with them for, and I'll put in the old 
good word for the type2 list!

I just finished talking to the guys out at Weddle Engineering to see if the
rumors of Quaife (sp?) limited slip rear ends for the 091 were true.
