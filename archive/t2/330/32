Subject: hard spare tire cover

Hey List,

The other day someone posted pictures of a bus they had just bought.  In 
one of the pics was the spare tire in it's well, in the back of the bus, 
with a nifty looking hard plastic cover for it.

Does anyone know where one of these hard covers can be purchased?

Thanks,

Bradley
'79 Bus
