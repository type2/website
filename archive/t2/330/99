Subject: Re: [T2] Starts right up and stalls (still looking)

Blake,
  I had this exact same problem, and after replacing every possible fuel 
injection component and then giving up, I called a local AIRS member to come 
by and take a look.  He stopped by and felt the air intake during the few 
seconds it ran and noticed that there was a slight pulsing of air coming out 
of it, then checked the spark plugs and noticed number 3 looked odd.  As 
soon as we popped the valve cover off we noticed that the valve spring from 
#3 exaust was broken into 3 pieces.  I had neglected to check because the 
heads had less than 100 miles on them!  A $15 overhead valve spring 
compresser from Sears took care of the problem.  Hope this helps, and a 
public thanks to Randall for helping me out.
