Be aware, however, that you can be cited for displaying this emblem if you
drive faster than 25MPH.  It's really made for tractors, bicycles, Amish
buggys, etc.

OTOH, if you make one in a color other than orange (fluorescent green
leaps to mind) it is no longer a "slow moving vehicle emblem" and not
subject to the regulation.
