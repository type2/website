Subject: new Mexican Longblocks?

My new longblock just arrived.  It was boxed up in corrugated cardboard 
and came with a new oil cooler (and gaskets).  There's a sticker on the 
box that says "assembled in Mexico."  The logos of VW, Audi, Seat, and 
Skoda are stamped on the outside, plus "Original Parts" in 18 different 
languages.  It's a Brazilian AS41 case but the full flow boss is not 
drilled out and capped like the Mexican AS41 case it is replacing.  
Also, the place where the thermostat bracket mounts needs to be drilled 
and tapped.

Already installed on the block are:  flywheel, valve covers, woodruff 
key for crankshaft pulley.

You will need:  exhaust installation kit (with extra gaskets/hardware 
for the heater boxes (exhaust #1 & #3), gaskets and deflector plate for 
oil breather/gen-alt stand, gaskets for the fuel pump and block, plus 
all the hardware (10x1.25 nuts and washers) for installing the 
"peripherals" on the top.  Don't forget a new clutch kit.

I guess that cases are not cast in Mexico anymore.
