Subject: RE: [T2] 1978 2.0L FI unit Spark Plug Swap

Erik and Bob and fellow Bus Pilots:

This has the photos of my current issue:
http://www.hueymungus.com/VW/teardown/sparkplugs/index.htm

With these photos, it looks like I am headed towards a machine shop.  Which,
I really have no desire to do.  But will since I have a camping excursion
planned for Feb 3rd. 

I tried molly grease to lube up the rethreader and then used the anti-seize
stuff to no avail.  It seemed that when using the rethreader unit it went ok
for a bit, but as I got lower into the hole it slowed way up.  Could not
move it at all. (this is after 2-3 rotations).  So I stopped.

I do not think that the 191, 388 and 488 numbers really mean much in the way
of width since they are all the same.

So, does it look like I am headed for a shop?  I do.

Thanks to all who answered the first email.

they make a spark plug "thread chaser" that you can pick up for a couple
bucks at the local FLAPS, has worked for me most times

if you force it you will likely need to take the head off, what you have to
do with it after it is off will depend on how badly the threads are bunged
up

I've tried most of the anti seize stuff and am not overly impressed by any
of them. the copper based ones seem marginally better,

good luck
Bob
