they make a spark plug "thread chaser" that you can pick up for a couple
bucks at the local FLAPS, has worked for me most times

if you force it you will likely need to take the head off, what you have
to do with it after it is off will depend on how badly the threads are
bunged up

I've tried most of the anti seize stuff and am not overly impressed by any
of them. the copper based ones seem marginally better,

good luck
Bob
