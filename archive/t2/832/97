Thank you all for your answers.
I was going into a vicious cycle of oval/square, oval'ish/square'ish  
with my roomate prior to ordering new HE's,  while each of us  
balanced the block on the edge of its packing crate lol.

I appreciate all the answers ! You've nicely pointed me in the right  
direction.

Steve
