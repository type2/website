Subject: A blessing?

I was taking measurements of engine components ( i.e. crank, cam, cylinder...) and found to my surprise that some of the readings are above the upper wear tolerance.  I have two books/manuals that state the same tolerances.
   
  I don't suspect the engine has been rebuilt before.  Is this a common occurance for an engine that is over 30 years old.  Hate to sound pessimistic, but it hasn't been all good news with the van.  It is a 1700 dual carb.
