Subject: Re: [T2] 1978 2.0L FI unit Spark Plug Swap - head removal? Not

I don't agree that you need to remove the head right away. I have had
threadserts, and heli-coils replaced in my motorcycles and other aluminum
heads over the years, and many times the mechanics have been able to do it
in-situ. My last repair was on a XS11 Yamaha where the mechanic was able to
keep the aluminum bits out of the cylinder with lots of grease on the tap,
as mentioned in How to Hotrod VW's by Fisher. I would check around first
about whether it needs to come off or not. I was just installing a Crane
XR700 ignition in my 77 Westy yesterday and lying down on the bed I had a
very good view of the no. 1 cylinder sparkplug, so perhaps with tin removal
it would be doable by a KNOWLEDGABLE mechanic. Where is Adam situated and
who are the local pro's in his area?
Regards,
Courtney
