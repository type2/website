looking to see if there is any winter shows going on or any local vw clubs
are having meetings"

Sam,
   In years past there has been a winter campout in the Pocono Mountains of
PA.  I haven't gone the last few years and don't know if it's scheduled for
the winter of 2006.  It's been announced here on the type 2 list in the past
so just keep your eyes open and stay tuned.
