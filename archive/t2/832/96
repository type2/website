I can't say for sure about the Volkswagen pistons as I have not yet opened a VW motor. However, I rebuilt a 2.8 V6/60 GM motor about 3 years ago, and when I removed the pistons, they too had concentric rings on the top. They are flat-top pistons. On each of the 6 pistons, there was also a big notch cut out of the corner. I can't figure out why this is. I thought maybe that it was from damage? But all the pistons have this same notch in them. 

I think maybe the notch has something to do with evening out the compression, or maybe weight or... who knows?

I suspect that the rings might be used to give the explosion something to grab on to?

Hell.. I don't know what I'm talking about, but I've seen it on a few motors myself.
