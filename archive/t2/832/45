#2 is the big one, make sure all that *&(-at-)##(-at-)! at the end of a message is
gone.   also I think there must be some formula because no matter how
important the message your responding to is and how relavant it is there
seems to be a caculation that if you don't put in at least a certain
percentage of new material it bounces it.

to fool that part sometimes I'll just put in a bunch of empty lines
between paragraphs etc, helps to put at least one or two characters on
those lines  (I like ! or ..... stuff like that.)


of course if I meet that bot on some cyber back alley he will have T-2
tire tracks all over him (mandatory bus content)

have a great and smooth running holiday

Bob
