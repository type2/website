Subject: Merry Christmas, Bus People!

It's Christmas... time to look back and think of the good things you may have 
accomplished in the year 2005.  My ole Bay was bought new by my sister and some 
years later she sold it to me. I was able to get this 69 out of the (sometimes 
inclement) Maryland weather and into a warm garage in South Carolina, where it 
now snoozes on its own set of jackstands.  May not sound like much of an 
accomplishment unless you consider I had to succeed in persuading my good frau 
that we needed to sell-up in Maryland and move house.

Moving right along... Not to be sacrilegious: I think about the death penalty.  
If the Romans had not practiced capital punishment, would the Christian church 
have got off to a start?  Not a Type 2 topic... 

but MERRY CHRISTMAS to all Type 2 enthusiasts, and to all a full tank of gas!

Not to be sacrilegious (I sing in the church choir...) but if Mary and
Joseph had a Westfalia Campmobile to take them back home to pay their taxes
to the Roman Empire, how would the course of history have changed???

One can only wonder!

Merry Christmas and God's blessings to all --
