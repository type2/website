Subject: Re: [T2] stranded in northern Virginia, urgent help needed

Thanks a bunch to all of you guys..... i have fowarded over 30 
messages/help/solution  to him.... still i wasn't able to contact him by 
phone or e-mail...

I am amaze to see how most of those messages came from the type2 
list....  not much from the Vanagon mailling list and other Vanagon 
list!!!!!!! kind of ironic considering he is driving a Vanagon..... that 
make me proud to go south in a few days in my 73 instead of my 87 or my 
84...... anyway, that van as been good to me...
