<< if Mary and Joseph had a Westfalia Campmobile to take them back home
to pay their taxes to the Roman Empire, how would the course of history
have changed??? 
One can only wonder! >>

The answer to this is really simple.

The IRS guy outa Rome would still be looking for them---- ~:)

Merry Christmas To One And All---
