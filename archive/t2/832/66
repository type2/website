Subject: Re: [T2] 1978 2.0L FI unit Spark Plug Swap - head removal? Not

<<I don't agree that you need to remove the head right away. I have had
threadserts, and heli-coils replaced in my motorcycles and other
aluminum heads over the years, and many times the mechanics have been
able to do it in-situ.>>

FYI---Or DYK that there is a insert threading tool that runs from the
inside of the head ---to the outside.

The tool collapses, it gets shoved in the plug hole and you back it out
along with the aluminum or cast iron shavings, and then the insert is
run into that hole as usual.

No filings fall into the cylinder in question when the plug hole is
bored to the correct insert size, thay all are run out with the tap.

Neat tool.
