Subject: Re: [T2] 1978 2.0L FI unit Spark Plug Swap - head removal? Not 

Head removal is "NOT" necessary! Simply pull the plug (or its already out
right), pull the valve cover over that cylinder, roll the engine over until
the "EXHAUST" valve "ONLY" on that cylinder is fully opened, do the tread
repair letting the chips fall where they will, then blow air into the
exhaust pipe! With the valve opened all the chips will be removed threw the
plug hole, simple! Worked at the dealer for twenty years and it was always
done that way with no problems.
