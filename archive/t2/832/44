Alexis Prappas - Brazil
1973 split http://66.34.72.138/gallery/image/2101437d.JPG

                that Brazil had split windshield buses in 1973.

What can you share with us.  When was the last Brazil split bus made??  Are 
there many split window buses in Brazil?  What would be the price range for 
a top quality, split window bus in Brazil??

Thanks.
