Hi,
there is a product I sed to insulate all my exhaust pipes, etc. Its 
fiberglass non-adhesive tape. Midwest Motorworks sells it. It stinks for 
a few thousand miles as the stuff smells a bit like waffles burning 
until the stuff finishes aging. Works great. You will need something to 
clamp it in place though. They sell ties that I didn't much like. I 
ended up using baling wire and hose clamps as they worked better and 
were snugger (more snug).
