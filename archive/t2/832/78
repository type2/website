Subject: Intake and Exhaust Studs

Hey guys,

     Does anyone have a source for intake and exhaust manifold studs? I stripped another intake manifold bolt hole, and I'm getting mad. I'd really like to use studs so I can minimize the risk of destroying more threads.

Oh, also... I'm not the kind of guy that likes to take a car to a shop. I usually prefer to ruin something myself first before I'm willing to pay someone to fix it. I've never installed a Heli-Coil before, but can anyone tell me what kind of tools I typically would need? A tap and die kit I assume? Where do I buy helicoils and any idea what kind I need?

I have a 1800 Type-4 motor in a 73 Bus with a 2-bbl Webber Progressive carb with those long intake runners.


Thanks!

Todd
