Subject: returned emails

To the administators

Am having difficulty getting messages through.  Though I delete most  
of any email I respond to (only quoting 1 or 2 lines) I keep getting  
my emails returned because
"Your mail to the type2 list has been intercepted and is
being returned to you because it appears to the list
server to contain an excessive amount of quoted material."

Any help appreciated.
