Adam:  Yes, a machine shop has a threaded insert which
they can install.  In-fact, you can buy the kit.

   But if you are a beginner, involve professionals. 
But a quick question before you invest in head repair:
 How many miles are on the current heads?  Any way of
knowing?  Do you know what your compression numbers
were?  I'm attempting to gauge how close your existing
head(s) are to replacement.
    
You need to remove the head; no choice there.  When
the head is removed though, I would take it to an
experienced VW Air-Cooled mechanic, and have them
inspect the head.  The mechanic may judge the head to
have only 10k, or 20k of life left.  For my money,
should the existing heads not have much life left, I
would replace BOTH of them.  Rebuilt 2.0 heads $230
each.  New heads, $300 each.  Used, much cheaper. 
Avoid high-performance heads.  Your 1978 would need to
have oval ported heads.
   
There is also a very quick cylinder wall inspection
which should be performed when the head(s) are off.
