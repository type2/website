Dave, get ahold of Mike Adams. He has my old westy and bought the lowering
kit for it. He is very knowledgable. Unfortunately I don't have his current
email. I do know he is with telus.net though, so they might have a search
for him available.

Hi all, 
 
Im planing on going with the 205/65R15 in the front and 215/65R15 in 
The rear on my 78 Transporter with stock rear height and drop 
Spindles in the front. 
 
Is anyone else running this meat? 
Does anyone have pics of it on a bus? 
 
Thanks, 
 
Dave.
