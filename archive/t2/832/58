I suppose not...  But I'm glad he did.

Blessings,

It's Christmas... time to look back and think of the good things you may
have 
accomplished in the year 2005.  My ole Bay was bought new by my sister and
some 
years later she sold it to me. I was able to get this 69 out of the
(sometimes 
inclement) Maryland weather and into a warm garage in South Carolina, where
it 
now snoozes on its own set of jackstands.  May not sound like much of an 
accomplishment unless you consider I had to succeed in persuading my good
frau 
that we needed to sell-up in Maryland and move house.

Moving right along... Not to be sacrilegious: I think about the death
penalty.  
If the Romans had not practiced capital punishment, would the Christian
church 
have got off to a start?  Not a Type 2 topic... 

but MERRY CHRISTMAS to all Type 2 enthusiasts, and to all a full tank of
gas!
