Subject: Exhaust Port Shape.

I have attached a link to some pics of the exhaust ports on my new  
longblock, from the looks they are oval,which to me would mean that  
72-78 style HE's.
I had initially been under the impression that I had '79 style heads  
on but now I don't know. If the pics suck I will get my other camera  
and take more.

Please help me solve my mystery.

Thanks
Steve
