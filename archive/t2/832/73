Subject: Heat in a Bus

I use my 78 Bay as transportation to work when it is too cold or wet or icy
to ride my motorcycle to work.  It is warmer than the bike but could be
better.  I have read the long article from the Archives on improving things
and have a couple of questions that I could use some help on.  My electric
blower is not hooked up and when I connect it to the battery, it holws so I
know I have to disassemble it and at least lube the bearings.   The heat
article said to insulate the paper ductwork by pulling 4" Mylar insulation
over it, not 6".  I note the corrugated paper conduit is closer to 8".  Is
there a smaller tube inside the large outside one.  Of course I know I would
get better heat with an OEM heat exchanger using the 72-74 set up.  But as
long as my crossover pipe is holding up I will stick with the stock Rube
Goldberg 75-78 set up.  Would it help if I insulated the outside of the heat
exchangers in some way?  I was thinking of 2" wide fiberglass insulation,
covered with sticky foam aluminum back tape to keep out moisture.  Also the
U pipes are exposed and I could perhaps wrap these with something but I do
not know what as they get real hot.  The up pipes to the flapper boxes could
be wrapped in fiberglass and the flapper boxes as well.   Does anyone have
suggestions on what to do with the plastic accordion "Mufflers" and Y
connection?

 

Feeding inside air to the auxiliary blower sounds like a good idea, but any
suggestions on how to do it with a Westfalia to avoid all the cabinetry,
etc.  Has anyone done this and could you explain what you used?

 

Thanks for any suggestions.  This is a project I should do after my garage
is completed in a couple of weeks and before it gets really cold in DC.
