Hy Karl

I will try to take more pics, if the new owner has not take the bus from the 
parking of the VW dealer.

There are no Air cond. in the brazilian kombi, and i believe theres no 
heater to, specialy because here is almost hot weather down here. So there 
is only ventilation controls on the dash. (open, close etc.)
