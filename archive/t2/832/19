Chris,

Sounds like it to me.  I've done this before on a 65 DC in the middle of 
the worst blizzard in pennsylvania in 30 years(was 1972..or maybe 71).

Drove it 30 miles after it broke.  Could still start and run it, but not 
very well.

Bought a motor out of a wrecked bug for $100.00 and drove it the rest of 
the way to NYC.

I got a chance to tear it down later and it was indeed a broken crank.

No one else had ever heard of such a thing at the time, so it was weird.

Cheers, dave
