Subject: Re: [T2] Lights won't stay on main beam - Fixed

Fixed it. As I suspected, the new relay had failed. However I found the old 
one and took the lid off.

Inside there is a clever latching mechanism which has become a bit sticky. 
Once cleaned out with a soft brush and the pivots lubricated with a very 
light oil (I'm a railway modeller so this stuff is to hand), everything was 
fine.I also cleaned the contacts with a bit of emery paper.

The top was put back on and the unit plugged in. Everything fine !

The moral is, if you have a German part, poke around its innards before 
condemning it. Perhaps it's fixable.

Hope this helps someone.
