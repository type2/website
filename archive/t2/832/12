Subject: Re: [T2] My 67 bus......

I've been to Karl's place.  No room (or a yard) really in front or rear to
park and the street he lives on is sort of a quasi "main drag" in town.  He
doesn't really live in a quiet neighborhood off the beaten path or out in
the country like some of us out here (I know I don't).

I like the junker vehicle filled with concrete idea.  I'd put a lot of
reinforced rebar in the mix as well.  Don't just wreck the drunk's car, hurt
him/her as well, real bad.  Yeah, I know, Christmas spirit and all that, but
gee whiz for cryin' out loud..............

Sorry for the loss Karl, that's a real nice Bus you have.
