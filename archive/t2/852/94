Troy,

I would think that a 6,000 lb winch would do it.

If it is rated at 6,000 then presumably the cable is good for a straight 
lift up at 6,000 before it snaps.

the rolling resistance of the bus should be no where near 6,000lbs...even 
going up an incline.

The only bad part will be if the brakes are locked up from sitting too 
long...and other anti rolling problems.

**************************************************************************
Re-read the winch specs....does it say rolling weight of 6,000 or straight 
up weight of 6,000????

*That* is the real question!

****************************************************************************

Cheers, dave
