The bolt should just tap out.

Removing the tab on the sway bar bushing clamp is often hard because it's probably rusted itself together. Often the tab is damaged too much to reuse so you either have to use a new one or be extra careful.

The best way to reattach the tab after spreading the sway bar clamp is to use a pair of vice-grips at one end of the clamp and a pair of pliers at the other while you squeeze it to wiggle it on. Use some grease to help slide it on and don't foget to bend the tab up when you are done.
