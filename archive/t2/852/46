Subject: speaker box

I have some nice acoustic research speakers and a amp
I got from a friend(FREE), and wonder if anyone has
pics of where they mounted the speakers. I dont want
to hack up the panel below the back seat(lose storage
space), and a speaker box would always be in the way.
any ideas?
