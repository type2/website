Subject: Re: [T2] idiot lite for oil pressure sender

I use a gauge i bought on line thru McMaster Carr.......a good one with 
glass cover and liquid filled.  I think I paid $30 or so, andthen just 
hooked up a hose and a 1/8 npt adapter for the oil pressure 
hole.........while you turn it over on the floor of your garage you can 
watch it prime....it is neat........
