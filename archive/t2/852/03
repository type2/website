Chai,

    I notice that you have the left tire on the ground. When one control arm
is higher or lower than the other, you tension on the sway bar. The twist of
the bar is what helps keep the car from swaying in curves.
    Jack up the whole front end and place it on stands. This may be enough
to relieve the pressure. If not remove both clamps from the rubber bushings,
and let the sway bar hang.
    Hang in there Chai, we'll get'er done! :-)
