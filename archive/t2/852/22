Subject: big oil leak - advise required !!!

Hi Volks,
Tomorrow will be a big day working on the Westy , I'll try to fix my big 
oil leak (I have to refill 1/4gal every 500Miles).
I can't see the leak from visual inspection, and it looks like its 
leaking pretty much from everywhere. most of it is burned while running 
the van (strong oil burned smell) , the rest drip on the floor when the 
van stop and the engine still hot, the leak stop when the engine is cold.
The engine has been rebuild from Quality German (LA)  - renamed Nazi 
German for the occasion ;-))). it has 5000 Mi on it.
Anyway , the two front cylinders (1 & 3) score pretty bad  to the 
compression test (80 vs 130 for the back cylinders). except than that , 
the engine work like a charm (beside the fact that I am lacking of power 
in slop)
Could it be possible that I am building too much pressure in the 
crankcase one way or another and this extra pressure is responsible for 
my oil leak ?

Any advise for tomorrow work will be welcome.

Thanks guys !!
