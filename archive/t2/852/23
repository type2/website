Hi Chris,

You won't get progress until you go to the car wash and pressure wash
all the oil off the underside of the vehicle. Remove the push rod tube
covers so you can get up in there too. Then when it is clean you can
see where the leak starts from.

 oil leak (I have to refill 1/4gal every 500Miles).
 I can't see the leak from visual inspection, and it looks like its
 leaking pretty much from everywhere
