 OK, if I am going to run my type 4 engine on the
 garage floor, what and how 
 do I hook up an inline idiot lite to the oil
 pressure sender so I can see if 
 I get oil pressure or not...
 
 I know, it was done right before my eyes last year,
 but man, like, I wasn't 
 paying attention.  I have a spare tail lite bulb in
 a socket, with two 
 jumper wires coming out of it.
 
-----------------------------------------------------

Positive from the battery to the bulb.
Negative side of the bulb to the sender.
When the pressure is zero, sender goes to ground, bulb
lights up.
When pressure is above 5-7 psi, sender opens and
breaks ground, bulb goes out.
