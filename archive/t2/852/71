My 1971 has a hitch that was installed in 1976 by what I think was the VW
dealer in Corvallis, Oregon at the time (remember those innocent days when
dealers weren't places to fear, loath, or avoid?).  Because I have to remove
it temporarily in the next week or two to replace my heads, I'd be happy to
(crudely) sketch up the design and the mounting arrangement when it's out if
anyone is interested in replicating these things.  It's basically a thick flat
bar that runs from underneath the ends of the two front-to-back chassis beams
(the heavy square beams that the bumper mounts to).  A big bolt runs through a
hole drilled through the top of the end of each of these beams (and a bit of
the engine compartment rear tin) and a hole drilled through each end of the
thick bar.  The middle of the bar has a perpendicular tongue with a little
bend to clear the bottom of the muffler.  If nothing else, the trailer ball
makes a convenient place to tie a tow rope to when pulling 4WDs out of
ditches.
