Hi Barry,

    Why not hook a pressure gauge to it and really know what's up? Cheap and
quick.
    I made mine with a good quality 200 lb gauge and a 16 inch brake flex
hose with 1/8 inch pipe threads on the end. I also bought a 1/4 inch pipe
adapter for different engines. I just unscrew the sending unit and install
the hose. Long enough to hold away from moving parts, in any direction. I
also use it for checking other things, like air pressure, etc., that is the
reason for the high dollar, high pressure gauge.
    If your not about checking other things, or worried about 100 %
accuracy. Use a cheaper gauge.
    I think Snap-On sells a kit with different adapters and hoses, for like
$100.00, Wow! Make your own and save the bucks.
