Subject: Re: [T2] heat shield &J River's trailer hitch

From Mike Benthin:

Lhiannon71 mentioned in commenting on install of J River's hitch that he 
had to remove the "gravel shield" to fit the hitch-
I have the long tubular muffler also on our busses (no crossover 
 pipes)-and am interested in ome for daughter's 75 bus to hold a bike 
rack or trailer- the shield you mention I thought is an insulated heat 
shield, not a gravel shield?  Wouldn't the lack of this make for a hot 
engine compartment floor?

The gravel shield is bolted to the BOTTOM of the bumper. #13 here:

It is NOT the heat shield above the muffler. #16 here:
