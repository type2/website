Subject: Re: [T2] heat shield &J River's trailer hitch

OK, I stand corrected- the gravel guard or "modesty" panel would have to 
go, but I still don't know about the heat shield- will the receiver 
style tow hitch fit with the heat shield in place over the round muffler 
that extends along the center underneath?
