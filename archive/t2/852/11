ok volks heres the deal.... i got the bus fixed thanks to lots of  advice and help from many list members.... and mark for sending me the parts to make it possible....
   
  the sway bar bushing i could not fix right now so i wrapped it in a wire clamp for now till i can get another clip for the bracket.... 
   
  the bolt for the sway bar i happen to have one in the building that was very close just 1/4 inch longer no problem wont bump uglies with nothing under there...
  and the nut fit the threads the original nut that is for the original bolt...
   
   
  so after all that i got it back together...
   
  i have not driven it or moved it but she is on the ground.... all fours now and woooosh man its time for a cold one and a bud and i dont mean budweiser....
  LOL... work is done and yes i feel like i learned something... man ole man after all that i think i can do it again BUTTTTTTTTTTTT NO TIME SOON I HOPE LMFAO....and well i dont know if the top arms would be as nice to me....
