Subject: idiot lite for oil pressure sender

[[Gosh, I hate it when I give away everything in the subject line]]

OK, if I am going to run my type 4 engine on the garage floor, what and how 
do I hook up an inline idiot lite to the oil pressure sender so I can see if 
I get oil pressure or not...

I know, it was done right before my eyes last year, but man, like, I wasn't 
paying attention.  I have a spare tail lite bulb in a socket, with two 
jumper wires coming out of it.

TIA

Barry
