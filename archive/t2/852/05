Subject: Re: [T2]tire broke inward this morning on me (update)

what photo are you look N at?
  curious...
   
  i got both front wheels off ground... i got two jack stands under the front but this *&^&^%(&^%(^%& dont want to budge.... 
   
  well so far it looks like i need another bolt for the sway bar and the way its going i will need another sway bar bracket to LOL....not funny but dilirious by this point...
   
  i am making up words as i go....and dont have anything to make me want to relax.... looks like i will be pulling out the herbal teas later or more... on this one &^(*&^(*&^(*&^)(*&^)(*&_)(*&_)(*_*^%$*$*&^%)*&(*   gald a friend left me some organic beer.... yummm....
   
   
  yeah mark said it would be a PITA but ^%$^%$*&^(*&^)_(*&_)(*)(*+_)(*+)(_* it LOL.....
   
  ok so back to the drawing board...... 
   
  i also have tried a huge C clamp on it but i cant get it to latch on good enough to take the pressure off the sway bar bracket to get that thing to slide....
   the metal is so soft its chipping and crushing so that s why i might end up with another bracket sooon.... eeeerrrrgggggggggggggggg
  hell if i gotta replace the bracket and bolt i could care less at this point..... longs i get everything else fixed i recon....~!~
   
  &^(*&(^%&^%*^*&^%(&^%(*&^ ohh yeah i already said that....

  Chai,

I notice that you have the left tire on the ground. When one control arm
is higher or lower than the other, you tension on the sway bar. The twist of
the bar is what helps keep the car from swaying in curves.
Jack up the whole front end and place it on stands. This may be enough
to relieve the pressure. If not remove both clamps from the rubber bushings,
and let the sway bar hang.
Hang in there Chai, we'll get'er done! :-)
