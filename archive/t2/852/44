IIRC, you were not producing hitches for the '72 before because of its
one-year-only properties.  Are the '72 hitches priced the same as the
'73-'79 ones ($150 + shipping)?  After all the good pub you've gotten
on the late-bay hitches, I've been waiting and hoping you'd break into
building '72's.  Now to scrape together some cabbage.... I regret that
I will probably have to wait until Fall.  Will you continue to be
making the '72's after the Spring run?
