Hi Don,

I have heard it referred to as "The divorce maker" for that very same  
reason.   But I love my Bus-Depot Side tent... Shock-corded poles and  
lightweight nylon make it very simple to assemble and it doesn't take  
up nearly as much room in the bus as the original steel and canvas  
monstrosity.
