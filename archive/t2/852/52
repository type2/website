 My 1972 Westy has lost it's alternator tightning

 It came loose and just feel off. I cannot find a new
 one. So my question is what size and type of bolt
 should I get for this so that it will stay put? 
 It's
 on a 1972 bus.

The upper one or the lower one?

The upper is a allen bolt with a special square nut
that fits in the slot of the support bracket.
