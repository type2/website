Well, since the GWB will soon be living on in other busses, I'm putting my
Konis up for sale.

Pay via paypal (no eChecks, credit card is fine) before the end of Saturday,
it's $325 for the set of 4 shipped. I'm leaving for Cali on Monday so need
the $$ for my week there. (One of those, "We'll pay for your food and gas
and such, but you have to pay first then submit and expense report" things)
I'll give them to my wife to ship while I'm gone. If they don't sell before
I leave, then when I get back I'm putting them on evilBay. =)

These were picked up from the second group buy through BD. I think they have
like 500 miles on them, because the GWB started giving me grief shortly
after putting them on.
