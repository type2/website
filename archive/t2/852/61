yeah I had one years ago and it was such a pain that I only ever used it
if I was going to be somewhere all week.   finally found the quick and
easy, got a 10X15 blue tarp and just throw it over the bus, 10ft side
going front to back of bus 15ft side going over the top.  two bungee cords
hold the off side down to my wheel wells and pull the other side out to
two trees or the only two poles I bring with me...   If I really want to
drive away I pull the low side up into two trees so I can drive out from
under it...  with the canoe I usually have on the roof it gives plenty of
head room... (doesn't hurt that I'm short either)  can set up camp without
help in under 5 minutes even in the dark.,.... the older I get the lazier
I get....
