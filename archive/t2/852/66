Subject: Re: [T2] 68 parts

The 68 door resembles the 75? and up door with the lock knob on the sill but from 70 and up flow thru
vemtilation appeared. The later door has slots in the front edge to allow air to enter. 68-69 doors did not.

In mid 76, the hinges reversed. Up to 2x6 2126 631 has Allen bolts. From 2x6 2126 632 has 13mm headed bolts.
You cannot swap them because of the thread position.


I have swapped late bus doors around by driving out the hinge pins and swapping the end of the hinge that bolts to the body....however, i could NOT do this when trying to swap '68 doors to a '72 bus-I can't remember exactly why, but it did not work. '68 to '70? Maybe.   Jeff
