Subject: Re: [T2] idiot lite for oil pressure sender

Karl says::::

""Positive from the battery to the bulb.
Negative side of the bulb to the sender.
When the pressure is zero, sender goes to ground, bulb
lights up.
When pressure is above 5-7 psi, sender opens and
breaks ground, bulb goes out.""

Wow ! ! !  This is SIMPLE "/ "/ "/

Now, all I need is a MityVac and I can measure the pressure it takes to get 
the pressure sender to  open.  If it opens at 5-7 psi, then I should have a 
good oil pressure sender ! "/ !

Of course, since I don't have a MityVac, if I just had a vacuum/pressure 
gauge by itself, I might be able to huff and puff some 5-7 psi, or I could 
leech some of the air off my semi-flat tires in the garage for pressured 
air.

Darn, I also don't have a vacuum/pressure gauge, so to get 5-7 psi I could 
hook up an old soccer ball at 10 psi and see if it opened the oil pressure 
sender.  If so, then bleed the soccer ball down until the light would not 
come on.  Or vice versa for those on the southern hemisphere.

I could even use the power and light from a small flashlight instead of the 
awkward and heavy 12 volt [well, sometimes '12'' volts] battery
