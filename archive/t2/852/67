Mark,

Saw the other answers, but have personally had a problem looking at 
transfering the 68 door handles to a 69 door.

I didn't actually fit it, but IIRC the opening for the handle in the door 
is slightly different....maybe I just looked at it and decided that when 
it same time to do it, that I could make it fit.

It was several years ago(before the 78 restore)....I really need to get 
back to my 68 DC soon!

Cheers, dave
