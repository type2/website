Subject: '78 stumbles on deceleration

Hello Volks,
My '78 stumbles upon deceleration or going up a grade. I have to floor it to 
keep it from stalling. When getting off the freeway and waiting for the 
light, it idles o.k., lbut when I start out it'll stall going from 1st to 
2nd if I don't depress the accelerator pedal to the floor. Aftger a while it 
gets hot, then will stall and not restart. Starts bucking like mad after 
downshifting from 4th to 3rd gear. I've never experienced this before. Water 
in the fuel? Oh yeah, someone (who shall remain nameless) drove off without 
reaffixsing the locking gas cap -gone- no more on eBay).
I checked the timing, etc. all okay. Oh, couldn't find the correct condenser 
(scarce as hens' teeth, anymore,) had to retrofit a wells 579 or something 
but it doesnt mate to the side of the distrib like the correct one. Seems 
everything has to be ordered now. Very depressing....las ttime i needed an 
brake oil reservoir. Know where I found it? Yugoslavia, yeah, that's right. 
Yugoslavia, as in Yugo, Yeesh(-at-) I am not happy.
Thanks in advance.

gross gut,
Oliver





1978 Volkswagen TRansporter (ca edition smogwise)
enough miles to go to the moon and back
3rd engine
1,000 frogskins in brakes , shocks, constant belocity pain in the arses, 
etc.
It's a love/hate  relationship thing we got goin' here and, somehow, I feel 
more like I did when I got here than when I do now?
