Subject: Help Needed for 1974 Westfalia

I've been struggling with a problem for quit some time - my van will
seem to run fine but stall upon stopping at a light, stop sign, etc.
Occasionally, such as last Sunday, it quits completely, with no lights,
flashers, anything-totally dead.  No dash warning lights come on (either
before or after it quits).  When everything quits I can't start it
without a jump, but then it starts immediately.  My stepson thinks the
cause is an electrical short.  Last year, before he passed away, my dad
put in a new alternator.  I've checked the archives but haven't found an
exact match for this problem.  Any ideas?
