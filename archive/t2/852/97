That sounds pretty original as emergency triangle and first aid kit are
required in every vehicle in Germany. BTW, my first aid kit (usually comes
in a rectangular plastic box) is mounted on a holder below the dash ('74
Westy). Most likely no flares - never seen them back home.

Mine holds an emergency triangle folded up in a blue-grey plastic box, about
14 x 3 x 1 in. Maybe it originally had flares.
