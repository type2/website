Subject: Electric winch for pulling T2's

	We've picked up an enclosed car hauler that is tall enough for T2's
to fit in.  Since I can imagine that the car being hauled may not be running
in most cases, I am having an electric winch installed in the front of it.
My question is, do I need a 6000# winch to pull a bus onto a car hauler or
can I go with something smaller?  The ramp is 6' long and the slope of the
ramp is not bad at all.  I'm just wondering if I can go with something
smaller since I'm not trying to lift a bus completely off the ground, but
just pull it on the trailer rather.

Thanks for the input.
