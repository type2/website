Subject: Re: [T2] drive-away tent

I had one for a short time. The bag was destroyed but the tent was near
perfect. However it was such a PITA for me to set up (perfect conditions...
test set up in the parking lot at home), that I ended up selling it on eBay.
I got around $400 for it.

They're beautiful and unique looking, but I just couldn't see setting that
thing up after dark when just arriving at a campground.
