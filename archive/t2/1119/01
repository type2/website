No reason to go so far as to busboys, etc unless you are dying to.  Most good
FLAPS (most NAPAs) will have the connector and a pigtail for about $5,
sometimes even just blister packed on the electrical display area.  Now if you
want to avoid soldering and a butcher job, you can surf for my instructions on
making a removal tool (piece of coathanger and a dremel tool and about 4
minutes) and just eject the existing ones from connector and the ones from the
new connector from NAPA and then swap just the housing on.  However if the
pins are getting iffy (likely) you need to clean them up (WD40 on a piece
cardboard like say a cereal box works nicely running it through them while
they are out of the housing.)  Anytime I put a harness in service I go through
EVERY connector that way, and replace with SOLDER and HEAT SHRINK anything
that can not be salvaged.  Anyway those are very standard Bosch/Lucas
connectors used on tons of things, most commonly
 injectors in US cars, but if you bring one in to a NAPA and talk to an older
guy at the counter, he will simply go get it for you.  Or of course a harness
out of anything Bosch from the 80s-90s at a pick and pull will yield at least
several good ones, doesn't matter if L-jet, K, KE, Motronic, Digijet,
Digifant, VW, Audi, Volvo, BMW, Alfa, whatever, even late 80s Cadillacs. 
There are 2 styles, eventually Bosch realized that everyone was breaking them
and the later have the little improved technology of the wire bale being on a
little ramp so you push it to release the bale.  They are interchangeable, the
newer is smarter of course.
