Subject: Re: [T2] Type IV Fan Shroud Removal

Got it out with the engine in place. Key was finding all the screws
which hold the fan shroud halves together and successfully removing
them.

Not surprisingly I'm finding missing bits (driver side lower flapper
valve and cover). Some broken bits (oil dipstick boot). And some
unexpected bits (spark plug socket sitting under the 3/4 tin).

Worst of all however is the situation with the oil sender. I should
probably rewind and tell how this story began  with a massive oil leak
on a road trip. I discovered the problem to be a failed sensor - so I
pulled an old sensor off a spare 1600 engine and install it. Turns out
the sensor I just installed has some thread issues - namely, lack of
thread. So I've got an oil sender in place which won't back out.

Now that the tin is off I figured I'd be able to wedge something under
the sender and somehow apply upward force on the sender while
unscrewing it.  No such luck. I've got a sender that just turns and
turns and turns but won't back out of its hole. any ideas or suggestions?

thanks
