Subject: Shipping items while on the road - tip

Check this out as I did it several times but many years ago:

Got to your closest USPS (United States Post Office) and ask the  
Postmaster if you can recieve your packages there under the General  
Delivery policy. It will be like this

NAME
GENERAL DELIVERY
POST OFFICE NAME
CITY, STATE
ZIP CODE + 4

Anyone in the know let us know if this is still available and the PO  
will assist

Sent from my iPhone... this thing is awesome
