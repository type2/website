I just saw the post from mightymouse on your Samba thread, "Low
compression/sh*tty flame propagation is likely all his issues."

Poor flame propagation would be the issue with my bad spark plugs. If
your new plugs don't solve your issue, you may be forced to change
your CR. Hopefully you can get what you need with experimenting with
AFR first. Also, I had suggested even leaner than 16.5:1, but if too
lean, flame propagation will be bad too. GAMI is your guide in this
pioneering territory.
