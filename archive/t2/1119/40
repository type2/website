I am mildly tempted to pull the engine and raise the CR.  It's a job, 
but it would definitely be interesting.  From a lot of scouring the 
various forums, I have gathered that Jake uses his 9550 cam, 8:1 CR, 
early exhaust, and the super stock heads (which I already have) in his 
Camper Special and that's about it.  I don't want to split the case just 
yet, but changing the CR isn't the worst thing in the world.  It would 
suck if that raised my temps even more.  Maybe I'll talk to my mechanic 
about building up a test engine over there... that, or see if I can find 
an earlier exhaust to test out.

hmmmmmmm
