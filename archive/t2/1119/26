Subject: Broke spark plug

Hi All,

Anyone ever had a spark plug break off at the base of the threads?
Last night after checking my #2 for lean/rich, I put the plug back in and had
that sinking feeling as it mushed at tightening. Thought I had stripped the
threads int he head.
Well, this morning I went to check it out and my NGK B6ES broke off. Got out
the whole end with my easy out.

Any recommendations for a replacement plug?

Anyone else had this problem?

Thanks,
Chris
