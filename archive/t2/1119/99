Subject: Oil Pressure Sender

Hi,

Finally got the stripped oil sender out of my type iv engine. It seems
that mainly the threads on the sensor stripped, not the block. I was
able, using an amount of teflon tape to thread in a new sensor into
the block and it seems secure.

When I have the chance next time the engine is out, I think I'll drill
and re-tap the sensor hole and put in one of those brass couplers so
that I can still use the standard size sender. Any thoughts on that or
any better solutions?

Also, I couldn't seem to find two keys pieces of data in my Bentley,
the correct tightening torque for the sender and the specs on the
thread size/pitch. Anyone know?

Thanks
