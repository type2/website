Subject: "Goodbye Pic"

I built each one of my daughters a "bus' as a Grad present, and my youngest
took hers and some friends out to the West Coast from here on that "nasty"
road, and the only advice I gave to her was, pull over in the pull over lanes,
and let traffic go by...she did that and having just aquired her license, said
'they' had a fantastic time!  Oldest daughters, I took from here in Canada
West Coast, to USA East Coast and back...just to make sure it was ok to drive
====8^)  !  I am almost ready to put "mine' out there, but it likes to be a
Garage Queen..so will wait a bit longer..to get her done!  Wife and I spent
some beautiful weekends off in the "toolies" camping on Pristine West Coast
Beaches, that only the bus could get to!
Cheers
SQUID
