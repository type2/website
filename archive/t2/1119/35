I did install another sensor and got the same results. Then I
installed spade connectors for quick disconnect. I was afraid the
connectors would skew the reading, but they were the same, so I
installed sensors with spade connectors on all 4 cylinders so I can
move the sensor wire from plug to plug from time to time.
