Subject: Shift lever frustration

I cannot for the life of me adjust my shift lever so that it doesn't  
pop out of the socket (that is the front of the shift linkage).

The problem is 3rd and 4th gear.  If I shift into 3rd, the pin pops  
out of the back of the shift rod.  If I shift into 4th, the pin slips  
out of the prongs that make up the front of the socket.

I fear that the problem may be in the bushing, which I replaced a year  
or so ago.  I don't want to go through that ordeal again.

What are other likely places of wear that could cause this to happen?   
How does one adjust the shift plate, etc. to factory specifications?   
There are no specific instructions in the Type 3 Bentley like there  
are in the Type 2 Bentley.
