I don't know if it's your problem, but I'd definitely dump the 009! I
"converted" my svda to a 009 by blocking the vacuum, drove for about 2
min and swapped it back again. Maybe with extra initial timing it might
work but I found it to be terrible "off the line".

Can you give us more information about when the symptoms occur?
Cruising, moving off, uphill, accelerating? When I had a progressive,
the biggest problem I had was creeping along slowly.
