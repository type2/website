Won't work for UPS/FedEx deliveries.

Instead, grab a local yellow pages and look for "Mail Boxes Etc." type
places. Places that do packing/shipping and offer personal mailboxes
for people who don't want to pay the steep prices the USPS charges for
a box now (or areas where the USPS is small and limited on number of
boxes).

I share an office with one of those types of businesses called
"PostMart" in Silsbee, TX. He charges $1 per package to receive
UPS/FedEx/USPS packages for anyone who is not a box-holder. Receiving
packages for paying box holders is a free addition.
