hehehe.. sorry, couldn't resist.

I would guess you just found a bad plug.  I'd pull all of your current 
plugs and change them out with new ones.  That way, just in case you 
happened upon a bad lot of plugs, you won't experience the same issue 
with the others.  But that said, I'd venture to guess that staying with 
the same plug won't be an issue.
