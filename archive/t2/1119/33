Hi Mike,

Thanks for posting those graphs. The obvious thing I can say in
comparing your results to the recent experience with my Weber
progressive that I told you about is that 14:1 is in what John
Connolly calls "the death zone" and will never give you acceptable
temperatures. Remember my Weber was too hot at 13.1 to 1 and I had to
bring it down to the 12.0 to 13.0 range before my temps became
acceptable. Plus, if I remember John's thread correctly, I think he
said stock VW is too rich around 11-12:1 to give you an idea of how
they ran to get acceptable temps. By the way, I read that Hot Rod
tuners are still using 12:1 as the best power ratio.

So to extrapolate that knowledge, 16.5:1 must also be too rich because
GAMI reports that leaner is cooler. So maybe you have to drop that
down to 17:1 or more. A check of the GAMI charts again might show the
ideal AFR they are referencing.

Good luck!

John
