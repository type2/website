I remember when my Westy was crushed by a falling tree. As upset as I was,
my daughter (then 9) was heartbroken. It occurred to me then that she had
spent summers in our Westy literally since she was old enough to remember.
To her it was like losing a lifelong friend.  

Eventually we got another Westy, and as we built new memories a new chapter
began and the loss was forgotten.  Someday when things turn around and you
decide to replace the Guac, you too will pick up where you left off.
