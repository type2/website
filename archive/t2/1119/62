The link didn't work (it's dynamic), maybe you want to provide their 
part number.

Here I was, getting all excited, only to find that there's additional 
work involved. You can get 1/2" AMP ring terminals from Digikey (p/n 
A28279-ND, 10/$4.45) or Mouser (10/$2.50, p/n 571-328970), which also 
need to be enlarged.
