It's hard when the different gurus give conflicting advice. Maybe Jake
would give you some advice on your problem as a customer support issue
for the heads you bought from him.

 would definitely be interesting.  From a lot of scouring the various forums,
 I have gathered that Jake uses his 9550 cam, 8:1 CR, early exhaust, and the
 super stock heads (which I already have) in his Camper Special and that's
 about it.  I don't want to split the case just yet, but changing the CR
 isn't the worst thing in the world.  It would suck if that raised my temps
 even more.  Maybe I'll talk to my mechanic about building up a test engine
 over there... that, or see if I can find an earlier exhaust to test out.

 hmmmmmmm
