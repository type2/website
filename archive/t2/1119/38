Subject: Stripped oil plug :(

Well, I was doing a tuneup today and was just about to go for a drive 
with my new plugs and well... the oil plug stripped.  It looks like 
there is enough meat on there to drill it out and tap to the next size 
so....

My plug is 13.7mm.  What would be the next size to go to?

Thanks!
Mike
