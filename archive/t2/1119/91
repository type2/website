I'll say!!! The alternator cover looks like a big ring if you have a
Type 4 engine. It serves as a seal between the tin and the alternator.
I can imagine beat up. I don't know that I've ever seen one on any of
the buses I have had.

That's a $64 question! Some of the better junkyards bench test their
used engines before offering them for sale, but I'd prefer a VW
specialty shop so they have the right bell housing and starter setup.
So either a good shop or an engine builder.

Have fun!
