To insure that you have high voltage at the plug, buy a spark tester. 
Mine is a little plastic gadget shaped like a wish bone. You connect 
the end of the ignition wire to one terminal and grounds the other 
terminal. You then crank the engine and watch the spark jump between 
terminals as you open the wish bone. There are markings on the 
plastic to evaluate the strength of the spark. It's an easy test. If 
you have spark here, then the plug is the only other component that 
needs testing.

As an alternative to the tester, take a spare spark plug, connect the 
ignition wire to it in the usual way. Ground the threaded part. Crank 
the engine and watch for a healthy spark.

Of course there can't be any gas fumes present when these tests are performed.
Let us know.
