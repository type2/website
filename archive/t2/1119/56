Subject: RE: [T2] flywheel bolts

Hi Kris and all. 

I found the bolts last night. It was in a container that used to have hand
cleaner in it.. (I thought it was full of hand cleaner) Do you know why you
find something in the last place you look for it in...?? Because once you
find it, you stop looking..

Thanks again for the responses..

Bob


Does anyone have a spare set for sale or know where I can buy a set? I've
been working on this engine off and on for a year. I was hoping to get it
started this year.
