It's kinda funny.  I talk to friends that have buses and they're all 
excited and I go "that guy is a total bus fanatic".  Oddly, I don't 
think about myself as a bus fanatic even though I've grown up my 
*entire* life with a VW bus.  My parents had an orange one when I was 
born, they got a green when when I was 3 or so, I inherited that when I 
was 16, got rid of it and bought an orange one when I was 20 or so, and 
then got rid of that one and bought my green 78 when I was 26 and have 
had that one until today.

I'm 32 and I have never owned any other car other than a 76 or 78 bus 
(and a couple scooters).  Crazy, huh!
