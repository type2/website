Hey Don (and others) -

Hang in there, I'm working on having Airhead Parts/VWG repro the S-Boot for
the 75-79 FI Bus, but it's gonna take awhile.  They already make it for the
air cooled 2.0 Vanagon, but its so different, it just doesn't work on the
Bay Window.  Figure sometime next year at the earliest, depending on how
much $$$ they have to pay for the tooling (it ain't cheap) and to keep them
from forcing us to make thousands at a time.  But they will be coming. Stay
tuned.
