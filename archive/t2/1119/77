Well, at least that rules that out!

There's so many variants of the 1700 engine too. My is a rare CA code
that is listed as mostly "no information" at
http://tunacan.net/t4/reference/case.htm -- except for the horsepower.
I know VW played with high compression, low compression, and various
cams, but who knows what mine was or is now!

What about something cheap on the fly -- a couple of J-tubes into a
muffler -- something quick and dirty your local muffler shop can throw
together, and that you won't feel bad about welding a bunch of sensor
bungs onto?
