I converted my old 74 bus to a fuel injected 2.0 pancake years ago. I could
not find a suitable s boot replacement so I made one out of sections of
radiator hose, pvc elbose and hose clamps. It worked great!  The engine pulled
17 inches of vacuum at idle with no problem.

Steve came to pick it up today, and it was idling really rough. I dove
into the engine compartment and found I could shove my whole hand into
the split in the S-Boot. What's amazing is that the thing ran at all!
2 splits in the accordion section, each opening 50% of the boot.
