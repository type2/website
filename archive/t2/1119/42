I wrote this reply earlier, but never sent it out - so I figured I'd

Hmm... I haven't seen that post yet - I'll go take a look.

I just did a compression test since I put in my new Raby heads as I 
hadn't tested them right after I put them in.  It looks like my hard 
work measuring the deck height and calculating everything paid off.  My 
CR on 2 and 4 is 139 and 1 and 3 is 132.  1 and 3 were running the 
hottest, but their valves were also slightly tight, so I adjusted them 
and we'll see how the temps are affected with the new plugs.  I'll also 
try bumping the AFRs a little richer on the rich end to see how that 
changes things.

Thanks,
Mike
