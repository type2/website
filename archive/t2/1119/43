Subject: Re: [T2] Stripped oil plug :(

I was thinking of using a drain like this one..
http://www.qwikvalve.com/home.php
but I am thinking that it may get damaged going down the road...
anyone with experience with other than stock style drain plugs.

second question..... there used to be a emergency drain plug kit.. it was a
soft rubber like product with a zsus fastener built in
it came with a 'screwdriver' that you poked into the plug ,, pushed and
turned 1/4 turn... that held it long and skinny until you put it in the
hole,, then turned and removed the screwdriver.. that caused the plug to
swell.  I found they worked very good ....
are they still around?
