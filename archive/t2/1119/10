this true when disconnecting the retard side of the vacuum diaphram?  I think
that the overall ballance of the engine firing is causing the rough idle at
anything before 5 ATDC.

The 5 ATDC spec is with retard line connected. You should just discard
the retard line and pretend it doesn't exist. 7 BTDC is the correct VW
spec for timing without a retard line. They say the advance line
should be connected, but I always time with it disconnected. Be sure
idle is low enough that mechanical advance is not being engaged.
Should be about 800-950, but a well tuned engine can idle 700-750.
