Subject: flywheel bolts

Hi all,

 

I have almost everything on the engine done. As I started to put on the
flywheel, I went looking for the bolts. I know I put them all together so I
would loose them, and of course I can't find them any where!!

Does anyone have a spare set for sale or know where I can buy a set? I've
been working on this engine off and on for a year. I was hoping to get it
started this year.

 

 

Thanks in advance.

 

Bob
