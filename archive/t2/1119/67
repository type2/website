So the symptoms occur almost always. At idle it sounds like its missing or hesitating, but does hold an idle. When driving it boggs down at take off... I have to kinda rev it up to get it going. Same symptoms in acceleration, boggs, low power, a little backfire action every once in a while. Rarely everything seems to click and it will accelerate as it should... but its rare.  
Hope this helps. Thanks for all the suggestions! Really thank you.

I don't know if it's your problem, but I'd definitely dump the 009! I
"converted" my svda to a 009 by blocking the vacuum, drove for about 2
min and swapped it back again. Maybe with extra initial timing it might
work but I found it to be terrible "off the line".

Can you give us more information about when the symptoms occur?
Cruising, moving off, uphill, accelerating? When I had a progressive,
the biggest problem I had was creeping along slowly.
