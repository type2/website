Well Martin good call. Started pulling plug wires one at a time from the dizzy
and guess what...#2 made no difference when I pulled it completely off.
So going by what say I need to get some new boots for the manifold tubes. Will
do that tomorrow.
This is a dumb question but what else might be causing #2 to not fire. I'm a
little scared to know but with the boots not being that old(6 months), I fear
it could be something worse.
Thanks for the imput everyone. I have ordered a svda and cb rotary pump. New
plugs and wires soon... suggestion? Anyway thanks again.

When you went into more detail about the problem I thought it sounded like the
old running on 3 cylinders trick! To work out where the leak is you need to
spray something flammable like WD40 around the joints on #2 when the engine is
idling to see when it makes the revs pick up. It could turn out to be where
the manifold meets the head, or, as you suspect, one of the manifold boots.

Might be something else, but let's start with the simple stuff!
