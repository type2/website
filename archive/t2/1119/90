Hi all,

I'm almost done installing the exhaust system on the engine. I have an odd
piece of plastic that looks like a cover. I'm guessing that it may go in
front of the alternator. Is there something like that? This piece is rather
beat up and there is only one place for a screw or bolt to go through. I
know I'm not being very descriptive. Also is there any place I can take the
engine to get it started before I install it into the bus?

Bob
