Subject: replacement "sensor" for CHT senders

If there are any of you that would like to replace the ring terminal on 
your CHT sensor, you can get them from Waytek Wire.  It's a minimum 
order of 50, but it's only $6, so that's not that bad.  Here's the part:

You will also have to drill out the center hole - I'd recommend using a 
dremel tool or a stepped drill bit with the torque setting set very low 
so it doesn't catch and twist the ring.

This connector will work as the sensor for both VDO and Dakota Digital 
CHT sensors.  It really isn't a sensor at all - it's really the 
thermocouple wire that does all the magic.  When you crimp the wire in 
the connector, make sure that enough of both ends of the thermocouple 
wire is stripped so that the stripped ends fit nicely in the plug and 
then crimp away.  If you mangle the connector, either cut open the crimp 
(so as not to lose more thermocouple wire), or just cut the thermocouple 
wire, restrip the ends, and crimp on a new connector.  And yes, you want 
the bare ends of the thermocouple wire touching inside of the connector.

I would also highly recommend wrapping the thermocouple wire with 
electrical tape or something to protect it from rubbing on spark plug 
tin hole.

Enjoy!
