I would swap back one of the NGK plugs back to one of your previous 
plugs and see what temps you get.  I got the exact same temps after I 
switched to NGK B5ES plugs.  This is driving me bonkers!

Btw, what year engine do you have and what exhaust do you have - is it 
the individual header and heat exchanger, or the combined header and 
heat exhanger?
