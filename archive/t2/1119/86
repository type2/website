Right. That test only tells you # 2 is not doing it's share of the
work. You can't assume it is the boot.

You have to do a vacuum leak test of the boots and intake gaskets to
confirm that.

Other causes can be a bad spark plug wire or a bad spark plug. It can
also be some crud in the distributor cap allowing the spark to take a
path of lesser resistance than the spark plug.

Boots not that old don't mean that the clamps haven't worked loose. Be
thorough in your diagnostics.
