You know, Ron and others have hit the nail on the head. My daughter grew up 
in Westies travelling the PNW and West Coast. When it came time to move our 
74 Getaway Hi-top it didn't really mean too much to me, but in talking to my 
daughter now in her 20's she remembers SO MUCH of being 3-5 yrs old and 
camping in it. It was replaced with 3 more after that, and now we have a 77, 
but they will ALWAYS be a part of our kids memories. I think sometimes we 
forget this as someone said, because we become adults and grow out of those 
things. (unfortunately). Now if I can just sneak this 70 Euro-standard bug 
out the door without her figuring that one out. ;-)
