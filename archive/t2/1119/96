Subject: Kudos for Bus Depot

As some of you know I have been traveling and living in my 1970 Westy since
January, logging about 8,000 miles, starting from Maryland via Florida and
since March in the Southwest.

Recently had a few maintenance issues that I wanted to address, but finding a
good VW shop has proven difficult, and the few that passed muster were booked
solid going out weeks and/or didn't have the parts.  The bad shops were lazy,
uncaring and scary.

I have always maintained my bus, but getting parts while traveling isn't easy.
But after the frustration of trying and failing to find good repairs venues,
I decided to try anyway.

On Sunday, I located a willing Grand Junction Colorado shipping address.

On Monday I called Bus Depot and spoke with Rick.  I gave him an extensive
list of parts  including rear brake shoes, springs, and cylinders, some small
grommets, new ball joints, axles nuts, cotter pins, and more.

On Tuesday the order was shipped out.  The ball joints were drop shipped
separately.

On Wednesday EVERYTHING arrived 1800 miles away before 10:30 in the morning,
in two shipments.

Of course I paid for expedited shipping, but the personal service, the speed
in which everything was executed, and the fact that EVERYTHING I ordered was
in stock and arrived -- nothing missing -- makes my day.

So I am a happy camper, and Ron Salmon and his crew deserve my public thanks
and appreciation.

By the way I am now posting an almost daily emailing of a photo or two and
sometimes a brief commentary of my travels.  Anyone on this list who would
like to be included please let me know.  I haven't posted to this list since
April because photos are so much a part of what I am seeing and sending.

Anyway, cheers and happy busing.  And thanks again, BD.

John
