Subject: Re: [T2] Tuning up my bus, thoughts and input

Thanks for the tips. I tried timing it at 5 BTDC and it would barely idle at
all.With the DVDA distributors, I read that it should be timed at 5 ATDC. Is
this true when disconnecting the retard side of the vacuum diaphram?  I think
that the overall ballance of the engine firing is causing the rough idle at
anything before 5 ATDC. I will try to get the carbs tuned better then retime
it. There does seem to be some cam overlap by the way it idles. I will contact
the mechanic who built it and see if he remembers the grind of the cam used.
In the mean time, I will change the fuel filter and tweak on the carbs some
more. I am taking a trip to Maryland this weekend with the bus,(I live in NC)
 so I have to make sure the carbs are not running lean and I want to make sure
that I have the right advance at WOT to keep from damaging the engine on this
trip. The engine seemed to run warm with the old 009 dizzy and because the
alternator likes to wear the fan belt
 loose after so many miles. Thanks for all the tips so far!
