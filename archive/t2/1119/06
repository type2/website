Changing a dirty fuel filter is always good. You may be on track with
the accelerator pump diaphragm, but you should do a physical
observation of the squirt in the carb before taking it apart. There is
also a measurement spec on the volume expected which can be adjusted
at the triggering arm.

I'd adjust the idle at 7 BTDC with the vacuum retard disconnected. See
if that helps your stumbling at all.

You need to look at a complete carb adjustment to make sure all is
working right. Be sure the dual carbs are in sync as well. That could
be causing your imbalance problem.
