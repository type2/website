Subject: quad CHTs installed and datalogged

So I finally got my quad CHTs installed last night.  I did a run on the 
freeway running at 16.5:1 AFR, and then another run at 14:1 AFR, and the 
14 run yielded hotter temps.  I need to stick the GPS unit in there so 
everyone can see the vehicle speed as that would be helpful.

Anyways, for those that are curious, I posted the two different graphs 
on thesamba.  Take a look:

1 and 3 are the hottest cylinders, and 2 runs the coolest.

I should hopefully have my EGTs installed within the month.  It will be 
interesting to see how CHTs match up to EGTs.

Thanks,
Mike
