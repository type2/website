I think John got it right with the distributor problem. That was my first
inclination anyway.I don't know exactly what is going on inside there, but
it can stick. There is a little thing inside the shaft that is supposed to
be oiled every now and then(not sure of the interval). If this is not done,
it can cause problems like you describe. Then again with the electronic
ignition thing, I'm not sure if that is an issue.

 

Let us know what you find out.
