Subject: Type IV Fan Shroud Removal

Hi,

I'm trying to get the fan shroud off my engine to replace some oil
seals that are leaking (I'm suspecting oil cooler seals, among other
things). I'm stuck.

Any good write-ups out there you all could point me to? I couldn't
find any articles in the library but perhaps I was searching for the
wrong keywords.

Thanks
