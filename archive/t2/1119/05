Subject: Aftermarket S-Boots

It was around 2 years ago (maybe a bit more?) when I put a new
aftermarket S-Boot on the Guac.

Steve came to pick it up today, and it was idling really rough. I dove
into the engine compartment and found I could shove my whole hand into
the split in the S-Boot. What's amazing is that the thing ran at all!
2 splits in the accordion section, each opening 50% of the boot.

Luckily I had the really old German one still in a box. It was hard
and a PITA to put on, but it worked great.

There's gotta be a better solution out there. Even my plasti-dip trick
wouldn't have helped this thing!
