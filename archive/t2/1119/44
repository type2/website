I was looking for something like that, but I couldn't find it.

In the end, I just went to my local FLAPS and picked up a single 
oversized 14x1.5mm drain plug and threaded that in there.  I used grease 
on the end and screwed the thing and in and out about 20 times, going in 
a little further each time, and cleaning off all of the cuttings every 
time I pulled it out (and regreasing).  Eventually I got it all the way 
in and seated nicely so I pulled it out and cut off the end that had the 
cutting bits (so I wouldn't easily cross-thread it down the road).  I 
then ran another quart of oil through to clean up any cuttings on the 
inside, screwed it back in, and it looks just as good as new :)

Thanks!
Mike
