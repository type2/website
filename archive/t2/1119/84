Well Martin good call. Started pulling plug wires one at a time from the dizzy and guess what...#2 made no difference when I pulled it completely off.
So going by what say I need to get some new boots for the manifold tubes. Will do that tomorrow. 
This is a dumb question but what else might be causing #2 to not fire. I'm a little scared to know but with the boots not being that old(6 months), I fear it could be something worse.
Thanks for the imput everyone. I have ordered a svda and cb rotary pump. New plugs and wires soon... suggestion? Anyway thanks again.

 > So the symptoms occur almost always. At idle it sounds like its
missing or hesitating, but does hold an idle. When driving it boggs down
at take off... I have to kinda rev it up to get it going. Same symptoms
in acceleration, boggs, low power, a little backfire action every once
in a while. Rarely everything seems to click and it will accelerate as
it should... but its rare.

I wonder if you are firing on all cylinders? When the engine is idling,
try removing the spark plug leads one at a time and see what difference
it makes to the idle revs. If there is a suspect cylinder, removing its
lead will make little or no difference to the revs. I seemed to be
always chasing down vacuum leaks with my progressive and this was a very
good method to identify the manifold pipe with the leak.
