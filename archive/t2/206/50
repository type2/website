Cool. Ironically, I ran in Ace Hardware for some bolts for another
application (it's closer than the bolt specialty place I was at before)
and they had a M10 1.00 tap. I'll give it a try or I may tap it out to
M10 1.25 or 1.50 so I can use a longer bolt. My problem is that the set
screws are short (about 1" long) and slotted. It's almost impossible to
get a feel for the threading with a common screwdriver inserted 4" into
the block. A 120mm M10 x 1.25 would work nicely. The 1.00 pitch bolts
are harder to find in those lengths.

Fortunately, I know it's not a big issue but I do want my bus running
quiet again. I got the exhaust all straightened out just to find this
issue had returned...
