Subject: A note from my friend in Italy

A recent note from my friend who lives in the North of Italy.
He works in Germany, and travels back and forth over the Italian Alps quite 
frequently.
Every time he sees a bus, I hear about it.

Roberto was recently over here, and I took him on a road trip of 10 days in 
NewBus.
He loved it.
He had never been camping before.
Never seen raccoons before (only in NA are there raccoons).
Loved waking up in the bus and having morning coffee and breakfast by the 
campsite.
I took him to diners, small town cafes for our "formal" meals, introduced 
him to White Castle, Coney Islands, Cincinnati chili, Kentucky hams, 
Tennessee pork BBQ, etc.
I even showed him statues where all the arms and legs were still attached. 
None of that old broken Italian sort of statue stuff.

What really amazed him was the bus.
He could not believe how NewBus ran, started right up every morning, and he 
always smiled with a real big grin when people would see he was a "bus 
person". - if only for a brief secret moment in time !

His message:

>Other subject: I read on an Italian magazine that VW is now designing a new
>edition of the VW Bus, inspired to the '60s model. There was a picture and 
>it really
>resembles yours exactly as the new bug looks inspired by the old one.
>There was a big VW meeting near my home town. There were some 100 cars from
>Italy, Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, Germany and the US. Well, I have seen 
>two cars with
>the A.F.I. (American Forces in Italy) license plate so they were from the 
>US but probably
>came from the USAF base abt. 70 km from my QTH. There was only one type 2 
>with an Austrian
>license plate. You would have loved to be there wit Newbus or das Auto!
