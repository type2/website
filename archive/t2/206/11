These bolts are actually just bolts...they're screwed into the place in
the head where the "smog pump" would have injected air into the
exhaust....if the smog equipment were still there.

Can you find a (12pt) socket that will fit the square end of your tap,
then just use the socket and extension and rachet to get the job done?

If you dont plan on reinstalling the smog equipment, you could probably
get away with retapping with whatever you find handy.

Perhaps tap them with an apropriate NPT tap and install a pipe plug into
the holes?
