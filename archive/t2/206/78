I guess I question whether that's all worth it for a distributor. Seems most 
people have no trouble calling an engine stock if it has a 009, so why not 
me too? She can have the thing (buy it, that is)

>or while you're waiting on parts to fix her distributor.

I've already spent more time on it than I wanted to.

But it's almost ready, and it sits there in the garage like a million bucks. 
It matches her car, blue top tin with white pulleys, everything painted 
twice, heat exchangers three times. Looks like a factory job. Everything 
overhauled (putting the carb together now). I'm a little stressed about the 
longblock, which came from the shop stamped "8080," meaning done to the hilt 
on the alignbore and thrust cut. End of the road. I trust this shop 
(Painter's Grinding, Denver), but it sure is one seasoned case. Let's all 
have a quiet moment in thanks that this engine is going into a Bug, where it 
will hopefully live a relatively peaceful life, and not into one of our 
buses, where it surely would not.

Amen,
Mick
