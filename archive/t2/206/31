Subject: Sound level meter and garage sales

Bought a brand new Sears sound level meter this past weekend at a garage 
sale for $5.

When I get my bus back on the road I'll be measuring the sound level as I 
progress through my version of sound proofing the bus and I'll report. 
(Progress is VERY slow so don't hold your breathe).

Anyone passing through is welcome to come borrow it.

A few weeks ago I bought a Raytek infrared temp gun for $15 and this sound 
level meter for $5. The same guy had several new smaller table saws 
(refurbished new?) for $75 but I already have a big table saw and didn't 
have $75 to blow.

Keep your eyes peeled - good stuff to be had if you look.
