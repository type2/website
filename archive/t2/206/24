She stated she could restart the engine.

The problem is that from what she was describing it could be the engine 
was just cutting out which could lead to bad indications on the dash.
  I would first start the engine and verify i had oil pressure.
then the basics after looking for  loose connections in the engine bay.
if you have a meter verify alternator output.

1.  fuel filter
2.  ignition coil, points, condenser, plugs
if plugs are severely fouled, comp check the cylinders.  If just 
severely worn because nobody has replaced them since the engine was put 
in, replace them and still continue wit the rest of this list
3.  fuel pump(if you can verify pressure)  If not start engine and 
verify that you get a steady running and no pulsating noises, or 
extremely noisy.
4.  air cleaner
these are all items that can be bad and still get a started engine but 
no run under load.
