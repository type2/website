Jim,

Serious bummer....I sympathize.

You won't know what happened until you take the engine out and apart.

Do *not* attempt to turn it until you take it apart.  I ruined a case once 
trying to do that.

Slight glimmer of hope...pull the fan belt off and see if it will turn.

I had the same thing(except for the oil pressure part) happen to me
once and it was the generator that had siezed.  Flipped the fan belt
off and then I could turn it.

What have you got on the engine(parts wise)..stock oil pump and cooler?

Still penty of oil?

Cheers, dave
