Subject: a vent?

Hi all,

     There is a little black cap on the drivers side right behind the door.
It has a small hole in it.  When I unscrew it, it looks like a pipe of some
type.  What is this?  Is this a vent of some type for the city water hookup?
It is not listed in my Riviera booklet.  Thanks.
