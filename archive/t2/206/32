jimt;
   I just heard from her (and so there's no confusion, the Kathy in my
e-mail sig is NOT the Kathy having problems). She's headed home and will
not have net access until 4:00 p.m. CST tomorrow, but is looking up a
list of questions I sent her.(Engine #, carbs etc.) She has no apparent
mechanical knowlege of VW's as far as I can tell and the local (Port
Aransas) mechanics are of no help whatsoever, which is strange since
there's a VW dune buggy rental outfit there. I'm trying to help out,
AIRS style, from about 160 miles away, so that bit is tricky. If anybody
on the list is anywhere near Port Aransas, Texas and could help out, let
me know and I'll pass the information along.

   My thoughts are along jimt's list of possibilities as well, but we'll
just have to see what she comes up with.
