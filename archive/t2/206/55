Subject: Re: Front discs problem


Thanks for your answers

The reason I started to work on the brakes in the beginning was that the 
brakes was binding and didn´t relase.

The problem is not the calibers becose when I connected the front brakes on 
the rear circuit the brakes worked fine.
And I have already rebuild the calibers.

The brake pedal stops when I open the rear bleeder bolt.

The brake padal doesn´t return all the way up to the floor so maybe that is 
the foult. I have adjusted the pushrod clearance but even in the maximum 
setting the brake pedal doesn´t return all the way.
If I push the brakepadal back by hand it comes a lot of noises from the 
master cylinder. It bubbles a lot.

So I think that the piston doesn´t return all the way the question is why??

Thanks a lot

//Johan
