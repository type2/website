Thanks for your reply. I will have to look at the wiring when I get
home. I was going 60 mph on
a flat road, although I had come over the big bridge about 7 miles
before the oil light started
blinking and the speedometer just started dropping off to 40 mph. Made
it to Aransas Pass and
had it towed home. The motor was replaced in '88. I have the work orders
for everything that
has been done to it. 

Since I haven't had it long, and don't know anything about it, it's hard
to know if the engine
sounds any different. Seems like a clicking that might not have been
there before, but not sure. 

Thanks again for everything!. I fell in love with it, and was getting
ready to jazz it up. Hope we
can save it. Kathy 

(Art here...
I've asked Kathy to get the engine number and whether it is carb or FI
and other details this evening when she gets home. Meanwhile, any ideas,
scientific wild-ass guesses?)
