Hi Mark,

With all the 009 bashing that goes on I thought I would be terribly
dissatisfied with mine which came on the bus I bought about a year ago. I'm
not. It purrs softly and beautifully at low idle, about 800 rpm, never
stalls and is good at MOST acceleration tasks. The only time I miss vacuum
advance is occasionally on acceleration from a dead stop -- I get an
occasional hesitation which I've learned when it occurs to partially
overcome by a soft, judicious push on the accelerator.

Other than that, I suspect I would get better mileage with vacuum, which
when I find a good clean dizzy I will one day install. But will the owner be
happy? Unless she is planning to drag race her bug I see no problem provided
you tune the carb/dizzy well.
