Brennan,

The correct answer may be (b) this mechanic just does not know anything
about buses... IF all the bits that are there are in good shape.  What
you describe:
2 heater boxes (left and right)
1 muffler
1 tailpipe
is the complete kit on '73 T4 buses.  Now the possible pitfalls:
 o check flange-pipe joints for rust;
 o check the ends that go to the head.  they should be tight to the heater
   box, flat and square (no sign of exhaust gas leaking);
 o the muffler is *probably* trash (internal rust), but they are available
   new;
 o you will need gaskets:
    4 copper ring gaskets, heater box to head
    2 trapezoidal metal gaskets, heater box to muffler
    1 ring gasket, muffler to tailpipe.
