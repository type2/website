Subject: 1800 condensor

Greetings!

I'm starting on my penance for a few too many years of
neglect.   Last fall I replaced plugs, wires, dist.
cap and rotor with Bosch, and the new battery turned
the engine over fine but no firing.

Friends chanted "your points or coil".   A few minutes
into the Bus books and I'm faced with gap and timing
needs.  Needless to say this neophyte crawled back
into my cave to hibernate. 

Yesterday I replaced the contact set -points
mechanism.  The grommit on the wire coming through the
square hole in the side of the distributor had one
side wing pulled off, and didn't sit tight.  
When asking my friend about it he recommended I 
change the condensor. (Also this helpful article:
http://type2.com/bartnik/points.htm )
Tried to take pictures but my cheap digital camera
doesn't focus that close.

I didn't have any trouble getting to the parts (hats
off to folks without an above motor hatch!) as
mentioned in the article...yet I haven't gotten to the
condensor parts.

Questions:

1. Do you expect I'll have trouble finding a condensor
at my local auto parts store?

2. Will it come with the wires and/or grommit?

I have a 1973 1800 FI->weber (po) conversion.  Manual
Transmission.  I'm fairly certain its the original
engine, although it was overhauled ("everything except
the cam") 6 years and 400 miles ago. :-(

3. Is my bus on the edge of obscure? Can someone point
me in the right direction for the exact title of my
engine..I was a bit confused at :
http://www.oldvolkshome.com/ignition.htm .

Wish me luck in the world of timing.

Best Regards from Central WI,

Dean
