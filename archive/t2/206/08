Subject: Seattle Vintage Meet, this weekend

Subject line says it all.

"Our" 21st Annual Show, open to all air cooled VWs
There will trophies, swap meet, and we have a completely
refurbished 74 Beetle as a raffle prize. And of course,
my favorite: The Burger Meat, Friday night cruise in\drive in
 
Anybody west of the Mississippi, if you leave now, you should be able
