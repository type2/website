Here's the catch... the German ROZ measurement is different than the system 
used in the US. The number comes out higher. I don't recall exactly why, 
maybe somebody else can give you a better explanation... but I found out 
after about a year of putting expensive gas in my bus that "oktan 91 ROZ" is 
equivilent to 85 octane over here.
