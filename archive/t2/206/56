I have successfully used some spray lubricants on them.
It might take several applications for the stuff to "walk" it's way down 
the cable as the cable turns while in use.

Try alternating squirts of white lithium grease from a spray can and 
plastic tube, and Valvoline Synpower penetrating lubricant from the same 
type of squirt configuration.

WD-40 could be used as a "starter" fluid for the above lubricants, as it 
will sort of start the carrier action of these better lubricants. WD-40, by 
itself, will not do too much, nor will it last too long within the cable 
assembly.
