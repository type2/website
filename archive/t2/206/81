Subject: Need advice on heat exchangers and muffler

I've pushed mine but as far as there gona go!
Bus Depot seems to have all the stuff but I'm trying to
"keep it on the cheap"!
what about used?? are they ok or not worth the fuss??

I currently have the "stock" '78 setup w/ a pace setter muffler (no cat/egr)
I want to switch over to the one piece heat exchanger ala '72-74&'79
(as opposed to the "extra pluming" and u-pipe), with a '72-'74 muffler.

I've read Heat/Rust/Noise and was wondering, how important is
the "exhaust wrap" I'm mostly a highway driver,
(50 miles each way to work, so about 100 miles a day) would I
see a benefit?? is it worth the $50 bucks a roll??
If so how many rolls do I need???

thanks,
Mike LaBarge
