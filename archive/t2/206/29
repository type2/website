Subject: RE: [T2] Front disc problems

Can't say I'm a brake expert but I'm a good troubleshooter. So let me
shoot from the hip and see if we can fix it.=20

First rule in trouble shooting is _simplify the problem_. I would start
by taking the rear circuit out of the picture by opening a bleeder on
the rear wheel cylinder and placing a tube over it in to a can or jar.
Now get in the car and press the brake petal. If it bottoms out or is
very spongy bleed the front brakes again (you probably should close the
rear bleeder valve to prevent losing too much fluid). If it does reach a
hard point before the floor (because the rear bleeder is open that point
will be much closer to the floor but should still be hard) then you know
you're developing brake pressure in the front circuit. Can you still
turn the front wheels? Yes, it would appear that the calipers are jammed
or frozen. On the other hand if you can't ever get the brake petal to
develop pressure I would fault the master cylinder.

Also make sure the brake petal is returning all the way. If it doesn't
it won't uncover the holes that let new fluid into the master cylinder.

I would do all this without the engine running as the brake booster will
add a layer of isolation and it will be harder to feel the real brake
petal pressure. But also remember that since you don't have vacuum boost
you'll have to press harder on the petal to generate the same brake
pressure.=20

If the front calibers are jammed they can be un-jammed but probably
should be rebuilt. If the pads are fairly new remove them from one side
and replace them with worn out pads or metal plates about the same
thickness as the backing. Again you might want to open a rear bleeder
valve so the pressure you feel is limited to the front circuit. While
someone watches the caliper pistons press on the brake and the pistons
should clamp down on the metal plates. You might have to press really
hard on the brakes. Once the pistons clamp down pry them back out and
install the good pads back in. Repeat for the other side. The ironic
part of about this is if this did fix the braking then you really do
need to rebuild the calipers.

If the pads are old and thin just replace them and in that process
you'll have to press the caliper pistons back which should free them
temporarily.=20

You didn't mention why you started down this road in the first place.
Was it because you started getting rear wheel lockup when you braked
hard?

I don't know if any of this helps but it's what I would do. If you have
anymore questions feel free to ask away.
