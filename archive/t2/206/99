Subject: Re: [T2] Gap between steering wheel and column. Why?

Easy answer:
The wiper/turn signal housing and assembly has slid down the column.

Not an easy fix:
You have to loosen the locking bolt, raise the assembly back up, retighten the
bolt. Sounds easy but.....the bolt is an anti-theft device. It was originally
a shear bolt. When you tightened it the head sheared off. Now you have a
problem. There is no head to put a tool on. If you look at the bottom left of
the housing, you will see a hole. In that hole is a broken off bolt. You will
need a narrow sharp chisel, just to fit in the hole, and a replacement allen
head bolt. 8 x 1.25 x about 25mm long. Get a big hammer and hit the chisel to
make a slot in the end of the bolt. You need a big enough slot to get a
screwdriver to unscrew the bolt out. It does work.....  Now replace it with
the allen bolt. Slide the assembly up to within a 2-3 mm gap and tighten the
bolt.
