A while back I received a lot of help from the list wrt my tie-rods and drag
link.

Back then, I rented a lot of tools in town and none of them were any good.
I did eventually rent one that worked on the tie rods but it kept slipping
off and required "micro-tightening" to get the tie-rod to pop out before the
tool slipped off.  It was a total failure on the drag links because the drop
arm isn't as wide.

The other day I found a tool that looks pretty close to the one pictured in
the Bentley for removing tie-rods without damaging the threads.

It's ACC-C10-7081 at California Imports and PEL-TOL-P211 at Pelican Parts.
I originally found the tool in a BugPack catalog item #7080.  I believe they
are all the same tool: about $45.  It's stamped Chrome Alloy, Hungary and
apparently made by a company called Weiss tools.  Note to Bus Depot: stock
this tool!

From the pictures you can see it has some good features:

- big screw with socket compatible end for leverage
- ball-end so you don't ruin the threaded part of your tie-rod
- c-shaped cup so it doesn't slip off while tightening
- cut-away backside so it doesn't damage the grease boots
