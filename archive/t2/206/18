Subject: 914 exhaust system questions What system would be best??? 

I don't know if any VW headers have adequate ports size or will match up
with the 914 2.0 flanges or interfere with your tin, but I will say that
you want to try as hard as you can to match the header port size with
the head exhaust ports to avoid that restriction, which could burn
valves. Do a google search for Porche 914 club and see if you can find a
forum. Maybe someone there can give you specs to help. Sorry I can't be
of more help.
