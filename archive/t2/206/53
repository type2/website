My Sportsmobile has inner supports.

As far as I can tell, there is only 1 set of cords
dropping.
My cords have been dried up and broken since I bought
it. (Along with very absent screen windows.)

Other questions:

1. Is there a special sealant or preservative I should
be putting on this white canvas?

2. One of the tie downs have come off and created a
leak.  Do you have suggestions for sealing?  Currently
I'm planning clear house roof epoxy. 

Thanks,

-Dean
