Subject: Gap between steering wheel and column. Why?

'1978 Transporter

The other day while pulling my steering wheel off and cleaning the contacts 
on my turn signal switch, I noticed that when I put the steering wheel back 
on, the wheel did not slide all the way down the shaft. It slides over the 
splines and appears to rest comfortably on the enlarged portion of the 
shaft. I realized that this was the way I got my bus and that this was the 
reason why my horn didn't work, and why the turn signal cancellor (sp?) 
wasn't working either. The horn button contact was not making hitting the 
contact on the top of the signal/wiper switch and the cancellor is not 
hitting the switch either...
There's about a half-inch gap where the wheel doesn't appear to go all the 
way to the column, but I know for a fact that it is as far down on the shaft 
as it will go!
So I fixed the horn temporarily by flexing the horn contact, but my 
cancellor wont work until I figure this one out...any ideas?

Thanks!
