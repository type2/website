I'm finally getting around to replacing the belt that runs from the A/C =
compressor to a pulley behind the fan shroud on my 78 automatic =
microbus.  I took the worn belt off last summer while I was taking the =
engine out to repair a dropped valve seat.  I think I've got the old =
belt here in my box of broken bus parts, but I never labelled it so... =20

How big is it supposed to be?  Anyone know?
