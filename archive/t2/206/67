Subject: '79 bus engine tin needed - hot running

After about 2 years in the driveway I have finally resurrected my '79 Westy.
A rebuilt transmission, and engine (balanced), plus soundproofing. The bus
hums nicely courtesy of a bunch of acoustic foam, blankets, and damping
material from left over failed aircraft acoustic testing.

My bus is running much hotter than before. It gets up to about 250F whereas
it used to run about 210F with the old engine. I think my cooling flaps are
stuck due to excess friction and a weak spring, but the flaps appear to be
stuck in the open position. The wire from the thermostat attaches to a tab
on the flaps rod. That tab points up (not forward), can someone confirm that
that is the position for OPEN?

I removed the dead A/C from the bus during the rebuild, so now I have a big
hole where the A/C used to be. This is probably the main cause of my hot
engine since the hole is right above the cat converter ('79 CA) bus. Does
anyone have this missing piece of engine tin (left rear, upper) that they
can sell to me? 

Thanks,
