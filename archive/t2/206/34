Kendrew,

If no one else answers, let me know.

I cut mine off about a month ago, but saved it for future reference.

Depends on what type a/c you have and what kind of compressor.

Better to find your original for a match up.

Cheers, dave

I took the worn belt off last summer while I was taking the engine out to repair a dropped valve seat.  I think I've got the old belt here in my box of broken bus parts, but I never labelled it so...
