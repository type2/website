The following is not intended as Monday Morning Quarterbacking, but as
a heads-up to others out there.........

If you must install an oil pressure gauge, please install the pressure sender
IN ADDITION TO, NOT IN PLACE OF the stock, idiot-light sender.  That way,
if you don't believe what the gauge says, or it malfunctions, you still 
have the
idiot-light to save your ass, poor engine, marriage, etc.

Note to Jim:
Don't be discouraged by this somewhat expensive lesson.  ONWARDS!  UPWARDS!
Persevere in lifting yourself above the mortgage-your-life-to-have-a-car 
mindset
shovelled out by the marketing lackeys, of the new car manufacturers!  You are
the mechanic in charge!  If your SO doesn't like that, then just buy her a 
nice bicycle
to ride.
