All I know is what Kathy wrote. 72 Westy. Knowing the Port A area,
unless she was going over one of the few high bridges in the area you
could assume "flat and level", it is the Texas coastal plains. I haven't
heard back yet re: engine type, carb or FI, but likely dual carb 1700.
(But anything is possible with a 30 year old Bus.)
