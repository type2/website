Subject: Re: [T2] Re:  Replacement 205/70/14s

Oops.  While you are mistaken about the 10cm
wider, I meant to say 1 cm wider (or less than
0.5 inch).  205 means 20.5 cm's vs. 195 meaning
19.5cm.  Right?  

195 tire is 7.9 wide and 205 is 8.2 according to
Bridgestone.com looking at BT70s (tire chosen
randomly).  Actually widths vary from
manufacturer to manufacturer and depending on
wheels and tire pressure as I recall.  

Your not giving up much width going from 205's
down to a load rated 195.  

I think I accidentally cross-posted this to type2
list.  Sorry folks.
