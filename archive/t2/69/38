but of course the removal/reinstall/setup/tunning

here are my ideas/options.  input would be appreciated 

*  take my chances and drive it as it is

*  take just the one side of the case off and have the boss (re)welded
back on, then reassembly  (not removing any bearings etc)

*  Send it out to major rebuilder (Boston Bob etc)

*  Try to convince the guy who did this rebuild to do it over (he has
retired, my engine was one of his last)

*  Try to find a GOOD case and do a rebuild rebuild.

*  in all cases try to find a "running" spare engine to keep my bus on the
road while I work on the main engine.

some questions

*  can you reweld the boss back on?? (I have all the pieces)
*  some of the above are not DM but I am looking at cost/benefit also
*  take into consideration that I have a single car garage that has no
heat and electric is basically an extension cord from the house.  Living
in the mid atlantic is cold wet during winter.  Bus does not "fit" into
the garage, the bus remains on the parking pad in front of the door.  
*  to do the rebuild work I would have to buy a few tools,  engine stand,
new dial micrometer for sure, think I have everything else I would need.
*  TIME, time is money and in short supply right now.  I have a major
project at work that is going to keep me pretty busy now til mid summer.

I'm sure I'll think of some more "issues"

* * *
personally I'm leaning towards driving it as it is until I can get a spare
engine and the time/money to do it right, knowing full well this is a
risk.  I would not touch the bolt etc again, do oil changes etc via the
drain plug, and change the filter more often.  I do run synthetic lubes,
and would probably put a buzzer of some sort on the oil presure switch.  I
do have oil presure/temp gauges.  during this time I will start gathering
the parts I need to do it over (case etc)


coments???  (besides damning GEX to the lower reaches of the crusher)
