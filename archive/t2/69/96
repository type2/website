Subject: 021 109 612A valves, anyone got a clue

Well as I'm busy tinkering with dreams of a blown 2 liter I got around
to taking apart my NOS set of 1700 heads for a long overdo looksee
at what I got.  And in case someone new is on the list that might have
a clue I'm wondering if the above mentioned valves are in point of fact
sodium filled or not.  They were represented as such and the PO clearly
believed them to be, had a scan of a 80's vintage VW parts list saying
they were.  He raced a 1600cc T4 powered Lola framed Formula V and
no I didn't stutter, a 1600cc T4, he had the pistons and cylinders as well
talk about odd and rare.  Now the thing being is they don't look like most
of the sodium filled jobs I've seen, certainly not like the TRW set I have
sitting beside them with the little hole in the center of the face.  These
appear like your average valve excepting they appear to be made in two
parts with the head and stem joined in some manner.  My listings for T4 
exhausts are as follows:

33mm
022 109 612D standard
021 109 611 sodium

34mm
022 109 612A standard
021 109 611A sodium

These bear on the valve the marks
EL (VW) 021 109 612A

A combination of all the above numbers and yet none of them.  Does not
show as a valid VW number any longer at the dealer not suprisingly.  I'd
really like to use these in the turbo project if I knew they are sodium, else
I'm probably going to use the TRW set I have.  If anyone has a clue, please
email me.  Else I had thought to x-ray them previously and that might be
my only real way to figure out.  FWIW I will trade these or my TRW sodiums
for a set of 34mm sodiums of any reasonable manufacture if anyone would
be interested.

Thanks
