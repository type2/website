Subject: Turn Signal indication

This 73 transporter is my first vw experience so excuse the silly question.
When either the left or right turn signal is activated the dashboard
indicators for BOTH left and right illuminate.  Outside the bus just the
corresponding lights blink. The Bently seems top show only 1 dashboard light
circuit?  
Is this the way it is supposed to be?
