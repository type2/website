How did they rig up the rear engine hanger on the
bus.  I was looking at a 71 today and am not sure
how the 71 mustache bar would fit without major
fabrication to the 74 body? =





Are you sure its a 71 tranny?  I can't see a reason why a 1600 wouldn't f=
it up
against a 74 bus tranny. Just have to run the right flywheel - if that.
Probably bolt right up.  I'll bet your tranny is stock.

I'll also bet that your 1600 isn't even hung in the rear, is it?

A local VW shop owner once told me story once of how he just popped a bui=
lt
1600 in the back of a late 70s bus and drove it back and forth to Florida=
 with
no problems. I took it with a grain of salt, but i think it is possible h=
e
actually did it.

Ray (Nemo) and i were speculating - as he checked out the way the rear ba=
r in
a my 71 mounts - that since a later 70s bus has a good rear tranny hanger=
, why
can't the engine just hang right off the transmission?
I mean - a beetle has no rear engine mount. Does a split bus run a rear
hanger?

Ah - the 'jake-leg' possibilites are endless.
Lemme get my vise-grips and some coat-hanger wire and we'll get at it...
