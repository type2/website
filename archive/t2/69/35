They have it:  http://www.aircraftspruce.com/main.html

And a great free catalog. (They'll make their money off of me when i buy 
another set of engine instruments).

I have a decent cab ceiling  panel that is ugly to look. I think I'll cover 
mine with a 1/4" of foam, and then with a layer of upholstery same as my 
seat covers (whatever material that will be). This is the same technique as 
making door panels.

I thought of this too but... you can't use a biscuit joiner (that i know 
of) . I have a DeWalt (nice machine) and you really need 1/2" of wood 
thickness to use biscuits. I just checked with a local specialty wood 
supplier and they report they can get 5x5 foot panels and 4x10 foot panels 
BUT the thinnest is 1/2".

I had considered making two panels, and then (covering the central joint) 
running front to back on the visible side, a nice 4" wide piece of wood 
with a design carved in it - like router cut grooves or something. Maybe a 
place added to hide that CB radio that doesn't get used much...

I think you could also simply laminate the seam on the non-visible side 
with another thin peice of the panelling and use gorilla glue and some 
filler and some careful sanding to create a seam that was almost invisible. 
I would try to add 8 tiny diameter screws in there too.
