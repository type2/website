I don't think carburated busses had the TDC sensor that Haynes mentions.

I opened the Muir book once just after I bought my bus and haven't looked 
at it since.  It's practically worthless for engine repair IMO.  The 
flywheel may have some kind of TDC mark that you can see through the sensor 
hole, but I've never used it.  There may or may not be a mark on the fan to 
indicate it, and if there it can be hard to find.  If not there I always 
look at the valves to determine TDC.  Turn the engine over by hand 
(clockwise, in the direction it runs) until you see the intake valve on #1 
close completely.  About 90 crank degrees after that point will be TDC 
(point at which both valves on #1 are closed and the cylinder is ready to 
fire).  You will feel a "dead" spot there where the crank is easy to move, 
as the pistons are either all the way in or all the way out and the rings 
don't offer much resistance because they're not moving much.

There are three small bosses at the back (FIF) of the fan housing, 
surrounding the fan itself.  You use the two at the 9:00 and 12:00 
positions to mount the scale.  The hole is a metric thread, same as the tin 
bolts (what's that, M6?) but you should use a longer bolt than 
3/4".  1-1/4" works pretty well if I recall.
