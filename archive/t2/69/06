A bug automatic stick shift is an automated manual transmission and can be
flat-towed in neutral as the gears and bearings are splash lubricated.

The bus automatic is a true automatic and is lubed with a pressure pump
driven by the engine.  Some automatics do have drive-shaft driven pumps
and can be towed (and even used to push-start the car), but not very many!

Mercedes and Saturn are makes I have heard of that can be flat-towed with
an automatic.
