Subject: RE: [T2] Transmisson

I recently had this problem in my '65 in that all of a sudden I couldn't get
the bus into 1 and 2, but R, 3, and 4 work fine.  I haven't changed my
linkage yet, but did find a way to get around it.  I push the shifter all
the way to the right while it's in neutral ( the middle of the H partern )
and then left and into 2, and then finally straight up into 1st.  May help
you get around until you have time to fix the linkage.

Get yourself a Bentley manual and a Haynes manual. The information is in
there. I had a similar problem with my '71, went through and replaced all
the bushings and the shift coupler. Not hard to do (and I was able to
replace the shift coupler without touching the transmission, contrary to the
books). Better, but I still had a problem. Tried loosening the two bolts
that hold the shift lever to the floor and shifted the shift lever base from
side to side, problem solved. You'll have to experiment for the best
position.

Okay, my 1970 type II bus has a problem shifting to one gear to the next. As
of know I can shift it from 3rd to 4th. I can not get it in 1st 2nd or
reverse. I was told to change the Bushing on the shift rod.
I bought the complete guide for idiots, and I am unable to find this info.
in the book. I need to know if I change the busing and the coupling will
this correct my problem? The transmission seems fine it runs good in 3rd and
fourth. Also where are these bushings supposed to be, I can only find the
rubber boot looking things near the coupling. Where do these little white
plastic things go and are they easy to install?
