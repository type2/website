Subject: RE: [T2] Fuel Pump for a 78

I have a friend in the auto parts business and I asked him to check on 
this.  He found another manufacturer (besides Bosch - he didn't have the 
Bosch info handy) of the pump used in the Fords and there are two different 
part numbers for the pumps used in 75-79 transporters and 85-88 Ford trucks:

75-79 TypeII is Roller Vane, 30GPH open, 110psi shutoff.
85-88 Ford truck is Roller Vane, 40GPH open, 95psi shutoff.

Not sure what this means to us, but it seems likely that the Bosch pumps 
might be slightly different as well, although they may work just fine 
anyway.  I will try to find out more.
