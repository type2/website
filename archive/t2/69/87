The only engine I ever saw Splitfires work well in was a 200-horse Johnson
V6 outboard on my night shift supervisor's bass boat. He was using Champion
standard spark plugs because "the manual" said to use Champions, and the
manual didn't say "Champion Platinum spark plugs." Anyone want to wager that
Johnson's CDI system needs platinum plugs to work right?
