I belive the smaog pump was on 74 only. Spezial double groove crank pulley
as well. If Califonicadia requires the pump down there, there would be a
market if it is still functional (not likely). The stock Solex carbs are
worth a lot if the shafts aren't worn and the idle cut off threads aren't
bunged up. I saw on the web a place in England that sells the carbs new.
Haven't a clue where they get them, or what the site was. 

Throttle shafts can be rebushed for around $150 each with a complete
rebuild. Risk is you don't know how they will perform until you mount and
try to adjust them. Sometimes no matter how you clean them there is still a
little piece of grit somewhere that won't let go, and you will suffer
forever and never get clean running. A bit of risk here, more espezially if
they have been sitting for years on a hulk.
