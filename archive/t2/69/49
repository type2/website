Rather than using an old washing machine part that's made of plastic and
has rubber seals that probably won't live in fuel, get yourself to the
local boneyard and grab the electric fuel tank selector valve off any
mid '70's Chevy or GMC pick-um-up.  Made for the purpose, probably cost
all of five bucks.  Cap off the two pipes that you won't be using with
neoprene slip on caps available from your local NAPA.  Plumb it so that
you're using the side of the selector that requires power to open. Bolt
it on and run a wire.
