I like the solenoid idea. Just cycle it with the ignition or a separate 
switch. Might require occasional use to keep it free.

How about a vacuum solenoid so there was no electricity involved? Vacuum 
holds it open, no vacuum, no open. Would require an electric something to 
open it at engine start for the fuel injected engines.

The other way would be to use the vacuum to close the valve in case of 
emergency. Hmmm. Bet this version would fail when it was needed the most.
