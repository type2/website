Subject: more xmas parts swappage

thanks to Clark G. i will be the recipient of the free tie rod ends.

in order to fulfil my part of the bargain i must now offer up free
parts to the list. so...i have 2 used chrome headlight rings for free
if anyone wants them.  they aren't perfect, but are still in very good
shape. a little chrome polish & elbow grease should get them looking near
new condition.

first pmail gets 'em - as long as you promise to keep the holiday spirit
rolling by offering up your own free parts to the list.

thanks to whoever started this. it's a great idea.
