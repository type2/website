>>No one seems to make a 205/70/14 with a load
rating of 97 or more anymore...  Only other
choice seems to be to buy four new narrower
tires. 

195's are only 1/2 cm narrower!  I run D rated
195 Cooper's (actually Mastercraft RD's).  You'll
thank yourself for having proper load rated tires
instead of some swishy passenger tire with
insufficient load rating.  I'm a cheapskate and I
resisted this.  But the difference between the
superior handling of a vanagon or bus with load
rated tires (even cheap ones) versus
non-reinforced passenger tires (even expensive
ones) is dramatic.
