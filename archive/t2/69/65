In case anyone is still interested I found a source for a shutoff valve.  GE 
makes them for aircraft jet engines.  Valve opens at 8 volts.  Disadvantages: 
 The size of the inlet and outlet are 3/4 inch.  The unit is about the size 
of a softball and doesn't look very easy to mount.  And lastly the price 
tag..... Only 243 bucks.  No typo there-- 243.00  Cheaper than buying the 
whole plane.
