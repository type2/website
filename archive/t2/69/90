Subject: Desperate - Bus for body work

I must move, but know not where to, at the end of the month.  I'm
scrambling to make some reasonable storage arrangements, but I just
don't know whatthehell I'm going to do with Sally and Walter...

So, I thought I'd give this a try:

I have a '78 Riviera in good condition, needs a bit of tlc right now,
that I will GIVE you (Walter) if you'll do some body work on the other
bus, Sally.  Sally needs a new nose from the wipers up (or if it can be
straighted, I don't care...), a windshield, possibly new wiper motors,
and a few other minor dings straightened, primered, and sealed.  I'll
deal with her paint later, I just need to make her whole.

Here are pics of Walter:

Walter suddenly began running a bit rough and sluggish in the spring,
and I just parked him.  He's got propane, dual battery setup and all
that, but I have no idea if all the camping gear works, 'cuz I've never
checked it out.  I just bought this bus Thanksgiving 2000, drove it
minimally, but it was strong and cool when I did.  Definitely needs the
usuals - new engine foam seal (not totally toast, but won't last much
longer), push rod tube seals, full tuneup, etc.  There is some rust in
the battery tray, that's it. 

And Sally's nose:

These busses are in northern california.  Walter would best be
trailered, as he's out of reg, but Sally can be driven, no prob, as long
as it's not raining.  ;-)  Sally is not currently my daily driver, so
the project could be completed at a leisurely pace.  

Please feel free to CALL if you're interested:
