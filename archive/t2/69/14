John,

Thanks, this is one of the reasons that I have not wanted to pull my fuel
tank in my 78 to clean it properly.  I was really worried that some
obscure part that I would have to replace would be NLA and I would spend
weeks trying to find a replacement.

Good job!

Please let us know if the part you get will work.

Cheers ,dave
