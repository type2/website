Subject: Trade for Bus heater



OK Guys,
Let me start off by apologizing for this marginal content. "I'm sorry for this marginal content". There.  Now,I probably should have waited til Friday but, anyway here goes.  It's starting to get cold in Ohio and I really need a gas heater for my 71 Westy.  I now have 3 vehicles I'm paying insurance on , My 71 Westy, an 83.5 water cooled Vanagon which I only keep for the GOOD HEATER, and an old Chevy work truck which I never use anymore.  So, in the interest of streamlining, If I can get a gas heater for my 71 then it can be my ALWAYS driver and I can get rid of everything else.  Blah, Blah, blah, so to get to the point I want to trade the 1986 Chevy Custom Deluxe pick up truck for a COMPLETE WORKING, GOOD CONDITION gas heater for my bus. The truck has a 350 engine with 160K miles on it and it runs GREAT! Not the prettiest to look at, but not too bad either.  It has a beefed up suspension for heavy hauling and towing.  It would be the perfect truck to trailer your show winner !
or to carry a BUNCH of parts around. Its a good solid truck, If I were selling it, I wouldn't take a penny less than $1000 so it would be great deal for a heater.  I will also consider ANY OTHER VW trades you may want to offer, don't be shy.  I am about 20 miles north of Cincinnati, Ohio.  Let's make a deal!!



Peace, John Baker
