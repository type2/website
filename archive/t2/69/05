I can see this as being prudent if you are towing a mystery transmission
or an automatic, but if you are towing a VW as a "dinghy" behind a
motorhome it would be most inconvenient to have to reinstall the axles
every time you want to use the VW.  Considering that motorhomes generally
don't put on that many miles I don't think that the transmission is in any
more danger than if it was being driven the same mileage.

The ideal would be disconnecting axles or hubs, which are sold for other
towable vehicles, but I doubt for buses, at least not at a reasonable
price.

If the hitch could take the tongue load, a "T" trailer as is used for dune
buggies would be ideal.  These are minimal trailers consisting of a long
tongue, a platform for the rear wheels and little else.  The front of the
vehicle  rests on the tongue (with an appropriate support fixture) while
the rear wheels rest on the platform.  The rear suspension of the bus
provides the springing.

This idea would probably work for a bug, but a bus would be stretching it
a bit!
