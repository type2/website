The story I read said DuPont was asked by the snake oil manufacturers to
sell them Teflon for use in the snake oil. DuPont said no, Teflon doesn't
belong in motor oil, we don't want your product damaging Teflon's good name,
no Teflon for you.

The snake oil manufacturers took DuPont to court. DuPont lost--once you sell
a product, you can't tell people what to do with it.
