If your interested in a carb overhaul,, 
Denmiester has been rebushing and then setting up the carbs. I believe he test
fits them to a running engine to dial them in,,

I am pretty sure he can work you out a good deal on Carb re-bushing and/or
rebuilding... He is in Ontario  CANADA..  and you can contact him at
jolliffe(-at-)mgl.ca
