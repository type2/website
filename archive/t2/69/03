Subject: Help- first 1800 tuneup- TDC and timing

List wouldn't take this the first time, for some
unknown reason.  

> I'm under my 74 1800 manual federal bus trying
> to
> get it tuned up the first time.  It was very,
> very sluggish off the line, then pulled hard at
> RPM.  PO said mechanic told him it was the 009.
> 
> I hoped he was right.  
> 
> Plan was new dizzy, points, time, valves, maybe
> plugs.  
> 
> The adventure began with installing an
> appropriate vac dizzy that I got this weekend. 
> (Thanks Clark!)
> 
> Spring is in the drive hole.  Dizzy seats ok. 
> 10mm nut on.  Points set to .018.  Check vac
> advance and retard again.  Seem to work.  All
> seems well.  
> 
> Carefully review the plug wires with the Haynes
> diagram.  It seems right.  Condensor is to the
> right and slightly to the front.  (Muir: front
> is
> front.)  
> 
> I have a dwell/tach and strobe.  I'm going to
> time the thing statically first.  Then double
> check dwell followed by the timing w/ timing
> gun.
>  (Then valve's-- figured I needed to find TDC
> for
> this anyway.  Then compression.  Maybe plugs if
> necessary.  No carb adjustment until I get the
> tools.)
> 
> The problem is TDC.  There is no timing scale
> on
> the engine.  No factory marks that I can find
> on
> the fan.  There are two paint marks, obviously
> applied by PO or PO's mechanic.  Paint marks do
> not seem to correspond w/ TDC.  Or the proper
> place for Cyl #1 on the distributor.  (Dizzy
> has
> that little notch.  I know it cannot be trusted
> until timed but there is no way to turn the
> dizzy
> that far clockwise because the vac pot hits the
> block.  Vac pot would be all the way to the
> rear.)
> 
> Checked TDC with wire.  Very vague but I found
> it
> to be about 30 degrees to the right of the
> painted mark.  (Other painted mark is 180 of
> the
> first.)  I double checked TDC with my thumb. 
> There is a range on the fan where there is no
> suction and no compression.  It corresponds
> with
> arc where I felt TDC with the wire.  I marked
> the
> beginning and end of this.  I assume true TDC
> is
> exactly in the middle of this arc?  
> 
> I double checked the valves to ensure this is
> TDC.  Both had slacked.  (Will set later.) 
> Turned the alternator clockwise, heard exhaust.
> 
> Exhaust valve had no slack.  Continued around
> until the TDC area was back on top, both valves
> had no slack.  360 more degrees and I'm back at
> what I believe is TDC and both #1 valves are
> slack.  
> 
> Do I have TDC?  The rotor button stills seems
> to
> far clockwise (looking from above) past the #1
> wire (and moving toward #4).  Perhaps I have
> the
> plugs wires wrong?  Pot is all the way to the
> clockwise as far as case will allow.  Should it
> be more in the middle of its range of motion?  
> 
> Thanks for all the help.  If a guru is
> available
> for a phone call, please send a number.
