Physics interpretation of splitfire "technology":

To build up large spark voltages, you want flat smooth electrodes.  If
you want to discharge the spark prematurely before it can build up install
a plug with sharp edges can corners like a splitfire.

Current will take the path of least resistance.  Therefore it will always
create one spark per discharge.  The "multispark" photographs you see of
splitfire (and other) plugs are exposures of several discharges.

For Kettering ignitions, use the stock low-cost plugs made by a quality
manufacturer like Bosch or NGK.  Avoid exotics like platinum and snake
oil like splitfire
