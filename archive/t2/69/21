And of course you ain't talking no automatic in tow either------

No dry pump syndrome-----

You can most certainly spin the wheels off a standard gear box in tow
with no damage inccured-----an automatic is a horse of a different color
!!!

Jim (and others), 
Why is this? I towed my '79 Westy from Alexandria, VA to Springfield, MA
on a tow dolly behind a U-Haul truck. I had the front wheels of the Bus
up on the dolly and rear wheels on the ground. I put the transmission
(manual) in neutral (of course!) and off we went. 
In response to all the questions about "why pull the axles?" let me
explain. 
First, I know lots of people have towed Buses, Porsches and so on with
the wheels on the ground and the halfshafts hooked up and not damaged
the vehicle. I've done it too. 
OTOH, there's always the chance (no matter how slim) that the Bus has
iffy CVs, or something's not quite right in the transmission, and towing
it will screw it up. Can I guarantee you're going to damage the
transmission by leaving the CVs on? Or the CVs? No, but I can guarantee
that if they're off you won't damage them. 
Also, taking them off gives you a good excuse to inspect the CVs and
boots and replace things as necessary.
