Subject: Putting in a new clutch : what's the pilot bearing for?

When I put the clutch on my rebuilt engine, there was a little part
left over. Looking over some of the VW catalogs today, I found that it
was a pilot bearing.

If the engine already comes with a flywheel installed, is the bearing
still necessary? I looked in the old engine tonight and didn't see
one, at least not anything with the flywheel in place.

Thanks.
