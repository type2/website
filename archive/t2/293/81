Bryan,,

You most certainly didn't play you insurance company--or who ever's
right---

You have the right in event of such a loss to demand an exact same,
type, condition replacement vehicle in leu of accepting a ridiculous buy
out --which I see that you didn't---or at least you didn't mention that
you did---Oops !!

Forget the book--if you didn't have the vehicle in question insured
correctly--as a collectors and or antique vehicle--which it was, you
goofed.

Later

Terry

You guys can rant and rave all you want about prices and bluebook. Wait
until you wreck both of your type 2s in less than a month. Then your
stuck without a vehicle and without a work vehicle. REMEMBER the book
value is a replacement value. When I wrecked my 70 deluxe with ugly
paint the low value was $3000-3500. was that value wrong??? Of course, I
had almost $4500 in the damn thing. I was offered $1500 for it , I got
$2200 . I live on the east coast , in Charlotte NC, I looked for 2
months and couldn't find a similar bus that was as solid as mine. What I
wanted was a similar bus and the $ to cover my time getting another ,
fixing what was wrong and getting it on the road. I needed to recouped
for my inconvenience.
So some of you have never paid more than $1500 - $2000 for a bus, so
what. What bearing does that have on the vale of a type 2 ?? I paid $600
for my 75 westy I have now. It a no rust , original interior camper with
a new acrylic top , OG tent and ugly primer paint. It would take $5000
to pry the title out of my hands. Is it worth it?? I don't care, it
would cost me $5000 to buy a crappy one and have all the lowers welded
in to resemble factory and locate an original interior and have a good
motor., Still not worth it you say? Good, its not for sale, Find me
another one. Everyone sees busses for sale cheap , well that's fine. If
I see a bus for sale in Texas for $1000 ,I have to rent a truck and
dolly and go get it. I have a 64 kombi waiting for me in Austin. Lets
see. 2 day there. 1 day to load the bus on the dolly and make sure all
is right , 2 days back. My 5 days are worth $700, a truck will cost at
least $600. I have to fork out $1300. so then I have $2300 in a $1000
bus, then I have to fix it and make it reliable. Or I have $1300 in the
64 that needs everything . The Samba rocks . Without it or something
like it many of us would be SOL. Of course their are going to be over
priced cars on there. That happens any where.
Bottom line is that if you find a $800 bus for $8000 , don't buy it.
