Hi again,
Am not sure how it work in the US (especially when importing between states), but here in Canada when the vehicle is more than 25 years old, you are in the obligation to have an "official" evaluation of this one made by an approve SAQ Bureau (registration bureau of my province), this evaluation cost about150$ and is at 100% good for your insurance also. + You need a mechanical inspection by the same SAAQ if the vehicle is from another province or states. 
In other words, it mean that even if you bought the van 2 month ago and the evaluation sticker in the windows is still valid (1 year) and you want to sell the van to your neighbor, he as "Again" to go through those same procedure again.
I paid my van 5800$ CAD, it was evaluated at 8450$ CAD + I am allowed to add any "improvement" bill/invoice to that amount to this evaluation for 1 year for free. The insurance company will officially (they are in the obligation to do so) cover all of this amount including all invoice (in my case; 9900$CAD)  for one year (when the evaluation was done).
To be fully cover for your old bus you need to renew this evaluation each year.
Well, in my case, to keep the value of my bus high, a 100-150$ it is well worthed.
