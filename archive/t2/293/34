Cap'n,
You are correct! I cannot believe the prices I have seen listed on The Samba
Lately.  I have NEVER paid more than $1500 cash for a bus.  My old 66 I bought
for $1100.  Put another $1500 into it. Looked decent, ran great (after some
work by myself), still had some issues. I traded it even for my current 71
Westy.  One month after I make the trade, the guy who took my old 66 sells it
for $6,000!!! And he actually collected the money from the buyer!!
So I have now decided that my 71 is the bus I will keep forever because I
don't think I could replace it for less than $6 or $7 grand. Do I really think
it "worth" that much? No, not really, but to replace it with a bus in
comparable conditon, this is what they are asking.  I have also been searching
on traderonline.com for old VW's and have found some that were pretty
reasonably priced.  I think the key is that 75% of the people who want to buy
a bus want to just pay the money, jump in it, and drive away with no further
effort. And buyers are taking advantage of this (and why wouldn't they??!). 
So I have had success finding buses that are ALMOST road worthy, towing it
home, and doing my own thing with them.  Here is a listing of the buses I have
owned in 3 years and their prices and condition:
75 Riviera, $1500, Ran OK, Summer driver for 3 years.
66 Camper, $1,100, barely ran when aquired with NO interior, put in another
$1,500, it became a great runner average looker.
71 Westy, $0, traded the 66 even, EXCELLENT bus, I can drive it anywhere,
looks great drives great.
73 Westy, $700, Not Running when purchased, I found that the generator was
disconnected, so I hooked it up and it ran fine.
64 Westy, $0, Free bus, PO blew up the engine and had to get it off the street
where he lived, acquired as an extra in a different deal and I put in a used
engine and traded it for a decent 73 Beetle.
So I guess the moral of the story is that the deals are there, somewhere, but
you just have to be VERY creative and PATIENT when finding them sometimes! 
If you think things are bad now, just wait til VW comes out with the new
"Microbus", then watch the prices start to sail!
Ray, by the way, there is a guy in Cincinnati with what appears to be a
running decent looking 66 camper for $1900 or best offer. I'd be willing to
take a look at it for you and even pick it up and store it at my place until
you could come get it if intersted, let me know!
Good Luck in your search, PEACE!
