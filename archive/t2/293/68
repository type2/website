Folks,

I want to shine Yvan Rodriques. Yvan wrote the original BuySell script 
we've been using all these years, and hosted it himself, since (I think 
it was) 1996. He's kept it running all that time through thousands of 
ads and never asked for a thing in return. A very generous person. 
THANKS YVAN FOR ALL YOU'VE DONE.

While we're at it, thanks as well to Andy P. who goes in every now and 
again and cleans the boards up. People will post quite a bit of crap to 
a BBS-style board if you let them, unfortunately, and Andy tries to 
keep the duplicate ads and blank ads to a minimum.

Anyway. We've installed a new classified script. Actually Matt Roberds 
is the one who got it running because it was too hard for me and my 
tiny brain, thanks Matt! The new interface is a good bit fancier, and 
it allows you to add up to a dozen pictures with your advertisement 
(80K max per picture). This will allow you to display close-ups of all 
those rusty places in your bus, so get those digicams clicking.

Fortunately, running the script on our own server will allow us to 
block certain IP ranges if necessary. That means we can do away with 
the copious amounts of pointless spam some of our Asian friends were 
posting to the old BuySell every day. So that's good.

If you posted an ad to the old BuySell page lately, you need to re-post 
it at the new page, we have no way of moving the ads over.

Beta-testers: Thank you for your feedback! Please stop posting bogus 
ads now. It makes Andy mutter and pick at his beard.

Have fun!
