I don't know what part of Oregon those folks are talking about, up here IN
Oregon it's "If I took this down to LA it would be worth $X".  But you can't
get squat for an old bus around my parts anymore. I had an og paint 66
standard walk through with rebuilt original motor with under 30k, electronic
ignition, newer brakes, tires, reduction box bearings, good trans, in other
words a good daily driver. ran an ad in the paper with no takers, or even
offers.  sold it on the samba for $2500. My favorites are the folks that
think because a restored early 23 was up for sale for 40k it makes their
home brew late model camper worth at least 8-9k, after all a paint job is
only $300 at macco.

There is a lady driving around town with my old brown/tan(ugly) 67 pop top
camper(american) for 2k obo. When I sold it it didn't have a motor or brakes
so I know it's had some work done in the last few years.
