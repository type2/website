I would live there. Like an idealistic Smurf utopia
built for VW enthusiasts. Reminds me of Everybus this
last year. If only we could make it last for more than
just a weekend! Heck, even a VW campground and park
catered specifically for our busses that was opened
year round would be nice.

Sounds like Heaven to me!
