Subject: ADMIN: Please beta-test new BuySell feature

Folks,

Please bang on this thing and let me know off-list what you think of it:

	http://www.type2.com/buysell

You can add up to a dozen pictures to your ad but none can be larger 
than 80K. Let me know if it's reasonably intuitive to use for sellers.

The basic logic/workflow of the program probably won't change, and 
there probably won't be any features beyond what there are already, so 
it really wouldn't be useful to send feature requests.

Don't post anything you wouldn't want your mother to know about.
