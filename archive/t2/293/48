Subject: removing vent and roll up windows from doors....

Man, I haven't had such a problem as when I removed the windows from the 
doors last night.

It said in the Bentley and the Haynes man. to "push the front guide channel 
off it's bracket, and pull the regulator through the gap thus formed."

Well, I really had to 'push' it, I mean with a screw driver, with all my 
weight, and a hell of a lot of grunts. Does that sound right to you all? 

I just want to make sure I am not screwing anything up, I still got to do the 
other door today.

Thanks all
