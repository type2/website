Actually, VW specifies 11mm, but good luck finding that size at yer
neighborhood FLAPS.

NEVER use water/coolant hose for fuel use.  That is just asking for a lot
of trouble as the rubber compound breaks down rapidly from exposure to
fuel.  I'd have the fire extinguisher at the ready like Dave Raistrick says.

Most any FLAPS should carry 1/2" Fuel/Emissions rated hose.  That's what
I've always used (even currently on my 84 Westy) and it's never given me a
problem from day one.  Of course, always use clamps to prevent leaks.

Cheers :-)
