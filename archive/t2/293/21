Subject: Tow dolly around Washington, DC

I just came home from a friend's place to pick up a tow dolly that I
wanted to borrow from him. When we came out of the house to unlock it
from a nearby telephone pole, the only thing that was there was a lock
cut into pieces but no tow dolly ...

Folks, it seems as my Thanksgiving plans have been shattered. I wanted
to tow my buddy's Civic (dead engine) with my Camper (VW content) to
Phoenix where he has an engine waiting and pick up a 58 Opel Kapitaen in
Albuquerque on the way back.

Does anyone of you folks around the Washington Metropolitan area have a
dolly that they would loan to me? I cannot justify spending the $39.95
per day U-Haul is asking for a trip that may last 8 or 9 days.

Thanks,
Marcus
