Subject: Re: [T2] RE: [VB] hooded sweatshirt wanted

i was thinking of sewing all my Full Moon Bus Club patches on my curtains
after i tie dye them blue/white. having event designs, like the shirts,
on the curtains would be neat, too. unfortunately, it wouldnt work for
any other event since most are printed before hand. i may start buying an
extra shirt and cutting out the design and sewing them all into new
curtains!

thanks for the idea, ronnie,
