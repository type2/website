My insurance company always gives me the option of filing the claim against my
insurance, paying the deductible, and then letting them recover the funds from
the other party. I always take this option. I've always gotten the deductible
back because they were able to recover 100% of their funds. This way I'm
dealing with people who I pay for their services and I'm dealing with the
terms for my insurance policy. Plus, they have gaggles of lawyers on staff to
take on the other insurance company.

But I don't have my bus insured as a collector's/antique. I don't know if I
can afford it right now. Of course if it's in an accident and it gets totaled,
what the insurance company gets might not exactly be what I was driving! My
VDO guages, stereo, and likely the entire engine, will be waiting for a new
home. That's where all of my money is anyway.
