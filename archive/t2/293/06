Not specifically Bryant's fault, except for doing something dumb (and who
among us doesn't now and then).  Here is the email I sent the VB list:

------------------------------------------

Hooboy, not this one!

Folks, this is not a nice thing.  The unwitting sender of this message
(bryant) made the mistake of answering "I Accept" to an end user licence
agreement that gave permission for the installed program to send this
message to everybody in his address book.

In essence this is a "legal" virus since it asks permission first!

Since it doesn't come as an attachment, it slips past the list filters.
I will see about fixing this on the filters.

Word to the wise:  Don't go to the friendgreeting site and don't accept
any EULA until you read the whole thing.

Bryant, I don't know how to fix this.  You can probably do a Google search
on "friendgreeting" and get a solution.
