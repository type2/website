Subject: tune up comments solicited

Hey,

this weekend I did the following, and would appreciate any comments:

76 bus, 79 cal engine

1. Adjust Hydraulic Lifters

Followed Bentley procedures, heard a lot of springs popping after tightening the rockers again, and some of the valves seems to have more thread left on the adjustment than others. Also, valve noise doesn't seem noticably reduced as I expected.

2. New v.c. gaskets

Still leaking oil after new gaskets on the 3/4 side. Too much heat from the catalytic warping my covers?
