Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Samba Effect /RANT/

amazing, isnt it? a few years ago my ex had a 95 neon that he bought new
for 10K (plus taxes et al= $11,500) and after4 years still owed $7K (cuz
his payments are $230/month and he tends to let his insurance go, so they
tack on a grand a year, so his payments are going to that instead of the
loan)... anyway, they were selling USED neons NEWER than his for $4k!!! i
was upset. of coarse it doesnt matter now cuz he is now my ex, but in
january he is going to finally pay it off... 8 years later, will owe $1k.
sad, isnt it?

thing is, it is falling apart and it isnt eve 10 years old yet! yeah my
bus <bus content> has it's problems, but it was neglected most of it's
life (i believe it was parked at the lake for about 15 years, then parked
another 2 years perhaps in a garage, before i bought it) but it is still
a great car, gets me where i need to go (when i dont have it torn apart,
lol). besides, once i get a few more things cleaned up or fixed, it will
be around ANOTHER 30 years!!!!

i have run accross the samba effect, too. if it werent for my buddy pete,
i wouldnt have the bus i have today. all the busses i saw when i was
looking, they wanted way too much for. i am a single mom with minimal
finances, so i cant afford to buy a restoration project. i needed a solid
bus that would be easy to maintain. pete rebuilt the engine for me, so
that saved me some money. the bus was good, but needed engine work...
just the kind to find (if there is any work to be done, anyway) and my
other friend leo said it looked like a good starter bus for me when he
saw it. i am so glad i got a westy, too. it has been so much fun and has
alot more character (IMHO) than a regular bus would have.

I LOVE MY BUS!

70 westy
and another that isnt a bus... (but it IS a vw)
