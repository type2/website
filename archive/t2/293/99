Subject: Loose output shaft bearing- is it adjustable?

Hello all and sorry for keeping on with this question.
My left side output bearing is loose and moving up and
down (-at-) 1/16 - 1/8 of an inch. There was something said
about it being adjustable and although I don't see how
it could be, if it was that would save me a tranny
tear down. what does the plastic flange around the
output shaft do and is that some kind of and
adjustment or not. Also can I access the shaft seal
without pulling the tranny>? Thanks in advance.
