The classified adds out here would tell another story, unfortunately.  In 
Oregon there are some amazing deals to be had on very clean buses because 
there are so many of them!  Even the very desirable late bay Deluxe 
Westfalias can be found for good prices if you are patient and keep looking 
in the local papers.  For a fair amount less than the $8000 he quotes you can 
buy a_really_nice complete, drive it anywhere, west coast, 78 or 79 Riviera 
or Westfalia. I sure wouldn' blow $3000 on a beat up, incomplete hulk with a 
bug engine I couldn't trust beyond the driveway!
