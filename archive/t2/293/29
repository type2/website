Vacuum leak that only happens when something finally gets warm. I'd check 
the idle air bypasss thingy-ma-bob too.

I had vacuum leaks in the gas tank venting system, injector seals, and EGR 
valve. I replaced the hoses, replaced the injector seals ($16), and blocked 
off the EGR valve saving all the pieces so I could reinstall at a later 
date in case TN gets smog testing.
