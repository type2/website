I wouldn't sweat the old Bentley, apparently my brain is even older. I
took a peek in the bentley before driving home tonight, while waiting
on the bus to warm up. I could find nothing about what the resistance
should be at running temp. I am almost sure I have heard this
somewhere but can't verify it. If I can remember, I'll try & see what
my sensor reads when at temp. Hopefully someone can step up & either
confirm or deny my memory :)
