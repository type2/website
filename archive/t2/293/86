Terry and others,

I've learned from a friend who lost out even after going to the mat with 
an insurance company over a cherry car that got totaled and the company 
would not give the real value - only
'replacement" value despite the full coverage.  He bought a '90 Land 
Cruiser for 17K.  It was in great shape and he kept it that way.  It got 
totaled 1 year later (not his fault) and the company offered 10.5K. 
 They fought and settled for 14.3K

He suggested and I got for my bus a "stated value" policy.  It, simply, 
a pre agreed upon value of the bus policy that I pay the premium and 
they pay the value if it gets totaled.  I took pictures and had the bus 
appraised.  I only wanted to get my money out of it if it was totaled. 
 That is 5.5K.  The company agreed and now I am covered.

Check with your insurance company.  My bus is a '79 and did not qualify 
as  an antique or classic or whatever it needed to be to get the full 
replacement coverage.
