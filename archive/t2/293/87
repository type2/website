Tell me about it, I recently did the same thing on my "old" bus. I couldn't get 
the window lifter thingy out of there. I was afraid of scratching or breaking 
the window. I ended up having to take the wing window frame out to get the 
window lifter and window out. 
Oh and Bentley says there is some metal tab holding the widow lifter cable 
guide to the inner door panel. I found no such tab.
