  I had mentioned this a few months ago with blue book value?  Seems many 
people want to have their cake, and eat it too.  Blue book is now showing my 
69 at 3500 low, 5000 mid, and 8500 high.  I like the rest, think 3500 is 
ridiculous for fair condition.  But, when we total said bus, we want that 
3500 out of it!  Some are saying that they would not pay more than 1500 for 
a bus, yet we are 0.k. with book being so high?  Seems like it does not make 
much sense.  Whenever you talk to the folks selling their busses for 8k, 
they always tend to remind you what book value is.  As far as I am 
concerned, book value meens nothing!
It is what the market will bear, and listening to the market, I do not see 
many out there willing to spend book value, or even near.  High book will 
always drive prices higher.  Yet remember, we still need these numbers for 
insurance reasons.  What to do, What to do!!!!
