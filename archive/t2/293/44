JB and list,
I've never had the nerve to really screw someone
on a price.  That pricing thing is also why I try
to buy in the fall, after the wives tell the
husband they aren't freezing for another winter. 
It also gives me all winter to get the thing
ready for spring camping.

Yeah.  That is actually what I'd prefer.  But
even the non-runners seem to have $2000 price
tags.  Unless I know the engine rebuilder (AVP,
Raby, new longblock) and know the appreciates how
to drive a vw bus (meaning no 65mph + driving), I
assume I'll have to put one in myself a short
time after purchase.  And I think I still have
access to a 70 westy interior for cheap.  But a
poptop (preferably a late poptop) is a must with
2.5 kids.  

I do find that traderonline and cars.com offer
more reasonable pricing than samba and even
ep.com.
