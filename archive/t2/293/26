Darren,

If you sheared all of the bolts on the cv joint off, it depends on 
how much of the bolts are still showing in the axle stub.

A *real* pair of vice grips might do it, otherwise you are in for some
serious work.

Probably would be better to tow it home and remove the axle stub and work 
on it in the open....wonder if anything is bent?


Cheers ,dave
