Autoanything.com is the place to find a good deal on a Covercraft Noah
cover.

And if you tell them waht you have they will custom build the cover fo
you--just give them the dimentions.

Camperworld also has generic covers for RV's that would work--but
wouldn't be a exact fit--

Later,

So.....I am just sitting here, exhausted from playing with the bus all
day, and started thinking about how I am going to probably baby it after
she is all done up. 
Then, I thought about how a car cover might be good, and would probably
keep the paint and seals nicer for longer, provided I don't get lazy
with it. 
Anyone know of a company that makes car covers for hightop busses?
Probably not, but I figured I would ask you all. I see them all the time
for busses and westies, but not for the hightops.... 
Thanks all
