Subject: Re: [VB] hooded sweatshirt wanted

I think Rex Eastman sell VW clothes as I have a hoodie that says VW party
instead of VW parts on the back and I think I bought it from him!  I am not
sure if I have seen him on this list but he is at all the big VW shows out
there (West) or a rep. for him is.   I am sure he will be at Havasu in Jan
2003 but you probably want it for Xmas!  Does he have a website? A email?  I
don't know!?      It snowed here last night and we have about 4 inches on
everything so I am driving the Suburban for the winter now as they are
salting the streets as I speak!

All journeys end when we reach our destination
but the journeying remains a thing apart,
 unique unto itself.
Most of us make life's journeys without
understanding that the
journeying is a separate thing.
