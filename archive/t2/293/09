Subject: REAR AXLE 

Howdy Y'all,

Me 72 van
This morning i was driving to work and i ran over a high curb
breaking all the bolts off where the axle meets the rear left tire.
the freakin bolts are all stuck in the part by the wheel.
anyone know if you can remove this part that attaches to the wheel
or any tricks getting the bolts out?
Your help is much appreciated.
Darren
