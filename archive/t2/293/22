Subject: Re: [T2] Putting in a new clutch : what's the pilot bearing

Ben,
On a type4 engine the pilot bearing is located at the end of the 
crankshaft. With the flywheel installed and clutch removed if you 
look at the center of the bolt pattern that holds the flywheel to 
the crank, there is a little hole in the center. The bearing is 
difficult to see so you could stick your finger in and feel for it.  
If the engine came pre assembled with the flywheel, the builder 
should have replaced/installed the bearing. If yours needs replacing 
you need to remove the flywheel to access it.
