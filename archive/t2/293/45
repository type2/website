Subject: Pressure Plate

Hi People,

I'm re-installing the the flywheel/clutch on my '77 2.0L and had a couple
questions...

I heard somewhere that the pressure plate/flywheel are supposed to balanced.
I'm wondering if there are marks on the pressure plate to aid in putting it
back on the flywheel correctly?  I didn't mark it when I took it off.

I've been told to chamfer the flywheel sealing lip...what should I use to do
this (sandpaper?), how far down the lip do I go, and what is the desired
final finish?


TIA,
