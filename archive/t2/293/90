True I did not have collectors , vintage insurance on my vehicle. 2 weeks
prior I totaled my singlecab in a pileup and the 70 had been on the road for
less than a week , and was my only mode of transportation. Having it insured
for a stated value was on my list of things to do but some loser in a Chevy
Astro had other plans.

I fought his insurance company for 2 months. The appraiser they sent out
took a picture of the nose, the worse part, without removing the tarp on the
rest of the vehicle. He also listed it as having a 6 cylinder, power
steering and power brakes. he didn't know VWs and didn't know what he was
looking at.
The only reason I didn't get stiffed for $800 was because of the NADA
values.

If any of you are convinced that the opposing insurance company is willing
and ready to replace your old bus with a duplicate or the financial means to
replace it then I will let you represent me if this ever happens again.
