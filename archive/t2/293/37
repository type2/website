This is exactly why when I found by 76, I took the 75 I had purchased
the year earlier for $1500, (after sinking a fairly large amount of work
into it, around $2,000 worth) and put it up on the type2.com buy/sell
page. It took a month to find a buyer, and hardly anyone contacted me
about it, but I still sold it for my original purchase price of $1500,
because I knew that is all it was worth still. Am I crazy? I don't think
so. I found my new 76 for $410, and wanted to be sure that I pass along
those savings, in hopes that they will come full circle again someday
when I do want to purchase my splitty, before moving back to Wisconsin
to settle down. 

Perhaps I will need to sell my 76, right about the time im done
restoring her to finance that purchase, but we'll see - hopefully not.
