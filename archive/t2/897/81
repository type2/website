A simple single color single color exterior paint job?

Nothing simple about it Andy--if it's done right, using top shelf
refinishing materials, and not missing any of the body work, or painting
half of the rubber moulding's around the glass.

All of the glass should have been out, and all of the chrome removed.

The body should have been naked.

No masking problems.

For the price that you paid for the paint work, they short cutted
something---

 The zinc chromate acid etch primer, the urethane sealer / primer, and
the base clear urethane paint wasn't used--you got straight enamel, and
there wasn't any final surface wet sanding and buffing.

You got a cave and pave paint job.

I sometimes wonder how a bike paint job warrants $10,000.00, and the
guys with Van's and Buses think that their getting a deal at a third of
that.

Their really not.

Oh well---your happy--that's all that counts.
