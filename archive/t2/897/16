Hi Travis,

This tells me there is a problem in power delivery. Have you checked  
ALL the power connection terminals yet?

Remember that the return trip wires are every bit as critical as the  
ones between the starter and the battery. There's a ground strap to  
the frame and another from the frame to the tranny. Make sure they  
are clean and tight.


Happy trails,
