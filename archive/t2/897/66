Chris,
Warning: *depending on your remote oil filter setup*
If you use a modified oil pump cover to route oil to the filter and
the pump is specific to the applicaiton, you cannot just replace the
pump cover, you most likey have to swap the pump body and put the
stock pump back in. You need a pump with an oil hole on both sides (on
in one out).
