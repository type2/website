Hi there:

Good for you for getting dirty with a FI.  You will love it if this is your
first time.  I did mine over the winter with lots of help from friends.  I
am still learning.

Here is a link to my website about my VW. Check out the photos since it
might help... never know. http://www.hueymungus.com/VW/index.htm

It's a 78 FI 2L Riviera model. Basically a Westie but made by a local Dealer
between 65-86.

I would look at Ratwell's website. There is a lot of handy handy stuff.

For gaskets I would get this kit:

It has everything you will need.  This saved my butt when one of my friends
asked if I had this or that.  I held this up, and they pointed to what they
wanted.

I would also replace all your fuel lines with new!! This will also go for
anything else that is easier to replace while in this state than on the side
of the road.

Is your tranny out too?  If so, replace the oil, check the throw-out bearing
($5 part). Check the flywheel, plate, pressure plate. I got a new setup
including a flywheel.

AKIT

I did not know I was going to replace the flywheel, but I did.  $50 from
junkyard.  Mine had a nice deep groove.

I also replaced the stock muffler since mine had a nice crack/hole in it.
Good time to do that as well.

Spark Plugs: Get new ones and check the wires.  Be careful of the #3 plug.

If your going to take off the heads then I would inspect the lifters and
replace the pushrod tubes and seals.  The seals come with the gasket set
listed above.

There are a lot of little tools, grease, sealant stuff that I cannot
remember that you will need when putting it all back together.  Buy it
too...

When your cleaning the tin, you could have it sandblasted and then re-paint
it yourself.  Though powder-coat would be nice if you had the $$.  I just
cleaned and painted mine with soap/water.

Basically, overall if the part is small and cheap replace it.  Also just so
all the listees know I did buy from the local FLAPS, Busdepot and a few
others for parts that I needed.

I think that I put $1000 into the removal and I am not done yet. Good thing
it's not a BOAT!

Have fun!
