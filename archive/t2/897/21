Subject: Re: [T2] AC Compressor replacement

Thanks for all the info.  Now I know there IS a replacement/retrofit, and
how it is to be done.  Unfortunately, I have some further questions, which I
am researching.

The comp on the '82 is pointing the wrong direction, it appears to be
mounted backwards, with the pulley pointing towad the fron of the bus.
Also, it sits on a plate with an idler pulley below it, both have two
grooves.  If I sight down the grooves of the idler pulley from underneath, I
can see one of the grooves lines up with the crank pulley.  This makes me
think there should be two belts, one for the crank to idler pulley, and a
shorter one from the ldler pulley to the compressor.  Is this correct?  None
of the local shops have a clue, and are trying to say there is just one long
belt, but there would be no way to turn 90 degrees without a second
pulley/wheel on the engine tin for the 'inside' turn.

As for the position, does this mean the retrofit compressor needs to be
turned around?  I am a bit confused on this point.  IIRC, the direction of
rotation doesn't matter on the York style compressors, but it is critical on
the Sanden's?  So how does it need to mount?

Back to the researches.
