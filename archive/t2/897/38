Solid Lifters.

Of course I wonder about it.  And I am sure there is.  Problem is I
don't know what.   The wear pattern of the bad pushrod almost looks
like someone put the rocker arms in and didn't make sure the pushrod
was seated.  I also changed the oil and put a new oil filter on.  I
ran my oil through a screen and dragged a magnet around the bottom of
the oil pan.   no chunks.

This is the first time I have ever adjusted the valves in ANY vehicle
let alone a Bus.  I am a little scared of stripping bolts right now so
it may just be that I didn't have the locknut tight enough.

Who knows. kinda hard to search on what I saw in the pic and nobody
issued forth any theories regarding the picture I took of the damage.
One shop I went to yesterday when I showed them the rod and asked
thier mechanic about it kind of half laughed and said "ruunn it".  I'm
paranoid.  So I replaced it.  It wasn't bent, showed no other unusual
signs of wear based on what I have read in bently or seen in pictures
elsewhere on the net.

Compression and power are still great, infact its running smoother
than before (I also checked my vacum hoses so that may be the
situation.

I am going to be extra gentle on it for the trip over the mountains(as
gentle as I can be loaded down going into the mountains)  Brakes are
great, Steering is solid.

Running like a top with a little more tick than I would like but still
pretty good.
