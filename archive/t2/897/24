Subject: California Fuel Pump Nozzles

WTF is wrong with CA? I thought they got rid of those accordion tube things?
I spill more gas with those things. I have no problem anywhere else. Just
with these "Vapor Recovery" nozzles.

Anybody got any tricks or suggestions fo rmy 78?

I tried shoving the thing all the way in, but then the nozzle gets stuck.
Holding the accordion tube by hand defeats the auto shutoff. Bleh.
