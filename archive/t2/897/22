Subject: SoCal Meetup!

Since I'm here in CA for a little while, I'm gathering folks for a bonfire
in Huntington Beach.

I went by the beach this morning. Here's the location:

Huntington Beach
Lifeguard tower #2
South end of the beach, near the river / jetties

Bring:
Wood!!!!!!
Food!
Whatever!

I'll be getting there around 4pm and staying until 10 or whenever everybody
fades. Look for the Guacamole bus!

Just a casual pull in, throw stuff in the fire, eat whatever you brought,
check out each other's VWs, etc.
