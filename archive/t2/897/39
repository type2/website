Previous Thread "Rocker arm studs and me :-("


Lastly, my pushrods are 10.650" (272mm).  One of the ends was kind of
"chewed up"  http://www.zachula.com/newgallery/bustek/P1010355

" Zach,  WHICH end of the pushrod was that?"

*hangs head*  Remember the previous thread?  I broke two rules.....I
was hurrying and I was so focused on getting my pushrod tube seals
replaced that I didn't really keep track.  I took lots of pictures.
and there is one with everything out in relation to how it was in the
engine

Looking at this pic:

it looks like it may be the exhaust rod and the lifter side.


Can solid lifters stick?
