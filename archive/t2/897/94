Subject: engine drop update

well,  i have about 3/4's of engine dissasembled.  mostly the tin and FI
parts.  doing this is alot of fun and has helped relieve some of the
trepidition i had before about fixing things that repquired any
dissasembly.  everything looks to be in very good condition.  most looks
new(er) but slightly dirty.  some tin is oily and mucky.  guess i'll try
different cleaners.  any suggestions on quick spray on wipe offf cleaners.
if not i'll just bathe them in a soapy water bath and wipe them down.  i'm
compiling a list of seals and misc.  other things i'll need for reassembly.
i'll post it to the list later, probably much later since i'm in KC for work
and the bus is in st. louis aka tornado city,  and if i miss anything i'm
sure someone will let me know.  anyway.  thanks for reading.
