VWG/Airhead Parts is in the pre-production phase of reproducing the Bay
Window Gas Filler Restrictor Plate, which was briefly available from VW
about 8 years ago.  It is hoped that they will be available before the end
of 2006.  Stay tuned.

BTW - the sample for the repro cheerfully provided by Karl

Before VW intro'd this plate, the other alternative was to purchase from VW
the 211 201 119 A Gas Filler Elbow with the restrictor built-in (looked like
a bird's beak) and it was very expensive to the tune of around $50 and its
longevity/reliablity was a very short lifespan.  The restrictor plate will
be appropriately cheaper and you can use the leaded style filler elbow, 211
201 119, which is still more common available.
