1. get an early bay with a manly 2.5" "straight shot" fuel fill
2. be happy!

Seriously, if you hold the "boot" back far enough the nozzle will function
normally.

Some stations have the "bootless" nozzles with the little vacuum holes in
the nozzle,  They work pretty well, but they are rare.

I agree about the gas spills.  When it comes to these nozzles "It's not a
good idea, It's the law!"
