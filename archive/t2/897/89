You got genuine urethane paint--or are you mistaking and you got acrylic
enamel with hardner in it?

Different stuff.
Different long term results.

You got it painted at a Earl Scheib / Maaco facility?

I don't think they have any Imron type paint available.

Just acrrylic enamel single stage color.

Just as long as your happy--that's all that counts.
