It takes less base coat than straight color to cover any vehicle.
There's more pigment in the base coat --it cover's more with less ,
except then you have to cover it with the clear which is less money than
the pigmented paint.

Red is expensive, white is the cheapest.

Porsche red, Andretti red is on the very high end of the color monetary
spectrum.

Some fof the newer Lexus color's are $750.00 a quart--no clear,
hardener, or reducer.

Liquid gold.

How much will it take to cover a Bus?

This is why aI asked in what--


How many coat's of straight color paint?

Johhny one coat?
A wham, Bam?

Two?

Three?

Splurge---go for 4.

Your talking two gallons of reduded color.
