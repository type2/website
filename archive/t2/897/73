For a short-range low-speed trip with an undamaged transmission there
should be no problem.  Use a wheel-lift towtruck and make sure that the
transmission is in neutral.

If I were towing for a long ways at highway speeds, I would disconnect
the axles.

Isn't there anyone in the area who can give this fellow a hand and just
drive the bus to the shop?  Heck, if your wife simply drives to the shop
and picks up the mechanic he might be happy to drive the bus back.

Play the "Overseas GI in need" card.  You deserve certainly deserve it!
