Well, that philosophy didn't do much good for the family I stopped to help
at the CA14/US395 junction a few years back.  Their coil was dead as a
doornail.  I didn't carry a coil in
those days and we hammered the 10 miles into Ridgecrest to try and find an
open parts store at 6:00PM on a Sunday.  We were lucky, we caught a guy
with his key in the lock and he was nice and opened back up for us.
Otherwise it would have been a long cold night in the Mojave.

A part in the hand is worth many in the parts store.
