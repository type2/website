Subject: 68 bus firewall?

Hi All,

I have a 68 VW Riviera. On a 400 mile roadtrip this weekend my gas gauge
gave up.  Anyhow, while investigating what might be the problem I have
been looking at a lot of pictures of buses and fuel tank removal.  One
thing I noticed in most pictures/postings is the mention of a firewall
between the engine compartment and the engine bay.

My 68 doesn't seem to have the engine bay closed off from the gas tank.
Looking in the engine bay, you can see the actual gas tank, filler neck,
breather tubes, etc. Looking at engine bay pictures of at least one
other 68 on Samba, it looked setup like mine with no firewall.  I have
looked at some 69s on samba and it seemed to have a firewall.  Looking
at 67s, no firewall.

Is this the norm for 68 busses?  Was 1968 a some do/some don't year for
firewalls...meaning if you have an early production 68(meaning built in
67) you might not have a firewall?

thanks,
Greg
