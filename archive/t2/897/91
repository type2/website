Subject: 1960 bus front axle

Hi group,

I had an outer bearing go out, and it broke my front left axle.  What years 
of spindles will fit my bus?  Is there a part number or other way to 
differeniate between the one I need and others without having the broken one in hand?  
Does anyone have one in their parts stash to sell?

Thanks,
Jacques
