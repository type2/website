At BBBX, there were a few guys with Bays that they had painted with pickup
bed liner material.  Looked pretty darned good and it was extremely
scratch resistant.  Nice bright colors, too.  You have to get into the
texture, though.

Wow.  I can't imagine that would improve our already 'less than stellar'
