Subject: driving ranges, 1600cc & 1700cc

	Old bus fans have their own ideas on this
-  I don't wish to dissuade them  -  but it
occurs to me ther may be some newbies who haven't
access to this advice from the mfr.



	from VW Typ2 Instruction Manual (37 pp.)
			Aug 1972   p.12


		1600cc		1700cc twin carb

1st gear	0 - 12 mph		0-15

		   economical		   economical
2nd gear	9-25	9-19		9-31	9-22

3rd	15-43	15-31		15-50	15-37

4th	25-68	25-50		25-78	25-56


	Those without tachs can draw concentric
arcs on the speedo glass with different coloured
felt pens.  (Many Pom sickles e.g Triumph in the
1950s-70s had such arcs printed on the Smiths
speedo.)  For 1st gear you don't need an arc but
just one red line.

	There's no hint of the criteria applied
by die Kra|te for 'economical', but I'm willing
to assume they emphasized both fuel economy and
engine longevity.  Take it that easy and you'll
save fuel & metal.

	As warned by one alert listee, you can't
take these mph ranges at face value unless you
know the transmission ratios are original.  Any
mucking around with rear tyre size will also
change them  -  by a proportion you can calculate
(with figs from the tyre mfr).

	For later types with more powerful
engines, if you can't access the mfr's
corresponding recommendations, rough
extrapolation from the above will be a lot better
than no guidance.
	For Judson-supercharged VW,
Corvair-powered hotrod buses, etc, all bets are
off.
