I have often wondered why someone with a great deal more money than
me hasn't repaired a bay or splittie body to perfection and used it to make
fiberglass
molds for new fiberglass bodies. No rust and the light weight would increase
accelleration and fuel mileage. Judging from going price of a restored
splittie, I
bet there would be a lot of interest in a fiberglass reproduction.
