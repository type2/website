In the antideluvian period when I was drivin' my first car, an MGA,
I came across another LBC by the side of the road...I stopped and
asked him to just turn on the key and I listened...Silence. So I went
back to my car and fished out a heavy screwdriver and reached be-
hind the rear wheel and gave the Lucas fuel pump a coupla sharp
whacks with the handle of the screwdriver...Tick, tick, tick, tick...
Sometimes the points stick... ;-)
