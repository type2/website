3 years ago my daughter had her 75 white/red bus painted white by Maaco, 
using their "best" 2 part urethane, $1,000 plus some extra to do around 
door edges where we covered red with white.  As she was just starting 
college, money was tight, and she wanted a decent white base to do 
murals on her bus.  The shooting still looks fine; the smoothness (no 
ripples) and shine is like the first day it was painted.  It filled over 
all fine scratches. The way to save is to do all the prep yourself; we 
sanded and had the pitted areas sandblasted (rockers, roof, nose) and we 
painted that with DuPont's etching primer (Variprime?) and putty 
filled/sanded pits. We sanded to 400 grit the rest (good base paint 
still there). We did the masking, going underneath the rubber where 
possible.  Any flaws showing now is our fault; one door rusting from 
inside at the bottom and the dogleg below it.  Also, we forgot to insist 
on flexisizer as an additive, so rock nicks can produce a paint chip we 
touch up immediately.
