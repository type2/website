Subject: AC Compressor replacement

Hi Volks,

On an '82, air cooled, which has A/C, it is the old style York/Techumseh
compressor.  I have had trouble with thoose on 134a conversions in the
past.  So the idea is to retrofit the compressor from a later model, or
other car.  Question is, which compressor and out of what?  I can't seem to
narrow it down via the archives, so am looking for additional input on this.

Thanks.
Burt
