Subject: Bench mount stand VS Just a bench

Folks -
  So I'm just about ready to tear into the internals of my 1700cc.  My
dilemma is this:  Do I put the engine on a bench, or do I get the 2-armed
yoke and use that?  I don't have room for a true engine stand, and there
doesn't seem to be a bench-mount engine stand that I can afford other then
the 2-armed yoke.  I'm leaning towards the yoke since I'm guessing it'll be
easier to work on the bottom end and stuff, but I'm afraid of the yoke not
being strong enough and breaking the engine/my foot/my floor...
Right now the engine is on a 700lb furniture dolly, which worked well for
taking off the accessories and stuff, but I think it would be hard to open
the crankcase and such while it's on it.
Just to clarify, I'm thinking of using the yoke on the "shortblock", no
accessories or anything.

And for those of you curious, I'm doing a complete teardown and rebuild
since the prior owner pulled it with every intention of rebuilding it but
then life intervened and the engine sat on the bus bed for 6 years.
It seems to be in pretty good shape from a visual standpoint, tho I'll have
a better idea after a leakdown test soon.
Thanks in advance!
