That was referring to checking the cable that connects the negative  
battery terminal to the bus. If it's corroded at the BUS end of the  
cable, it will create resistance.

Checking the battery terminals is good, but checking BOTH ends of  
those wires is better. The positive battery terminal connects to a  
cable that is then routed to a post on the starter. That is where it  
meets up with the wire from the alternator, and the other wires that  
power your bus. The post on the starter is subjected to the elements  
and corrosion on these connections is not uncommon.

Only the connections in the starter circuit are important at the  
moment. Focus on them and you will get the problem resolved.


Happy trails,
