Subject: Re: [T2] AC Compressor replacement

From "hawk wolf":

 On an '82, air cooled, which has A/C, it is the old style York/Techumseh
compressor.  I have had trouble with thoose on 134a conversions in the
past.  So the idea is to retrofit the compressor from a later model, or
other car.  Question is, which compressor and out of what?  I can't seem to narrow it down via the archives,
so am looking for additional input on this.
