Subject: Driving Challenge videos from BOTC 2006

Hi Volks,

I just posted two video clips of the Bus Driver's Challenge from BOTC  
2006 to youtube.

This first video clip has my brother Brent driving, it' shot with a  
short NASCAR style interview before the run and is a great example of  
how the course is run. The event features a slalom course with a stop  
in the middle for a random task, after which the driver continues to  
the end of the course to "stop on a dime". (actually a foil-covered  
paper plate is used) The driver then slaloms through the entire  
course in REVERSE, without stopping until they back up to a post as  
closely as possible without stopping. Then they drive over to  
parallel park next to a flag placed between two trees. The final  
score is a combination of total elapsed time and the stopping  
distance from the dime and the post.

The second video clip is shot from INSIDE the van, with "madman"  
Jamie Rivers at the wheel. Jamie provides quite a memorable  
experience to the onlookers, and our intrepid cameraman does his best  
to record the experience for posterity.
