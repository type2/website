One way to get around the "one year only"  manifold problem is to find
one of the early governor replacement spacers, the ones that mount
between the carb and manifold. Then  bore the center to match and add a
pipe fitting to the side to act as a vacuum port. That way you don't
need to remove the manifold or find an original manifold with vacuum
port. Tmo
