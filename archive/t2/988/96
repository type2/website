Hi Jason,

You and every other Harley that leaves the showroom. Seems like there  
are very few people happy with the stock HD exhaust. The pipes I got  
were BRAND NEW. The chrome is super thick and bright, and the build  
quality is 10/10.

The on ly issue I have is the lack of stealth. People can hear these  
pipes from a mile away. But that also brings to mind the old saying:  
"Loud Pipes Save Lives".


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
