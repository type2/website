Subject: not sure where to put this hose

engine is 2.0L FI solid lifters from a 77 donor bus.  i put it into my 
78 westy a few weeks ago.  i'm very close to firing it up.  there are 
two hoses coming out of the charcoal canister.  on my other bus, which 
is a 78 with 78 parts, that hose goes to the tin that covers the side of 
the case.  the 77 tin has no such place for this hose.  what should i do 
with the hose?

tia,

dan
