Matt-
On my '77 the pointy tabs poked through the rear seat vinyl just above the
cord and wrapped around the bottom. The front side of the seat just tucked
under and wasn't secured by the tabs.   

On the first seat I did the tabs were a little blunted and didn't pierce the
vinyl very neatly.  On the second I sharpened up the tab with a file and it
looked a lot better.  Also had one of the tabs break off.  Where that had
happened I used a black zip tie to secure it.
