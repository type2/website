 And I also hooked up the power brake booster. I replaced the unit 2 or 3 years ago, with the previous dual
carb 1800cc engine and I opted to disconnect it due to vacuum leaks. I bought some 1/2 heater hose and ran
that from the long metal pipe to the engine bay.

.... I might buy some more of that heater hose and bypass the
 metal pipe. There was some rust on it. (where isn't there any?).

WRONG hose to use.
You need to use booster hose.
It is reinforced so vacuum does not collapse it.
