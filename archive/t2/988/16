Subject: RE: [T2] Torsion Bar Adjustment

The Haynes manual talks about using a tyre lever to relieve residual tension
in the torsion bar.  After a quick search on the internet it looks like this
tool is used to remove tires from wheels.  Anyone had experience with a tyre
lever or other tools used to relieve the torsion bar tension?
