Hi Nathan,

If you have to remove the existing tank anyway, I would strongly  
recommend you do so and take it to your local Rad shop.

If the tank is solid, the "Dino poo" can be removed with an  
appropriate treatment of solvents, steam-cleaning and abrasives. Then  
a new lining can be applied to the interior if required, and you're  
good to go. No new parts needed.


Happy Trails,

Can anyone suggest a Canuck source for a fuel tank for a 68 single

Samba, a pre-72 bus tank is the same. Mine is clogged up with dinosaur
poo...
