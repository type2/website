Subject: Re: [T2] Driver's Seat Removal?

This has been the case with several drivers seats that I've come across.
Patience, WD-40, liquid wrench and a hammer will help you get it off. Try
tapping it from both sides with a hammer or rubber mallet. It usually takes
a lot of rocking back and forth once you get it unfrozen.
Make sure you clean it up good and lube it before reinstallation.

Best of Luck
Eddie
