Subject: single cab fuel tank

Can anyone suggest a Canuck source for a fuel tank for a 68 single
cab? CiP doesn't carry them and I would rather avoid the costs/delays
of shipping across the border such a large item. According to the
Samba, a pre-72 bus tank is the same. Mine is clogged up with dinosaur
poo...
