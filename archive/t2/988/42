You may need to work some scotch pad with some solvent
around in there as there may be a buildup of gunk
cooked on. Otherwise, as Greg says, they should come
out. I've had to pull as quick and hard as the magnet
allowed a few times to kinda beat its way through the
spot that was resisting, but when I cleaned the bore
thoroughly as far as I could reach, they came out.

 okay, pulled off the rockers and pulled out the
 pushrod tubes, then
 inserted a magnet to pull out what should be a solid
 lifter in my 75
 FI auto engine.  the lifter had some play but i
 could not remove it.
 this was the #4 exhaust.  this is the one with the
 rocker arm with 1/4
 inch play when i went to adjust the valves.  so, i
 checked the #4
 intake.  same thing.  lifter had play but would not
 come out of the
pushrod tube.  do i need to keep on trying and
 jiggle the magnet to
 try to lift the lifter over a lip at the end of the
 pushrod tube?
 
 okay, again.  looked online a little and found some
 pics of lifters
 solid and hydraulic.  appears i did not try hard
 enough, so i will try
 again in a bit to pull out the lifters.  i'm still
 leaning towards a
 valve seat that fell out and is now improperly
 wedged in the
 combustion chamber bashing the hell out of the
 piston.  may be wishful
 thinking but that is what happened before on the #1
 intake valve.
 
 thanks, to everyone.
