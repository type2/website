Subject: Bigger may not be better??? and a tach question.

Hi Volks,

I did some checking on this new engine I have in Bob the Tomato...

It turns out that the "EA" series block is a 1.7L that was designed  
to make 80HP(-at-)4900RPM and 97 lbft of torque (-at-)2800 rpm with 8.3:1  
compression and was used in both the 411 and the 914.

Specs were sourced here:

http://www.carfolio.com/specifications/models/car/? 
car=49335&Volkswagen-specifications

The GD series engine I was running before (the one that now features  
the big hole in it) was rated fo 67hp (-at-)4200rpm and 101ft-lb of torque  
(-at-)3000rpm and had 7.3:1 compression. It seems to me that the source of  
this power is the 8.2:1 compression.  I know it definitely likes to  
run fast on the highway.  I am thinking that water injection and/or  
high-octane fuel could be a good idea to help haul my bus across the  
blue ridge mountains with this motor. Would it be worth the trouble  
to hook up an oil temperature gauge?

Also, does anyone know where I can find plans for an LED bar-graph  
tachometer? My "Dream Dash" includes a tach and a CHT gauge fitted  
into the right pod where the clock would go.  A tach made with a  
string of about 20 LED lights running the between the CHT and the  
edge of the pod would fit nicely and meet my needs. With blue LEDs to  
1000rpm, green LED's through to 3600rpm, yellow to 4200 and red to  
5400, it would open up a slot under the radio where I could fit the  
oil temp gauge. Since there's a digital clock in my MP3-player radio  
I'd have all my dashboard info needs covered.


Happy Trails,
