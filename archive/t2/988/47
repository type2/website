Subject: i got a call back from sirius radio and i gave them my demands

so roger from the promotions department called my asking my demands about
using my bus for 6 weeks to spread the word on the new grateful dead station
for sirius radio to be released this summer.

all insurance will be covered by sirius radio

only one driver will  drive my vw between the mph of 60-65 on the highway in
the first lane of the highway

he also told me since i have 4 radios on sirius radio he would give me 4
lifetime services

as far as money goes i told him i would like 6000 for the 6 weeks they will be
using it

i am giving them 3000 miles and anything over that will be 15 cents for
additional millege

after i told him my demands he told me that it was fair what i was asking
rogers boss wasn't in so he is going to call me early in the week wil the
answer well i will keep everyone posted take care


sincerely sam
