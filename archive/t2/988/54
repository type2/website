Valve noise should occur generally once in 4 engine
revolutions (or once on open & a second time on
closing - similar sounds maybe)

Loose rod noise should occur every revolution and
possibly noisier every 4th. -BaH

 Anyone know the difference between throwing a valve

 throwing a rod engine noise? Bus, 1979, overheated

 with a loud noise which seems to be on the passenger
  side. Thanks for any 
 help.
