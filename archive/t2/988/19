Subject: RE: [T2] Torsion Bar Adjustment

I believe what that refers to is: When you have the
vehicles weight off the suspension, the arm (the flat
steel piec that goe from the torsion bar to the wheel)
is perched upon a small ledge that is the limiter to
keep it within range. Loosen the bolts on the end of
the torsion bar tube and pry the arm out over that
ledge (Be sure there is nothing in the way like an
ankle!) I use a big screwdriver. -BaH

 The Haynes manual talks about using a tyre lever to
 relieve residual tension
 in the torsion bar.  After a quick search on the
 internet it looks like this
 tool is used to remove tires from wheels.  Anyone
 had experience with a tyre
 lever or other tools used to relieve the torsion bar
 tension?
