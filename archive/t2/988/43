It's been eating that bug for so many years, a bus
would last forever!

I had never seen it prior to about a year ago and set
off in search of it. I was at such an angle that I
couldn't see it and I asked several joggers where it
was. They had never heard of it and suspected I might
be crazy or worse!

BTW - Trend Micro Systems flashed a bunch of
"dangerous website" warnings at me when I followed
your link. They said the danger was spyware. Just a
heads-up. -BaH

 about it today.  Wonder
 if it eats buses?
