Hi Kevin,

Mine was doing the same thing last year, not too long before it quit.  
If the alternator is more than 8 years old, I'd suggest to not waste $ 
$$ on a gauge, just get the alternator rebuilt. I had a 70A  
alternator rebuilt last year by a local shop for about $125... They  
cleaned it up and rewound the armature, replaced the diode pack and  
the bearings. it looks like new and works perfectly.


Happy Trails,
