Inner and outer.  One has 40 splines, the other 44.  If you move the 40
spline end one notch clockwise and the 44 spline end one notch
counterclockwise the net rotation of the spring plate is 0.81 degrees
clockwise.  That's how you get the fine adjustment needed.  If you simply
turn it one spline it goes 8 or 9 degrees at a time.

Remember, the bus is a bit front-high when it is sitting static.  If on
level ground, the sliding door sill should be level with 240 pounds in
the driver's seat.  Many people think that their bus is sagging when it in
fact is fine.
