Subject: Re: theorerectially looking for hypthesis(dropped exhaust

finally removed the #4 intake pushrod tube and then quite easily slid
out the lifter.  right out.  right in.  right out again.  easy.  so i
went back to the #4 exhaust lifter.  she, yes, she,  wouldn't slide
out past a certain point.  seemed to stop just before the square hole
in the bore that i guess is for oil.  pushed it back but she still
stopped just before the square hole.  i could spin the lifter in the
bore if i pushed her back just a fuzz.  if i pulled her to the point
at which she always stopped i could not spin her.  seems to indicate a
lip on the lifter.  dammit.  seems greg potts et.al. were right.
since these are brand new lifters bought and installed by a reputable
local rebuilder i suppose i'll contact them on tuesday when they open.
 anything else i should look at or check before i call them?  i'll
probably do as jrivers suggested and pull the #2 exhaust lifter to get
a look at the cam lobe.  that way i have a fuller picture of what may
or may not have happened.

thanks to everyone for the help.  if i said things like this list
rocks, i would definitely say this list rocks, but since i don't say
things like that, well, you know.

thanks.

jeremiah
