Subject: Re: [T2] not sure where to put this hose

dan asked:


 engine is 2.0L FI solid lifters from a 77 donor bus.  i put it into my 78 westy a few weeks ago.  i'm very
close to firing it up.  there are two hoses coming out of the charcoal canister.  on my other bus, which is a
78 with 78 parts, that hose goes to the tin that covers the side of the case.  the 77 tin has no such place
for this hose.  what should i do with the hose?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

On a 77, the cannister mounts on the gas tank wall to the left of the decel valve. The left end of the
cannister has a single large nipple. The hose from it goes to the left end of the fan housing.
