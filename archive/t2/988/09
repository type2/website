I just wanna know if you break down again, will Harleys stop to help now. :)
What a great idea! What fabrication was involved with this one?
I've been working on my '81 Westy. Just finished replacing the left rear brake line, due to TOTAL loss of fluid, while parked thank goodness, and then completed a brake job including - wheel cylinders, shoes, calipers and brake lines, and pads. Should be good for a few more miles. :)
Take care,
Phil
