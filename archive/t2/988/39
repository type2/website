Hi Jeremiah,

For a good test of your magnet, try pulling the #3 lifters and see  
how you do with them. In my experience they should slide out of the  
case pretty easily, there is no lip on them or the case. If the  
lifter doesn't come out of the case, it has been mushroomed by the  
cam, and the odds on either case or cam damage are pretty high.

Since you're in there already, try turning over the engine and watch/ 
measure the movement of the lifters; if there's a difference in the  
range of movement of a lifter then you'll *know* there is cam damage.  
If not, then you just have a lifter/case issue. Either way you're  
probably gonna have to split the case.


Happy Trails, (but sorry to bear bad tidings)

okay, pulled off the rockers and pulled out the pushrod tubes, then
inserted a magnet to pull out what should be a solid lifter in my 75
FI auto engine.  the lifter had some play but i could not remove it.
this was the #4 exhaust.  this is the one with the rocker arm with 1/4
inch play when i went to adjust the valves.  so, i checked the #4
intake.  same thing.  lifter had play but would not come out of the
pushrod tube.  do i need to keep on trying and jiggle the magnet to
try to lift the lifter over a lip at the end of the pushrod tube?
