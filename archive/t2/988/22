they will fit of you slice off the oval part above the "ear" where  
the exhaust stud mounts up. then you will have a home-made square  
port pipe. the surface area of the sealing area will be smaller than  
a true square port manifold, but the bolt-up will work. it is a bit  
of a half-assed solution, but people have been doing this for years  
to make a cheaper set of square-port heat exchangers, for a '79 bus  
for instance. take a pair of 72-74 HE, remove the oval part of the  
manifold pipe and you now have some one-year only 79 bus HE.
