It was same day for me. Dropped off in the morning, picked up in the
evening. Guy said to wait 24 hours before putting gas in it though.

The problem is that since there are no NEW tanks being available,
getting one from a yard may be no better than the one you have.
Relining at least gives you some confidence that the tank is good and
you can move on to other things.
