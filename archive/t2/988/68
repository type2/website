Greg,, you make some really thorough points!,, Lifters can really make a 
person worry the first time the hear them! 

Check lifters should come in the same process of adjust valves.. 

I can't think to say MAKE SURE THE LIFTERS are HARD ,, enough! 

but put overheat with noise.. ,, I still think anything short of a complete 
overhaul for that engine is doing an injustice. 

Laura may find a more economical method to get the bus running again.. 

If a valve seat has done piston damage,, the rod may be bent.. and the 
crank,,,  and one thing leads to another!
