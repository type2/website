Subject: fwd: [T2] alternator wire identification

Sorry, should have mentioned that the wire that runs up to 
the front for the indicator is already accomodated for.

I have a 78 westy and I am trying to identify a wire 
coming from the alternator.

There is a bundle of 4 wires that heads to the voltage 
regulator. Three of the wires go to the regulator, but one 
of them is loose with a connector on the end. Does anyone 
know what this wire is for? I thought it was for the aux 
battery relay, but it doesn't seem correct because it 
always has +12v, even when the car is not on.

Any ideas?
Mike
