Subject: F.I. throttle body part # 067C

78 Fed. F.I.
   
  I've been struggling with a non-idle problem for months. Will only idle with throttle plate held open manually.  It has everyone stumped, including 2 different very good shops.  Regular issues have all been addressed, vacuum leaks, compression, etc.
   
  The most current shop that has it states their last hope is that it may be the throttle body. I had already tried different ones, all numbered 022133067C, same result. 
   
  According to them, and to ETKA, the throttle body SHOULD be 022133061AK.  However, I have other F.I. buses here, 77, 78, and 79- all are running and all have the 067C throttle body. Looking in ETKA, I can't determine what year the 067C "actually" goes to. But, all my F.I. buses have the 067C throttle body and all the throttle bodies in my inventory are 067C. I've never seen an 061AK, which is what ETKA says should be on all these buses.  
   
  Anyone have a take on this, what your throttle body part # is, what years these numbers SHOULD fit, and whether it makes a difference or not?  I suspect it doesn't. I suspect they just think this is the problem because ETKA shows a different part #. I suspect ETKA may be wrong and I'm ready to tell them to just grind off some of the throttle plate to get it to idle!  Thanks, Chris
