Subject: RE: [T2] Steering Box rebuild

If it's a late-model bay, the seal in the gearbox can
be replaced (by you), if you can find the seal.

This is the part number I have from several years ago:
211415273A

Also, you can access the fill plug by removing the
collar at the base of the steering column. Make sure
it is filled almost to the top.  Use the same gear oil
as the manual transmission.


As long as the gear box works OK, it probably doesn't
need rebuilding (not sure you can rebuild the late bay
box anyway).

Can and has anyone rebuilt a steering box? I noticed a
lot of grease coming
out of mine when Duroc and I were attempting to get my
steering pin bushings
out (ug).
