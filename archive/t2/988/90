they all run great if your the seller, why do they want to sell.

who rebuilt the engine (GEX-be prepared to rebuild it is already life
expired) Boston Bob probably good for another 50-75k miles.

make sure they are C or D load rated, most vans seem to have car tires on
them,  these are unsafe.  check for weight range.  check library for tire
info,

with bearings and brake dragging I wouldn't take it on a trip.

where are you located, can you get someone on this list or who knows VW's
to go with you.  no 1971 VW is in "GOOD" condition, the question is, is it
worth what their asking to you, how much is it worth to you. what are your
skill levels etc etc.


. check front wheelwells, probably rusted out.
. check under bottom of windshield moulding, probably rusted, significant
repair
. under battery is probably rusted out.
. what is the engine code/on base of alternator pedestal
. check for good clean title.
. check serial number, does it match title?

Good luck
Bob
