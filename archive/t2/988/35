Chris -

This is why I keep the good ole microfiche machine around because ETKA only
shows what the REPLACEMENT item would/should usually be.  ETKA gives no
history like a good old style parts book and/or parts fiche.

From the Fiche, Throttle Body, Type 2 75-79, as originally equipped:

022 133 062P - 1975 Automatic
022 133 062Q - 1975 Manual Trans

022 133 061AH - Early 76 thru Eng# GD0010999
022 133 061AG - Late 76 fr Eng# GD0027786

022 133 061AK - 77 thru 1978, 1979 Federal Models

039 133 061E - 1979 California Models

Note - ETKA 6 or 7 doesn't even list what the replacement is in the first
place, so you must be using a real early version, like version 4 or 5.  ETKA
7 shows the 022133061AK was obsoleted December 31, 1993, with no superseded
replacement

Casting numbers are usually NOT the same as the part number.  The reason it
says 022133067C instead of, say 061C or even 061AK is that the 067 is the
base casting number of the ASSEMBLY.  Although not generally known, a lot of
pre-assembled items have individual VW numbers for each and every component
of the assembly.  The 022133067C is such a "component" number and in most
cases are not shown in the fiche/ETKA, sold or even in the VW price list.
But I happen to have a several page reference list in my library that shows
the 022133067C Casting was used for the finished 061AG and 061AK assemblies
as well as for the 1974 412 w/L-Jet FI

My buddy Cliff has a complete 77 engine under cover, complete with the FI
and I gave him a call to have him get the casting number off of the Throttle
Body Assembly.  He came back with the same thing - 022133067C.

So my edjumicated guess is that you have the correct Throttle Body Assembly,
but still no solution I can see for the moment :-(
