Subject: Steering Box rebuild

Can and has anyone rebuilt a steering box? I noticed a lot of grease coming
out of mine when Duroc and I were attempting to get my steering pin bushings
out (ug).

I see that they are on Bus Depot for a little over $200, but I still can't
help but think that they must be able to be rebuilt. It seems like a simple
enough machine...

Be gentle.
