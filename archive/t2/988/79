Used heads, reworked x many times for minimal cost.

They do. The intake fails because of a design flaw.

New heads are made by AMC.

Anyone else selling a "new head" for $200 that doesn't use an AMC casting which costs more to begin with is re-using the original factory casting. YMMV.

Oil temperature isn't going to tell you when the heads are overheating. Install a CHT sender until the spark plug and go by that gauge.
