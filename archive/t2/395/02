Subject: Re: [T2] Sunroof idea's for 71 bus

Rusty, I mean, this has got to be the way to go ! ! !

And it could be a lot of fun, and a great learning experience.

Even if you couldn't do it yourself, like me, there are PLENTY of high 
school auto shops that would LOVE the opportunity to excel!!  Just pay for 
the shop supplies, and promise to throw a christening party for the shop 
crew after it is completed!!     West Virginia, here I come ! ! !


[I can finagle, connive, and convince far better than I can brake the bead 
on a tire.]


With this kind of vehicle, you could then go to adds-on-wheels and get the 
monster wrapped in advertising vinyl and get paid to drive around town!!
