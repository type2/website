Hello Guys    I have 3 panels  my 59 is a walk thur , the 62 and 67 are bench 
types. Most of the bench types have the vents at the top in the rear. I have 
heard of one panel with the vents that was a walk thur, haven't seen it so I 
still don't know if it is true or not. Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
