Subject: Re: [T2] double relay question

Greg:

I didn't pull out my manual to read the testing process for the double relay
so I can't really comment on the results of your tests.  However, my
instinct is that a starting problem such as you describe is more likely to
be related to FI issues, e.g., thermo-time switch/cold start valve system
not working, fuel pressure problems or TempII sensor issues, rather than an
"electrical" problem.  I've had double relays fail and, in my experience,
when they fail, they fail at all temperatures.  Besides, you obviously *do*
get the engine started, eventually, when the engine is cold, otherwise you
wouldn't know it starts OK when warm :-).  Have you eliminated all the more
"obvious" issues?
