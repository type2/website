Hello,

I was able to get a really good deal on one of these
"ragtops" that was new in the box from one of our
favorite auction sights. The one I "won" is navy blue.
The construction seems to be good. The seller said he
has a one on his bus and it does not leak and he loves
it. It is quite large and you will have to cut a hole
in the roof. It came with instructions and everything
needed to install it. I have not installed it yet. The
engine and brakes comes first... They are a bit over
priced though :(

Have a great day!
