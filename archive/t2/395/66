i had one of the empi units. i liked the way it looked at first, but it
rusted to bits within 12k miles. they are very poorly made and the
mechanical design of where the welds are is terrible. luckily i bought it
from RMMW, and i was able to return it to them under their lifetime
guarantee policy.

i replaced it with a liestritz 72-74 style muffler and i am much happier. it
is quieter and there was no noticeable performance change, in fact if
anything the motor runs a bit cooler with the OEM muffler.

i have heard that the type IV mufflers made by ernst flow a bit better, but
good luck finding one, i've been looking for a year or so.

the single quiet pack and header combo made by S&S headers looks decent and
will not fall off in a year, but i doubt there is much of a performance
benefit.

there are NO performance exhausts for a type IV bus that cost less than
500.00, that i know of.

the copper gaskets are available at any VW mail-order place.
