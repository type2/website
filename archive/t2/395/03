Subject: Re: [T2] hot wire under dash...

Without seeing the wires my first guess is that this isn't good.  Try and
get under the dash and follow the wire back to the source.  I expect the
plastic covering has come loose somewhere, and a postive wire is somehow
grounding out against the chassis.

The best thing would be to remove the whole wire & get a look at it, if
possible.....

Regards,
Shawn.
