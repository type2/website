Subject: Re: [T2] Slip Streaming a Semi on I-95

Good subject matter--
And I can relate to all of this a former long haul driver--and a slip
streamer myself--

Two good stories on this subject--

First one--I'm on the way to Salina Ks. to see my Dad--in a yellow 73
bug ragtop--and I did have a CB it--
Anyway I'm sucking up on a 18 wheeler's ICC bumper--as he's flying at
80---and this is for miles--
He didn't care one bit--but brought one thing to my attention--
" Hey there pregnant roller skate--I don't care if your sucking
bumper--that`s OK-- we'll make good time wherever your going--but just
think of this--what if one of my caps on my trailer lets loose--you'll
be eating it"--
I backed off--just couldn't see eating a ribbon of a 10.00 x 20 cap at
80.

The second story is--and this is justice-

Three of my friends and I are out on the bikes one Sunday afternoon in
late fall---and the is dropping fast--out west on I-80--towards Iowa--we
have to beat feat home--about 100 miles back to the burb's of
Chicago---and it's geeting cold--and not one of us has any winter riding
gear on--just out leather jackets--

We're cruising east--and all of sudden a flying 18 wheeler blows past us
like we're standing still---here we go-- it's drafting time--it's warm
behind a truck---and all ya have to do is keep an eye on his tail
lights--at about 4 ft off his bumper.

Well---it was a memorable experience---
It was a Pig truck--WOW--it stunk like all holy hell--but it was
warm--and followed the guy within 20 miles of home--
GAG, COUGH, BLOOEY---

If you play ball with the trucker--he know's your there, and if ya know
what your doing--NO FEAR---

Fragrantly Yours,

Terry

And I have a brother-in-law and a son who are long haul truckers. You
overgeneralize, my friend. You might know of what you speak in your
family. Not in mine. The drivers in my family are courteous,
PROFESSIONAL drivers. One drives for Swift, the other for Mayflower.
  I've riden with both of them. You get a pretty good feel for what
kind of drivers they are after two weeks on the road.
They *are* profesionals. And slipstreaming makes them nervous. If you're
going to play that game, use your CB and ask the driver's permission.
Obligatory bus content: When they're in town, I think nothing of letting
them borrow the Riviera to unwind.

Before I get flamed, I've got friend whose family business is produce
brokering/shipping (think short time-frames) companies in Calfornia, so
I know of where I speak.
