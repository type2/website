Subject: Re: [T2] Slip Streaming a Semi on I-95

And I have a brother-in-law and a son who are long haul truckers.  You 
overgeneralize, my friend.  You might know of what you speak in your 
family. Not in mine. The drivers in my family are courteous, 
PROFESSIONAL drivers.  One drives for Swift, the other for Mayflower. 
 I've riden with both of them.  You get a pretty good feel for what kind 
of drivers they are after two weeks on the road.

They *are* profesionals.  And slipstreaming makes them nervous.  If 
you're going to play that game, use your CB and ask the driver's permission.

Obligatory bus content:  When they're in town, I think nothing of 
letting them borrow the Riviera to unwind.
