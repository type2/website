I'll chime in on this one as well.

Following a house trailer down the interstate many years ago in my 65 bug.

I could easily see under the trailer, but was not drafting or tailgating 
and some 6th sense said watch out!  About that time, one of the wheels 
came loose somewhere in the middle.

I swerved left just as the tire bounced out from under the trailer and
jumped about 50 feet in the air right where i would have been.  Watched it 
in the mirror as it followed the trailer, slowing down and still bouncing 
lower and lower....finally wobbled off to the right side of the road after 
a several hundred feet.

It can happen *any* time.

Still here, dave
