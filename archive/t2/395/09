Subject: Re: [T2] Sunroof idea's for 71 bus

Two station wagon sunroof panels (also SUV panels). If you are going to do 
some welding and hacking put a sunroof over the front seats and one over 
the rear seat. Fill in the stock opening with a nice section of station 
wagon roofing with ribs. Easy for an experienced metal and body man (or 
woman).

Buy power sunroofs for added convenience with a switch for the rear roof 
located on the dash and the near the rear seat.
