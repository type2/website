Subject: westy poptop latches?!?!?!

Hello Listees, me again.

My poptop rattles like you wouldn't believe at high speeds.....high speeds, 
har har har.

I noticed the rubber latches but they won't work becuase the bottoms of both 
have broken off. Are there after market ones available? What are they 
called? Has anyone replaced them?

Thanks!
