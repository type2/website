This is not true, Ihave owned a couple of 71 panel
vans that were walk throughs, Had a friend with a 71
double door panel with a walk through, and saw a 70
panel at a show last month that was a walk through.
These were all U.S. Spec and were original
walkthroughs, not modified. All of the double cabs
were bench seats though. I also recently had an 82
vanagon 9 seater which had a partition so late bays
probably did to.
Later,
