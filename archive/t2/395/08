Subject: ECU update

I cleaned off the ground wires that I know of again to try and get the EFI 
to spray gas when the engine was cranked.  Still no luck.
When I tested the ECU connector correctly with the test light on terminals 
10 to 5, 10 to 16 and 10 to 17 all light up properly.  And it flickers when 
engine cranked over and connect to terminal 1.
I still think I have a ground problem, if not I'm thinking I might need a 
new ECU as rare as those things go bad.

I crawled under the bus and checked the ground strap from the chasis to the 
transmission and it is ok.  The two wires (along with the switch/terminal) 
(for the reverse lights, I think) going to the front left side of the tranny 
are in pretty sad shape and I am going to replace it all.
Would this cause problems for the Fuel Injection?

My main question is:
Can somebody tell me where all of the ground wires for the electronic fuel 
injection are so that I can make sure I check them all?
(3 under air intake, one to neg terminal of solenoid, and where else???)

Thanks again,

p.s. I saw a Westy just like mine this morning on the way into town and I 
wanted to pull over, flag the guy down, shake his hand and go for a ride.
