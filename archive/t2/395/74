Oh well.. it was worth a try! heh.

Looks like I'll just install it on the motor itself.

Quick answer:  NO

Detailed answer:
Seat of the pants estimate of HP required to turn today's typical rotary 
compressor: 3 HP
Watts per HP: 746
Watts needed to turn compressor at 80% efficiency: 2797.5 watts
Amps needed from alternator (-at-) 13.8 volts: 202 amps
Typical amperage of a VW alternator: 45-75 amps (depending upon model)

Additional problem,
If I remember correctly, the laundry motors are no more than 1 HP at best.
