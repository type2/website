Thanks for everyone's input about the sunroof idea's. I appreciate them. I 
was curious to know if anybody can shine any light about the small European 
pop-up assemblies for bay windows. I believe these were part of the 
ASI/Riviera conversions. I'm wandering if ASI/Riviera used a standard 
sunroof model like Westfalia did or if they made their own custom cutouts 
for their pop-ups.

Thanks again everyone :)
