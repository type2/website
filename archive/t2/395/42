Subject: RE: [T2] Natural Bus route info

I am heading from Norfolk va, and Mark Dearing recommended from I64 take
rt29 to rt130 and that way I will not hit any mtns.I have never gone this
way but I will this trip and I trust Mark on this too.

The 501 out of Lynchburg is a very slow drive, very windy, LOTSA hills and
trucks too....I have travelled this road many times, its fun, but I81 would
be a
faster route for sure.

Lynchburg to the 81 is about an hour taking the 501, FWIW.
