Subject: Re: [T2] classic info needed

> just quick question as everytime i call i cant get ahold of anyone.. but are
 they letting bay windows into the classic this year ?

They always have for the past 6 years I have gone.
Perhaps you mean the OCTO show on Saturday?  That is 67 and back only. They do let bays into the swap section
along the back wall, but otherwise we have to park in the north forty......
