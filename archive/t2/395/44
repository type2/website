Dave,

Make them.

Grind the heads of stainless carrage bolts to fit the slots--make the
"T" bolt.

Or use mild steel ones--whatever--

Anyone know where I can find the bolts that hold down the rear seat in a
regular bus or a westy? They are the ones that a re kind of t-shaped and
slide into a slotted bracket on the floor in the rear. There are 2 of
them. Mine are rusted bad. I've looked through a few catalog's and
websites and can't seem to find them. My local hardware store didnt have
any. 
Thanks,
