> 81 

Hello Guys and Dolls   For you guys coming from the south,central Carolinas 
take rt 29 to Lunchbag(Lynchburg) Go to the far side of town and take rt 130 to 
glassgow then Natural bridge station. Same for the Northern Va group come 
down rt 29 to rt 130. Very good road bus friendly, very few trucks. For those 
coming up I 81 you can get on Rt 11 and run right beside the interstate just 
ingnore the signs that have I81 and rt 11 together cause that just puts you back 
on I 81, Yes there are way too many trucks going way too fast on I 81.  Looking 
forward to one of the best campouts yet and getting to see everybody.  <A HREF="www.naturalbus.com">
