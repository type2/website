Subject: Re: [T2] hot wire under dash...

"Without seeing the wires my first guess is that this isn't good.  Try and
get under the dash and follow the wire back to the source."

My advice as well, except...  If the wire is connected to a load(light, 
gauge, switch), then it may be heat exhibited when the current encounters 
resistance across the circuit.  Wires that supply large amounts of current 
will become warm.  If the wire is 'hot', then the 'load' in the circuit may 
be drawing more current than the wire can comfortably supply.  Add the 
resistance that corrosion adds to a 30+ year-old wire, and you've got 'new 
wire time'.  Also, make sure that the item drawing power doesn't need 
rebuilding or replacement.
