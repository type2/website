Yep, those things can really fly!  Consider that the top of the tire is
travelling forward at twice the speed of the vehicle.  If the truck is
going 65, the alligator will be flying forward at 130!.  Add this to the
speed of your bus going south (55) and you can get an impact speed of
185mph!

The onset of warm weather seems to bring with it a general loosening of
retreads.  On one 400 mile trip a week ago I saw three vehicles at the
side of the road disabled by separated treads.  The treads are not
uncommon, but seeing the vehicles that lost them is rather rare.
