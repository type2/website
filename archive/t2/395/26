Subject: Re: [T2] Sunroof idea's for 71 bus

sorry just dropped in and these is where i came in at just to say of and idea of mine that i have seen before but cant remember when...

I want to take a bug and cut it from the bottoms of the windows and have it welded to the inside of the top of my bus...

Thought it would be cool that way ,
since the transporter has sleeping quarters and all now anyways,,...

why not one more up top and only if that bug had a sunroof in it as well..
sorry this probadly didnt have anything to do with what you were asking...

to eliminate my high top.

You know some people prefer high tops.  Why not look for a sun-roof,
pop-top or hard-top model to trade for?
