Take a real good look at your front hinges. More than likely the center pivot is shot and totally loose. Look
at the round tubes and see if they are bent. The 68-72 front hinges were cheapo frail aluminum arrangements.
VW finally got smart in 73 and made them out of steel flat stock like the 74 and up rear hinges. [the 73
hinges are one-year-only, 74 and up rear hinges will not fit on the front]

> I noticed the rubber latches but they won't work becuase the bottoms of both have broken off. Are there
after market ones available? What are they
 called? Has anyone replaced them?

www.busdepot.com has them

They are called "poptop hold-down, 64-73 Westfalia" and are on the camper page section of 68-71 buses.
