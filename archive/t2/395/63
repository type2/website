Subject: Jackstands warning again - - - consequences

 From a friend:

<snip>

I know this has been discussed in length but with a subject like this I don't
think you can remind folks enough.
I got a call last evening to inform me that a friend of mine had been killed
by being crushed by his car. He had jacked the car up to change oil, the jack
gave way as he was under it and crushed him to death. So here is a man who I
had been friends with since childhood now gone due to not using jackstands.
The sad thing is that it could have been so easily prevented. I have lost a
friend but his two young kids have lost a dad.
Please folks, I know we have mentioned it before, but please DO NOT EVER get
under a car without jackstands - NEVER. I do not like burying people -
especially my friends. Hopefully this tragedy will cause someone to go invest
in some jackstands today.
