Hey, Stan, I just pulled that 3 mile figure up from the tips of my fingers 
(this IS a family list, right!!)


My wife totaled her '89 Honda Accord just 7 houses from home.  In a 25 MPH 
residential zone, and at 2:30 in the afternoon.

My daughter was coming home on the school bus from elementary school, and 
the school bus could not go any further because of the fire engine and 
ambulance.  When my daughter got off the school bus, she saw the car and her 
mother in a stretcher, covered to the neck in a white sheet.  Jenna had to 
go with mom to the emergency room, in the ambulance.

This was less than a block away from home.

Mom could not keep awake, and lost it..  She almost hit a mother and infant 
who were waiting for the school bus for another child.

Mom came over a rise, but didn't turn the wheel.  The curve had her going 
over a huge boulder on the other side of the road, coming down nose first 
and digging the front of the Accord into the soft grass.

Digging into the grass, she swerved and went into the center brick post of a 
double car garage, taking out that center, and both garage doors.  If she 
hit the corner of the garage instead of the center, the second floor of the 
house would have collapsed on her.

So I guess this and all of the accidents the family experienced in the past 
5 years (like, 5 accidents!!) that were our fault were within just a few 
miles of home.


(There were some 'acts of God', but you can't count those, right.  I mean, 
God can strike most anywhere..)
