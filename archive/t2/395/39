Subject: Re: [T2] Sunroof idea's for 71 bus

Hello all,

I'm thinking of removing the pop-top of my 78 westfalia and instead
installing a sliding ragtop over the whole length of the pop-up hole (behind
drivers seat to the back). I saw this conversion once, and it was very
decent work. Must be great to sleep in the bus in summer with the whole roof
open to the stars... Unfortunately I could not talk to the owner to get some
information about this.
But I think there are some proplems to solve:
Is the bus still structural stable? For the ragtop to be curved like the
roof, there need to be some plastic/metal stripes sewed into the canvas.
What about the front end of the ragtop? There should be some windshield and
a very strong connection bus<->ragtop. What happens if you drive with both
front windows open (lots of air pressure in the bus), will the ragtop just
pop off?
Right now, this is just an interesting idea for me, but please feel free to
comment. And if the owner of the bus with the mentioned conversion is on the
list (british 76 ex-westfalia, color blue and white) please email me.

Thanks

Timo
