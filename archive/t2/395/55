I know the top you're talking about. I remember them back when the cars 
were still on the road around here but they must have gone to the crusher 
directly because I've never seem one in the yards. I've got a late 50's 
Beetle ragtop in my '65 Beetle. It is far from complete. Hopefully it will 
be as nice as I think it will be.

I REALLY like the full length ragtops that replace the rear window as well. 
When I'm richer in another lifetime.

If I had a steel top bus I'd seriously consider a sunroof be it steel or 
"rag". Seriously consider it before I did any cutting too! <grin>
