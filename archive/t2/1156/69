Hi David,

I'm looking at doing the same for my 74. Unless you want to get exotic
and try to survey the junkyards for an OEM VW bus AC setup, it's an
easy commodity job from any decent AC shop.

I'm going to go for the dual head type - one under the dash and one
hanging from the ceiling behind the rear seat blowing forward.

Again, these are all commodity parts. Just pick out the head/s you
like on display at the shop or from their catalog and they will make
the hoses to length and fabricate a mount for the compressor.

John
