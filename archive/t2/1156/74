I think they are great .... Totally great ... We do not have near enough
if them IMO. I think it is completely stupid to sit in front of a traffic
light at 3 in the morning when there are no cars coming from any direction
and just wait for a light to turn green.

I did grow up with a couple bad ones in Halifax - but the ones in Portugal
and amazing ... Totally efficient ... Maybe its about knowing how to use
them.

Finally we got a couple here in eastern Ontario .. But I hope for more ...
