Subject: RE: [T2] Importing to the US

I saw two right-hand drive vehicles yesterday ... one was a smallish car ..
can't imagine why someone would import it .. the other was a 70's (I'm
guessing) beautiful Land Rover ... painted this sort of cream colour ...
beautiful ...

I bet I've seen at least 5 right-hand drive vehicles in the past year ...
there was a bus in Peterborough I saw early this spring ... a Dormobile ...
bit on the rough side but basically solid ....
