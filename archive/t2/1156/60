the 412 fuel injection is a different style than that used in the bus so 
you either have to use the 412 fuel injection or completely change it over 
when you put it in a bus, but you would already have the bus FI  system so 
it is not that big a deal.
but the FI systems are different and not compatible,  I think the bus FI 
is a better system (I once owned a 412) and have had a 412 engine in my 
bus for a period of time.  they work fine except for the FI changeover
