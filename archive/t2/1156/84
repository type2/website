Subject: RE: [T2] AC for 69 kombi

Im in the same boat. Before i install my overhead.ac, i am doing rust repair and repainting the top half of my 68 bus. I sent my windows out to be tinted before i reinstall them. i am going with 35  on the front two, 20 in the rear, and a special almost completely clear tint on the windshield.  The windshield tint is unnoticable, but it blocks out  almost all of the radient heat. On a different note, i found that my defroster  grid was toast so.im going to replace it with a new clear view defroster grid.Then i will have it tinted.  i will keep the list posted of the results.
