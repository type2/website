Subject: Sliding door seal problem

So I was feeling adventurous today after I was able to replace the
pushrod tube seals with little difficulty I decided to replace the
door seal on my '75.

I bought a seal from BusDepot a few years back and had it sitting
around taunting me.

Got the door off, old seal removed had three sides of the new seal
done and then I found a twist in my seal.

There is a 360 degree twist and I have tried several permutations and
manipulations but cannot for the life of me figure out how it could
have happened or how to get it out.

I pulled it fresh from the bag so its not like its been bouncing
around in the back of the bus for a few years.....

Anyone experienced this problem or did I get a bad seal?
