Maryland classes the deluxe with windows etc like mine as a car
Maryland classes the campers as "multi purpose vehicles" and "may" not tax 
them as harshly
Maryland classes the single cabs, double cabs and ones without rear 
windows as trucks.  they do get chicken taxed for sure.


of course based on age you "Could" possibly get Heritage or even Antique 
tags but MD has some real tight restrictions on how much you can drive em.

1977 and newer get smogged they do not have a rolling sunset, although it 
is real easy to get the older ones smogged.  heck they have to get a 
supervisor everytime I've taken mine down because the old buses don't have 
enough digits in the serial number for the computer to accept it.  and it 
only gets a gas cap check (if they can find the adapter) and a tail pipe 
sniff.

again YMMV and I do reccomend a local agent.
