I LOVE roundabouts. I first "discovered" them in Italy when I was 
stationed there. Suddenly most of the four way intersections and traffic 
lights I grew up with in Tn seemed old fashioned. My current town has a 
semi-roundabout near the university. For months a few locals would run 
through the interesection and bash the curb destroying their front 
suspensions. It also caught a few drunk drivers.

My town SO badly needs a traffic redesign. Takes forever to drive just a 
few short miles b/c when you get through one light there is another one 
waiting for you already red just another street away. On the rare 
occasion I hit multiple green lights I know either the day is going to 
be wonderful or I've used up all my luck for the day... GRIN!
