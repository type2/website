Hi Bob,

That's true, and it reminded me of 2 other little details.

1. There are case breathers on the 411/412 heads that need to be capped 
off or sealed up. I have seen it done both ways; the last time I had my 
engine out I filled the 1/2" holes with JB weld, and it's been fine ever 
since.

2. The AE series type4 engine is VERY high compression and isn't really 
suitable for a bus, particularly for long-range travels. If you ever use 
one of these engines in a bus I'd strongly recommend shimming the 
cylinders to drop the compression. My engine originally gave 180-210 psi 
when first acquired, but on a sustained highway trip I melted the rings 
off of the #1 and #2 pistons. Subsequently I refreshed it and used shims 
to drop compression back to 125psi. It's run fine for about 20,000 miles 
since then, including a bunch of marathon 16 hour days.


Happy Trails,
