RHD in the USA just keeps you out of the drive-thru. YAY!

I drove a RHD vehicle several times when I lived in Italy (they drive on 
the right side of road like us). Not a big deal.

Gate security checks and drive-thru aren't much fun unless you've got a 
passenger or a good E-brake to hold the bus while you move over to the 
left side to deal with the guard or drive-thru in the rain.

I suspect the import would be pretty simple. Possibly adding sealed beam 
headlights and a MPH speedometer. Emissions were probably similar to the 
USA then. You're going to need to probably pay to have it certified. 
Keep your UK parts, at least in my state (TN) you can then reinstall 
them and nobody is going to care at all. I run H4 headlights and Bosch 
500 driving lights. Nobody cares. No emissions checks in my part of the 
state either.

Plenty of info on the web. Goodthing too b/c when i was questioning 
bringing back a number of European vehicles from Italy I got all sorts 
of different stories to go with all sorts of different prices.

I would like to know what it costs to move a vehicle over the Atlantic 
ocean now. My "ultimate" roadtrip would be our Westfalia on a 6 month 
tour of Europe and the UK.
