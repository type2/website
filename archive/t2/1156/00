Hi Josh,

RHD would be a PITA in the US, and I'd expect the resale value would suffer.

Exactly what would be required to legalize your import will vary 
depending on the state and county you emigrate to, but in any case it's 
pretty certain that the price of a good bus there will be cheaper than 
in the UK.


Happy Trails,
