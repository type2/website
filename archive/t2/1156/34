The POWER of the Internet!!!! GRIN!

Seriously I've heard of people having successes ordering Euro or 
Japanese market parts from their USA VW and Honda dealers. They parts 
guy probably won't have a clue but if you can provide a part number, 
you're golden. I bought an original bumper cover for my CR-V after my 
wife bumped a truck in traffic with our CR-V. The seller bought a 
Japanese style bumper cover for his CR-V through his dealer.

It's  shame that the Chicken Tax persists after all these years and a 
shame that VW doesn't pull a Dodge Sprinter trick and build us some vans 
here from VW Euro parts. Chattanooga eventually? I'd still like to have 
a late model Eurovan style poptop to go with our baywindow Westy.

I'd still like to see unified European and American safety and air regs 
so we consumers could buy whatever we want to. The regs are probably 
very close these days as it is. Let any vehicle that is certified in 
Europe sell here and vice versa. Probably just a way for gov'ts to 
quietly have protectionist trade policies for their home vehicles. Still 
- GM and Ford could sell their smaller vehicles here more easily too.
