 I am not sure if you can help me, but if you know we would really appreciate
 the help.

Hi,

Welcome to the list. This is a pretty open-ended question. We should
probably know more about how close to the family or how far afield you
are willing to go.

By US specs, 1978 models had all evolved to 2 liter Type 4 engines. To
get the same engine you can use 2 liter engines from the 1976 to 1979.

You can also probably get away with a 2 liter air-cooled engine from a
1980-1983 Vanagon though the crankcase breather setup is a bit
different. Others on the list would have to chime on other differences
to factor in on that choice.

You can also stay in the Type 4 engine family by going back in time to
earlier, smaller capacity versions of the same engine, the 1800 (from
1974-75) or 1700 (1972-74).

Prior to that, buses used the Type 1 (Beetle, etc) engine. While not
recommended for the 1978 because of the higher gear ratios in the
transaxle, it can be done. The engine tin is different, but others
have reported success in either obtaining the correct tin or
fabricating solutions from sheet rubber, etc. Your fuel injection and
other engine accessories will not be compatible with this engine, so
you want a complete turnkey engine pull. If you get an engine that is
not from a bus, you will need an adaptor plate for the engine hanger
at the oil pump.

From here you can get more exotic by going into other engine types.
You can stay in the VW family group with air-cooled Porsche engines.
These will be bolt-on solutions, but with adaptors, virtually every
conceivable small engine on the market can and have been installed in
VW buses.

Good luck,

John
