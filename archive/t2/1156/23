He doesn't have a Westy.  He has a conversion of the likes I've never seen.

It's incredibly unique and one of the best campers (from what I can tell from
the pictures) I've seen based on the VW bus.  Plus, he's owned it for years
and it is a "known quantity".

Plus, I think it is strange that anyone on this list wouldn't understand
illogical sentiment attached to a VW Bus!
