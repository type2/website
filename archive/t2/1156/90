Subject: Re: PICT 30 Carburetor Question

Thanks Jim for the VERY helpful history. I was surprised at the very
high quality of the carb and operation and a little befuddled where it
sat in the PICT legacy.

Furthermore I was on the edge about using one of my best "034" SVDA
distributors with the motor.
The motor runs like crap with the 009 it came in with, runs pretty
good with the "035" SVA i had lurking around, and runs flat wonderful
with a scoop of ice cream with the "034" SVDA dizzy controlling the
spark.

Is there any "safety net" so-to-speak with timing the "034" with the
PICT -2-3? Or should the standard 7.5 BTDC applicable at 5400 + feet
altitude?
