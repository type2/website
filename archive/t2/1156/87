Hi John,

I am thinking they were used on the bearer bar; to hold the brackets 
that the motor mounts are attached to.

That'd be my guess.


Also, if you can read this via the list then it looks like I may have 
found a work-around for the spam-bot that we all loath so much. OK, 
maybe not everybody but I know Access Bob doesn't love it.

Just convert the quotes from > to + or =. It's a quick change in most 
email editors and it will help preserve context when responding in depth.


Happy Trails,
