I brought mine in thru the port of Baltimore and the local agent 
"Hobbleman" was great but still took several days to get it thru the 
paperwork.  the price was based on size, max length/width.  height was not 
really an issue within pretty big limits, like 14ft or something  they 
didn't care how much junque I piled in the car so long as it didn't make 
it longer or wider.  although on the docks and at sea it is pretty much a 
target I wouldn't put anything of real value in there but spare parts etc.
I shipped from mainland Europe thru port of Rotterdam so the UK may be 
different.  was shipped on Atlantic Container Lines roll on roll off 
(RoRo) ship so it was never lifted off it's wheels.

the sea trip pretty much destroyed the battery for some reason though..

it may also be easier/cheaper to ship it in a container. although you are 
then responsible I think for securement (lots and lots of styrofoam 
peanuts)

good luck
Bob
