Yah,, I dunno Greg... it seems there is a LOT of RHD in this town..  low
milage japanese cars with RHD seem to get a pretty good price on resale..
and from what I hear,, they buy low, import process isn't that much, or that
hard,, and to some degree.. it has caused a stir in the gubbermint... to the
point there was talk of banning them. check google for RHD ban ontario..

as for the USA... I dunno..
