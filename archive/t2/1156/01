Subject: Re: [T2] Importing to the US

I disagree on the PITA part.  He would get used to it plus the novelty of
having a RHD vehicle in the US would fetch a premium if he were to sell it.
I drove RHD Range Rovers in Afghanistan where, at least on base, they drive
on the right side of the road.  Off base...they drive wherever :-).
