Hi

I moved to Stuttgart Germany this past April from Woodbridge Va, and
roundabouts seem to be popping up everywhere.  When I left back in 1990 there
wasn't one to be found any where as I remember.  As for me I liked them once I
got use to them, but now I am driving them with a VW Golf, I think they would
be more fun with a bus... :(

"How about where you live?  What has
been your colonial experience with 
roundabouts and what are negative comments
made by their detractors?"
