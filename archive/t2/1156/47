Subject: Re: [T2] [non-T2] Roundabouts

I'm in Maryland where they have become relatively popular with our State
Highway Administration (SHA).  You'll be happy to see them around Baltimore
used at exit/entrances to major highways from large arterial routes.

There is a large development just outside Brunswick Maryland (near the WV
border) that essentially doubled the population of the town.  All of the
intersections between the main road and this new development are traffic
circles (I believe 3 of them).

Personally, I'm a fan for several reasons, and the more people get exposed to
them the better they end up working.  I remember driving from my sisters house
in Clacton on Sea to Colchester (in Essex, UK) without hitting a single
traffic light.  Brilliant!

I've spent many miles on a bicycle, but I've had very few interactions with
traffic circles in Anne Arundel County.  I find that since traffic (generally)
slows down to negotiate the circle, it is easier to take up the traffic lane
on your bike, which IMHO is the safest way to negotiate intersections.  You
are much more visible that way, and you can ride very close to the speed of
the vehicular traffic.

p.s.  Yes, those roundabouts are still in southern Maryland, specifically
southern AA County.
