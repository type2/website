Subject: re camping in bus- bed improvement

Hi, owner of t"The Moldy Twinky" here, which went 250,000 mi before 
needing any rebuild due really to low oil pressure and seals blowing 
oil. It has a 74 full width bedseat in front of stock rear cabinet.
We used 2" polyfoam mats we made sewn covers for and put them on top of 
the vw beds to make it softer and cover the seams.  A narrower mat is 
for an extra bed I made for our daughter when she outgrew the cot and 
fits next to the sink cabinet. It all carries up above with the orig bed 
never folded back.  The bed base board (1/2" ply) has screw in pipe legs 
to make a table out of it.  Nyssa has her own bus now and we use that 
narrow mat below on the lower bed as it hides the gaps of the seatbed 
and keep the board for a table.  It also fits in a tent with a 
thermarest airmat slipped in under the foam.
Note when the bus is loaded for travel one could nap/sleep on the rear 
bedseat with the mat set up as a tube to cushion the sleeper from the 
sink cabinet.  Pics avalable on request, as my Geocites site went 
bye-bye with geocities.
