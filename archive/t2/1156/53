Subject: Oregon Highway 31 from Ca. border to La Pine

My wife and I have the option of going up the 97 through Klamath Falls
(boring, done it a bazillion times), or the sight unseen Highway 31 which
looks very appealing. Would love to hear from listees that have been this way,
and the pros and cons of it? I will be leaving from Reno, and will be driving
my *ahem* new M*zd* 3 Sport. The 77 westie is getting new calipers and shoes,
so couldn't join us this trip. ;-) I therefore am not worried about climbing
power.
Many thanks in advance,
Courtney
