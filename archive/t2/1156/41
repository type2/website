Subject: Re: [T2] re:camping using the bus vs working on the bus...

The bus is not a bad place not only to camp in but to live in.  I have been 
living in my '70 westy the last three months, and before that spent six 
months last year driving and living in her. Over the last 18 months I've 
logged more than 20,000 miles, from Canada to Florida several times, and 
from the east coast out the southwest and back and am out here again, with 
visits to the great plains states thrown in

Right now I'm on a mountain 14 miles northwest of Taos, NM, and at night I 
can see fires burning near Los Alamos. The bus is packed up and ready to go. 
Tomorrow I head south on a 300-mile trip from here to Truth or Consequences, 
NM, where I hope to settle in for a while.  After 20,000 miles it's time to 
do a little maintenance besides oil changes and valves. Like maybe points 
and plugs and adjust the brakes.

The only mechanical problem I have had over this long period of time was a 
leaky left rear wheel cylinder which of course also meant new brake shoes. I 
had the parts shipped to Colorado from Bus Depot and did the repairs while 
camping at a National Park.

The bus has been a trooper, but like me it is getting old. Still I sleep 
well in it.  It is my home.
