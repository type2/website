Assuming you are taking 395 up through Altruas, CA.  I can't speak for
31 personally but I did just do a trip down to klamath falls and on a
day trip went out to some obsidian mines north of Altruas.  395 north
is an interesting road.  Nothing crazy but your basic two lane highway
with some nice views of goose lake.

Agreed 97 is weak sauce.

love to know how 31 turns out.
