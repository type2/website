Subject: rear end rubbing noise

Well I've been trying to figure out a weird noise on my rear end. I was
thinking rear bearings or CV joints, or brake pads rubbing somewhere. I took
the rear drum off again, and took another look at things. See picture on the
samba - www.thesamba.com/vw/forum/album_page.php?pic_id=824441 

 

It looks like the drum is rubbing on the bottom, and the pads or something
have worn two holes and the beginning of a third hole in the backing plate. 

 

Some background info on this 1969 singlecab. I know the PO had installed
lowering brackets on my bus, which I have since removed. The top mount of
the rear shock on this side had come off and been whacking around for a
bit(but this was a while ago). While investigating around here, I have
realized that the CV joints need to have their  boots replaced. 

 

What would cause this, and what should I do to repair it, or prevent further
damage.

 

Thanks for any tips on this.
