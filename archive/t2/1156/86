Hi John,

I usually add oil from the upper hatch, as I have the heater box booster 
fan across the top rear of the engine compartment blocking access from 
the rear hatch.

I find it best to add oil through the case breather. I have found it 
fills best using a 1L bottle of oil with my thumb sealing the spout 
until I get the bottle in position over the breather hole.

Happy Trails,
