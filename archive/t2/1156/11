Thank you, everyone for all the info.

That has put some things straight for me, especially whether I need to worry 
about EPA.

As for the inconvenience of driving a RHD bus on US roads...well our previous 
bus was a LHD '76 Spanish import here on UK roads.
So putting a RHD on US roads will have had me driven every sort of combination 
possible!  I don't imagine I'll be doing a lot of passing anyways.
Working as a part-time mail carrier sounds interesting as well.

As for local regulations, I'll have to check out what Maryland requires as 
that's our home of record.  So if we go the import route we'll come through the 
Port of Balitmore.

The Autostadt West website was helpful as well.
I did not realize the Chicken Tax was still in effect!
I suppose I cannot personally reclassify my camper as a passenger vehicle?

I suppose the tax might not be bad depending on how much I value the vehicle.
Then again, the point was made about how that would affect insurance and resale 
value.

Resale value is hard to compare against how well this bus suits us.
I know I can resell for more than we bought her for here in the UK and use that 
money to buy a tidy bus in the US.
Prices for Bays here have gone to silly money and Vanagons are on the rise as 
well.

I'll have to make some enquiries when it's getting closer to moving time.

I suppose I can always salvage the Viking roof and interior and just graft those 
onto a donor bus in the US...
