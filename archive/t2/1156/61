If you are just building it of course, you can machine the filler/dipstick
location and choose to keep the upper dipstick or not.  And a Vanagon dipstick
makes for a way to check the upper location from the engine hatch easily if
you do choose to go that way.  How is it to pour oil in the top though Greg,
do you use the engine hatch or the interior hatch?
 
Of course to the OP I will note, finding a 411/412 or even a 914 compared to
finding a bus is getting pretty tough, but Greg is right, you never know.
 
Obvious note as well of course along the lines, air cooled Vanagon engine is a
fine swap as well if you get some '79 exchangers, drill out the motor mounts
for the M10's (or helicoil the M10's down to M8's), and block off or keep dual
dipsticks.  Could bolt Bus heads on it of course but chances of having good
bus heads with a dead bottom end seems slim.

Along with other years of bus engines, I'd mention that the 411/412 series of
VWs and the Porsche 914 also have type4 engines that easily can be used in a
bus. There are some sacrifices with the oil filler and dipstick location but
the engine is certainly usable; I have had a 412 motor in my bus for a couple
years now.
