Subject: [non-T2] Roundabouts

Not bus content, but more along the lines of traffic engineering and road craft.

Here's an interesting article from the BBC on roundabout uptake in the US.

Check out the video as well. Nice Yes soundtrack and the mayor of Carmel, IN 
seems clued-in as well.

I remember seeing a few new roundabouts in Southern MD before we moved to the UK 
in 2007.
I though of them more as a novelty then.  However after being in the UK since 
then, I have found them indispensable.
Traffic would grind to a halt without them in some towns, cities, and major 
intersections.

How about where you live?  What has been your colonial experience with 
roundabouts and what are negative comments made by their detractors?

Are any of you cyclists that have to negotiate them?  Are your safety needs 
provided for in the design?

Note:  Do not not confuse roundabouts with the massively awkward traffic circles 
(e.g. Columbus Circle in NYC).
