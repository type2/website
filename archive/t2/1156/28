JnOK,

Thanks for the frank advice.  I don't mind your advice against my idea as we, as 
a family, really need to consider all angles before we decide what to do.
My initial assumption was that in terms of money, time, and effort, that import 
back to the US would not be worth it.
In terms of all three it still isn't, but it looks like it is not as bad with 
all the info given by the list members.
The jury's still out for us.

Ideally we'd find a complete Viking roof here and graft it onto solid US Bay 
window bus with an Eberspacher heater.
(sidebar:  Will an Eberspacher run overnight with a 85 A-hr lesiure battery?)

I know some folks over here have done that with a Westy base and Viking top. 
 Some call it the ultimate conversion and I could see that.

Greg U,

Wow, didn't think I'd see a Vanangon Viking in the US!  Much less a 1.6 
aircooled (engine code "CT") one.
If you thought a 1600 air-cooled bay was slow...
And it's in (s)Lower Deleware!  I could sell our Viking in the UK, then buy that 
with plenty of spare cash for a party with bushels of crabs and corn!
WIn-win!

That would be such awesome camper with a load of TLC!  Hate to see Viking go to 
waste.
