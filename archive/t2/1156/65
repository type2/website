Subject: loose jalousie

Ive got the jalousie louvered windows off my 74 bus to redo the seals.
Checking them out during disassembly, many of the  pivots seem very
loose and I wonder if anyone knows of a way to fix or replace these
pivots and thus keep the windows from rattling too much. The pivots
look like press rivets.

Thanks,
Scott Busby
