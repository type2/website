I'm sure I'm preaching to the choir here....

When I purchased our bus it had a 009 distributor.
Today I just got my second-hand Bosch SVDA distributor installed in my 1600 
twin-port bus.

What a revelation.  I had gotten used to driving with the 009, but this is night 
and day.
Things I've noticed since it's been installed:
	* I don't have to play racebus driver anymore on my commute to work.
	* My dodgy 3rd-gear synchro ain't much of a problem anymore.
	* Hills are greeted with glee now.
	* There's now a whole new middle region of the throttle pedal travel that does 
something now.
	* Warm-up periods don't have the bus stuttering all over the place.
	* My cholesterol is lower.
	* My hair is thicker and fuller.
	* My sex life is better.
	* I now have a genuine Bosch paperweight.
