Subject: Friday topic, ID this bolt? M8x1.0 x 25mm

So over the last week I have finally been unpacking all of the garage
finally after 4 years in AK.
 
Lots of boxes of VW parts, and sorting lots of hardware.  Every time I part a
VW I strip tons of just plain hardware, nuts, bolts, trim screws, all of it. 
Already have tons of it in bins, but of course, boxes on boxes have random
unsorted bits laying in the bottoms.  Still I never ever have to go find
metric hardware, and I know the quality is good.  Furthermore I can even
usually match vintage and head markings if I need a bolt for a project.
 
So this is the odd bit, I mean I can usually recall the purpose of an odder VW
bolt on sight from Bus, Vanagon,  EV, A1 or A2 VW.  But I have found scores of
these bolts in several locations, probably got 30 of them.  M8 bolts, but FINE
(1.0) pitch, 25mm (1 inch) long,  and 10.9 grade.  For the life of me I don't
know WTF these are from.  Could be non Bus/Van/EV related but I've parted far
more transporters than FWD VW's over the years.   Initially I thought ring
gear or something, but oddly they all have metric style metal lock nuts (ends
crimped a bit) and  serrated high grade lock washers with them as well.  If I
had only a few of them, I'd write off my forgetfull ignorance, but it is funny
because I have scores of them, and they came from like I said, many boxes of
many vintages.
 
It is times like this that I miss Karl, he would have known.
 
Anybody got a clue?  Yeah not that engaging of a topic, but hell it's Friday.
 
John
