And our Westies are safer than the UK version why? RHD doesn't make that 
much difference safety wise. Tried it. Not a big deal. The rest of the 
safety package is nearly identical to our US-spec Westies - right? (If 
I'm missing me, teach me something I didn't know. Seriously).

I'm not being snarky here nor am I implying you are either. Just 
conversation with a smile.

Financially - it's whatever floats the owner's boat so to speak. Owning 
a 70s aircooled VW product doesn't make much financial sense but all of 
us here do. If that particularly Westy is really important to them 
(history = if he restored it, an old family car, etc) then perhaps the 
$2K in shipping charges would be worth it. And the $2K shipping charges 
to possibly return it someday to the UK.

I have a Beetle and a Westy. The Beetle was my car through a big portion 
of my time in the Navy and Italy. I proposed to my wife in the Westfalia 
in the Smokey Mtns once upon a time 15 years ago. We're a sentimental 
mess her and I. Both vehicles have dry storage so they aren't aging badly.

Strictly logically and financially speaking I ought to sell all four of 
our cars - two daily drivers and our two aircooled VWs - and then buy 
one very late model commuter car that gets 40+ mpg and needs no 
maintenance except a wash but we won't. GRIN! (Just doing it to bug my 
Mom who doesn't get it after all these years... Just kidding!)

Ciao amici!
