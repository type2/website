open the windows and enjoy the view....
yes I've been there and the humidity is horrbile but the engine just 
doesn't have it to run AC reliably for any length of time in those hostile 
conditions.

even with a 2liter engine from a later bus and a new rotary compressor you 
would still be working that engine hard.  and I would absolutely put in 
some temp gauges on the engine so you know just how hard you are working 
it.

wish I had a good answer would love to add AC to my bus
