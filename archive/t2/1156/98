I emailed David seperately but figured I'd share with the list.  Of course on
a 1600 upright  first and foremost I suggest not to do so at all...   But for
all you considering, not that the T4 has a lot more power or cooling
reserve...  The Eurovan rear A/C unit is an extremely nice compact R134 unit
with 3 speed fan.  They come out easily (behind R rear trim panel) and can be
easily ducted.  Probably best for under rear seat application.  I have
installed these in a couple guys street rods.  I have considered strongly in
the '77 doing an under back seat install then back ducting into the factory
heater tube to remove the dealer installed "COOL" under dash unit which I
consider an inferior pain.
 
Also when looking for under dash units in yards if you choose that route, the
DPD unit is significantly nicer, has significantly more airlow than the VW
unit, so if you can find one do so.  Also DPD condensors usually are heavily
louver shielded with heavy fans compared to the "COOL" setup often using some
expanded metal over the core with little else.
 
Anyway the EV unit makes a very nice yard pull, same function as a $250+
generic street rod setup but I've pulled em for as little as $15 at yards,
give em a thought.
 
As I mentioned to David, don't reinvent the wheel though, I presume ICE still
makes setups for the upright, and they are/were nice but pricey.  I see now
they are into a lot of vehicles but still list VW applications

like on display at the shop or from their catalog and they will make
the hoses to length and fabricate a mount for the compressor.
