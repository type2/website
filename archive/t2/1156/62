Hi John,
           I find the roundabouts in Anchorage to be a great step forward.
IMHO their main purpose is to cut down the plague of red light running so
prevalent up here.  Particularly by overloaded, gravel trucks.  Big time
problem here.  Lots of folks killed.  No red lights = no red lights to run.  
If you charge the in-circle traffic and miss the gap, they come through your
(offending driver) door =  excellent deterrent. Even the cell phone junkies
understand that part. Red light runners go nose first into the cross traffic
drivers door = no pain to the offender but a good way to kill the innocent
party =no deterrent.  I have seen tiny roundabouts as traffic calming in
Seattle/Everett (I'm sure they are common in WA), and never understood them. 
Trucks cannot get past by going around, and have to drive straight across.
Some of them are so flat that aggressive car drivers can straight-line them
too. The ones I know in ANC are big enough,
 and also with kerbs and enough relief in the center, that any straight-lining
would flip the truck.  Probably the only deterrent to these folk. Tickets
don't seem to have any effect.   Slow learners will be weeded out, or come up
to speed.  I'm all for roundabouts.

also of ignorance on the design side to even try.
