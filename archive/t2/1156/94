Subject: Brake lights no worky

Hi everyone, 78 bus with brake booster
My brake lights do not work, here is what i have tried.
Checkd bulbs, good
Checked grounds to bulbs, good
Checked all fuses, good
Tried just stomping on brake pedal, nothing
Rapped on switches on booster, nothing
Used a test light, while tool box is on brake pedal, i unplugged both plugs
from the booster and jumped the connectors on the plugs, test light came on
for all 3 but the lights did not light up
Plugged the forward plug back on and used test light from 2nd switch to its
plug , but did not get anything..
Anyone? Bad switch or 2?
Joe
