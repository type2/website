I saw a RHD drive long wheel base Toyota Landcruiser from the 70s here 
in town. Aussie plates on front (we aren't required to have a state 
license plate up front so you can run whatever you like). Also saw a 
Fiat Multipla in Nashville recently. That's a 90s car! Didn't think it 
was old enough to be here. Couldn't see if it had Euro-plates on the 
back or TN plates.
