Well, as being from UK and living in CA for 30+ yrs - I do have some  
experience - and right now drivers in CA are much too fast for any  
drive to be easy. But I do see one advantage - the RHD will make it  
easier to move into the slow lanes! Why add more stress to one's  
driving?

The roads here are not like the narrow winding ones of rural England.
Westies  _are_  commanding ridiculously hi prices in UK.
He says he is coming to MD?   With his name. is he from there - in  
which case he knows all these problems.

I did say it was IMO for goodness sake!  It is just that no one is  
discouraging this guy.

and I am keeping my own 71 purely out of love for it - but I know  
there are other Westies out there that could command the same feeling.
