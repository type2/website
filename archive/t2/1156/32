well inspite of the fuel guzzling problem I dedicided I couldn't wait any 
longer.   putzed with the spare AFM and got it up to 11mpg so hauled out 
of Baltimore last Sunday using all secondary roads drove up to the 
delaware water gap and stayed at the Taylor Campground (great place) 
in Blairstown NJ just south of the Del water gap and 
spent basically a week camping in the van alone.  rained 3 of 6 days but 
needed the break and did have a very good time.

bus besides getting only 11mpg bus behaved like a champ up and back...only 
200miles each way.  slept like a baby, must be something about communing 
with my bus...  still have the exhaust leak to take care of but have parts 
just need time....
