Oddly Alaska has gotten a bug up their rear for them recently, as I heard it
there was federal money to encourage their installation in place of otherwise
controlled (signals) intersections.  Perhaps the reaston for their
proliferations recently.  Being that they don't require power or
maintenance, they should then be very sensible for slightly remote locations
with lower population density.  They have just installed one at a major
intersection about 2 miles from my house, 8 months on, old folks are still
either getting trapped in it, or blatantly ignoring yield procedures (OK not
just old folks ignoring yielding but you get the idea.)  I'm just waiting for
the first fatalities.  In this case I think it is beyond foolish, a great idea
but you can't teach an old dog...
 
The average AK driver, just doesn't get em unless they grew up in the
northeastern US where there are quite a few.  A sign of our ingnorance, but
also of ignorance on the design side to even try.

How about where you live?  What has been your colonial experience with
roundabouts and what are negative comments made by their detractors?
