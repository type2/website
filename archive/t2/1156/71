Very nice road, just drove the southern  part of it last week and cut 
off northward at Fort Rock where I eventually drove past VW Ranch.  The 
Rand McNally is fine for Rt 31 in this area, but not so good for some of 
the back roads, there are roads they show that aren't even close to what 
is on the ground.
