Subject: Re: [T2] PICT 30 Carburetor Question

The 30PICT-2-3 was manufactured by Tomco Carburetors in Japan in the
1980s.  It is essentially a 30PICT-3.  This was perhaps the first of
the Far Eastern reproductions of the time and very well made, east to
set up and adjust.  Production only lasted for a few years.  It still
shares the shortcomings of the German one in that the throttle shaft
bores do wear out after continued use.  30+ years later, I'm sure it's
showing it's age.  The current Universal Carb Rebuild Kits are
compatible for this carburetor (I've done it).

I had one on my 69 Hardtop Camper back in the mid 1980s.  Worked very well.
