I actually found the breathers useful. I first plugged them too, but
had oil control problems like I did on my mild-build 1776 before I
installed a breather system, so I had to unplug them again and install
the same kind of Bug Pack breather box that I put on the 1776. No oil
problems after that. I think they put them in because of cam overlap
on the intake/exhaust valves. When I first put the 1776 on the road, I
attributed the oil problem to rings needing break-in, but when I put
the breather on, no more problem. Same on the Type 4.

I didn't see AE at Tuna Can - http://www.tunacan.net/t4/reference/case.htm

I wonder if you meant EA. It looks logical since it produces 80
horsepower compared to 60-ish on the standard 1700.
