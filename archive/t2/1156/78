Right. I'm in the same boat waiting for funds too. My friend running a
T1 got the dual head unit installation for $800, so I plan to find out
what shop he used and take a trip when I'm ready. I'm still in final
prep for paint stages now.

I use the LM-1 tailpipe adapter. I think it cost me about $15 on that
auction site. The HO2 sensor screws into it, and then you clamp the
adapter into the tailpipe.
