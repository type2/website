I remember the Halifax  MICMAC rotary blues they used to sing on the evening
news ,,the segway, just before they showed the carnage of the day,, another
collision on the Micmac rotary [roundabout] ... some folks just didn't get
how to drive in that circle... it was huge!

I wish I could find written yield procedures ,,, I thought I was taught a
yeild was basically todays stop[tional] signs,, you sort of brake, slow,
ensure it is safe to roll thru, and then carry on.
The circle jerks [lol] around here seem to speed up to slingshot thru the
circles.. or sort of freight train thru,, as one road will have the majority
of traffic,, the cross road entering the circle will never get a chance to
enter,, as the "freight train" just keeps coming from that other side...
sigh,,,

Wow.. jug handles eh?   that is an eye opener... I am not sure if I have
ever driven thru , around on a jug handle,, but I do remember being
confoooosed about having to keep right, to make a left turn a few time!! lol
....

The waterloo region here in southern ontario canada has a huge preference
for the traffic circles, roundabouts, rotary intersections,, are there other
names for it,,?

we have one that is a 45gal drum for the entire center of the circle,, they
had to use smaller signs because the cars were hitting them..
news cameras don't even get set up to film oddities,, people who drive left
in the circle , or straight thru the center, the ones that are sort of
flat.. not the one with the drum!  I wish a big truck would just "barrel"
thru and over that one! hahah...
I do like the circles tho..  just not that one... it is really just a
neighborhood traffic calming device that doesnt' work well.

So,, they are using a teaching campaign with a DANCE...

lot of interesting comments on that page.

it is interesting to signal left when entering the circle.. even tho you are
turning right ,, but intending to exit on the left.
