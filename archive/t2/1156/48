Subject: RE: [T2] [non-T2] Roundabouts

There have been two that I've run across in the Augusta, GA area, and both
are well-suited to VW bus traffic because you can't go faster than 10 to 15
mph around them.

The diameters are so small that I can't see how tractor trailers get through
them at all.  You couldn't fit a couple of signs, let alone a fountain and
sidewalks in the middle of them.

If they'd just made them a little larger, say another 20', so you could go
15 to 25 mph around them, it would be better.  A 30' addition to the
diameter and a top speed of 30 mph would be even better.

I didn't know that the European model of traffic circles was being
introduced here in the States.  It explains a lot.

Not bus content, but more along the lines of traffic engineering and road
craft.

Here's an interesting article from the BBC on roundabout uptake in the US.
