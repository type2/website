In the 90s we Navy guys were allowed to ship one car to Europe and one 
car back. No necessarily the same car but the car coming back we had to 
own for I think 6 months prior to the ship date. Free. In Naples there 
wasn't alot of organization so the option to ship a second car back on 
my own dime involved finding "this guy who knew somebody". That <insert 
diesty of your choice> for the Internet. Today we can hunt down our own 
info and likely check them out too. My time there was pre-Internet/

I brought back a '65 Beetle. Originally sold in TN. I'm from TN. (Cue: 
It's a small world after all, it's a small world after all...)

I left behind a Fiat 500 and a VW Rabbit 'vert. The 'vert netted me 
twice what it was worth here. The 500 I should have packed up with my 
furniture. They price closer to $10K now. Then I got it for free. DUH! 
It was kind of rusty but not a lost cause. I'd LOVE to have another 500.
