Hi Volks,

Along with other years of bus engines, I'd mention that the 411/412 
series of VWs and the Porsche 914 also have type4 engines that easily 
can be used in a bus. There are some sacrifices with the oil filler and 
dipstick location but the engine is certainly usable; I have had a 412 
motor in my bus for a couple years now.


Happy Trails,
