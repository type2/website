I'll second epoxying the panels into place. I would not this to a 
structural part but for a battery tray absoleutely.

I would trim back the old tray until you had a lip of the original tray 
left and then place the new tray on top of the old tray.

In between them put a good layer of epoxy body adhesive. It has to be 
bare metal on both sides of the joint so I would smear the epoxy over 
all bare metal surfaces had epoxy covering them and then place them 
together and clamp. Might even use a few pop rivets to pull them together.

Do alot of dry fitting first.

I was very wary of this epoxy body adhesive but patched my VW Cabrio 
floors with it and two years later they are still strong, no leaks and 
no rust.

Overlap from the inside. New panel goes on top of the remnants of the 
old panel. Try all the rust away.

I got my epoxy gun (like a big caulking gun) and the epoxy at a local 
auto body supply store. I live in a small town so I'm sure your local 
stores can get it too. Don't cheap out.

Like other posters have said - coat everything well with quality rust 
proofing and paint.
