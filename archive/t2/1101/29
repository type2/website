Subject: ready to move

Today I had a good day of working on the bus. No more electrical problem; she's running. Now to make it road worthy as she need to be moved tomorrow.

Started with installing the oil temp sensor from the old engine, which of course required an oil (20-50) & filter (Mann) change, might as well check the screen while I'm here. Next, pulled the muffler and manifolds 'cause I wanted to make sure everything was seated and  tightened. While I've got the damn heat exchangers off (I hate these things, anyone wanna trade for them?) I figure this is a good time to pop the head covers and set the valves since this engine is new to me. Once I figure out the PO's timing marks, and verify with the factory marks on the impeller, I set the gaps to .006. It looks like the PO had set to .006in/.008ex; but the Porsche sites said .006/.006 for the 1700, so I went with that. Put the covers, exchangers and muffler back on and start her up. ..and start her up ... ok third times a charm, there we go. Warm it up and reset the timing and dink with the carbs a bit, I know I still don't have this right but take her for a test
 drive anyway. 

First thing, the brakes are not happy. 2nd, it still stalls if I don't keep my foot reving it; stalls at speed when I go into neutral or try to downshift; when in the driveway, it stalls when I rev the engine and release it. 3rd, I noticed that too-high-of-a-gear sound from the engine (a rattly glug glug) going into 2nd and 3rd gear, hmm. So I go back and tinker a bit more with the carbs; happier but still don't think it's great but I pretty much leave it at that.

25 mile drive down I-5 tomorrow. Wish me luck.
