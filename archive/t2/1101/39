	Some similarities, yes.
	The diagrams in that URL fail to show how the rings are located.
	There are some differences.  Our Tornado. muffler had the 
discs filling the lumen of the shell, except for the radial 2 - 3 mm 
slots and the 3mm gap all around the outside of each disc.  This 
HyperTrapp. seems to have no gap around the outside; the gases 
apparently pass along the middle  ...  And I fail to see that the 
gases are much nudged to form a vortex as they pass along  ...

	If some graphics demon can easily (as I sure can't) do a 
draft sketch and send it direct to me, I'd be happy to comment and 
the next iteration would probably be pretty near the original Vortex 
Muffler.  I can read CorelDraw, and any PDF  ...

thanx
