Subject: Re: [T2] Throttle part question

Chandler -

Basically, it's a Throttle Body Tension Spring.  Never sold separately by
Volkswagen, you had to buy the whole Throttle Body as an assembly from
Volkswagen - NOT CHEEP.  Today's ETKA shows it in the illustration
(Illustration 18-20, #9), but this item was obsoleted a long, long time ago
in a galaxy far, far away, so no part numbers exist in the text, so that's
not much help.  I'll have to dig into my ancient parts fiche reference to
properly ID it.  But if memory serves, it was used on Late 76-78 Buses and
79 Federal Buses (79 California Buses used a different Throttle Body
Assembly).

I'll get back with better info on Wednesday after digging thru the fiche.
No "print" version of the Parts Book existed for the Type 2 after 1974 when
they converted to fiche, so it makes it difficult to properly ID stuff
unless you have the fiche and reader - something I never threw away :-)
