Hi Daniel,

Upgrading your 1.8L to 2L will require new crank, rods, pistons and 
cylinders. You can keep the case, cam, and heads. Some will say you need 
a new cam to go to hydraulics but many have managed the swap without it. 
Buying a rebuilt 2L would probably cost the same price or less. You will 
also want to rejet the carbs to compensate for the larger displacement.

The 1.8L motor will fit just fine into the 73 transmission. You can swap 
the flywheel from the 1.7 without a problem. IIRC the 1.8L engine may 
have longer transmission studs than the 1.7 has but that's about the 
only difference. You will find the archives at type2.com have plenty of 
details on transmission swaps.

Happy Trails,

  I am getting ready to attempt my first engine rebuild.  I have an
  1800cc donor from a 74 to go into by 73 which has most of the original
  1700 still running it.  The history of the engine is unknown.

  I have already disassembled the donor motor.  While I am cleaning and
  inspecting I am gathering my parts list and trying to come up with
  some sort of budget.

  If budget allows I would like to upgrade to 2000 and put in hydraulic 
lifters.

  Can I (or do I have to) use the 210mm flywheel out of my 1700cc
  current motor.  It has a new(er) clutch that I would like to reuse.

  Are there any issues with mating my 1800cc from the 74 to my 73 
transmission?

  Is there any reverence I  that explains the different flywheel,
  clutch, transmission compatibilities?
