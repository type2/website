I'm 98% sure that the TC door and surrounding metal are the same as a 
split.  Locks may vary a bit, but...   Gerson makes all of that for the 
splits, and Ronnie will probably ship it to the tundra... :)

The rear corners are the same, too, minus the missing reverse light 
cutout.  battery trays are pretty close...though they liked to change them 
every 6 weeks it seems like.   But a 12v 67 clamp down (vs strap down) 
should work fine even if the stampings aren't "correct" :)
