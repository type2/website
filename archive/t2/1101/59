Subject: re:'69 Single Cab Battery Tray, treasure doors?

Hey John,

 

Welcome to the SC club! I've got a '69 as well.

 

Those Treasure chest door locks are tough to come by. I have seen this guy
in the Phillippines on thesamba that supposedly has a NOS set, with keys. I
have emailed him numerous times, and not gotten any reply.

 

The PO of mine used engine latches for this area. It works, not great, it
takes a church key to open them. I would like to be able to lock it, as I
could then store my tools in there, with a little more security.
