Hey  Paul,

 

The backfiring is probably caused by a leak at the manifold? I'm not sure
how to test this, except to run the engine, and feel near the exhaust
manifold connections with your hands for air rushing out. I don't understand
what exactly is happening with backfiring, but if you have an exhaust
leak-it happens. Considering you just put the exhaust manifold on, maybe a
gasket did not sit correctly, or is not tight enough? Also check the gaskets
at the muffler. 

 

I don't think you should be getting any popping or flames from the heads.

 

If the engine is running on after shutting off-you have two issues.  One,
your carb should have a shut-off solenoid type doohickey on it, so when you
cut the power, it cuts the gas, and prevents dieseiling. This is either not
there, or not working. Then again, the fact that its purpose is absent,
helps to point out that something is not right. This could otherwise be
masked. 

 

I think poor timing causes the dieseling. I'm not sure beyond that-except to
figure out what your timing should be and what it actually is, and adjust
accordingly.

 

Good luck.
