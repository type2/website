Subject: '69 Single Cab Battery Tray, treasure doors?

So looks tentatively like I will be gaining the '69 SC, losing my Triumph
TR4A, which as I used it once the whole summer and as I'm too tall and too fat
for it, doesn't stress me too much.  Greg suggested Alan Schofield for metal
for the SC, which I have an email into, but anyone else know of US source for
a '69 battery tray, and for anything off the shelf as far as repair panels for
the treasure doors (only the R side needs lower skin (easy even to fab)) but
also needs the lower inner reinforcement (reasonable to fab, but hell if I
don't have to...))  Someone who will know, are these the same as splits
(treasure doors) and how about the battery tray, similar to '67 split?  Anyone
with a set of locks for the treasure doors hanging around they want to part
with?
 
Thanks
John
