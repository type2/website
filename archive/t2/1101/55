Any thoughts on improving drainage since these trays not only face the
usual challenges of hosting a battery, but also tend to fill with rain
water through the air intakes?

 Both trays were secured with Norton structural epoxy and I think this
is probably the best way to go. As strong as welded but with none of
the obvious draw backs.

 Both trays were then POR-15'd for spill protection and then painted.
I also installed an Optima 34R for a little more insurance and it
turned out to be a fabulous battery overall. It's a pity the price
went up so much after Katrina.
