Hi Courtney,

I find it takes about Half a gallon or less if you spray. 50% more if 
you use a brush and roller.

When I repainted a black car in bright yellow, I had to paint it with 
two coats of white first; then it took three coats of yellow to get the 
colour consistent. (spray job) But that was a rabbit vert, and I still 
have a little bit of yellow paint left over in the 1L can from that one.

Happy Trails,
