Hi John,

SC's are rare... that does make them more valuable. But there are limits.

I always recommend you set the price comparing what is offered against a 
complete running vehicle. Reduce the price according to what it would 
take to repair the vehicle offered to a similar condition. Don't forget 
to include charges for labour and storage fees for the time to completion.

If the seller is asking $4500 and it needs another $3,000 in work to 
become an $8K truck, then the price is not out of line. But if it needs 
$3K in work to be worth $6K, it's clearly priced too high.

A vehicle that needs tires, bodywork, paint, engine, and transmission, 
could potentially lead to loss of value even if it was "free to a good 
home".

Happy Trails,
