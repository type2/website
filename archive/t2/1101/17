Subject: Re: [T2] wide 5 wheels on a 71

MBZ wheels fit, sometimes requiring clearancing, I'm sure it is well dealt
with in the archives back from the very first days of vanagon(-at-)lenti (I recall
it.)  I've had the 15" alloys on a bay (came with the bay and sold with it,
don't know if anything had been done) and some of their 70s-80s alloys are
forged, and can take an incredible beating.  Recall they were often on 2-3 ton
cars, that were often used as taxi's, bulletproofed limos, etc.  Of course if
they crack, they crack, and it is over, whereas a good dent on a steel rim
sometimes still will run.  I had pmailed Chuck, 16" Eurovan steels may fit as
well, I have a set around but my bay is in the lower 48 still alas.  Same for
many 15" Audi steels and alloys from the big 5000CS/200s from the 80s and 100s
into the 90s.  But in all of this, ask yourself the intention.  A 27x8.5R14
can be just be massaged under a bay with a lift and some real work to the rear
fenderwells.  There aren't many 15
 or certainly 16" sizes in C-loaders that will be any bigger for offroading
and fit width wise either.  If a bit wider is the key 195 and 205 14's still
exist in C-loaders, but are becoming somewhat rare.  14" tires in general are
becoming rare, but there are still some early 90s Fords that want a 14" truck
tire at the moment at least.

Also, late 70's Mercedes used 15" steel wheels that supposedly have the same
bolt pattern as a late Bus. I have not confirmed this for myself yet, but I
have a set that I will try on my Bus this summer.
