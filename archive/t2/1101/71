Subject: Re: [T2] $50 dollar rustoleum/tremclad paint job pictures?

I found a rustoleum (may be Krylon, have to check) that is a VERY close
match to the original Turquoise of my crew cab. This is my no-mask, no-wash
first, paint job of almost 3 years old at the time of this pic last spring.
It's still holding up well colorwise, although the spots where I painted
over dirt have started to peel a bit...it looks great from 20 feet. I would
imagine with a little surface prep and masking you would have a good, solid
5-7 year paint job.
