On my 71, which has the exact same washer setup as the 72, I converted it  
to an electric washer pump.  That was the easy part.  Somewhat more  
difficult was converting the wiper/washer switch to operate the washer pump  
instead of releasing water from the pressurized reservoir as it was originally  
set up to do.  Basically, I removed the water valve from the back of the  
switch and replaced it with an electrical switch that is actuated by the long  
plastic rod the extends from the washer button part of the switch.  So, now  
I have reliable electric pump washer spray and completely retained the stock 
 appearance.
