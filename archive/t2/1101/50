I am also interested in the answer.

I found this on theSamba:

I may buy the busdepot.com battery tray for $25 and reuse the outer edge 
of the old tray so as not to mess up the outer body surface of the bus.  
One guy said he welded his from the bottom, that sounds like a good idea 
since it is easier to access than the top (at least with a welding 
helmet on).
