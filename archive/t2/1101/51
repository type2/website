When my bus bodywork was done, I bought two battery trays from Bus Depot. At the time (2003) all that was available was Genuine VW for the driver's side and Klokkerholm for the passenger's side but it was equally good:

Both trays were secured with Norton structural epoxy and I think this is probably the best way to go. As strong as welded but with none of the obvious draw backs.

Both trays were then POR-15'd for spill protection and then painted. I also installed an Optima 34R for a little more insurance and it turned out to be a fabulous battery overall. It's a pity the price went up so much after Katrina.
