Subject: Re: [T2] first time engine rebuild

My answer is just about engine size increase.

Crank and rods are NOT the same on 2000 and 1800 so increase is much of a 
job and parts seeking. (Well, same crank but rod journals machine 5 mm 
smaller in diameter and 2.5 mm offset)

Parts will fit on but you will end up with a low low compression ratio.

However, you may consider buying a "big bore" for a 1800 which will get you 
close to 1900 if I recall well.

About lifters, I put it a question of taste.

For some time, I was defending hydraulic. Now, I feel that mechanical is 
much cheaper for parts (specially lifters) so a good mechanical will be 
better than a worn hydraulic (cam). Cam has to be hydraulic type when 
lifters are.

Hope this can help in your decision.

I am about to refresh a 1800 and I had in mind to put a "big bore" for 2000 
but I will check about compression ratio and I guess it's gone a be too low.
