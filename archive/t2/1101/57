Subject: Battery tray for 71 bay

Last year I a link to a battery tray for about $14 - now it is up over 
$28.

does anyone have a link to something along the old price? or maybe just 
a piece of sheet metal would do the job?

also looking for a small part of the firewall - the left hand side 
place where an Espach heater used to go through.

thanks
