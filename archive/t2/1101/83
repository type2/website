On my 72 bay, that item does not have a pump  per se, it depended on
pressurizing the washer bottle with an air hose and that turned out to be a
pitiful plan, because nothing made of rubber will hold pressure after 38
years...
If the wipers won't turn on or they blow the fuse, try some Breakfree or WD40
on the wiper arms where they go through ...
