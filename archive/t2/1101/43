Subject: Throttle part question

    Can someone tell me the technical name of the round spring that sits under
the nut that connects the throttle body to the throttle cable?  I'm not an
engine person, or a VW person for that matter (not yet, that is) so I don't
know all the correct terms.  Basically it sits right above the bypass screw in
my 1978 type 4 engine and is short and squatty.
    I ask because my bus has been running rough, lots of hesitation, low
power, etc... and while troubleshooting noticed that spring had come undone.
I just re-attached it and my 3 minute test drive says that might have been the
problem.
    So, can someone tell me the name of that part, what it does, and if not
attached if it could cause those symptoms?  It's hard to search the archives
or elsewhere when you don't know the name of the part...

Thanks,
Chandler
