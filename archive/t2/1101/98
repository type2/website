Hello all! I have been lurking for quite some time now, but now have a new
bus in the family, and I am a little bit confused about the camper
conversion.

Being that I know a bit about Rivieras, and the information out there was
pretty easy to find (Thanks Jim A!) I find myself frustrated with the lack
of information on these high tops, as looking for the Adventurewagen/Safare
camper information has proved to be a lot harder. I have done the standard
google search and only found a couple small pieces of the puzzle.

Here is my new bus:

She is a May of 1971, her name is Rosie. Unfortunately was in a flood of
almost 6ft of water in the winter of 2007 in Vernonia, OR. The previous
owner had her since the late 70's (second owner) and put a lot into her, and
was devastated when she was flooded. Fortunately his son removed the bus
from the property and put an electric dehumidifier in her for a couple
months. The damage really wasn't as bad as i was expecting, the worst of it
is the spice rack cabinet on the fridge. Besides the mechanical work
(rebuild/replace all the brake components, specifically the booster,
calipers, and regular maintenance, tranny flush, engine flush, replace
intake boot seals, replace batteries, clean up a lot of wiring terminals,
windshield wiper motor rebuild, etc).

I am hoping that someone will know more information, as it seems that the
type2 website would benefit for more info and I might possibly put up some
information on the Riviera Registry website.

Thanks again everyone!
