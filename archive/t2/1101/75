Subject: Re: [T2] Battery tray for 71 bay

You can blame the Chinese for the increase in steel sheet metal prices for
the past few years because they're buying up the majority of raw steel.
I've seen these Battery Trays increase to as much as $36.95 at some
places because the dollar sucks against the Euro.  Right now the cheapest
price is Bus Depot (-at-) $22.95 but coupled with the shipping from PA ro CA,
your final cost will be in the $30 range.  Shoulda bought it last year and
the way trends are going, the price will keep going up if you keep waiting
to buy.

The left-hand firewall area will most likely have to be fabricated, no patch
repair panels I know of are available for that area.
