Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon antenna ... (woes)

Are they really hard to find today???  That is an adjustable ball antenna that
used to be $7 in every Autozone, Pep Boys, etc, probably $10 in NAPA and $5 in
Walmart at least into the early part of this decade.  But I haven't bought one
in 4 years probably (bought one at Walmart for my ancient RV for the cross
continent oddysey up to AK.)
 
I'd note that if someone installed one of these in the OEM Vanagon hole (does
an '82 have the OEM hole though I've had a couple 82's and don't recall
perhaps only if factory radio prepped?) an oval shaped thing on the drivers
side of the vehicle, I'd personally replace it with one of the correctly
angled VW ones that are (or I guess I should say were, been about 5 years
again since I've had the need) available from BD and others for $25 or so. 
They are I think like late bug (air cooled) antennas or something as the
stocker Vanagon were near $100, but the others mounted in the exact hole
correctly, just they didn't retract all the way to flush whereas the OEM
vanagon one did.  Still they are the right part and fit correctly compared to
the ball mount one, IF an '82 has the stock hole, and someone didn't buggger
it to install the ball mount.
