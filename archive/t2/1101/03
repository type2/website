Subject: first time engine rebuild

I am getting ready to attempt my first engine rebuild.  I have an
1800cc donor from a 74 to go into by 73 which has most of the original
1700 still running it.  The history of the engine is unknown.

I have already disassembled the donor motor.  While I am cleaning and
inspecting I am gathering my parts list and trying to come up with
some sort of budget.

If budget allows I would like to upgrade to 2000 and put in hydraulic lifters.

Can I (or do I have to) use the 210mm flywheel out of my 1700cc
current motor.  It has a new(er) clutch that I would like to reuse.

Are there any issues with mating my 1800cc from the 74 to my 73 transmission?

Is there any reverence I  that explains the different flywheel,
clutch, transmission compatibilities?

I will continue to peruse the archives and I am loaded with manuals,
but thanks to help from the list members

-Daniel
