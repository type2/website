Subject: Vanagon antenna ... (woes)

So the 82 is very close to being ready for paint .. It looks totally amazing
. only problem is he won't paint it until I can confirm I can get this
antenna . sooooooo here is a pic of the base . you'll see it sort of pivots
.. I think it is a very good style for the vanagon . it attaches to that
part of the front that is about 45 deg to the road . so with an antenna that
pivots you can run it straight up perpendicular to the road .. Or pivot it
more and have it parallel to the window . here is the base

anyone have a source for an antenna with this kind of base . I need it ASAP
.. Crappy tire has a similar sort of antenna but it only goes straight up .
so in that 45 deg piece of metal it would be on a 45 deg angle to the road .
it would NOT work.
