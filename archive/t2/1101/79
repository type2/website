Subject: windshielt washer switch is KAPUT ! HELP please !

Hi
I have trouble with a windowwasher swich of a 1972 VW Bay Bus. It is
the type which combines activation pump- button in the center and
windshield wiper  rotating switch and it is encased along with the
other round knobs on the dashboard.
What is the easiest way to get axess to those corrupt water lines in
order to replace them. I Have to disconnect the electrical jacks first
but then what ? how to get it out?
I am planning to separate water activation pump (or is it a check
valve ? the correct name of it ?) and put another switch for the wind
shield wiper to prevent future damage from immediate leak onto the
wires.

Any suggestions welcome !
Thank you in advance !
