Boy do we miss Karl von Salzen! He'd tell you the name and give you the part number and tell you if it was NLA. And probably some stuff about it you didn't want to know!  But I bet you could find it in one of Richard's diagrams on www.ratwell.com <http://www.ratwell.com>.  I'm too busy to dig through it myself at the moment.  Good luck...KR 


"Can someone tell me the technical name of the round spring that sits under
the nut that connects the throttle body to the throttle cable?"
