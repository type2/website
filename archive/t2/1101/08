Subject: parcel tray fabric

I bought this fabric for fixing an old parcel tray . it's white plastic mesh
stuff sort of with octagonal holes. Its very very close to the original
stuff although the holes are a tiny big smaller. I  bought a few metres of
the stuff and now I have enough left over for maybe 2 or 3 parcel trays. If
anyone would like some let me know .. I hate to throw the stuff away but I
do not need it and since I live in a garage space is at a premium . I'll
give you the fabric and I'll even pay for shipping if it is only a couple
bucks . if ya need the stuff let me know.
