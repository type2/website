Hi John,

Frank Condelli sells those. They aren't expensive; I think I paid about 
$15 for it.

They aren't very durable though. I lost one backing out of the cedars at 
Warsaw 2008 and its replacement broke about a month ago... it got 
whacked on the highway and when I stopped it was bent pretty bad and had 
a lot of feathers stuck to it.

It does have an adjustable angle as described.

Happy Trails,
