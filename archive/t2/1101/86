Hi Greg,

Just had to wish you guys the best at the True Canadian Winter Bus Campout
this weekend! Hope you have a great turn out and great weather. Wish I could
be there. Maybe this summer. We are talking about getting a group of Bus
Pilots from the Michigan area and doing a Carabus up to Bus Fusion for the
10 year anniversary. It would be a great time! Hopefully we can pull it
together. Have a great weekend!

 

Wishing you many miles of smiles in your Bus!

 

Todd J. Olson
