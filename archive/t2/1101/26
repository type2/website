Subject: Tried to explain!!

The other day I was out walking and spotted this nice '67 Beetle, with
a.."megaphone' on it...no muffler..just that!  Tried to explain that it was
prolly not 'good' for an aircooled motor, but then..got to thinking...what
harm..other than 'dialing' in the carb..did that 'megaphone' ..do?  With no
back pressure from the exhaust sytem, are the valves at harm?  Prolly 'revs'
above 4000 would make 'it' work,..so just thought I would ask 'pundits', re:
VW type 2 motors..what could  happen with this setup, since "type 2 motors"
are working on the same factors, and 'granted'  no 'sane' Type 2 owner would
run a Megaphone on the back of his bus...Hmm..guess I will just have to
walk..further!
