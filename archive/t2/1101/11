Subject: Re: [T2] first time engine rebuild

My thanks to all those who replied.

My goal is to rebuild then engine myself and keep the cost low.  Given
that, I believe I will keep it a stock 1800 configuration.  I do plan
on ordering the bug me video.  I am lucky enough to live near
Northwest Connecting Rod in Seattle so they will be a big help for any
machine work I need done.

I have already disabled the motor (keeping everything bagged and
labeled)  I think this will be fun.
