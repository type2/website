Subject: re:treasure doors?

Was writ:

"I'm 98% sure that the TC door and surrounding metal are the same as a 

split.  "

 

The metalwork is pretty similar, but the locking mechanism is different.  I
believe a lock for a baywindow has 3 screws, and a splittie has 4 screws, so
the configuration is different.

 

Was also writ:

"Being a newbie, and ignorant about the parts of our 1970 bus,,what and
where is the treasure chest?"

 

The treasure chest(TC) is the storage compartment under the bed of a
singlecab(pickup). It is  only on the single cabs and I think the double
cabs as well. Although I'm not sure if double cabs have TC doors on both
sides. I don't know why they would not have TC doors on both sides, except I
often see them advertised as "having TC doors on both sides" like that is a
extra great option.
