Hello Paul, first of all, you don't want to adjust carbs unless you know
the timing is correct. Incorrect timing can cause backfiring. While yor
checking your timing you might also want to check that it's getting full
advance at around 3000 rpm too. Note: The throttle positioner screw ( on
top of the arm the cable attaches to ) should be srewed in until it just
touches plus 1/2 turn. On a warmed up engine: adjust the idle with the
fat screw on side of carb. Next adjust running mix with the small screw,
turn in until it runs the fastest and then back out a little bit (
richer ). You may have to go back and forth to get this right, too fast
idle will make setting the mix impossible. Also: a loose or leaky
exhaust can cause backfiring, so can an aftermarket one with less back
pressure. You should only see blue flames if the exhaust is not mounted
and you are looking at an exhaust port. Like I said, check the timing
first! Hope this helps, Timo in Hawaii
