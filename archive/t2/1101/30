Hey Paul,

If those heat exchangers are sound I may be interested in buying them.   We
need heat here all but 4 months of the year.   Although I'm thousands of miles
east of you I have a close friend in Laguna Beach for shipping!   I'd need
pics to make sure they'll fit my UK '72 but I'm pretty sure they will as it
was built as a carb 1700.   That's if you weren't kidding around of course.

Sincerely

Ches
