Subject: $50 dollar rustoleum/tremclad paint job pictures?

I'm sure everyone has heard/seen the Rustoleum paint job threads here on the lists, and on the web, but has anyone who's actually done it posted pictures for us to see? I'd love to see some real-world pics on bays or vanagons, since summer is coming and I have at least 4 Vw's that might need a paintjob. :-)
