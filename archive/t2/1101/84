That article was a gas!  But I didn't realize how much more I need to 
buy.  I guess with tools and such you can never have too many.   The 
stuff about having two sets makes a lot of sense.  A good set and a 
cheap set.  There's always the one you know you have but can't lay your 
hands on when you need it.   But with my luck, I'd lose the good 
ones.    I should have been named Murphy.  :)   Thanks...KR
