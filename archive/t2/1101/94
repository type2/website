Subject: Steering column housing tube compatibility

I need to know what years the steering column housing is the same.

I found a 1970 in a boneyard, but this boneyard is part of a VW shop,  
so the bus is full of parts (and is missing the wheels).  Before I  
tear into this project, I need to be sure the part I'm after is the  
same for 1970 and 1971.

Thanks, esteemed list collective...
