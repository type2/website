Hi Volks,

I just checked the forecast and it looks like we are going to get PERFECT
weather for the True Canadian Winter Bus Campout this Saturday.

The prediction for the Valens, ON area from the Atmospheric Environment
Services division of Environment Canada is as follows:

   Friday night:
   Cloudy with 40 percent chance of flurries. Wind west 30 km/h
   becoming light early in the evening. Low minus 6.

   Saturday:
   A mix of sun and cloud. High plus 2.

   Sunday:
   A mix of sun and cloud. Low minus 9. High plus 2.

Please note that those are CELSIUS temps.

As far as I'm aware there won't be anyone camping there on Friday; not
officially at least. I plan to get there by noon on Saturday, find the
designated spot and get a fire lit. I talked to the park staff last week
and there isn't much snow, but there was a bit more snowfall this week so
it should be OK. Definitely not snowshoe conditions however.

There are buses converging from miles around in pretty much every
direction of the compass, so it promises to be a good gathering again this
year. Bring firewood if you can, and an ingredient for the Breakfast
Burritos on Sunday morning. You probably already know the drill for that,
if not then drop me a p-mail and I can make a suggestion for you.

I am */so/* looking forward to this, it's been a little too long since my
last bus campout. Hope to see you there!

Happy Trails,
