Hey, Todd!

It is Lake Effect snowing like crazy here in Indiana right now, but we are
ready for Bus BRR next week!  I have a bunch of handwarmers, some new boots,
and my shipment of La Gloria Cubana cigars came in last week.  Should go
good with the Famous Grouse scotch around the big bonfire.

Can't wait to ride the toboggans again and see the buses in the snow.
