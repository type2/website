Subject: Dual Relief/Oil Cooler Explanation

Hi All,

I am trying to explain to a friend how the dual relief case works in
conjunction with the oil cooler on a Type 1 motor.  I recall at some point
someone had a diagram of how the oil flowed when cold and hot.  Anyone seen
that or have a link to that diagram?

Thanks

Ray
