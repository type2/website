I haven't seen that type before. All the buses I have had used a wiper
control on the steering column.

The VW switches on the dash allow you to unscrew the knob by turning
counter-clockwise as usual. Then you are supposed to use a spanner
tool to remove the silver ring from the face of the switch, but most
people don't have this type of tool. You can improvise with something
like a needle-nose plier or a couple of slotted screwdrivers.

Once you remove the face ring you can withdraw the switch from the
back of the dashboard.
