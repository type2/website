Subject: was Electrical

Hey Volks! 
Electrical issue fixed (thanks all). Although I did find some corrosion around the starter wires to deal with later, the ground was the issue.

So I got the new engine started for the second time. Adjusted the clutch cable and made sure it'll go through the gears. And took her for a test run. Feels pretty good but I did notice a couple of things. 1st- it stalls when slowing/stopping or just when I put it in neutral while at speed; also stalls when I rev and release the engine in the driveway. 2nd- I notice a popping sound that I think is backfiring. I did have the engine started before putting on the exhaust manifolds and noticed the popping and flames from the heads. I know that some of this is normal but to what extent? I tried playing with the carbs and distributor timing but I don't think I made it better. 3rd- I also notice a run-on when shutting off the engine. 

My thought is that the mixture is to rich but does that explain the stalling? Uh, adjust the idle, then mixture, then timing?

Suggestions, please?!

Thanks again,
