Hi Courtney,

I did a headcount of the vehicles I have painted with enamel and there 
are at least seven in my past. I put some pics of them online for your 
perusal. None of them are show-winners but they are greatly improved 
from the "before" shots.

There's one notable bus in there that isn't mine, but I did influence 
the owner and it's interesting enough in that the owner has repainted it 
4 times in the last 8 years.

The key is to do good prep. Remove everything that can be removed. tape 
and cover everything else. Spraying is better than using a roller, but a 
brush and roller can get good enough results if you are careful, and 
there's less overspray. Spraying also uses a LOT less paint.

There are also different grades of enamel. Tremclad/rustoleum is your 
typical $25/gallon Walmart brand, and it works well enough for what it 
is, though there's not a lot of colours to choose from.

Since being hired by a national sign industry supply company in 2008 I 
have discovered there are better options in enamel out there. One-Shot 
brand sign-maker's enamel can be had for about $30/qt. Yes, it's 
expensive, but One-Shot has better pigments and a higher UV resistance 
than tremclad. It also flows better from a brush and has a higher 
surface tension to help prevent sags and orange-peel. It can be used as 
supplied with a brush and roller or thinned out and sprayed if you prefer.

If you are in a major Canadian city send me a p-mail and I can hook you 
up with our local branch office to buy some if you want. For those 
outside of Canada you'll need to use google to find a dealer. I am not 
on commission here, just trying to help make people aware of their options.


Happy Trails,

I'd love to see some real-world pics on bays or vanagons, since summer is coming and I have at least 4 Vw's that might need a paintjob. :-)
