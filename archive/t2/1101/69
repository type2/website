Split and Bay DCs don't have treasure chests, gas tank is sitting there where
one could be.
 
Vanagon DCs do though, small ones, with doors on both sides of most.  And your
cool Jadwagen (sp?) came with a slide out locker to put your firearms (long
guns) for the hunt mounted inside it.
 
The single treasure door (passenger side) is mostly how split SCs are, most
bay SCs have doors on both sides (I'd never seen one without actually until I
got up here to AK and two local club members have SC bays with apparently
factory passenger side doors only,) someone more cognisant than me would know
when in the split times the doors on both became more common, my guess would
be '65 or so, but I'm speaking out of my ass totally on that.  Perhaps both
sides was always available in splits, but if so early on it was damn rare
which is why people would advertise it proudly.

The treasure chest(TC) is the storage compartment under the bed of a
singlecab(pickup). It is  only on the single cabs and I think the double
cabs as well. Although I'm not sure if double cabs have TC doors on both
sides. I don't know why they would not have TC doors on both sides, except I
often see them advertised as "having TC doors on both sides" like that is a
extra great option.
