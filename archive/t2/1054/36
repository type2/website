Subject: Jumpy timing...

So, here's the situation:

Brand new (ok, a few hundred miles now) mexican type1 longblock.   Distr.
drive gear not installed by me (the block was owned by someone else first,
but never fired).

With both a brand new chinese 009 w/ points, AND a brand new mexican 034
(aka SVDA) with pertronix, the timing is really jumpy.

2-5 degrees of bounce at idle, 10 degrees of bounce at full advance.

Same with and without vac. line attached to the 034.


Any ideas on cause?   The only other distr I have is a vacuum only that
doesn't play well with a 34pict3.

Cam lash? Distr drive gear shims/play?   Two flakely distributors?   Maybe
my timing light has gone bad?  (I should fix my older one, the + clip got
torn off).  Or?  Or?

3 cap/rotor sets tried.

Ideas?
