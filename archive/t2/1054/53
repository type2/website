I have a fuel pump for that heater ,, if you find you need one.. let me
know..

I might just have a stock dash switch too.. actually, I have lots of these
items.. I have to test them to ensure they still work.. to be sure.

I have never seen a t/stat connected to that style of heater... it seems
that BN2 are not really good for operation when parked.. they consume a lot
of battery juice.. and for that reason.. most folks use them for a few
minutes to warm up the car,, then while they are driving,, but not while
camping .

But,, just because *I* have never seen it done.. doesn't mean it is gospel!
lol

Do you have a link or a picture of the style pump,, and switch ... so I can
look in my box of goodies to see if the ones I have are what you're looking
for?
