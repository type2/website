When I converted to an alternator, the brown wire was there, so I
connected it up.  I doubt, however, that the little brown wire can handle
the kinds of current the alternator supplies, so most of the current goes
through the ground strap between the transaxle and the frame.  Make sure
that one is connected, else all of the current will go though your clutch
and throttle cables, possibly welding them to something!
