Subject: UPDATE - Re: [T2] ball joint fun...

I brought the bus to the mechanic to have the ball joints serviced for 
my up-coming road-trip.  I also told him to check out my damper, tie 
rods and anything else major under the front-end.  After pulling the 
torsion arms off, he told me that two of the torsion bars were broken!  
He also said that the damper and tie rods were in need of 
fixin/replacing - probably because everything's 30 years old!

So yeah, that's the scoop so far.  I'm glad I brought it to the mechanic 
because I really didn't want to do a torsion bar job on that thing 
myself - seems like an unpleasant job, of which I'm more than happy to 
pay someone else to do... and the same goes for the ball joints :)

Now I just need to bring it to be aligned and then it's road-trip time!  
Super excited!
