Subject: Latch mechanism

1974 Transporter restoration.

After replacing the slider door runner cover, I realized that the door isn't
latching because part (or all I don't know) of the rear latching mechanism
is missing. I originally thought it wasn't latching because the cover was
bent. I have no clear idea of how this works except that when the door
handle is raised, it is supposed to possibly pull a cable and release the
latch. Do any of you have drawings or advice on how to fix this? I assume
that at least part or all of the mechanism has fallen into the door but I
don't know. The Bentley manual isn't clear on this. Any help would be
greatly appreciated!
