Subject: Re: [T2] Decent window rubber seals for 70 bug and VW's in 

A lot of people use Silicone when inserting their seals for some reason, 
avoid that and your rubber will age better and last longer. Silicone eats 
rubber. There are vulcanizing rubber adhesives you can use to seal your 
rubber in place if you wish, but trust me and avoid silicone.
