Howdy,

I'm picking up my new to me '75 in Wenham Massachusetts tomorrow and
driving it west across the state to Troy NY. I'm either taking 2
straight across Mass or 9 up through southern NH and VT. I hopefully
won't be needing any assistance but if you see an Orange '75 by the
side of the road please stop by and say hi.

Peace
Jules
