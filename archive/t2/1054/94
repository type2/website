I am truly saddened and sorry to say that Boston Bob Donalds died  
last night at 2am.
Those of you who just knew him from the list posts likely have only  
an inkling of the true Boston Bob.
I was fortunate to meet and become friends with him over the last few  
years.
He was a true individual that found his niche and pursued it with  
perfection and gusto, both professionally and personally, thru most  
of his life.
He had beaten cancer twice, once as a young man and again a few years  
ago, and the 3rd time finally got him, despite the pure stubbornness  
and energy with which he fought.
He never complained about his life or any of the things that would  
have beaten a lesser person down.
We would talk about our businesses and customers and the issues that  
small business deal with.
We would reminisce about the good old days when life was simpler.
We would laugh and  complain about the things we had no control  
over,  just to have a laugh or two and make the day go a little  
smoother.
He helped me thru my sons cancer with words of caring and wisdom and  
tried to downplay the bad with his typical cranky old fart sense of  
humor... Just what I needed at the time.
I will make a toast tonight, from the bottle of 20 yr old Bourbon I  
have been saving, and shed some more tears to the good friend that  
has gone to a better place and will suffer no more.

Below is from his lifelong friend Shaun ...
