I don't know if you call this normal wear, but I checked my logs and I 
first changed the steering box with a new TRW on 3/22/05 (-at-) 219,000 
miles.  I then changed it again 1/29/07 (-at-) 247,000 miles after it 
developed a flat spot.  I'm now at 272,000 miles and I've had this new 
flat spot for at least the last 5,000 miles.  This is a pretty bad track 
record if you ask me.

I have been using new hankook ra08 tires for about the past 5000 miles.
