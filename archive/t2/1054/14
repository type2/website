Subject: Rebuilding CV Joints

Volks,

I need a new set of CV joints for one axle on my '71.  I have 4 or 5 spare CV joints
but all of them have one or two bearings which are pitted (often in very minor
ways, but I can still find one or two marks).

Is it reasonable to take bearings from one joint and use them in another one?  I seem
to remember hearing at one point that this should not be done, but I could not remember
"why" and so I thought I'd ping the list to see what people's experiences have been.

Thanks!
