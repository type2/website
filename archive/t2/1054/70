Subject: New 1972 VW Bus Owner in need of help please

Greetings group
My name is Mike and I live in Stateline (Lake Tahoe) Nevada and I am the proud
new owner of a green and white 1972 VW Bus who we named Gamera (yes the turtle
from Godzilla).
 
When we bought it we were told it had and oil leak, backfires and needed a
valve adjustment. Many years ago I owned a 1976 VW Bus and loved it (traveled
over the Rockies in first gear).
 
I put a pertonix elect. ign. on her which seemed to help a bit...at least I
wont have to change points. I wanted to check the timing, but there are
notiming marks on the fan shroud...if I am lookig right it looks as if the
mark on the pully is at about 7 oclock.
 
Asside from what the seller told me, the bus ran fine. I took it to steam
clean the oil off the engine and compartment the other day and have had a
severe loss of power ever since. I did take care to cover the distributor
before washing. I have made sure everything is dry, replaced the spark plugs,
replaced the coil and still no power...it doesnt seem to be firing on all
four. I am on my way out to get a new condensor.
 
Any help would be greaty appreciated. Startng at about 11 oclock on the
distributor I have theplug wires going 1-4-3-2. The PO said the engine was
rebuilt about 9,000 miles ago. Hmmmm I am puzzled.
 
Thanks
Mike
