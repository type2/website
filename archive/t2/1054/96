Unfortunately, I never knew this guy, but reading what a few of you have written so far, I really get an idea of what this guy was about. I've been on enough car lists to know that there's always 1 or 2 of those real special people, the gurus of the hobby. The ones who basically know everything there is to know about that car. It's always the same kind of person, the person who's the most honest... the person that everyone always comes to for advice and who everyone always expects to give them answers, but the person who always genuinely and constantly gives without expecting anything in return.

It's these people who are missed the most, and I'm saddened that I didn't get to know the guy personally.
