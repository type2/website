Subject: RE: [T2] removing 'eccentric' bushing on the upper ball joint

A puller might work, I clamp them in the jaws of a vise, whenever I've done it
it was in conjunction with balljoint replacement, so I cut the shaft off to
make it easier and just use the jaws of the vise to rest the eccentric on and
strike the shaft thru.  You might be able to use heat to soften the boots
enough to stretch over the eccentric, but I dont know about that.JT Beaufort,
