Subject: Re: [T2] Decent window rubber seals for 70 bug and VW's in   

Glass stores and NAPA for two examples have a urethane sealant that the 
pros use to seal glass. I recommend it highly over silicone which I can 
verify does lead to more rust as my first car back in the mid-80s 
proved. It comes in a caulking tube and costs $16. That said I did not 
use it on my VW Westfalia and had no leaks despite changing all of the 
seals on all of the glass.
