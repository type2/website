Subject: Bugpack seals any good?

I emailed CIP and they told me their U.S. seals were made by Bugpack. I have no idea of the quality, has anyone used these before? CIP is close by me, but I want QUALITY seals. I don't see them on the WCM site for a 70 bug, just for earlier ones??? I'd just order them from WCM if I knew the number of the complete window seal set.
Thanks,
Courtney
