Hi David,

What about the end play on the crank/flywheel? If it's too loose then 
the distributor will rotate as the crank moves fore and aft across the 
bearings. Dunno why that would be different from idle to full advance, 
but it's one more possibility to consider

Happy Trails,

With both a brand new chinese 009 w/ points, AND a brand new mexican 034
(aka SVDA) with pertronix, the timing is really jumpy.

2-5 degrees of bounce at idle, 10 degrees of bounce at full advance.

same with and without vac. line attached to the 034.

Any ideas on cause?   The only other distr I have is a vacuum only that
doesn't play well with a 34pict3.
