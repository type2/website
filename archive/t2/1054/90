Subject: Re: [T2] Opinions sought - Wilson book on engine rebuilds

It is THE BOOK.  A bit dated now, but doesn't really matter for the practical
information regarding the actual building, just doesn't recognize some of the
aftermarket parts advances in the last 15 years.  Also some specifics here and
there on the T4 engine are not always perfectly correct, but generally still
THE SOURCE for aircooled engine rebuilds.  Bob Hoover's words (if still for
sale at BD) are equally wise and worth reading.  As are mine or anyone elses
on type2.com under the engine section.
