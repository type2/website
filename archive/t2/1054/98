It was very sad to hear of the passing of Bob Donalds. I remember the day I
took my 1600 to Bob's for rebuilding.  I thought I would be just dropping off
the engine and leaving within 20 minutes.  Instead Bob spent almost three
hours, educating me on all aspects of air cooled engines and giving me advice
on how to care for them.  He showed me around the shop and introduced me to
the people with whom he worked.  It was obvious that he had a lot of pride in
the work that he did.  I always looked forward to seeing him at the Litchfield
show and chatting with him telling him about the fun I've been having with the
engine he made for me.  He will be truly missed. 
 
Here are three photos of Bob taken at this years Litchfield show:
