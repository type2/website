Subject: removing front ball joints from steering knuckle

I'd like to remove the ball joints from the steering knuckle so I can 
replace the seals.  Does anyone have any tricks for removing the lower 
ball joint as the bentley shows a special tool being used to press it 
out.  My mechanic just said to hit the knuckle on the side where the 
ball joint's shaft goes through the knuckle and that'll free it up.  How 
about the upper joint?  Do I need any special tools to deal with the 
eccentric camber adjusting bushing?  I just want to make sure I can take 
this apart and put it back together :)

Thanks!
Mike
