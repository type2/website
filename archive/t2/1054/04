Subject: TRW steering boxes keep breaking!

Does anyone know what's up with these TRW steering boxes?  I'm on my 
second one right now and it's got a flat spot in it like the first one I 
bought!  I am looking to buy another one, but I'm hesitant to get 
another TRW dud if there are any other options available.  Has anyone 
else had any issues with the TRW steering boxes??

thanks,
mike
