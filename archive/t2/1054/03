Subject: =?iso-8859-1?Q?Resurrecting_Overhead_Air_Conditioning_-_What_would_you_do?=

Im in the process of rebuilding a 75 FI bay (Twinkie) that I bought a
couple of years ago. Because we are located in Arizona, I would like to get
the dealer installed overhead air conditioning unit operational. It is a
model VPC  ZVW 203 270.

Q1.	The dealer or P.O. ran a red 10 Ga. wire from the fan speed switch on
the dash all the way to the battery in the engine compartment but did NOT
fuse it. Should I run it direct to the fuse box or should I keep it as is
and put a fuse or circuit breaker at the battery?

Q2.	The fact that the York compressor is a power hog and the clutch is
burned out, I decided to replace it with the Sanden SD-508 compressor using
the adapter mounting from the BusDepot. I also plan to convert the
compressor from R-12 to R-134a Freon. My question is what vehicles used the
Sanden SD-508 with the dual pulley clutch. I was hoping to find one in my
local junkyard or Ebay.

Q3.	Most of the A/C wiring under the Twinkie is just protected with
electricians tape. Can anyone recommend a source of wire loom?

Q4.	The following link is a simple drawing of the A/C wiring I found by
crawling around underneath the Twinkie: http://smaziarz.com/AC.jpg
Does anyone have a drawing, microfiche, or source of the original wiring or
installation instructions?

I sure would like to hear from others who got their A/C working.

Thanks  Steve
