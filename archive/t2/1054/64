Ditto.  At minimum I'd go up 101 to Eureka and cut over 299 to  
Weaverville, then Highway 3 to Yreka (and I-5), or up to Crescent  
City and take 199 to Grants Pass from there.  My personal preference  
is 299, but having spent a lot of time in Weaverville growing up (and  
my parents still having property there I can use) I'm biased.  LOL

I-5 through the valley is a pretty boring drive IMHO, doesn't start  
to get interesting until you're at least as far north as Dunsmuir.
