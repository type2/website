Subject: BN2 help

I would like to install a BN2 in my Type 2.  I fired it up on the  
bench, and it is belching black smoke.  I would like to get this  
resolved before I install it.

I let it go for a while thinking that old crud just needed to burn  
out of the combustion chamber.  I don't think that strategy is going  
to work.  I suspect it is getting too much fuel.  There is what  
appears to be a metering device on top of the heater (downstream from  
the pump and upstream from the glow plug) that could possibly be  
adjusted (a bolt with a 7 mm head on it in the end of the unit).

There is also mention of a "fuel metering pump" in the documentation  
that I have.  I am lacking this fuel metering pump.  I cannot tell  
where it mounts in the fuel line, but I guess it goes between the  
tank and the fuel pump, which by the way, is mounted to the side of  
the heater.

The pump pulses about once a second, and I have yet to check the  
output at the glow plug, which I understand to be between 6 and 6.5  
ml for every 200 pulses.  I'm guessing that this output can be  
adjusted by turning the bolt (cw for less, ccw for more) mentioned  
above.

I have a dash switch (it is a timer), but close inspections reveals  
that it is missing some of its guts, so I think I'll pass on using  
that.  Is there a thermostat (available at perhaps a marine supply or  
camping supply) that I can use?

I would like to get this installed within the next week for a camping  
trip to the mountains.
