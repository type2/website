Welcome


I would suggest the following, or part number 021119249E to start with

http://www.busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=021119249EA

Then you may need to take the distributor cap off and see which one is #1 by
bringin the #1 piston up to top Dead center and the mark on the crank pulley
at about 11 oclock, then hook up the #1 plug to that one  That would be
number 1.  You got the timing order right, and #4 would be the next one
clockwise.

Also suggest setting the valves once you know where #1 is.

It is also a good idea to check out the compression after setting the valves
to see where you are at.

Enjoy your new bus.

Eric
