 This was indeed an option (albeit RARE) on early model bay window buses (on
all models) and looks simple to retrofit to a standard bus hatch. I helped
Chris at BustedBus pull one off of a parts bus a few months back. He may have
another one or busboys or wayoutsalvage or one of his contacts may have one. A
very cool option. Jon StilesOn Oct 6, 2008, at 1:31 AM, Phil Parker wrote: >

I believe you are talking about the internal locking latch for 68-70 Westies
[also fits 67's]. It has a sliding black knob that allows you to be able to
lock
the pushbutton from the inside. After you lock the front doors and the slider
from the outside, you then enter from the rear hatch and close it. When you
move the knob, the hatch cannot be opened from the outside. Here is a pic of
it. The left one is unlocked, the right one is locked.
