Hey Everyone,
I'm headin' on a road-trip with my GF next week and we'll be doing the 
grand tour of.. well.. a lot of states :)  We have about 2.5 weeks to do 
the trip and I wanted to find out if there were any listees along our 
route.  Here's the google map I made that shows our rough path of where 
we intend to go:

Now, I don't know if we're actually gonna swing up through montana, but 
we did want to go to yellowstone, so maybe we'll just come back down, 
head through salt lake city and then cut across the bottom part of 
wyoming and drop into colorado that way, and then go through grand 
junction on the way back.  Any recommendations?  I figure there are 
quite a few of you that have done some neat road trips through these 
parts and might have some suggestions on places to go and how to tweak 
our route.

thanks!
Mike
