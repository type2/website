Yeah my WCM seals started cracking along the rear side windows after 7 
years.

Not really  dissatisfied but the originals lasted 20 years.

Also bought door seals from Bus Depot (or was it WCM?) and they have 
been really good. Did two buses at nearly the same time. Took several 
years for them to shrink a tad so they fit perfectly. At first the door 
needed a little extra slamming speed. Even with the door latch pins 
adjusted out a little. Now they are perfect and aging very well.
