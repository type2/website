What a shock and true loss,  I did not know him well, but had met him
and his family a couple times,  even gave him some of my hard earned
money to build an engine for my bus, and just to give you an idea of
the kind of perfectionist he was, he tore the new engine back down
twice because he "thought" the bearings may not be quite right...

he was definately a man who marched by the beat of his own drummer,
and we all benefited from this,  this is such a loss to both his
family and friends including his extended VW circle of friends..

peace to both his soul and his family

Bob
