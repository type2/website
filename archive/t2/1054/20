Subject: Decent window rubber seals for 70 bug and VW's in general

There appears to be a bewildering assortment of window seals out there, many
various Brazilian ones, German ones, U.S. ones. I am doing a body off resto of
a 70 beetle, with my son-in-law, and would like to suffer the least amount of
frustration. I am thinking German or WCM seals? Would REALLY appreciate some
guidance here, in fact, for ALL the seals. Money is a concern, but frustration
is a BIGGER concern. :-) I'm thinking you get what you pay for.
Thanks,
Courtney
