Subject: ball joint fun...

I appreciate everyone's help and advice on removing the steering knuckle 
from the ball joint shaft, but eventually I realized that this was a job 
bigger than I'm willing to do on my own.  While trying to pull the 
bottom joint off I noticed a good amount of play in the joint.  I figure 
it's probably better to just change the joint out than just change the 
broken boot (which was my original intention) and that's one job I have 
no desire to do.  So, off to the mechanic it goes :)

Thanks again for all your input and advice!
Mike
