Subject: Opinions sought - Wilson book on engine rebuilds

Hi all

There is a project bus in the backyard next door which I am thinking of 
buying from its elderly owner.  It needs an engine rebuild as it's sat 
for 5 years or more, but there are no cracks anywhere I can see.

I saw this book on Amazon. 
How to Rebuild Your Volkswagen air-Cooled Engine (All models, 1961 and 
up) (Paperback)
by Tom Wilson 
<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/ref=ntt_athr_dp_sr_1?%5Fencoding=UTF8&search-type=ss&index=books&field-author=Tom%20Wilson> 
(Author)

Has anyone used this book and should I have it along with Muir and Bentley?

Thanks,

BEN
