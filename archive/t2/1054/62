Living on your route, I'd have to warn you to be COMPLETELY prepared  
for winter driving conditions. It's pretty late in the year to be  
traveling to Yellowstone...  Could easily get suddenly white.  Watch  
the weather forecast. Blankets, coats, sleeping bags, high cal food,  
water, etc. You DO have real winter experience, don't you?  Santa  
Barbara does not have "real" winter. (said the former Sandy Eggan)

And when you go through the Columbia Gorge, plan on a couple hours at  
Maryhill Museum <http://www.maryhillmuseum.org/>. Cross the Columbia  
at The Dalles and continue east on WA 14. Visit Maryhill and cross  
back to OR at McNary.
