Hi Dave,

I used a short piece of wire or nylon "weed-whacker" line, and tied one 
end to the door latch and then tied the other end to the pull knob.

If you're working on a camper, be sure to locate the pull knob a few 
inches above the base of the door, so that you don't have to go digging 
below the cushions to get the door open.

Happy Trails,
