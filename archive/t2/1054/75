Hi Bruce,

Eric had some good advice as to the timing scale.

Assuming that you are running the stock dual solex carbs, I would 
suggest you check ALL the vacuum and 12V connections. Be sure to inspect 
the rubber/plastic 90 degree boots very carefully, they are prone to 
cracking as they age. Wrapping them in electrical tape will help  for a 
while until you can source replacements. 90 degree ACdelco spark plug 
wire boots can also be fitted in their place if you have trouble getting 
new elbows.

Good Luck!
