I like the idea of the map for these kind of questions...

If it was me I'd go up the coast all the way to Tillamook, unless you 
plan on stopping along I-5.
South of Monterey & north of Morro Bay I'd stop at Plaskett Creek 
Campground (just north of Gorda, CA on Hwy 1) and go down to Jade 
Cove to find some jade in the gravel. North of San Francisco in 
Leggett, CA I'd spend the $5 to go down and drive thru the Redwood 
tree. Up by Crescent City (CA) I'd go camp at the Jed Smith Redwoods 
park. In Tillamook I'd stop at the cheese factory just to see again 
how it's made and get some for the trip.
If the weather cooperates that drive up the coast is a fantastic drive.

In the FWIW department, the Grand Canyon is always worth seeing, I've 
always wanted to go see Mesa Verde National park and I'd have liked 
to have a full day to wander (on foot) down the strip in Las Vegas.
