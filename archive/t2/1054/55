Subject: NW Dallas, Need to check a van out for me, please

Hi all,
I have asked the same the other day and got one very brave answer from one
member who is a little too far from the place.  Now I hope to find someone who
is a little closer and could just the same make a few digital pictures and
drive the camper to see if it works well enoug to sell it.
So, is there anyone closer to North West Dallas to go out to Roanoke to see
this van?  The folks are real nice and cookies are a given.
Cheers, Zoltan
