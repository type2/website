Yes, white wire is connected, and comes from same contact as condensor.
As for Bob's question, I assume coil has power since the spark works 
fine.  Next I will check for voltage going from that terminal, and for 
continuity from white wire at coil to wire going into #1 at MPC.  Also 
must check that injectors actually get + voltage at one of the contacts, 
since it's ground that's being switched?

you did make sure the white wire for the trigger is connected at the
coil...?
