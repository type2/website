Simplest and nicest looking would be to find a pull knob at home depot 
that threads onto the END of a threaded bolt.  The bolt usually comes 
long enough to go through a drawer or cabinet face.  Run the bolt 
through the hole in the latch release behind the wooden cover panel and 
secure it with an extra nut.  Put panel back with hole "exactly" where 
the bolt will come through.  Screw on the knob.  You could attach a 
string through a drilled hole in the knob to act as a locator you can 
pull on.
