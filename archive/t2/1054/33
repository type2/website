Subject: Re: Get in the Bus! ... Travelblog

I've got to admit, this is VERY cool. I've got a couple of friends who have 
talked on and off about doing this one day when they retire. I have one 
friend (former co-worker) who's been begging to buy my 73 Bus. He talks to 
me every day about his plan to buy a camper (or weekender, as he told me), 
and cruise the entire United States. We live in South Florida, so he would 
start from Fort Lauderdale, cruise up the east coast to Maine (stopping 
everywhere along the way) and then making the trip through the old Route-66 
(as best as much as he can), going up the west coast to Oregon, and cruising 
back through the top and making his way back down Route 27 to end his trip 
in the Keys (and then drive back to Fort Lauderdale).

Cept... he wants to use the trip to get away from his wife! hahah... my wife 
doesn't like camping, so I told him I'd cruise with him (I'll sleep on the 
front bench seats, he'll sleep on the Z-bed) all the way to D.C, and then 
catch a flight home. That will be a good way for him to shake any cobwebs 
off the motor and really give it a good run before he goes on a long long 
trip (for whatever Bus he buys).

I'm going to forward this link on to my pals...
