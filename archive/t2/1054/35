Subject: Anyone near Dallas?  Need some help

Hi to all,
I bought a 1983 Westy near Dallas, TX and would like if someone would take a
look at it.  I'm in Seattle.  I hope, there is a guy nearby who knows how to
set timing and the gap for the points and to make a dozen pictures of it and
send it to me.  Maybe a lot to ask, but I would do it for anyone and maybe
there is someone like me around there too.
The people who sold it a while ago are very nice folks and very patient and I
would like to settle it now.
Anyone, please?
Good wishes,
Zoltan
