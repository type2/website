Transporterfest/Volkswagen Day is a fun filled day of VWs, with the emphasis
on buses, vans, and transporters. All VWs are welcome though; from 1946
through current models and we don't care what condition they are in.

Vehicle registration: $12. New parts vendors: $25, used parts: $15.
Spectator admission is $10 for adults. Vehicle registration includes museum
admission for 2 adults and kids.
