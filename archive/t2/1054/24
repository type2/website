Hiya Courtney,

Most folks who reply to your post will respond with anecdotal references to their own experiences.? These may be of value to you or they may not apply at all.? That will depend on your situation.

My advice would be to talk to Ron Salmon at the Bus Depot.? Ron is in the business of importing and selling this stuff.? He knows more about seals and quality than any other person I've run into.? And, I might mention, he is a WCM dealer.? Even so, he will speak honestly about what's out there on the market.? 

I have followed his advice on seals and have never had a problem.

Mike
