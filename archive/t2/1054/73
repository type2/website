had same problem bout a year ago, was intermittent open circuit on
signal to trigger.  broken wire, worked sometimes not others.

put in new wiring harness no problems since.

hope you can get her home, if you can get a spare engine wiring
harness might solve your problem, also might work if someone cranks
while someone else jiggles the harness.

but the running fine then suddenly no start makes me want to consider
other issues,  mine got flakey intermittently for months before I
could find problem.

is there power to coil????  since coil is I think before trigger

good luck
Bob
