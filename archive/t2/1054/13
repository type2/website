Hi Mike,

I think this looks pretty slick, and it's all VW parts.

I used a spare coat-hook knob from a vanagon I had scrapped out. The 
same part is also used on the bay and old beetles, except it's white 
plastic. Or hit a wrecking yard and pull one from almost ANY VW model. 
The center section has a plastic plug that pops out, and it's held to 
the VW with a phillips screw.

Here's how I installed it: First the weed-whacker cable goes through the 
small hole in the panel, and gets tied to the release tab inside the 
door. Then the panel is put back into place, with the cable hanging out 
of it. Finally, you thread the cable through the coathook and take up 
the tension. I then tied it off around an M6 washer inside the 
coat-hook, trimmed off the excess and reinstalled the plug on the coathook.

Getting the slack out of the line is the key to making a clean looking 
and smoothly operating installation.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
