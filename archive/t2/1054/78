conversation that I was having with Sean and telling her about the our plans
to have his bro's mini ,his double cab, and my single cab done and all roll
down to a show in Texas  in May after telling her all of this she looks at me
devilishly and says wouldn't it be cooler to have both the single and the
double done so she would role down in her single cab and me in the  double cab
so there you have it I will be Keeping you updated
