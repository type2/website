I tried that on my '71 and ended up cracking the bakelite near the
steering wheel hub.  I didn't manage to get the wheel off either.  I
suppose after 18 years of it being non-symmetrical I should be used to it.

My opinion is to find the proper factory-style tool and use it carefully.
Banging on stuff often has undesirable consequences.
