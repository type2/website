Subject: RE: [T2] removing front ball joints from steering knuckle

I worked in an alignmet shop for a few years, all we ever used was a hammer,
two lb ballpeen, never failed.  Hit the knuckle at right angles to the ball
joint, should pop loose after a few tries, problem is going to be the
eccentric used for adjusting the camber- allways sticks to the shaft of the
balljoint, heat and a brisk whack will get them off, use a brass hammer or
drift to deliver or transmit the blow to the shaft, since you'll be hitting
the threaded end.JT Beaufort, SCRunning: 1. 62 404.1 Kompressor 2. 58 VW panel
