Hi,

Picked up the '75 this morning. Brought the wheels and Hankook RA08
tires from the '71 to replace the under-rated passenger car tires.
Fortunately I brought along some fuel line because I doubt the fuel
line on there would have made the trip - the fuel flowing out of that
line was black from deterioration on the inside of the line. The
outside of the line was almost severed from a deteriorated grommet
through the tin.

Serious potential issues averted.

I was surprised how well she pulled up and over the hills in the
Berkshires and Taconics. Curious to figure out exactly what I've got
under the hood.

Took RT-2 the entire way. No issues, good route across Massachusetts
for a bus. Thanks for the responses from those of you along the way.


peace
