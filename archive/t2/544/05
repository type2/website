I just purchased a 1978 Champagne Editionm microbus
(I'll tell more about it in a later message on the
list)

That really great! I never saw the receipt for a
Tourist Delivery bus before. Would you like to send me
the codes on the M-plate in your bus? I am curious to
them. Probably most codes are also shown on the
receipt...but still...sometimes the plate shows some
other/extra things.

Do you know if there were any brochures or something
to promote the Tourist Delivery Program?

Those are great things to have with your car. I am
gratefull that the Previous Owners of my bus saved
them (especially the first owner of course).
