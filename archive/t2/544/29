Hi Volks,

The other reason that tourist delivery was popular is the sales 
tax/import duty rules at the time.

You could import a used car into north America for a lot less than the 
cost of a new one, and use the savings to  finance a european vacation.

At least that's how it was explained to me. In 1980 our family bought a 
71 westy from its original owner who bought it on the tourist program.

Happy trails,
