Subject: RE: [T2] Charging circuit mods required for deep-cycle 

Are you running a 38a generator? I plan on trying the below with a 55amp
alternator to run my Norcold fridge while under route with DC power.
Thanks,

I have a '71 westy with dual yellow top optima batteries.  It just
works, no questions asked.  Camping for 2 days with stereo cranked
(~500W RMS (-at-) 12V
DC) and I still start in the morning if I can find my bus or my liver.

I have a cheapo battery isolator (alternator to one isolator terminal, +
on yellow tops to other terminals on isolator) and I wish I would have
spent more on the isolator.  I get a dimly lit generator light when
under heavy electrical load (high amperage, running headlights, wipers,
gas heater, etc. all at once).
