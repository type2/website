I can't confirm it but I can say having lived in Italy for 3 years, you could buy diesel VWs in Vanagon (van and pickup) form. That's because diesel was much cheaper than gasoline. $3 vs $5.50 for gasoline. 

Get off the American websites, and move to European enthusiast websites and I think you'll find your answers. FWIW the Canadians often get diesel vehicles we don't (Eurovan comes to mind). 

See ya!
