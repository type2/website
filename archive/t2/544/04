Subject: SingleCab bumper = Any other splitty bumper?

Hey Volks,

I'm looking to purchase a straight rear bumper for my new '60 SingleCab - Is
there any difference between this bumper and the bumper from any other early
model Type 2?

And if anyone on the list is in the Phoenix area with one for sale, feel
free to p-mail me!

Thanks!
