I am also looking for one, the rear on mine broke. So If you find more than
you need for a good price let me know.  Does anyone know if the ones from
Bus boys are the same, and will the sides be the same as the orig ones?

Hello All,
I have an aluminum side step, with the cast aluminum side support
attachments
(what enters the jack point) and mine are cracked.
Looking for anyone in a similar situation that would have one bad as well
that
is willing to part with.

Kind Regards,
