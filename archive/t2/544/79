Subject: Re: [T2] Charging circuit mods required for deep-cycle

I have a '71 westy with dual yellow top optima batteries.  It just works,
no questions asked.  Camping for 2 days with stereo cranked (~500W RMS (-at-) 12V
DC) and I still start in the morning if I can find my bus or my liver.

I have a cheapo battery isolator (alternator to one isolator terminal, + on
yellow tops to other terminals on isolator) and I wish I would have spent
more on the isolator.  I get a dimly lit generator light when under heavy
electrical load (high amperage, running headlights, wipers, gas heater, etc.
all at once).

I have nothing bad to say about optima yellow top batteries...  they should
be called "gold top".

hope that helps some
