Subject: muffler

Hi list,

I have a real problem with my 80 Vanagon/L. I can't find a muffler. Frank
Condelli looked for the motor # CT 131429 and he can't find one. I was at
OWASCO one of the biggest VW dealers in Ontario Canada and they didn't found
the motor # at all and think that this a 1600cc singel carb engine used for
industrial purpose like the ice sweeper for a hockey arene.
Is there anyone out there who can help me?
The muffler is rather special. No cross member and has the pipes from the
heater boxes going to the muffler unit on the right and left outside. The
endpipe is on the left side that means there eare two oval flanges om the left
and one on the right side. I could go for a coustom made uint but the price is
very high and it would be the last step. The muffler ist the hurdle to get her
certyfied.
