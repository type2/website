Subject: Re: [T2] RE: VW - Corvair

FWIW Clark's Corvair has discontinued (for the forseeable future) the "Trans-vair" conversion kit. It's still int he catalog but they have no stock to go with the part number. Maybe they just haven't put in an order with their fabricator... Dunno. 

By no means does this mean Corvair parts are drying up! Lots of custom engine and stock engine parts available (everything actually!) from a hundred different sources and at least maybe 10 of those are catalog companies. 

In reality it is not a hard conversion to build yourself without the kit with some pics and a welder. By the way - got a friend looking for a kit or pieces of a kit. Give me a holler and I'll put you in touch. 

George I'll put you on the "mailing list" for the Corvair pics. Maybe this weekend I'll get those put together. 

See ya!

Chris
