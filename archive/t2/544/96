Subject: Re: [WetWesties] POR 15 Corrosion Control Process

Here's the deal with this rust "converter"  stuff--all of it---whatever
brand name it may go by.

It's a band aide--a condom to mask the problem.

It cover's the rust, and corrosion---and allegedly bonds to the area,
not allowing any air to get to the rust--

This sure doesn't repair anything--

It doesn't remove the rust.
It doesn't clean the rust outa the pore's of the metal.
It doesn't prep the surface in question for permanent bond for paint.

All it's doing is putting a plastic bag over the top of it.
( the poly isocyanates that are in the POR product convert the liquid to
a urethane based product --a plastic cover)

Better to do the job right the first time and be done with it--

Maybe as a stop gap measure the stuff is Ok--it may buy you some time
till ya get the denaro's together to get the job done right--but that's
about all it would be good for--

Hasta,

TK
