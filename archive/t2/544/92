Subject: RE: [T2] Weber tuning- low power uphill

Guys, found a crimped fuel hose from a foolhardy 90 bend. Going to fix
that this weekend and try again. A 7.5mm hose bent 90 deg right after
the fuel pump might restrict gas flow, eh?
I plan on properly going through the engine again and fixing that, so
ignition, fuel delivery, and timing are rocks on.
This makes sense this is my problem, runs fine at low throttle and
cruising rpm, but get into it or have a demand form a hill and she bogs
with no power. Not driving until it's perfect.

The 009 advance curve note is taken, and somewhat existant in the lower
rpm range, but I am used to that, this is not an advance issue, other
than she could use the extra vac advance when I hit a hill in 4th or
3rd, where a 009 is all the way in or almost, but could use more. This
is def feeling like fuel delivery, and/or float levels.
