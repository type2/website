Subject: Regulations for out of province registration here.

Hey guys

Just found out something kinda cool for the province I live (Saskatchewan) 
here.
I had been looking at some busses outa province and was always worried about
registering them and having to get them certified. Guess there is an easy 
way
around the paperwork here.  You register them as an antique, no 
test/certification,
and a week later you can re-register them as a normal vehicle.. bypassing 
all
the crap.  As an antique I am sure they have to be a certain age but the 
baywindows
and such are within the window.

Straight from a RCMP officer.

p.s.  Don't tell anyone ;)
