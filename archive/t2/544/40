Subject: timing - by the engine or by the distributor

Could someone please explain to me why you would want to time an engine 
according to what distributor is in an engine?  It just doesn't make sense!

I would think that you would want to time an engine (for max advance!) 
according to the model of the engine and what kind of advance that 
engine (block, heads, cylinders, pistons, etc) is capable of handling. 
Exceed those limits, and you're going to burn that engine, regardless of 
what distributor you're using.

If you put a stock distributor in it's correct engine, then yes, time it 
according to the Bentley.  But if you are going to put an aftermarket 
distributor, it's *max advance* needs to be set so the engine doesn't 
blow itself up.

Now, how would you know what the max advance is for your engine?  Find 
out what distributor is *supposed* to be used in your engine, look at 
the advance curve, add it to the prescribed idle timing for your engine 
model year and voila.  Now use *those* specs to time your non-stock 
distributor.

I hate to make a big deal about this, but it seems like the generally 
accepted reasoning is to time engines according to distributor type, and 
this is what could potentially burn up people's engines.

I have no problem if I'm wrong.  But nobody's come up with a solid 
justification as to why you'd time an engine according to the 
distributor yet, so the question still stands...

thanks,
Mike
