Hi Hartmut,

Since you mentioned the industrial engine, I would suggest you talk to 
Mark Dearing and/or Boston Bob. I toured Boston Bob's new shop last 
summer and he mentioned that he had done business with Mark regarding 
engines for Zambonis. Maybe they would have a lead for you.

Also, I know there is a 1.6L vanagon in the Full Moon Bus Club, and 
I'll bet Mark knows something about it.

Finally, you might try getting an original VW muffler from the UK or 
europe.
