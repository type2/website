The Tourist delivery Programme was an option in the
late 60ties en early 70ties (don't know the exact
period when this was available).

Anyhow, In the USA and Canada it was optional to buy a
bus at the dealer and have it delivered in Germany.
Then travell to Germany and drive it around Europe for
a few months. Finally the bus would be shipped to the
USA.

Tom Riis has a bus that was sold like this, his
website address was http://www.70camper.com/ , but it
seems to be offline :-(

In my previous message I forgot to send the URL of the
receipt that came with my Champagne Edition bus:
