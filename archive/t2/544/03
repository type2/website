Hello all
I have two 68 buses in restorable shape that are
identical and thinking of selling them, but on one of
them I have the original window sticker in really good
shape. I dont have a scan of it but can get one and
post.........i thought it was really neat......I have
a 1974 beetle that I bought from the original
owner....which was cool cause i have copies of the
original title and such paperwork.....things like this
really interest me also.
