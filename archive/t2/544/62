Subject: Wiring guru needed, battery drain continues but did find what

I've had a massive drain on my battery which will kill it in under 2 days
when it sits. Today I hooked up a light between the neg post and the neg
cable and pulled fuses one by one. The light stayed on no matter which fuses
I pulled, so it's not there. What I DID find though is that if I pulled the
big red wire that goes from the pos. battery terminal to  the B+ terminal of
the regulator, the light went out. I am not an expert, what have I
discovered here? This is a new battery and a new regulator. Can someone tell
me where the drain would be in this circuit so I can repair it? Is it the
starter? The starter works fine.

Help!
