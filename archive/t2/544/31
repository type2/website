Subject: Re: [T2] SVDA question

Proper vacuum advance is only present from off-idle to 1/2 throttle. Above
1/2 throttle vacuum advance is 0 and you have centrifugal only, which is the
same as a 009. This is why a properly setup SVDA will outperform a 009 in
ALL circumstances, because the worst it does is a 009 curve (1/2 to full
throttle).
