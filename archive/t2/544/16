Hey Frank,
Why don't you you just go have them welded up?

No big deal, and not an expensive operation.

Grind the welds smooth, sand and polish them--they'll be better than
new.


    
 
Hello All, 
I have an aluminum side step, with the cast aluminum side support
attachments (what enters the jack point) and mine are cracked. Looking
for anyone in a similar situation that would have one bad as well that
is willing to part with. 
Kind Regards,
