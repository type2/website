Subject: Re: POR 15 Corrosion Control Process

Some times you simply can't do everything that needs to be done what
some people deem as 'correct'. But every now and then something else
will give you the equivalent in what 'you - yourself' see as fufilling your 
needs and
that's not wrong either.

If I had the choice of buying a 35$ container of POR-15 (as I did) vs
a $4-600 replacement of a chunk of metal and labor and the result was the
same for the appropriate period of time... I would pick the POR-15
and smile since it means that I can drive it, look good and rust is
stopped. Even if it's for another 10 years. Money saved in my case.

Just because it's not the way it 'should' be done, some alternatives
do work just fine.

My 2 cents.

Maybe as a stop gap measure the stuff is Ok--it may buy you some time
till ya get the denaro's together to get the job done right--but that's
about all it would be good for--
