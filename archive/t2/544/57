Bummer - I was hoping it was a stock type IV motor.  I'm not an expert, but
I've got 10 years experience on 2 different type IV motors running dual IDFs
and I feel like I had them both dialed in just right.

Hopefully someone on the list can give you some pointers based on real
experience with a similar motor as yours.  But in general, you'll want to
know the following:
  1. Main venturi size
  2. Main gas jet size
  3. Air correction jet size
  4. Emulsion tubes (probably F11)

The 40 IDF setup as they come new out of the box are usually not really
setup very well especially for a mildly hot motor like yours.  

I expect you've got 28mm main venturis.  In my opinion that's too small for
a 1776 with a mild cam and you're starving the beast.  30mm is probably a
better bet.  I ran my 1.8 type IV with 28mm once just to see what it would
do and it was CRAP.  No kick on acceleration and the thing was really
starving by the time I got up around 4000 RPM.

The F11 emulsion tube sucks for a type IV application.  The transition from
idles to mains is way too lean and it stumbles around 2200 RPM.  The F7
tubes provide a richer transition.  Again, this is based on type IV
experience.

Then there's your main and gas jets.  You've probably got 115 gas and 200
air.  I was running 125 gas and 185 air on my 1.8 type IV in San Antonio
(near, but not at sea level).  I tried several combinations and found this
to be the best.  Now I live in Colorado Springs (7000 feet) and suspect if I
was still running my dual Webers I'd probably find that 125 gas/195 air
would work better.

Hope some of this helps and hope someone with real hands-on experience can
give you some more definitive info.
