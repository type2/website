Subject: [T2]switching batteries/radio?

ok i have asked this before and somewhere lost the info on it...?
 
as of now i have my radio hooked as normally would be in any other vehicle with the switch wire hooked up and the battery wire hooked up~!~
 
so the radio cuts on when you turn the switch on and crank it....
ok,.
i bought the relay they have for a trickle charge from bus depot....
havent hooked it up yet,.,, but will....
 
i would like to push a toggle button and have the radio flip over to the marine battery that the bus depot relay is hooked to or will be hooked to...
 
this way camping it doesnt draw from the starting battery but yet the marine battery that has been trickle charge to full capacity till camping...~!~and we can listen to our tunes still~!~
 
i am not sure how to do it so that the starting battery doesnt fry or the wireing either one under the dash with the radio...>?
 
in simpliest terms...??????????
thanks 
peace
Cha
