Subject: dash crack repairs

I've waited about six years to post this to be sure it worked.

Fifteen years ago, when I got Beatrice, my 1973 Campmobile, there were two
cracks started in the padded dash.  They were each about 1-2 inches long.
One was from the top of the dash, above the radio, and the other started at
the lower left corner of the glove box.

The first thing I did was to drill out the end of the crack, similar to what
is done to repair cracks in the aluminum skin of aircraft.  It was probably
another year before I took the next step, and the crack had gone no farther.

That next step was to cosmetically repair the crack itself.  I found a
product called StarBrite brush on wire insulation at Harbor Freight which
I'd used on wires, but seemed to be fit for the crack repair also.  I
brushed on a light coat in a very narrow path over the crack.  I let it set
overnight and it filled in the actual crack.  The next day I put on another
light coat and feathered it into the surrounding dash area, but no wider
than 1/4 to 3/8 of an inch.

I'm pleased with the repair.  After all this time, it's held up.  I have a
dash cover and so what is visible of the top crack is not noticeable.
Likewise, the crack at the glove box isn't noticeable either.  I doubt
anyone is aware of them unless I point them out.

So, since I have another bus now with a few cracks to repair, I thought I'd
post this fix in case anyone else is looking for a solution.  I know the
cracks in the new bus dash will take more work since they are much larger
and I plan to start filling in the crack with silicon and follow with the
StarBrite.  I'll let you know in another 6 years how that works......
