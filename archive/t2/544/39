There are several ways to "time them". 40-45 degrees full timing IS NORMAL;
if it makes you feel better remove the vac hose and check it, it should be
30-32. I tell people to time it with the hose disconnected like a 009, but
then connect it and verify you have another 10 degrees of vacuum. The vac
hose should NOT change timing at idle, if it does you have it connected to
the wrong port.
