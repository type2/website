Agreed, but dropped spindles for the bay window bus are not as readily
available (cost wise) as they are for splits. I have been bugging bus boys
for years. Franklins VW Werks makes them, but they are pricey.

If a source for bay window dropped spindles is available that I dont know
about, I would love to know...
