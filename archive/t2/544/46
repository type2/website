Subject: 78 FI 2L into 73 bus

I don't know what half this stuff is. But I tried to take a pic of

Thanks in advance for any help
I know I need a Fuel pump and Fuel filters.
I have a brain coming... Thanks Rob

I know I'll need more but don't know what.

Also, I already swapped a 78 Tranny in so that should be good.
