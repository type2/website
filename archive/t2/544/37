Get a valve stem core removal too; remove all four valve stem cores.  Bus
will lower about four inches.

Handling may suffer slightly...

Seriously, the only way to do it right is to use lowering spindles that
keep the original front end geometry and to reposition the rear spring
plates and then realigning all four wheels.

Whatever you do, make sure that it is reversable, as you or the next owner
of the bus will want it back to stock height.
