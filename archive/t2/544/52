Subject: RE: VW - Corvair

The axle adapters will prob require some careful cutting. It is simply a steel disc same diameter as the CV joint. Same bolt pattern. Also has another piece of steel whose length is the same as the diameter of the circle and the width is the same as the diameter of the U-joint caps on the Corvair. Again a pic says a thousand words!!! 

All common dimension steel. 

I'll try to get something together here soon!

Some of the other hardware needed are the couplers to hook up the bus axles
to the corvair transaxle. Do those look easy to fab?
