Subject: RE: [T2] Rust Under the Windshield

I had a similar problem with rust under the windshield on my bus and it
did eventually start leaking water onto my dash and then down on to the
floor :(

I removed the window and used a small mig welder to fix the holes.  Not
a big job if you catch it in time.
