Subject: Need the knob to hold my spare tire cabinet on, in my 77 Westy

I made one for my 1979 Westy... if memory serves me - I used a wood cabinet
knob that I got at a local hardware store and the correct bolt... I drilled
a hole through the knob and counter-sunk the head of the bolt into the knob
- I may have used some epoxy to keep it in place as well.  Not perfect - but
certainly functional.

I've been to Samba, etc, and sent of many emails but no-one seems to have
one. This is the knob/bolt that comes down vertically from the top, and
holds the top of the spare tire cabinet on. It is right behind the drivers
seat in my 77 Westy. 
Does anyone have one they are parting out, or seen one in a yard? I'm tired
of using a normal screw that doesn't fit.
Thanks,
Courtney
