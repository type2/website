Subject: Nose High '75

Howdy Y'all,

I have a '75 restoration I am finishing up. I completely rebuilt the  
front beam and the rear suspension. Now the front suspension is riding  
very high, on the top snubbers when empty. When two people sit in it,  
the front suspension settles and is drivable. One person, it is pretty  
bouncy. I installed a Addco 7/8" anti-sway bar in the front and the  
bus is running Koni's.

I have done almost over half a dozen beam rebuilds and this hasn't  
happened before. The beam is in excellent shape with no apparent bends  
or damage. The leafs in the spring packs were in excellent shape as  
well.

Anybody else had this issues with this type of combination of parts? I  
am wondering if it will just settle over time.

Thanks,

Jon Stiles
