I've been using a Delta Mark 10B capacitive discharge ignition since the 
late 70's. Long plug and point life.
Only needs an occasional timing setting as the point wiper wears. Its mostly 
indifferent to point dwell.

I bet I set timing only every 5-6k miles. Plugs last 20-25k miles easily. 
Points never foul and last as long as the plugs.

Maybe you can find one on ebay.
