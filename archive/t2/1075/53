Subject: Re: [T2] 71 turn signal question

I recall that in my turn signal ass'y ther was a brass half-round plate 
that wore completely through (the wheel rbs on it?)- using hobby shop 
brass (K&E display) I cut and soldered over it a new piece.

John quoth:

  But I hate to have any mech thing defeat me, so I really would like to
  know what the 'bit' in question might be. Like others I did the
  down plate.
