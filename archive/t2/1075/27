I used Acrylic Enamel and it has held up for a long time. Just starting to 
fade (red) and have never been waxed. I think the paint is seven years old 
now?

My father builds street rods and uses urethane and the look is amazing. don't 
know how long it would last (prob longer that enamel) b/c these cars seldom 
see any weather.  Much more expensive up front. Can't comment on how it would 
measure up if urethane lasted longer (TCO). 

Make sure you get enough paint over the edges of things like doors. Make sure 
you thoroughly kill the rust. It will come back. 

The only place that my paint truly failed is the bottom of my passenger door 
where there was some tree gunk building up (wasn't getting washed enough) and 
there might not have been enough paint put there when my friend sprayed it. 
Paint peeled back and rust set in. Dunno if I am going to replace the door 
yet. I have to remove it and flip it over for a look. Also has a dent to be 
heated and nudged out.

The acrylic enamel paint I used I added hardner to. It was a cheap no-name 
brand (Stories brand I think - the in-house brand). 

Would use it again. 

The urethane would likely yield a deeper shine. Something consider if your 
bodywork is not really good - might reveal some flaws.
