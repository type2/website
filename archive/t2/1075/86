Hi, I am putting finishing touches to my '74 Westy 1.8 L, and I have an 009
'Dizzy" with Petronixs innards, and also my stock 'dizzy", with dual vaccum
ports, and was wondering, should I just install stock dizzy,..... when I have
added a cam with more lift and duration, twin del 34s, headers, and Empi "twin
mufflers,...as is,..or try and install petronixs in stock "dizzy", or spend
'big' and put 'Crane"system in?  I have an MSD 6 series, so was just wondering
how much "more', I need, or if stock "dizzy" with MSD, would be enough?
Thanks.
Syd
