Subject: Re: [T2] 71 Turn Signal Switch

The VWG/Airhead Switch is essentially the same design with some very minor
improvement mainly in materials.  VWG/Airhead even looked into completely
re-engineering the design, but they didn't have the hundred thousand bucks
to do that (mechanical/electrical design/CAD engineers aren't cheap as well
as the subsequent tooling from scratch).  It was less expensive (but still
several thousand dollars in tooling,) to essentially copy from an existing
design that works and in many cases lasts (or should last) 20 years or
more.  Certainly better than the planned obsolescence of GM, Ford and
Chrysler stuff of an average of 10 years or less.

I use to own a 69 Camper back in the 70s and a 71 Bus in the 80s.  Never had
a problem with either one regarding the Turn Signal Switch because they
weren't all that worn THEN.  I sold perhaps two SWF replacement switches a
year in the 70s and 80s and usually because some dickwad mis-wired it
(resulting in the "smoking" and frying situations) or broke the stalk off.
This is now, decades later - mechanical action parts wear out regardless of
the excellent care, maintenance and ingenious repair(s) that have been
mentioned on this list by some very excellent DIYers.

And things do improve in design over time - I've got a box of NOS Vanagon
Turn Signal Switches and I haven't sold one in almost two years and
they're roughly 2/3rds the price of the 68-71. Both my 84's have switches in
perfect condition despite the hundreds of thousands of miles on both of 'em.

I know, I know, can't get stupid Volkswagen parts to last more than 2 or 3
decades (said in jest by a 40 year VW mechanic to me several years ago).
