Subject: Speedo woes

Hi Folks,

For some time now the speedometer in my '70 bus has been making a rhythmic
twang-twang-twang, with the needle jumping in unison.  I figured it was the
cable.  I finally got around to replacing the cable, but the problem remains.
I'm guessing the speedo is screwed up inside.  Has anyone had a similar
problem that they've fixed successfully.  I really really don't want to pull
the instrument cluster, so if you have any other hints, I'd like to hear them.
Thanks.

Best,
Jerry
