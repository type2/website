Subject: RE: [T2] 71 turn signal question

OK, I have to ask - is this door lock issue a '71 thing as well?  My
Westy's symptoms are such that if I lock the front doors by depressing
the door "switch" (on the inside pull handle), I can't unlock with the
key.  If I lock with the key, I can sometimes unlock it with the key.
And if I can't unlock it (either way), I have a devil of a time snapping
the locking switch back into its open position.

I took things apart to lubricate them, but still no workie.  So are
there springs I can get that will fix this "typical" problem?  I'm not
sure I have the time to fix them, but I need to do something.  For now,
I just rely on people's good nature not to mess with another man's bus.
:)

Thx,

JP

and I was surprised and glad I could get those tiny door lock springs;
from a VW dealer too.  Lots of fiddly work, but worth it, and I learned
more uses for dental floss.
