"Looking for chromed plastic inserts for bus windows"

Greg,

Most of the online vendors sell the all-rubber "California look" seals. I
bought mine from Bus Depot and like the quality.

The plastic inserts are harder to find. I know that Wolfsburg West sells at
least some of them - look here:

Other vendors might have them (I typically check with Bus Depot first) but I
just happened to run across them the other night
