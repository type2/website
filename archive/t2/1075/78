Subject: sliding window track seals

Hey Y'all,

I am looking for some replacement track seals for '79 sliding windows.  
It is not the metal reinforced stuff found on window tracks. I have  
been trying some Super Beetle track seal, which is the same shape, but  
the metal reinforcement is proving difficult in the corners.

Anyone have a line on the original rubber track seals?

Thanks,

Jon Stiles
