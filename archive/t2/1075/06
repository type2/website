Subject: 23rd Twin Cities Volkswagen Club Annual Show

OK everyone.  It's time again the Twin Cities (MN) Volkswagen Club Annual Show!  This is the 23rd one and this year the is no charge for spectators nor for show cars.  There is a $20 charge for swap spaces and cars that are for sale. There are three Type II classes, bring yours in!  There are 1st through 3rd place trophies for these classes.
 
The date is Sunday 7 June from 9:00 am to 3:00 pm and it is a Westside Volkswagen's new New Car dealership on the west side of County Road 100, south of I-394, in Saint Louis Park on Westside Drive.  Old maps have this as Stevens Drive.
 
Hope to see you there!
