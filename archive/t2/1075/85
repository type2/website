Marcus, There are numerous options on that piece that depend on the exhaust
installed.  If you are installing the 72-5 exhaust, I'm afraid I can't help,
but I do have the piece for the '76-8.  The difference is a hole for the
U-turn.  The late tin has it, the early one does not.

Facet.  The FI pump is producing 60PSI reduced to ~32PSI.  Carbs max out at
2-3 PSI.  I am sure someone has a way of reducing 60 to 3, but I ain't heard
of it.

BTW, Hello, all!  I'm still alive, still depressed and still a hermit. If
anyone wants a '74 autostick beetle , let me know.  I'm also trying to rid
myself of the '80 vanagon.  The vanagon has a new AVP rebuild hung in it,
but I've had health issues that have prevented me from ever hooking it up.
Been hung in there for three years, still not hooked up.
