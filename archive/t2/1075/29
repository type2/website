Subject: 71 turn signal question

List,

 

 

My turn signals work.

 

My question is that the left one clicks back after you turn left and
straighten up but the right one doesn't spring back that well (it sometimes
just stays blinking 'right turn) is their any adjustment internally to get
this working better, my first thought is just to clean it.

 

Thanks, 
Trey
