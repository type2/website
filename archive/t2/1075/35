Subject: RE: [T2] 71 turn signal question

My 71 Westy, Feelmore, turn signal will turn right and will sometimes "cancel"
or click back but the left side is so stiff it would turn.  I've tried taking
it apart and cleaning it and trying to figure out the stiffness to no avail.
I too would love to hear any suggestions.

Peace,

Michael in Montevallo
