Subject: rubber window trim

I'm at the closing stages of finishing the restoration of my '78 sunroof bus. 
I would really like to go back with the original plastic chrome trim
inserts on all the window rubbers but the online vendors' websites are
confusing at best. 
 
This is the trim that fits into a groove on all the weatherstripping and
serves no other purpose except to be purty i think.
 
Please let know if any of you have sources for the seals and the trim to go
with it for a complete '78 Bus.  Thanks, Greg
