Subject: RE: [T2] Engine cutting out with brakes..

Ah, I didn't know what that valve was specifically for - I have a leak
somewhere in my brake system as well which causes idle to cut out.  I
purchased a new check valve as part of my repair/replacement strategy,
but just because I wouldn't put anything past the PO, what is the
correct direction for the check valve?  I assume it needs to open
towards the intake but it wasn't obvious to me when I looked at it and I
don't have it in front of me now.

Thanks,

JP

Somewhere in the archive you will find a refernce to a torn Diaphram on
the bosster, when you press the brake pedal you open up a massive vacuum
leak, thus stalling the engine.  On Polly (74 twin carb 1800), replacing
the booster did the trick.  IMPORTANT, one cause of failiure is
misfiring or whatever causing a pressure bubble and ripping the
diaphram, VW thought of this and included a small valve in the vacuum
line near the engine.  Sadly folks replacing their vacuum lines miss it
out, and pop goes the booster!
