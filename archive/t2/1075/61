Subject: starting problems and burnt wires

I went to take my 1972 bus out for the summer and ran into some problems
starting it.  I put a fresh battery in, but when I went to started it it
turned over very slow.  I switched batteries and had the same problem.  I also
noticed that a wire from the alternator to the voltage regulator had burnt in
the process of trying to start the van.

Would it be something simple like a bad Starter Bushing making the starter
work too hard and pull too much current?  or would it be the alternator,
voltage regulator or something else as the problem?

My vw usually starts very easy after a being stored for the winter and it
worked fine when I put it away last fall.  It's stored at my in-laws about an
hour away.  I'm going to have another look at it next weekend.

Any suggestions of a fix or something I should look at?
