Hi Jason,

I have no idea where to find another hitch like that one. IIRC I got it 
at a VW "garage sale" held by a then-list-member in 1997.  I have seen 
people fabricate their own versions of it; usually for an early bay.

If I was buying a replacement, I would probably go for the under-bumper 
reciever hitch.... I can't count the number of bruises my shins have 
from that bad boy.

Happy Trails,
