It seems that everyone either loves it or hates it. :-)

Pros are well documented vs. points:

- $69 USD
- Eliminates cam wear
- Saves on routine adjustment/replacement of points and lubrication  
of dist. cam
- Stabilizes dwell and timing during tune-up interval of 15k miles  
(better idle and smoother revs)
- Minor boost to mileage
- Major boost to top end

However there are some cons to be aware of:

- Sleeve can sometimes be difficult to install over distributor shaft
- Spacing of magnets in sleeve can be off by 1/2 deg.
- Will burn out immediately if wired backwards
- Still requires you to lubricate dist. cam through felt wick (don't  
forget!)

Given these results, I think the pros outweigh the cons at this price  
pint. There are better systems out there that cost a lot more and  
there are copies of the Pertronix like the HotSpark and Compufire/ 
Accurfire that cost less but as they say, YMMV.

I've not been able to replicate comments that leaving the ignition on  
with the engine off burns out this unit. If this was true at one  
time, it may have been the fault of an older design or perhaps an  
electronic unit mistaken for a Pertronix branded unit.

As always, disconnect the battery before doing any work on the  
ignition system.
