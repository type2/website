Subject: Trailer hitches

I wanted to know how many folks are utilizing trailer hitches on their  
buses and where they got them from.

I'm looking to put one on Zoey so that I can pull a small motorcycle  
trailer since I don't have a truck. I've looked at a few styles, but  
am curious as to what folks are actually using.
