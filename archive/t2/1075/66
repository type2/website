Subject: Re: starting problems and burnt wires

It could be as easy as a corroded fuse. If there is no power to the  
ignition circuit, the alternator sensing wire is the next best route  
route from the battery to the iginition and your accesories. Twist  
the relevant fuses in your fuse panel the clear any corrosion on the  
contacts.

The slow turn-over, however, is most likely the consequence of a bad  
battery or ground connections. Clean the battery terminals, the  
starter terminals and the ground strap connections (battery side and  
transmission side).
