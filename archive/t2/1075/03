Subject: RE: [T2] Engine cutting out with brakes..

The vacuum is at the engine - the valve is to allow it to suck from the
booster but not ever to blow towards the booster. Generally the big hoses at
the "S" hose blow off if the engine backfires.I suppose damage would result if
the check valve was not in place or not check valving.

I didn't know what that valve was

 somewhere
in my brake system as well which causes idle to
 cut out.  I
 purchased a new
check valve as part of my

 but just because I
wouldn't put anything past the PO, what
 is the
 correct direction for the
check valve?  I assume it
 needs to open
 towards the intake but it wasn't
obvious to me when I
 looked at it and I
 don't have it in front of me now.
Thanks,
