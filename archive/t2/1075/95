"When I hit the switch I can hear a motor running."

 

I had the same symptom with my '72 Westy. Bolted to the shaft of the wiper
motor is an arm (about 5" long) which attaches to the wiper linkage - mine
had come apart where the shaft arm attaches to the link. If this is the
case, you should be able to see the shaft arm revolving when you turn on the
wiper motor, and there will be no link arm attached to the end of the arm
opposite the motor shaft.

 

Less likely is that the arm itself has become detached from the motor shaft.
If for some reason you must remove the arm from the motor shaft, remember to
mark its position in respect to the shaft or you'll be fiddling with it
later to get it positioned correctly.
