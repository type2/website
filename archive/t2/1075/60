Subject: Re: Trailer hitches

I have used my bus for hauling cars. Many thousands of miles with a  
German factory hitch rated for 1200 kg and 50 kg tongue weight -  
based on my experiance it can handle much more (more than your bus  
brakes can). I just pulled it from my bus that fell victim to the  
metal mites (some call it rust ...).

It is bound for my moving container, but I would consider selling it.  
Ball size is 50 mm wich works great for trailers with a 2" coupler.  
It mounts to the frame in place of the bumper brackets. The bumper is  
then bolted to the hitch. That way the bumper hides the enitre hitch  
construction (very heavy duty tubing) with the exception of the ball  
and the trailer light socket. I can take pics tomorrow.
