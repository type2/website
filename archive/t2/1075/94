I had this happen. The square hole in the grease cap into which the
speedo cable end is inserted became rounded out so that it would no
longer facilitate the turning of the cable. Bus Boys was able to
supply me with a suitable replacement. I've had to replace the cable
before too (in a '71) - the key to doing it easily was tying a string
to the old cable as I pulled it through the floor, then I tied the new
cable to the string and pulled the string and new cable back through
in the other direction.  I'll probably replace the two half cables and
EGR box in my '75 with a single cable at some point - I'm guessing the
cable from the parts '71 will fit , we'll see.
