Subject: Engine cutting out with brakes..

Hi,

I'm trying to help out a friend who has recently bought a 2 L or 1.8  type 4,
twin carb (Solexes) in not very good condition. He hasn't had it long, so I've
been trying to give him a hand sorting out some of the issues he's having. The
bus is definitely non-original, so knowing the year would not help. It's a '76
or '78 perhaps.

When coming to a stop at a traffic light the engine often cuts out. Initially
I thought thought that the idle might be set too slow, but then I noticed that
once warmed up, the engine idles perfectly, and as he sat in the bus and
depressed the brake peddle, the engine slowed noticeably. Repeated a few times
(not pumping exactly), it stalled.

It seems obvious to me that this has to do with the brake booster/servo but
I'm unfamiliar with them and what could be causing this. Is it a vacuum leak
somewhere? Where should we start?

Regards,
Bruce
(My bus is a '71 without booster).
