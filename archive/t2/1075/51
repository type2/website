Well John, not everyone is maybe as mechanically inclined or experienced to
be the ultimate do-it-yourselfer to replace that "bit" that may be failing
on your switch.  In fact, you're in the minority.  In this economy, I (and
quite a number of Type 2 owners out there,) can appreciate and empathize
with your feelings to just replace what's breaking down on your 38 year old
switch.  I'm an owner (and former owner) of Type 2s stretching back to 1967
and I learned early-on about being self sufficient in the care, maintenance
and repair of the crazy little things that can go wrong.  Besides, I like to
tinker with stuff like this.  But there comes a time........

They're not designed to last forever and somewhere down the road one has to
eventually bite the bullit and spring for another good used switch (VW swap
meets get around $45 to $80 for a good useable switch), or a new one.
Before the VWG/Airhead Repro 68-71 switch was available, a brand new "in the
box" German SWF switch was commanding close to $250 - these days, if one can
be found, it's still in the high 100 to 200 bucks.  This is why almost 3
years and several thousand dollars of development of a reproduction
replacement switch was done by VWG/Airhead Parts and because there is a
demand by people who just want to replace the whole piece.

There is a number good reasons why that "bit" (and others) aren't available
to the public or even the mechanic........Here's the best way I can explain
it.....

Even clear back into the fifties, Volkswagen (or SWF for that matter,) did
not offered separate "bits" to repair a mechanical device like this because
it's not cost effective to carry such an enormous outlay of "bits and
pieces" in the inventory for their mechanics and the do-it-yourselfer to
take the large labor time frame to repair a defective or worn-out switch
like this.  It is (and it was back then) cheaper in the long run to replace
it to properly warranty the repair.  One of a few exceptions to this
is/was the wide variety of components made available by Bosch for their
electrical products (alas, in recent years, this "component availability"
has shrunk to less than a shadow of it's former self).

I remember 33 years ago when I first got into the auto parts biz that
separate "bits" and pieces for Turn Signal Switches were available for a
number of American cars - literally thousands of "bits".  And I remember
when thousands of these pieces of inventory were eventually consigned to the
dumpster because no one ever bought any.  The DIYers coming into the store
(and most shop mechanics) just didn't know how to take apart/repair the unit
or would have rather replaced the entire assembly to reduce the time
involved.  There has to be a balance between "bloated", rarely asked-for
"tiny bit" inventory and a complete assembly offered at as fair a
replacement cost to the public and so that the vendor can stay in business
to provide to the end-consumer.  The "shelf space" re-gained is utlized for
more asked-for product and diversification to better serve the end-consumer.

My ten cents worth ;-)
