Subject: Distributor and Pertronix Installation Question

Hello all,

having a "Pertonix Ignitor" unit lying around on the shelf for quite some
time, I finally decided to install it since the last experiences with points I
ordered were far from acceptable. Quality ranged from crappy points failing
after a few hundred miles to contacts that seated only on the edges. I
disassembled the dizzy, checked for play, greased the advance mechanism, etc.
I was wondering if there is a way to bench-test the dizzy prior to
installation (this is a stock SVDA for a '78 type4)? Of course, I can suck on
the vacuum advance port and see the advance mechanism working and also
reverse-rotate the upper dizzy part while keeping the lower part fixed to feel
the play of the centrifugal advance. But is there a more clever way? I thought
of placing an angle chart on top of the dizzy to actually measure the advance
in degrees... Having installed the Pertronix unit, I'm also quite unhappy with
the overall fitting. The magnet ring is so thick, it prevents the rotor (a
rev-limiting one) from properly seating all the way down on the dizzy drive.
What are your experiences with this setup? Should I take material off the
magnet ring or off the rotor or leave it as it is?
Any help is greatly appreciated!
Cheers,
Timo
