  is a super resource, and the one I used.

It says though :
" Installing the spring is another task requiring patience, so make 
sure your wife is still available for the inevitable. You'll need the 
thin nosed pliers and a dentist's pick or their equivalents. I found it 
easier to hook the spring on the more visible lever first (the other 
lever is obscured from view). Use your pliers to get the spring against 
the hook at the end of the lever, then work it onto the hook using the 
dentist's pick."

I suggest threading dental floss through ends of spring and pulling 
into place. Still a fiddly job. but you will be Sooooo pleased with 
results
