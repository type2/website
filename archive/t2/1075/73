Hi All,

Just food for thought when considering the design of your the trailer
hitch...  my 79Riviera has one in the rear welded to the frame- this is
great in that I suspect I can haul about anything I would want, yet bad
because nothing but the stock muffler will fit.

For a light weatherproof trailer, a have a friend who got a used Harbor
Freight trailer sim to this:
http://www.harborfreight.com/cpi/ctaf/displayitem.taf?Itemnumber=42708, and
he borrows my car top carrier

(sim to this:

but I got it for $20 at a yard sale), bolts it onto the trailer, and uses it
for hauling extra gear around.  It's compact, light, weatherproof, and
stable at highway speeds.

Cheers, Mike
