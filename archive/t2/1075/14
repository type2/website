Subject: RE: [T2] No to Petronix

I had Petronix and it worked well for a couple years then it failed. I'm
back to points but I would like to return to electronic ... sooooooooo ..
I'm looking for opinions on what is 1) the best and 2) the best in terms of
price vs. reliability. 

> I'd give John a call at aircooled.net about this. I have both the
Compufire and Pertronix in the buses and so far so good. I had to buy the
Pertronix from John last time as availability was scare for the Compufire.
No problems.
