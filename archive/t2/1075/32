Subject: Strange noise when rotating engine counterclockwise

Hey everyone,
I am rebuilding the top-end of my t4 stock 2 liter engine out of my 78 
bus and I have a question: I have pretty much everything done on the 
engine (heads on, valves adjusted, etc) and whenever I rotate 
counterclockwise past the #2 firing position, there is a slight clang of 
sorts from inside the case - not very loud, but noticeable. So, I 
loosened the nuts that hold the valve rocker shaft on the 3/4 side 
because I thought it was coming from there and the noise goes away. It 
seems as if I loosen either the 3 or 4 rocker arm shaft, the noise will 
go away as well, so it seems like it's doing it when the cam is loaded. 
I haven't tried tightening up the 3/4 side and loosening up the 1/2 side 
to see what happens..

Now, it only makes the noise as you pass through a certain part of the 
rotation turning counter clockwise (near firing position for #2). If you 
turn it 'till it makes the noise, spin it clockwise, it won't make the 
noise while spinning clockwise. Then if you turn it back counter 
clockwise, it will make the noise. I'm only turning the crank slowly 
about 20 degrees or so.

It almost sounds like something is shifting slightly... This is a used 
engine that has been run for about 70k miles and had a new cam and 
lifters at the time. I pulled off the lifters on the 3/4 side and they 
all look really clean except for 4e, it looks like it has some slight 
wear, but it wasn't loaded up during that particular rotation of the 
crank...

Soooo.. anyone have any thoughts?  should I even worry about it?

Mike
