Subject: Re: [T2] Hydraulic lifters in type 1 engine

Chris,

I had them on my 1914 motor. I especially liked that they made the  
motor very quiet. They should be coupled with a hydraulic cam. They  
tended to bleed down if parked for too long, just like a Type 4 motor.  
I am not sure what brand was used since the motor was built by MOFOCO.
