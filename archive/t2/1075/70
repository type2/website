Seriously, no problem with anything melting? 

Always seems our rear bumper gets HOT!

I agree about a good bike rack. Hobbled along with a 50% solution for years 
and then recently put a Yakima rooftop on our Honda. WOW. Nice improvement. 

Will eventually work something out so I can use those Yakima racks out front. 
Rooftop would be fun but I don't want to risk the bikes or the poptop to 
trees or bank canopies.
