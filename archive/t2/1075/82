So for the sake of clarification, here are a few pictures of my bumper
bracket and bumper mount to the frame...

1. Are the two tapped holes there for mounting a factory bumper or is that
where the bumper is supposed to be mounted?

2. The ripped out hole is where my bumper was originally mounted, which
seemed about as smart as bolting it to tin foil. Was this the correct place
for it to be mounted because the holes on the bumper mounting bracket will
NOT reach the two tapped holes that look to be the logical mounting spot
IMHO.

The other option I have for a hitch is the one that attaches to the engine
mount (which I can still do), but even it needs to be mounted to the bumper
as well.

Look forward to some insight!
