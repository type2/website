Subject: RE: [T2] 71 turn signal question

My '71 does this too - but the housing on the column is also loose.  So I have
to hold the lever down and hold the turn signal "body" on the column to keep
it from spinning.  It works OK going right as the body seems to catch on the
column, and the return works too.

going left is another story - have to hold it the whole time while turning
with my third hand while the first two steer and shift. 

You'd think I'd look for a new one...
