Subject: acrylic enamel, single stage urethane, or acrylic lacquer??

I'm going to be putting a coat of paint on my 77 Westy hopefully this summer, so I've started looking at paint options. These guys sell a decent product at a really decent price. My 77 Westy will never be a perfect resto, and I don't expect it to. I'm after a decent paint job I do myself, and if the bodywork isn't perfect that's ok with me, as I use it to camp, not to look pretty. Bearing that in mind, which paint system would be the choice of people on these two lists? I'm leaning towards the acrylic enamel at this point, but certainly want the wisdom of the list for input. I'm NOT interested in a two stage system, even though it's apparently a better system. I'm happy with the single stage paint the factory used back then; it's lasted 32 yrs so far. :-) The color is chrome-yellow, L-20A and this company mixes it in any paint system you want.
