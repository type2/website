Subject: 71 turn signals

The 71 turn signal switch is a known problem unit.  The circut board was broken in mine when I took it apart.  Seems to me the best option would be to update is with a universal heavy-duty unit like truckers would use.  It would be nice if someone re designed a unit to fit in the OEM housing...
