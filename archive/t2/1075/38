Subject: RE: [T2] 71 turn signal question

Blake
the housing is held tight with 2 grub screws - mine always loosened and 
fell out, and we were lucky to find them on floor. Now I have them in 
again and the holes plugged with 'museum wax" this is what we use to 
hold ornaments down for a small earthquake.  I can pull that off any 
time to service the levers, I think lock-tite would be a problem.

of course, the indicators still have to be held lightly to stay on!

John, '71 of course.
