Subject: RE: [T2] Trailer hitches

I have two of the Jamie Rivers hitches on my 78.  The front I use to
carry a two-bike bike rack, and on the rear I have a cargo rach that can
hold a couple of rubbermaid storage bins and a cooler, and it has
completely transformed for the better how we use the bus for camping; it
acts as a storage closet so we don't have wads of stuff cluttering up
the bus inside.

I towed a trailer full of gear from Seattle to Burning Man & back a few
years ago, as well.  Not sure I'd do that again, but it made it, no
problem.
