vacuum advance dizzy is always a better bet (assuming it's in good 
working order).

You can't do that as the pertronix for the 009 is different than the one 
that goes in the vacuum advance distributor - at least I'm pretty sure 
that's the case.  If not, then put it in the vacuum advance distributor 
and throw the 009 back in the junk pile.

Try it with the stock dizzy and see how it runs.  Make sure it's working 
nice and then go from there.  Anything will be an improvement over the 009.
