Wow, you're lucky - mine don't even stick in place - I have to hold them
when I turn.  I've taken mine apart and cleaned with electrical spray,
but otherwise I'm looking for an answer to why mine don't click into
place at all.  Not looking to hijack the thread, just seems like a
similar issue.

My turn signals work.



My question is that the left one clicks back after you turn left and
straighten up but the right one doesn't spring back that well (it
sometimes just stays blinking 'right turn) is their any adjustment
internally to get this working better, my first thought is just to clean
it.
