Subject: 71 turn signal question

Similar situation here.

My turn signal works for the left turn.

I have to hold it in place for the right turn.

I've taken it apart, cleaned it, lubed it, and put it back together  
with no improvement.

It's a complicated array of springs, levers, cams, contacts, sliders,  
etc. that I still haven't quite figured out.

At 38 years of age, I guess it is gonna go wonky somehow.
