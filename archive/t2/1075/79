Subject: Re: [T2] sliding window track seals

Jon -

The track seals, which are on the top and front of the window frame are the
same as what is used on the Vanagon Sliding Windows.  VOA says it's not
obsolete, but there are none in North America right this moment and must be
ordered from the fatherland.  They're not cheap.  Bus Depot shows them at
over $48 each (!)  The dealer ain't much better.

As a matter of info, the nylon/plastic guides that mount on the bottom of
the glass/track, also used on Buses and Vanagons (up to Mid 87) have been
obsolete for over a decade.  There have been folks I've spoke to over the
years that say the Late 87-91 nylon guide will work, but has to be slightly
trimmed around it's outer diameter to slide into the metal track with abit
of super glue (when you trim it, you ruin the locking "flares" that keep it
in place while sliding the window back and forth).  Those (281 847 723 B)
are available from VW for around a couple bucks each.
