Subject: RE: [T2] 71 turn signal question

well I am not going to spend $100 on a complete setup! I have the 
lever, the housing. the wiring and the inside . Why cant they just sell 
the bit that is failing, not the whole thing.  Surly someone by now has 
pinpointed the worn bit? Is it the little springs?  I remember 
replacing tiny springs in the door locks and for v. little money, but 
lots of time. Now  I have doors that key open even if someone has 
pulled the trigger.
