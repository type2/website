Now that Crane has been acquired by S&S Cycle does anyone know if they are
going to continue the ignition line of Crane products?  Warranty the Crane
products. I think the ignition retard module looks interesting  Crane #
6000-6425.  Would be useful on hot days in heavy traffic or steep hills to
take a degree or two off the advance. jon
