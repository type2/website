For lightweight trailer shells I recommend "stitch and glue" (boat building
technique) using 3mm Okume plywood.  Cover this with a single layer of epoxy
and 6 ounce cloth.  Stronger than you would believe if you put some curves
into the design.  A search on "poor man's vacuum bagging" (a super technique
from the homebuilt aircraft folks) will show you how to produce a
ready-to-paint surface, with minimal sanding and grinding, and minimize your
epoxy bill.  I have some links, but will need to dig them out. 

I also second the car-top carrier on a fold-up HF trailer.  Practical, pretty
weather-tight (I drove mine ( boxy, lightweight, Sears S-cargo) from CA to AK
in January without any water getting in), garage sale item, especially around
campus.  Allows the trailer to be a flat bed for other projects. jon
