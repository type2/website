Mine is also acting up and I have just lived with it for years (71 -
surprise!)  Has anyone bought one of these repros?  I ask because  these are
listed for 68-71 and I thought there were differences througout those  years.

Repo is here, Busdepot appears to have them also

You all should  talk to Wolfsburg West. Maybe there is enough of a market
for
a repro.
