Subject: Re: [T2] Engine cutting out with brakes..

Somewhere in the archive you will find a refernce to a torn Diaphram on the 
bosster, when you press the brake pedal you open up a massive vacuum leak, 
thus stalling the engine.  On Polly (74 twin carb 1800), replacing the 
booster did the trick.  IMPORTANT, one cause of failiure is misfiring or 
whatever causing a pressure bubble and ripping the diaphram, VW thought of 
this and included a small valve in the vacuum line near the engine.  Sadly 
folks replacing their vacuum lines miss it out, and pop goes the booster!
