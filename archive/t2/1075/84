Hi Jason,

I have that style of hitch; I've been using it for about 10 years now. I
was told it was originally from westfalia but there are no markings to
verify that. It bolts to the bottom of the "ears" on the engine hanger
bar, and the tongue bolts to the bumper for support.

It is strong enough to lift the tail of the bus from the ball of the
hitch. I have successfully towed other buses with it. (Slowly, and with
LOTS of braking distance!) It also plays nicely with a variety of stock
and aftermarket exhaust systems, including the custom Harley Davidson
pipes, the large 72-74 stock muffler, the empi dual muffler and the
header-style single-muffler setup. The only downside is that it adds an
extra 6 bolts to be attended to when doing an engine pull.

Here's the pics:
