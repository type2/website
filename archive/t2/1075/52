Hi Jim

all your points are well taken, and thanks for the time you put into 
your answer.

But I hate to have any mech thing defeat me, so I really would like to 
know what the 'bit' in question might be. Like others I did the 
cleaning, and got a slight improvement, but I feel it is just a worn 
down plate.

and I was surprised and glad I could get those tiny door lock springs; 
from a VW dealer too.  Lots of fiddly work, but worth it, and I learned 
more uses for dental floss.

and I hate the death of hardware stores where one could rummage in 
boxes for just the right  nut or bolt.

cheers
-John
