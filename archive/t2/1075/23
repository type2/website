Subject: Need the knob to hold my spare tire cabinet on, in my 77 Westy

I've been to Samba, etc, and sent of many emails but no-one seems to have one. This is the knob/bolt that comes down vertically from the top, and holds the top of the spare tire cabinet on. It is right behind the drivers seat in my 77 Westy. 
Does anyone have one they are parting out, or seen one in a yard? I'm tired of using a normal screw that doesn't fit.
Thanks,
Courtney
