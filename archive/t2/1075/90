Subject: EGR box speedo

Hi all,

I'm trying to help a new VW friend. He has a speedo on a 78 VW that just
stopped working. He says he can disconnect the cable and insert an allan
wrench into the speedo to get the needle and odometer to work, but when he
reinstalls the speedo, it won't work. I just read the comment about the worn
grease cover. Has anyone had the same problem? Any comments would be
helpful.

Thanks for the advice.

Bob Pratt
