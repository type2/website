Mark,
The last time my the electrical portion of the ignition switch went bad, the
gen light came on.  This time it doesn't, other when trying to start like it
is supposed to.  Is this not a necessary sign for this malfunction?

    Hello Guys   Anyway you do this put a fuse in there . If you have a short
with the hot lead to the coil it can melt the wire all the way back to the
ingnition switch.  I think that snoopys switch probably has gone bad   later
and have fun  mark Dearing
