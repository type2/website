Subject: my three oil temp gauges

i have these three oil temp gauges, all 2.25".
1]vdo: measures to 300*; light bulb socket, and three contact posts [2 at
top, 1 bottom]
2]westach: measures to 250*; no light bulb, three contact posts [one top, 1
bottom, 1 bottom left] and 2 thin blue wires coming out of bottom right.
one of the blues is hitched to the bottom right post, the other hangs free.
3]stvrk: measures to 250*light bulb socket; one thin copper wire cased in
black - cut at about 2 feet.

kinda different huh? here are my questions. why just one black wire coming
out of the last gauge?  which one is best quality?
