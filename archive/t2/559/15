Does Coker carry the reinforced sidewall tire that the Bus requires...
White wall or not...Even at their hefty prices...?-(
From what I gather on other lists, Coker is for "collectable" or show
car owners who want correct or period tires...Street cars are probably
better off using modern tires (J. C. Whitney probably still carries white
wall inserts. tho' ... ?-)
