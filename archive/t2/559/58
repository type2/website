Subject: clutch problem

I seem to be having a clutch problem.. tranny shifts fine, but when I step
on the clutch you can hear a grinding sound and a whine.  The clutch was
adjusted per Bentley, but not sure what is happening now.  This clutch is
only a little over a month old.  The one before was only 4 months old when
it started almost the same thing and totally burned and shredded apart.  Any
ideas would be appreciated.  The bus is a 72 with a carbed 2L.
Thanks
