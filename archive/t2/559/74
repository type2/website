This is a special tube that has a special size and material. The 
replacement tube is a blue tubing with a cloth cover. I don't know who 
sells it now. I would always call Ron at the Bus Depot first and he can 
prob. get it.

That said, the previous stuff on mine was clear plastic tubing that looked 
like large aquarium tubing. It was on there for at least 10 years. It was 
quite a bit too small but someone, prob. my dad, had heated it and 
stretched it over the fittings to get a tight fit. When I took it off it 
was hard as nails but didn't leak.

Good luck! Use the right stuff if you can get it. But if you can't, I am 
sure you can rig something.
