Subject: Help with seat belt parts.

Howdy

I took the seat belts out of the westy this weekend to clean them up good.

In the process I found that I am missing one cover for one of the rear 
seatbelts.
It has the VW symbol on it and the part number REPA 01.0050.0

Also when I took the front passenger seat shoulder belt off the bolt holding 
it onto the door jam  was pretty snug the whole way out.
When I finally got it out I found a stripped bolt and bolt hole.
So I need the bolt also....if you have the plastic washers that go with it 
that would be great too.
The bolt is approx. 1 1/4 inches long with a 1/4 collar on it.

Can somebody let me know what size/pitch tap I will need to tap out the hole 
so I can get one.

Pictures of the parts I need can be found here:

Hopefully somebody has these laying around in good shape.
Let me know how much.

Thanks
Kevin
