Subject: Coils, fuel filters, enriching solenoid, sensor, OH MY!

I found the fuel filter. It was snuggled up against the fuel tank. That was 
a fun job (and gasoline does NOT feel good soaking into your armpit!!!!) 
Here's the one I pulled: http://www.donimages.com/1973bus/cloggedfilter.jpg  
It's just a little BLACK. I didn't get a new filter yet, so the cheapie 
(even cheaper than that one) I had went in for now. Anybody have a part 
number available at Autozoned or PepBoys or something that has the right 
sized fittings? Maybe a metal one?

Earlier I had asked about my coil being hot. Well, I decided to test it 
today. The secondary tested oddly. My multimeter flashed 4500 ohm, then 
zeroed (no continuity). Primary hung at 25 ohm, way lower than what the 
Bentley said it should be. Again, anybody know a part number I can get at a 
chain store that is known to work well with my 73 with points?

I'm assuming this sensor I found with the wire going nowhere is an oil 
pressure sensor. Straight behind the dizzy? I want to rewire it...

My cutoff solenoids are all kicking. That's good. But that enriching 
switch/solenoid/thing (the rectangular box on the left carb) doesn't seem to 
do anything when 12v is applied to it. I pulled it off, and it rattles. 
Applying power does nothing. Bently is silent about this too except to 
include it in the carb diagram. Any tips on testing it? What exactly does it 
do (how does it function)?

Again, thanks for your time all!
