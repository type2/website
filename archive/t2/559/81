Subject: One final question. :) (about starters)

Ok, anyone  know their starters really good? :) The PO had taken out the
starter, and taken off the solonoid becouse it was sticky (yep, I'm
gonna do the relay thing). But when I put it back together I didn't know
witch way the solonoid went, so I just guessed that the braided cable
from the starter went to the short post. So then I have the long post
furthest away from the starter motor. 
 
So now I have 2 posts, one long, one short. I have a single blade
connector on one side witch has a very skinny threaded post behind it,
then on the other side, I have what looks to be 2 bladed connectors
witch seem to be connected on the bottom to each other. Then underneith
their, I have a heavy gauge wire coming from the battery. Another Heavy
gauge wire coming from I think up front, another smaller, but still
heavy wire coming from I'm not sure where. Those all have the circle
connectors obviously made to go onto one of the two BIG posts. Then I
also have 2 female bladed socket couplers. 
 
Now what I would REALLY love is if someone could take a picture of
their starter with clean wires so I can see the color codes and where
they go. Failing that could someone please tell me where everything
goes? Preferably by wire color code. Like "The black one with a red
stripe goes on the long post", that type of thing. I know, I know, I
need to get the books. I've ordered them, and I'm waiting for them to
arrive. But I'm impatient, and I've borrowed a compression tester and
some other stuff to start testing stuff out and I REALLY need to get
that starter to crank before I can really start on anything else. 
 
It's a early (7th week of production) 1976 2.0L Fuel Injected with a
manual tranny and a rebuilt bosch starter (starter has rebuild sticker
on it)
