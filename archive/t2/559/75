Hm.  I have actually used that cabinet on trips ... but your suggestion 
gets me to thinking...

4x10" are not so hard to get... Sony makes a decent one, XS-W4121.

I wonder how difficult to build a small wedge that could hang down from 
the overhead cabinet to hold these... 4" is not very tall...

Alternatively, a 4" wide wedge for the speakers to be mounted 
vertically in the rear corners of the Bus might not be a bad idea, 
either...
