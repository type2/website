Common causes of shifting problems in a manual...
 
1) MAYBE low tranny oil (GL4 (not GL5)  80W or 90W hypoid gear oil, NOT automatic tranny fluid)
2) Missing shift linkage bushings (esp. the front one, easy fix)
3) Worn shift coupler on the front of the tranny.
4) Gear shift lever needs adjustment.
5) Clutch needs adjustment.
6) Worn out tranny.
7) Worn out clutch.
8) Loose tranny-to-engine nuts.
9) Broken engine mounts.
 
1-5 & 8 are easy fixes, see the Bentley manaul and the T2 library. But check the clutch adj. first. I have personally experienced most of these problems, except #6
