Rus,

Always pick the least complicated possibility first!

Generally something that the p.o. wired in to the always
hot wires in the front...like a radio or cd player that
uses the battery to maintain the memory in the radio.

Admittedly, this would be a *big* drain to make it die overnight, but 
always possible.

Otherwise, start by disconnecting the positive terminal on the 
battery and then pulling all the fuses.

Then measuring if there is any *voltage* between the positive terminal 
cable and the positive terminal on the battery.

*Then* evaluate where that cable goes and what might actually still be
connected thru the main power cable.

Cheers, dave
