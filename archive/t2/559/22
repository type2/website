Your mechanic is smoking crack... and you're engine will soon be
smoking, too.

Time your distributor according to what MODEL ENGINE you have, not the
distributor.

However, if you've got an aftermarket distributor, you probably want
your total max advance to go no higher than what a stock distributor on 
that engine would time to.

make sense?
