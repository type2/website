Subject: Book Timing or Mechanics Advice Timing????

I finally got the correct distributor with two vacuum hoses for my '73 manual transmission with CB engine.

Haynes says at idle time it 10 ATDC for automatic,  5 ATDC for manual.  The library says 10 ATDC for a CB engine. The mechanic says time it at 38 BTDC at high idle.

38 BTDC gives great power but pings at low RPM.  5 ATDC gives less ping at low RPM with a slight loss of power.  10 ATDC pings verrrrry slightly at low RPM but with less power again.

At any of these settings changing to a lower gear eliminates the ping.

I'd rather have an engine that lasts than one with power.  38 BTDC gives the best power and economy.  What should I do.

Thanks,

Ian
