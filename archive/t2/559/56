Subject: Re: [T2] carb question

Zach, I'm with you, man. My 71 1776 dual Kadron setup lets me reach
the right hand mixture screw only. The doghouse is totally in the
way of the left hand carb's screw. I asked the nice guys at RAMVA
for suggestions on how to "remote" the adjustment and a lot of ideas
were tossed around, including magic bendy screwdrivers. The best
idea there was to shove a bit of fuel line hose (or other) over the
head of the screw, and bring the other end rearward so you can grab
'n' turn. John at aircooled.net claims you can reach around the left
carb with two hands and grab that screw between opposing fingers. I
need to try that. Will discover how hot is is in there.

Curious how thick is the Head of the Adjusting Screw? 1/4", 3/8"(Metric 
Equiv.) Is it thick enough to Drill a hole through on the Side? Is so you 
could probably pop down to the local Tattoo/Piercing shop and pickup a Small 
Diameter "Barbel" (Stainless Steel or Titanium) that could pass through. 
Drill your hole on a press, remove one of the threaded balls, insert into 
the hole, replace ball, voila. Should work like the end of a C-Clamp, slide 
handle. Just a possibility.

TravelOn,
