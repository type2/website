Subject: Re: [T2] Richard Atwell's website

This is a nice idea, Steve, but I'm going to guess that Richard's 
Cupertino home address means he has some relationship with Apple and 
may be loyal to dot-Mac.

I'm also a really poor administrator, so I'd best not start a 
collection.

But how about some sort of "best bus content website of the year" award?
