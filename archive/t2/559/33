Subject: Update: Shakes and Shudders 

Well I just thought I would provide a bit of a clarification -
I too thought this was due to fuel tank issues, so the tank itself has been 
checked - no chunks inside and no varnish.  All hoses were replaced and I 
replaced the filter recently (which did not affect the performance).  Also 
more recently filling up the fuel tank has had no effect on reducing the 
problem (which it had seemed to early on).

The part that set this apart from me was the rpms.  When the problem becomes 
prolonged (for a few seconds) it becomes very noticable that the engine revs 
much higher.  For example I would be traveling at 65mph at about 3000 rpm on 
the highway and then with the loss of power (and thus of speed) I would 
notice the engine was at about 5000 rpm.  When the power returned the engine 
would slow down to 3000 rpm again.  This seems to point to some sort of 
transmission issue - since (and correct me if I am wrong) I thought that due 
to the gear ratios at a specific speed in a specific gear I should have a 
specific engine speed (rpms) - the fact that they rise up like that would 
mean that the engine is "detached" from the transmission...

Thanks for any help you can give me - as well as the previous suggestions.
