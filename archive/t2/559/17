Subject: Re: [T2] no spark :(

I took Bill's advise and tried this again. It didn't work before we switched
out the coil and condenser but does now.  I shall be looking for a short
tomorrow.  But at least I can drive to work  :)

Thanks to all for all the advise and suggestions..

  If you need to get to work tomorrow you can make a jumper wire from the
postive side of  you battery to the coil. You will still need the key to turn
the starter and keep the steering unlocked. You will have to remove the jumper
to turn the bus off though.
  Just don't leave power on without it running to long or you will burn up the
points.
