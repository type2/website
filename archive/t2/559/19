Folks,

Thanks for the kind words and the offers of support but keep in mind that storage space and bandwidth for my website is currently free and I wouldn't think of taking donations to support it.

I'm near the 100MB limit of free space right now but managing until I have the time and need to host the website under it's own domain. I will have to locate a server that can support the volume of traffic it receives in an affordable manner so until that time free is a very good deal.

I'm planning to spend the next couple of years enjoying my bus from the driver's seat rather than from behind the camera lens so I don't expect it to grow more than another 5-10MB in the short term.

If you want to send money, please donate to the type2 list as Phil suggests and support this great resource from which we all continue to benefit from.
