Subject: no spark :(

I was driving my 71 single cab home today and she cut off in traffic, after
a few tries she started back up and ran fine for a few miles then stalled
again, started right back up then stalled after 15 feet and won't start
again.  :(

Fortunately a guy driving a 72 bug stopped and he helped me check for spark
as one of us turned the engine over.  There was none. So he gave me a ride
to the parts store, (super nice guy that had moved here from England)  I
bought a new coil, condensor, rotor and points.  Put it all in and still no
spark???

What else can I check?  All the wires seem to be hooked up correctly.
Nothing loose. It gets gas.

I am running a stock 1600 with a stock solex carb.

Thanks in advance for any ideas...

And thanks to AAA for the ride home...

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
