Subject: Re: [T2] Hydraulic lifters - mistake to replace?

It is a guessing game.  Some may have done it, and have been lucky, others
not so lucky. but without knowing what the cam is or where it came from, you
are guessing whether the materials are "matched".  Could be fine, maybe not.

When i did my rebuild, i swapped from hydraulic cam and lifters to solid cam
and lifters.  No more irritating rattle, when i hear a knock now, i cannot
attribute it to a lifter bleeding down, i know it is more
serious..............
