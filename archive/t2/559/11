Subject: Re: [T2] Richard Atwell's website

You know someone really autta buy Richard some hosted web space so 
www.RichardAtwell.com  can have a home. His site is an invaluable 
resource of information and inspiration when you have taken something 
apart and feel like its a long road until its back together.

Anyone want to start a collection ?
