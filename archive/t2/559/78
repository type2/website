and what did VW do if a lifter failed????
anything can fail,  but the current cam is already matched to the other 6
lifters and when the lifter fails what is the option.....

I don't think anything would ever get me to go back to solid lifters. the
two jobs I ALWAYS hated about a VW was adjusting valves and points

a 78 comes stock with hyd lifters and I want em to stay that way
and I put a pertronix in the dizzy,  so after 12 years with my current bus
and about 70,000 miles on the current rebuild.....and 322,000 on the bus
