Nothing is expanding or heating up to cause this in your tranny. If 
anything, I would crawl under there and make sure that your tranny mounts 
are tight. Also check the mounting bolts at the shifter. You might have to 
move the shifter slightly left or right to help it out. I had exactly the 
same problem and it was a cracked front tranny mount. Not the steel, but 
the rubber mount had cracked slightly. My problem was it wouldn't shift 
into 2nd unless accelerating. You had to hold the shifter back while 
hitting the gas, revving the engine a little to get it in. I replaced the 
rubber, adjusted the front (the busted rubber let it move 1/8 inch or so 
and banged the front shifter out of adjustment) and all was right with the 
world again. But check the shifter first, it is prob. simple.
