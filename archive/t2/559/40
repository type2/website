Subject: Re: [T2] Richard Atwell's website

From: Stevie Havoc

You know someone really autta buy Richard some hosted web space so
www.RichardAtwell.com  can have a home. His site is an invaluable
resource of information and inspiration when you have taken
something apart and feel like its a long road until its back
together.

Anyone want to start a collection ?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I will contribute. Where do you want to start?  I use Richard's Site and 
"help at times" almost if not more so than I use my Bentley(of course I do 
consult Bentley he is always hanging around my shop). What a wealth of 
information! Detail is where it's at and Richard's site goes beyond the 
detail of most sites and manuals, being a combination of them both. Then 
there is the hard to find stuff the tools and gadgets(that's one of my 
favorite parts). "Where does he get those wonderful toys."

Count me In,
