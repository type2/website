Hi Jason,

Depends on how committed you are to the "head banger" cabinet over the 
rear cargo area.

I used a pair of 4x9" speakers installed into the cover that hides the 
hatch springs. They sound great, and you can always hear them 
regardless of how heavily loaded the westy gets. 4x9's may be a bit 
harder to find, but they are also a lot easier to find places to 
install into. IIRC mine are made by pioneer, and originally came out of 
an early 80's buick.
