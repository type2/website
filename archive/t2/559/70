Hiya Kevin,

From your pictures I'm guessing 1970.  Is that right?

I have all of that stuff (well, the 1970 version of it), albeit in 
questionable condition.  You might want to contact Joe at Busted Bus for parts in a 
little more respectable condition.  However, if that is a no-go for whatever 
reason and you like my prices (postage and handling) better, drop me a p-mail and 
I'll see what's out there hiding in my Seat Belts box.
