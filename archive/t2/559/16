Hi Volks,

I need to add a second fuel output line on my fuel tank in order to 
install Bosch L-Jet FI on the westfakia.  I have removed the original 
fitting that screws onto the tank, and was wondering where I could 
source a replacement part with 2 lines out instead of one.

Swapping the tank is not an option, as finding an FI tank in Toronto on 
short notice isn't very likely.  If anyone can help describe this part 
(thread pitch, proper name) it would be appreciated.


Happy trails,
