An even easier way to prevent the battery from moveing is to get a plastic
battery box from someplace like Pep Boys. Runs like 6-8 bucks,used for
trailers or boats, keeps anymore acid from rusting out whatever floor is
still there. The one I had in the 70 was a perfect fit and didnt move at
all. Also keeps the cables from grounding on tools or whatever else you
might be probeing around with back there.
