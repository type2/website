Subject: Fw: [T2] Cheap timing light/tach-dwell meter and other tools?

I would get a cheap volt/ohm meter (I have seen them as cheap as $5.00) and
use that to static time the bus.  Instead of a dwell meter use feeler gauges
to set points and use your ear instead of a tach to set idle.  I did that
for 20 years before I finally bought a timing light.  I still don't have a
tach/dwell meter.
