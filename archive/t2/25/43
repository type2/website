Subject: Re: Fw: [T2] Cheap timing light/tach-dwell meter and other tools?

Volks,

Thomas has an excellent set of points. (and a good condensor, too :-)
Some additions:

This is fine for a type1 engine, thru '71 in the U.S.  If you have a type4
engine, tho, you really need a timing light.  Sunpro makes one that is
fine for our application.  A quick search on the internet turns up a post
on the Miata list (http://www.realbig.com/miata/miata/1998-01/3887.html)
that sez you can get them at western auto for $29 or thereabouts.

Second, Barry Burneskis found someone who was selling a sunpro ignition
analyzer for ~$15 that included V-O-M and dwell functions, a longtime
dream of mine!  I piggybacked on his order, so I don't know the source...
Barry?

Third, If you have a V-O-M and don't have cash, you can set dwell using it
as a dwell meter by setting it to low DC volts, connect the red wire to
the condensor lead on the coil, the black to the engine case or body
(ground) and then look for 6.67 volts, which translates to 50 degrees of
dwell while cranking or running.
