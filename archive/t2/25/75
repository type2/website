Hi All,

Has anyone found a great place for VW stock items,
other than Carlsen's Audi (Calif), and Bus Depot?

Just finished drilling out my exhaust manifold to
remove one broken stud, and allow the exhaust pipe to
mount with no leaks (82 diesel Westy).  As I
discovered, the trick is to not even try to unloosen
the nuts on the manifold studs.  I ended up using a
nut buster and hacksaw to get them off.  It was
awkward to keep the nut buster in place, but it
worked.  Has anyone used an electric hammer drill and
chisel attachment to cut through rusted nuts?  I'm
looking for something better than the nut buster,
particularly if I ever have to replace the exhaust
manifold, which is held to the block by 8 rusty nuts.

In the process, I noticed two of the three shock
mounts for the muffler were broken.  The local VW
dealer wants $34 each, Bus Depot $25, and Carlson Audi
wasn't open to check their price.  Any other parts
places with good inventory and prices?
