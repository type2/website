I just sold a really great 1981 Westy for $3500.00 to the first person
that drove it. I would consider it nicer than the 83 Westy that I've been
driving for seven years but I just put a new engine and about 800$ more
in restoration parts on my 83 so it was a hard decision of wheather to
sell the 81 or the 83 and I know there are not buyers for the price I'd
like to have for the 83. You can see the 83 at  
http://williamwareagency.com/forsale/stanvan/83westy.htm
If you want to see the 81 I'll post the picture gallery again at your
request.
