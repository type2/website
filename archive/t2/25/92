I just bought a 79 that had been sitting since 95 . I replaced the fuel tank
and all the lines because of the rust and the varnished gas. The fuel pump
worked, but ran slow, so I soaked it in WD40 overnight and it now runs fine.
I didn't have any fuel injector problems, the engine started up first turn
of the key.

Good luck,

Joey
