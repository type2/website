Subject: Value of roof rack??

Hi, all,

A lad wants to buy the roof rack off my parts bus, but I have no idea of the 
value. can someone help me?

It is a full-length rack made of round tube (not home-made, but I am not 
certain if it is a VW part... better think it's an aftermarket one). It is 
sound but rusty.

Any idea of what it's worth?

I'm on digest, so if you'd be so kind, I'd apreciate a direct reply.

Thanks a zillion/Don Carron
