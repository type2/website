Subject: Re: [T2] child's cot brackets

Hoo-boy, good question. I don't know what they came out of but IIRC the
bars are not collapsible. They're going into the 73, though, and I'm pretty
sure the cot is out of something earlier, as were the rest of the interior
parts.

So it sounds like what you're saying is I should probably not go with a
point to point measurement (which would vary from year to year) but should
gauge where to put the brackets by the relationship of where the horizontal
poles meet the vertical pillars and hope for the best.
