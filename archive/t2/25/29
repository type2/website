  Nikki, the problem is that the Solex carbs on a 72-73 are very hard to get
to work right when worn out and there are no parts available. Also these
buses are underpowered and expensive to work on for what they are. I look in
Cali all the time and 72-73 are available for give away prices, regardless
of smog laws. The people I know buying them are upgrading to 2 litre and
using the earlier vin to get around smog. It's an expensive propsition to
buy a bus then swap out drivtrains.  I have cut up and thown away at least
10 72-74 bay windows in the last 3 years. I couldn't give them away, hell
they were all given to me!!

ps. The people back east and the midwest would chastiz me if they saw what I
cut up or had hauled to the wrecking yard. But as I mentioned, I still have
bays that I would love to get rid of. Most have been stripped of parts now
to help other bays out though. Free shells if you want them.

Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie! You need to focus on the Cal buyers -- 72 and 73
oughta move because you don't have to smog anything prior to 74 (last I
checked). I was at my mechanic's once when a guy came in looking for a 73
to replace his 74 because he was tired of having to smog it, and obviously
73 is the newest pre-smog model you can get.
