This Bus is actually a '70 based on the side marker lights.  It looks too
good to go to the crusher. 

Let me take a little poll here.  Does anyone own a '70 sunroof bus that IS
NOT Savanna Beige?  I'm starting to feel like my '70 sunroof Bus is the most
common version on the planet.  The up side to that is that I should be able
to find the one year only brown interior parts I need.
