Subject: bad tune up



Hi,

I just had my 79 rivirea completely tuned up yesterday.. and it looks like
they did a crappy job.  So I have a few questions...

1. Can anyone recommend a good mechanic in Sacramento Ca. that I can use in
the future.

2. I now smell gasoline.. keep in mind that they did replace the fuel
filter, but for how long should a gasoline smell be present?
 
3 . My bus seems to "miss", or lose a bit of power at certain rpm's.  For
example, when I am in 3rd gear at about 32 to 35 mph it skips a beat.

Any ideas on what may be wrong?  I would take it back to the mechanic, but I
think I have a better shot of getting it right if I just do the work myself.

Thanks again,
Nick
