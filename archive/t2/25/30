Dear Jane,

I've heard different stories from different Mexican insurance companies in
this regard. Some have insured me for collision too, some have refused.
Fortunately the one time we hit something (a cow- totalled my bus-DON'T
drive at night down there!)), I had collision insurance. They asked me to
state the value of the bus and didn't second guess me. I was skeptical of
their conclusion that the damage constituted "Totaled", but you don't have
much bargaining power when you're in that situation in someone else's
country. That was also a few years ago. I think that was BAJAMEX
insurance.

In general, Mexican auto insurance is easy to purchase at border towns. It
usually sells buy the day and last time I checked was going for something
on the order of $7-$10/day. But I've also heard that if you're going for
longer, there are more cost effective longer term policies to buy. This is
one thing you should look for for a 2 month trip. I've heard of one called
Vagabundos de (Mexico? Baja?) that used to do this.

I recommend you consult some of the good Baja info websites. Start with
this one for Amigos de Baja. There are a lot of Mexico afficionados out
there who can point you the right way.

Bien viaje y buena suerta. I wish I were going to Mexico in my bus for 2
months this fall!
