Subject: Insurance for 1974 in Mexico

I am planning a two month camping trip down to Mexico (from Canada) in a 
1974 Westfalia.

The problem is not in Canada or the USA - any insurance you buy from here 
(or USA) is not valid once you cross the border.  You must have Mexican 
insurance to be valid in Mexico.  So far the information I have found 
indicates that I can only purchase liability insurance for any vehicle older 
than 20 years.  It is my understanding that Mexico goes by the Blue Book 
value and anything that old is deemed "worthless" regardless of appraised 
values etc.  I gather insurance companies think they are too expensive/hard 
to fix.

I am very concerned about collision and theft - does anyone have any 
experiences with an older vehicle in Mexico and insurance and/or accidents?  
  Any advice for what we can do?
Thanks, Jane

PS - I am new to this list - and hope that I'm not breaking any rules.  
Please let me know if I do!
