Subject: Re: [T2] cheap tools

I like cheap tools for another reason, illustrated by the following example.
A couple of years ago, I bought a Harbor Freight airbrush for less than $10.
I always thought of airbrushes as somewhat silly appliances for making
1970's style van murals, but for such a cheap price I thought I'd play with
it and throw it away.  It turned out to be an amazing little tool, perfect
for doing paint on small parts.  Of course the one I bought at HF was junk
and its o rings quickly eroded in automotive laquer thinner, but not before
I got a clear idea of what it could do.  I threw it away and bought a good
Iwata on ebay for $75, which I have been using ever since.

If I had had to shell out $75 in the first place, I'd never have bought it,
and I'd never have known about something that's been very important to my
restoration work.

Regards,

Grant
