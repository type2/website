Hi All,

I posted a couple of weeks back, about our club's (www.vwt2oc.org.uk) show
VANFEST. Well the shows over now and it was probably the best VANFEST ever.

Numbers were well up on last year with literally thousands of VW campers
turning out. The sun shone and the campers glistened and everyone had a good
time.

So if you want to see some of the happenings at a British VW show then point
your browsers at www.vanfest.org for a full report.
