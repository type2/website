Subject: plastic sheeting-cab door goo

hi all - i am getting set to hang door panels for the first time since i
have had my doublecab. plastic sheet was long gone. here's a friday-type
question: what sort of adhesive has best proven itself to stick plastic
sheets to the cab doors. i was hoping to find something like the goo vw
used, since it was pealable and repealable, and repealable again. standing
by for this vital vw info.   - steve
