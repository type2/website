Subject: Carb Synch, am I doing it right?

Well, after owning a dual carb(dellorto frd34's) bus for 
some five or so years now, I finally decided I should be 
sychronzing my own carbs. I ordered one of the less 
expensive uni-syn models. The other day I finally got 
around to trying it out. With the engine idling, placing 
the unit on top of the carb causes it to slow down 
almost to the point of stalling.The little red thing in 
the tube doesn't budge. The uni-syn has a thumbscrew in 
the middle. The engine still tries to die even with the 
screw all the way out. I know the uni syn works, I was 
able to make the little red thing move up by sucking on 
it (before it had touched a carb)
The old Clymer manual that I have says to check 
sychronization at 2500-3500 rpm's. Bentley, the "idiot" 
book, and the delorto tech book all imply that it be 
checked at idle. 
Any advice will be greatly appreciated
thanks
