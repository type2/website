Subject: Re: Fw: [T2] Cheap timing light/tach-dwell meter and other tools?

Snap On timing light for $20 ?
I picked my timing light up for $20.00 and its a classic Snap On.
The pawn shops around Dallas TX always ask for more but I know how to say
NO and nobody uses timing lights or tach dwell meter anymore, everything
takes some type of adapter to plug into late model ignition modules.

I'm familiar with your e-mail address, I'll keep my eyes open and see if
I can get you a Sun, Allen or SnapOn for $20-25.
I just hate to see Made In China on any tool in my hand. Even Sears tools
have a value but nobody knows what a Chinese tool is worth, their quality
runs from none to very poor.
