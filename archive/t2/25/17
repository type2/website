If what I've just posted to the list on sloppy shifting doesn't tell you
enough then drop me a line directly

Good luck

Thanks a lot for the info

I've just been out to the bus and after struggling with an adjustable
spanner for what seemed like ages (I really must invest in some tools if I'm
going to try and do some work myself), I borrowed a neighbours socket set
and loosened the blolts.

I have adjusted the gearstick as per your instructions and I can now get it
into gear without any trouble at all.  Havent taken it on a test run yet,
but back and fore the driveway, it is definitely improved.

It is still going into reverse gear though without depressing the gearstick,
but I couldn't remember which way the lockout plate was supposed to go.  It
is set up with the notch to the right which I am assuming is right since the
lever goes left for reverse.  If this is correct then I guess it might just
need a little further adjusting (it certainly doesn't look worn), but I dont
want to change it until I know for sure.

So, could someone confirm the actual orientation of the lockout plate for
me??

Thanks again

Tammy

PS I'm amazed at how good it feels to have actually done something on the
van without running to the garage.  Okay it's not like I've dropped the
engine and carried out a major rebuild, but little steps and one day who
knows!!!!!
