Subject: Re: [T2] cheap tools

That was my point entirely
Here you have two young women with their first bus,and, without getting in
trouble for generalizing, what do you think the chances are of them opening
the engine compartment in the first place. Be like Muir and keep it simple
for them. Be honest now, how many of you actually used a timing light on
your first VW. I know I didn't, my first 40horse,crashbox,fiberglass buggy,
went togeather with the Craftsman beginner kit and broken knuckles. Now
being older and somewhat wiser, I no longer break bolts or bust knuckles,
but then the box is now almost all snap-on, but I had to start somewhere.
