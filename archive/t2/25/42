Subject: Fresh Meat in Baltimore MD

A 1979 9 passenger van at Crazy Ray's ( I know I should not advertise these 
hidden jewels of junkyards, but perhaps someone else might also be generous)

Check  www.switchboard.com for location.

Engine is mostly complete, with heat exchangers, crossover pipe, cat 
converter, muffler, straps, and EGR filter.

Complete, but heavy rust.

All nine seats are there, but a bit ragged.

This vehicle has the two exhaust tubes for the hot air from the heater 
control boxes, and it looks like the heater control boxes are the original 
style, too.

The fuel filler neck is torn and worthless, sorry.

This has only been at the lot a month, but it is already being picked over 
(me!!)

Good luck.  They ARE open Saturdays and Sundays, and it is a pink and pull 
lot.

BTW, there are FOUR Vanagons (three air cooled) at the Jessup lot.
