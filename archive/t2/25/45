Stan,

If you know a pawn shop that has a Snap On timing light for $20, please
let me know the phone #!!!!  I will call right now to buy it!  A quick
search of *bay tells me the price of Snap On timing lights is closer to
$150/$200, at least if the auction is within a day of closing.  Go there
and search "snap on timing light"

The Sunpro would not do for a professional mechanic, for whom a busted
timing light means losing a day's pay, but for a back-yarder, it is
perfectly adequate.  I have one and have been using it for a year or two.
The pickup is held together with duct tape, as I keep busting it up, but
it tapes rather well and keeps on flashing.  When the bulb goes, I will
toss it and buy another.
