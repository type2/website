Subject: Camper Prices going UP!

Sorry to report that my '78 camper was certified by State Farm Insurance to 
have a retail value of $6,600, and a salvage value of $600.

Prices of these things ARE going up, or so it seems to me.

Sunday a week ago there was a '79 BUS for $5,400 and a '72 camper for $5,250 
in the Washington Post, both on the same weekend.
