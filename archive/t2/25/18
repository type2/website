Subject: Friday Bus sightings question

Hey All,
Last night I was watching a documentary called "Tie Died - Rock n Rolls most Dedicated Fans" on the Trio channel (Direct TV) Anyway, it was this film-maker who followed around and interviewed Dead Heads at Dead shows.  They must have showed at least 75 to 100 different buses in this film. The film was made in the Summer of 1994.  Just curious, anyone out there on the lists have a bus that was shown in this film? Or were YOU on this film?  Just curious. BTW, it was a pretty interesting show and the network has played it a few times in the past year.  Even if you're not a Grateful Dead Fan, it's worth it just to check out all the buses.  HAPPY FRIDAY!
  



Peace, John Baker
