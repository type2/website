Err, I have a 3/4 drive Chinese flex handle that has held my Dad + me 
bouncing on it with the aid of a 10' black gas pipe (among other 
atrocities), sailed through. I have a Chinese socket set that has been 
my "main squeeze" through the past five years, was purchased open box at 
a K-Mart that was being closed down, cost (I think) twelve bucks, came 
with a monster 11" flex ratchet that I frequently bear on with all my 
strength, no failures ever. I have fixed a LOT of cars with it.

Admittedly "all my strength" may sound more formidable that it is in my 
particular circumstance, but still. =^ )

I believe the point of the thread was to try to help two young women who 
have purchased a bus, need tools to learn with, and have almost no 
money. Harbor Freight is carrying a 40-piece socket set for (read it) 
five DOLLars. It's probably not very good, but it is probably good 
enough. Open end wrench sets, 8 through 17 mm, six DOLLars. They're fine 
for the job at hand here IMO.

risks, but its contraries ensure disaster.
