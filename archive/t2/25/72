Look at the aft end of the rack.  If there's a blue sticker there it is an
aftermarket rack sold through dealers.

Well, these aren't nearly as valuable as the wood-slat variety.  In good
shape $100-200, but rusty would be less.  A lot has to do with where you
live and how often these racks become available.  I got mine for free from
a fellow who approached my wife in a supermarket parking lot.  He had one
but sold the bus and was tired of having it hanging in his garage!
