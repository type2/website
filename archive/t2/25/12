Subject: Re: [T2] Camper Prices going UP!

Asking price and the final sales prices vary a lot. Mostly based on Cash.
Most cash buyers are in the $3000.00 range in Texas.
It could be significantly higher in California or the East Coast but I'm
just not seeing on *-bay bidding.
I'm seeing 89 Vanagons going for $1500.00 and 81/ 83 Westys going for as
little as $2500.00 and as knowledgeable people we all know that the need
engines at these prices.
