They do seem to be long-lasting, if you take care of them.  Both my
tach/dwell meter and timing light are from Heathkit, which means that I
put them together myself.  That was many moons ago, and Heathkit is no
more.  The neat thing is that the Heathkit manuals also include detailed
troubleshooting instructions that allow me to fix the gadgets if they
ever need it.

I have a feeling that Muir got the idea for the idiot book from Heathkit
manuals.  The procedure style is certainly the same!
