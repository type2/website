Subject: Re: replacing front 73-79 bumper with 68-72 bumper(project report)

Hello,
     You are absolutely right. It is much easier to
replace the front bumper with its origional. It is
also less expensive and it would be the stock thing to
do. What can i say, I liked the look of the 68-72
style bumper. My old bumper was bent and the old
pannel that was behind it had large rusted holes
through it. I figured what the heck, I would give it a
shot. I guess I like projects. Thanks for the reply.
Have a nice day!:0)
