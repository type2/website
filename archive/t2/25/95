Subject: letting go


Letting go of a beloved VW is not easy, even if it is a '00 NB.  Our little
yellow LOVBUGG was loved and appreciated, but not what we now needed.
Facing facts, we traded her in and passed on our joy (and cell phone,
antenna ball, etc,etc) to another person or couple like us.  But as we
pulled out of the lot (driving two vehicles got traded her for), we both
agreed to find out how much a fellow down the street wants for his
dilapidated '71 bug, and that we would do what it takes to get my Westy
going good again.
