Subject: Re: Oil cooler project

I'm mostly wanting to build this passive type system that can be turned
on and off with a simple valve and not effect anything within the engine.
Foolish as it may seem I'd like to build this system as a potential of an
auxiliary heater for Air Cooled VWs.
I calculate that you got heat so just add a fan and in summer months just
turn off the valve.
Needless to say I've got some time on my hands that I'm trying to turn
productive.

 I've got an entire Type IV cooler system from my 79 loaf I'd 
be willing to part with.  Pmail me if youre interested.
