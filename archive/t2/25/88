Subject: Re: [T2] cheap tools

Cheap tools are good to throw in the spare parts boix in the VW, but when
you twist them all day, the "Paws" begin to feel it...

IO have ATLEAST 50 K$ in tools of all kinds, and I will tell you that
nothing beats the grip of a snap on screwdriver, and nothing is easier on a
tired set of hands than a good feeling wrench...

Backyard mechs can get by with cheaper tools, but I have goofed up way more
bolts/nuts with ill fitting tools than any other reason..

My favorite tool is a factory supplied 17mm Box wrench from a Honda
Motorcycle..Nothing breaks bell bolts loose like this thing..I have had it
for near 20 years and use it everytime I pull/install an engine..
