Alan,
I was out working on my Riviera because my ordered voltage regulator came in 
today.  I quickly looked at the wires coming from the regulator and this is 
what I found.  I have four wires: Green, Brown, Red, and Blue.  The Brown and 
Green look like they head down to the alternator and the Red is connected to 
the top middle isolator post.  The blue wire drops down and goes through the 
fire wall.  I haven't tracked it any farther than that.  I hope that helps a 
little.
