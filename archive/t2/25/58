Subject: Oil cooler project

I need a sump plate and an oil strainer plate for an oil cooler project.
P-mail me with your price request.
I plan on using the existing oil strainer plate with a suction tube to
draw oil from the sump plate to pass through an oil cooler. See basic
concept at http://williamwareagency.com/forsale/stanvan/oil-project.jpg
I figure that I can put a tube up through the strainer plate and through
the bottom of the strainer and use the engine oil pickup to circulate the
oil through the cooler thus removing any need for devices or adapters
that would lower the oil pressure.
