Subject: Re: Fw: [T2] Cheap timing light/tach-dwell meter and other tools?

George Lyle:
We were racing AA fuel funny cars,after racing inboard hydroplanes, AA
Fuel Roadsters Etc. Etc. we had our own machine shop, Balancing shop and
Etc Etc. and we always bought the best because we didn't have a choice
every timing light was good, every torque wrench was good ...... no
matter the brand and it was 1960-1970 and everything was American made
and it was all very good. 
Sorry to say most of the quality manufacturers are "gone broke" and you
guys gotta live with lesser quality even if it has the old quality brand
name.
