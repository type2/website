Subject: Friday funny

Hey Volks, a little background: there's a bus in my neighborhood,I believe it's a 1970. I have talked to the father of the driver. Father said bus was his and sat in garage for years, now it's his sons ride. Said bus is now lowered, has chrome eyelids on headlights, has chrome tin and requisiste loud muffler. Oh and it also has stickers on the back window that look kinda like the chrome naked ladies on trucker mudfalps and a beer tap handle for a shift knob. I haven't gotten a close enough look at the engine to discern if it has a chrom 009.(I'm not trying to pass judgement 'cuz it's his ride and I'm just glad to see an ACVW kept on the road)

Anyway, as i was walking my son home from school yesterday the aforementioned bus drove by. A kid walking just ahead of us started yelling "hey hippie bus" and making peace signs etc. I could not reaming silent; "That's not a hippie bus, that's a kewel-dude bus"

Happy Friday everyone
Mike
