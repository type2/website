Subject: It just died  -Update

Well, I checked the dual relay; it tested o.k. Then, I did something which, 
probably, I should've done in the first place. I disconnected the high 
tension lead which runs from the ignition coil to the dizzy cap, cranked the 
starter and, guess what, no spark! Do you think this means something? 
Earlier, about a week or two back, I did a tune up but my local flaps didn't 
have the correct condenser so I gerry-rigged one. Perhaps, it's weak or 
dead. Will test coil and replace condenser ...manana. Any thoughts? Thanx.
