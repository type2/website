I did it in Feburary, and was quite pleased with the results.  Well, maybe 
not quite 200 miles, but Seattle to LA.  I then quite successfully drove the 
bus from LA up to Seattle with nary a problem.

What I did do beforehand was first talk & email with the owner fairly 
extensively, to get an idea of the plusses & minuses of the bus, and also 
get an idea of his experience and trustworthiness.  Then I asked for 
additional pictures of areas I had questions about.  When I felt good about 
all that, I had him bring the bus, at my expense, to a nearby VW shop I had 
located, and then had a long conversation with the mechanic about the 
condition of the bus.

At that point my wife and I got two round trip tickets (thank god for cheap 
airfare) to LA and we both flew down to check out, and possibly buy the bus. 
We liked what we saw, bought the bus, and took her for a shakedown cruise 
through Joshua Tree National Park for the weekend. We then drove back to LA 
to drop my wife off at the airport (she wasn't able to get time off from 
work) & I then drove the bus up the coastal highway (amazing trip), never 
doing more than a few hundred miles per day.

And it all went well.

Sure, I was lucky, as there were a hundred & one things that could have gone 
wrong, but even long distance there's plenty you can do pre-trip to make 
sure you're not getting a headache.  The independent inspection was key for 
me to feel confident about taking the risk of going down there, as well as 
not committing to the purchace until I actually was there.
