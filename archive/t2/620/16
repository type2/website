Subject: Re: [VB] Faulty CB Brazilian Heads ?

  Don't blame it on CB, they are the same heads as everyone else sold back then and up to a year ago when they 
became NLA. I personally never use the valves, springs, etc in any aftermarker head I use. All of these get changed or I 
buy bare heads and build them myself. Just be happy that you even had a set of new single port to begin with. I only 
know of one source that even has any for sale and they are 250 dollars each and the new Brazilian aftermarket ones 
that just became available are 200 dollars each!!!
