Subject: Maybe an "Oops"?

Dunno if this is an "oops" or not. I just installed a brand-new factory 
built 1600 DP longblock into the Wonderbus. I think I may have forgotten 
to smoosh some grease into the pilot bearings. Um -- does anyone know if 
Mexican (Puebla factory) longblock pilot bearings are pre-greased? I've 
got about 400 miles on it to date.
