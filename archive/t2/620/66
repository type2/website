Subject: California BUS

I got lucky, I saw a Westy on the Samba Classified. So I took a train   from  
Bakersfield California to Clear Lake, Just North of San   Francisco. I took 
the  
cash with me not knowing anything about the  bus.  1971 Westy in great 
condition.  I bought it on the spot.  That night I  slept in it on the San 
Francisco Bay, 
with  a  view of the ocean. The  next morning I took the long way home on HWY 
 
101 along  the coast. I  even went past Bakersfield on the coast  and took 
HWY 
126 and came  down  the grape vine into Bakersfield.  Life has been good ever 
since. that  was  two and a half years  ago. Daily driver. weekend camper on 
the   
beach.
