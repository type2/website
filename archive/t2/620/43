Subject: It just died

I was humming along at 70, as usual, and the bus just died. No noises. 
Nuffin'! Just two red idiot lights on the dash. I had it flatbedded home. So 
far, I've changed the fuel filter and fuel pump. Where do I go next? Double 
relay? Pressure regualtor? Any adivice would be most welcome. This process 
of elimination crapola is getting expensive. Thanx.
Oliver
