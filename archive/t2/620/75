Subject: Bus Engine Question

I was wondering if anyone on the list is running a 2187cc, 78.8 x 94,
type 1 motor in their bus? If so, please p-mail me as I would like to
ask some questions as to how it's set up, cooling, performance, etc. No
flames please. I'm not a purist when it comes to my bus. But it looks
damn good!!! TIA
