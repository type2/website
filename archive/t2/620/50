Subject: Re: [T2] cv dished washer

Speaking of "dished washers" used heads clean up very nicely in a dish 
washer :-)
I cleaned a set of heads that I got in a junkyard in WA state serveral 
yrs ago in the dish washer. 
Just talked with the current owner and the bus is still running well, 
don't know the how well the dish washer runs.

:-)

Cheers,
Harry
