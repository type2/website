Subject: Need a VW in San Jose, CA

Okay, here's the story.  A friend on mine flew from Indiana to San Jose
to pick up a car.  He gets out there and the car is not road worthy.
Since he only bought a one way ticket he is looking for something to
drive back.  He has about $1500.00 cash.  If you have something or know
of something please email me right away.  He would prefer a bus but
anything that he could drive back would be considered.

Thanks,

Kevin
