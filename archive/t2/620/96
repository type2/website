Oh, lots of thoughts. But you've probably been punished enough.

Okay, one or two thoughts: (1) Always follow troubleshooting procedures 
from the start. Look for fuel, look for spark. (2) If you've done work 
to your bus, and it suddenly doesn't work, suspect your work before 
suspecting anything else. That's not meant to be personal; it's the way 
of the world.
