Hi Chris,

I'm with you on the tow dolly... Unless the bus is being sold or 
certified by a trustworthy list-affiliated vendor, I'd definitely dolly 
or trailer it.

Our Sunroof Automatic Bus has a dealer tag from Las Cruces New Mexico 
on the back... It had the paint scorched by the sun before it came to 
Toronto, and that didn't help its complexion at all. Then the sunroof 
drains came unplugged inside the body, which rusted out the drivers 
side rocker. It also had a bad valve and a busted exhaust and a ghastly 
interior... But since the price was good and it came with some useful 
spare parts and the body was otherwise solid, I went for it.

Here's some recent pics:

And here's my cheap-(-at-)$$ rust repair. It's not pretty but it will get 
the bus back on the road and I can make it better later.

Once there's enough paint on it to keep the rust demons at bay I'll get 
the tranny swapped over and rework the brakes. If the weather holds I 
hope to have it on the road come springtime.

Happy trails,
