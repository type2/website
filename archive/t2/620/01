Subject: Re: [T2] new solex 35 carbs

  Have used a few sets, am building a 1904 and will also use them on it. Don't really like the cast iron OE VW manifolds 
they come with though. Linkage is good and a good selection of jets are available. They are also going to come out 
with 38 mm Solexs soon. When Scat came out with theirs I stopped using CB Performance 34's. They do fit right on to 
the 1700 and 1800 type 4 manifolds. They have been available for a few months now.
