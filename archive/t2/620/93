Subject: John Brown's Buses

It's that time of the year when we have to start making plans for John Brown's Buses 2004 in Harpers Ferry, WV on October 15-17.
There was a great turn out last year and rumors have it that there will be 8-9 Canadians showing up!
Since the campground is a KOA, please make reservations so we can all be together.  More information can be found at
http://www.johnbrownsbuses.com
There is information on cost , schedule and something brand new for 2004 T-SHIRTS!  Adam Narraway of Suburban Design Core has
designed the shirts and will be producing them.  Check out this incredible design and place an order.

There will only be a limited number of T-shirts available at JBB2004 that are not pre-ordered.  You can't beat the price of $10.00
USD!  Hope to see you there and don't forget to let me know if you coming (and how many children) and please sign up for The Burrito
Breakfast!  Hope to see you all there.
 
Joy thru air,
