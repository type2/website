Subject: [T2] Need a VW in San Jose, CA

Out of the 8 VW's since '97 that I have owned, I only drove one home. One 
other was semi-driveable. '69 Squareback from my buddy and Listee, Wes Brown 
was the first. After we got running he drove it across town to my house and 
almost died(Cough,cough, cough, hack, hack, spit, cough). That was Wes not 
the car. Carbon Monoxide is a killer. He and I have traded and swapped a lot 
of stuff over past years ;). The last thing was "el Verde". Traded two bugs 
for it. Who knows one day he might get it back.

This bus I saw once on a weekend visit to Asheville, NC. He had picked it 
up. After a couple weeks we decided to make the trade. I used a work truck 
with a V-8 I and rented a two wheel dolly from U-Haul loaded up one of the 
bugs and headed for the mountains. We got the bus on the dolly ass end 
first. It is an Automatic and could not get the steering to lock. I headed 
down from the mountains at a slow pace and the fish tailed the whole way 
mostly when braking. Changed pants. Got home unloaded drove the bus two 
blocks to my house. Adventure and I would do it again. This was aboput the 
same time I joined the list last year. Maybe this year the list might see me 
driving it again and hopefully more than two blocks.

Later,

Michael Knight
'77 Westy Deluxe, "el Verde"
