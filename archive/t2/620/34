I installed the rubber cover for the bottom of the filler tube 
breather.  There is tons of pressure coming out of the top of the oil 
filter breather when the engine is running. It's a full blast of "vapor" 
(well, it's not water, but certainly oil is coming out). Also, oil is 
dripping oil from the bottom of this tube.

Here's a diagram of what I'm talking about. It is dripping from F

Is this too much pressure? I'm thinking that compression is leaking out of 
the cylinder, possibly because one of the valves isn't seating properly. 
I'm really at a loss here, and I don't think the guy who replaced the head 
knew what he was doing (ok, I did it, but I had the Bently manual).

To add info to my previous post, the head (I only replaced the #1/#2 cyl 
head) is from MOFOCO. When I torqued the head down I could not adjust the 
#1 exhaust valve (the front most valve - I don't have the shop manual in 
front of me), there was no clearance even with the screw all the way out. I 
had to add a shim to the "forward" rocker arm bolt to allow enough 
clearance to adjust the #1 valves. Am I stuck with a bad head? Ugh.

Maybe I'll take my old one to a machine shop to get some new valves. Is 
there a good machine shop in Chicago?
