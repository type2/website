Subject: Need a VW in San Jose, CA

I found my bus on the Samba in 2001. I emailed and phoned the PO and he told
me as much as he could, but it was pretty much on faith and a couple of
pictures that I decided to go for it. An expensive flight and long bus trip
later, we saw the bus in Medford Oregon, waiting for us at the bus station. I
brought my toolbox along of course.
The body was really solid, it ran great and was quite driveable.
The Adventurewagen interior was thrashed and the seats had massive rips,
horsehair hanging out etc.  It wasn't easy to decide, but I took the bus to a
local VW mechanic in Medford who adjusted the valves, fixed this and that and
said he thought it was all right. We then did the deal. I headed east to
Klaamath Falls where the bus died, dead battery. Wow, 100 miles out of 3000,
we had to be back to work in Ontario on Monday, this was Tuesday...Found a
great mechanic in Klamaath Falls, he spent 8 hours going over it from stem to
stern. Turned out it had no charging system at all. I also got him to put in a
remote starter switch so the ignition switch couldn't leave me stranded.
A couple more problems on the way home, but basically clear sailing all the
way. Great bus, great adventure. I'd do it again in a heartbeat.
