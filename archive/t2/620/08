Original VW Bus fog light switch.  Looks like a
four-way flasher switch, but with two switched 
positions (head and tail) and with a yellow window
with the appropriate symbol on it, lighting up
together with the 2nd "on" position, which is the
fog taillight.  Not a common item, but I've seen 
several on German swap meets since.
