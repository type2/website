Subject: Faulty CB Brazilian Heads ?

 I bought a set of Brazilian SP heads  in about 1982 from CB at a very low
sale price. I recently used them when rebuilding my 70 bus engine.

I just did the first valve adjust since the rebuild and found all the
clearances had dropped from .006 to about .002.

I discussed the disappearing valve clearance with a local ACVW expert. He
told me that CB Brazilian heads of that era commonly failed when the keeper
end of the valve pulled apart and dropped the valve into the compression
chamber with the expected result. Replacement of the Brazilian valves with
higher quality valves before failure is the only solution

Anyone on the list familiar with this type of head/valve failure with
CB/Brazilian heads? Also, any recommendation for a good quality valve? My
engine is completely stock except for balancing.
