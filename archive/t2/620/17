Don, I haven't felt any need to pick on you lately, but I have to this 
morning. This is flat wrong. I call it "the fallacy of carrying 
spares." It reminds me of those insurance commercials: you're standing 
next to your totaled bus, providing details of what happened to the 
police. And then you say, "but I have some good news. I have a cylinder 
rebuild kit in my toolbox."

Everyone should carry spares: points, a tire, even a fuel pump and 
alternator. But you don't carry spare brake parts. You install and 
adjust your brake parts, then keep them well within specs.

Mark
