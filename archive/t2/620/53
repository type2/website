They just left Anaheim after picking up the $350 in donations (!) and
letting me take their pics and shoot some video. (See the thread on
The Samba for these items... I've already posted 'em.)

They'll hopefully be hitting IL in a couple of days. I hope they make
it without any problems and they stay safe!
