If the brakes are solid right now, and inspecting the hoses doesn't
reveal any stretching or swelling, just carry spares. One cylinder for
each axle and a brake line would be a great start. Oh, and fluid too.

I carry the pads I last pulled (or shoes), a spare line and a cylinder
rebuild kit (and I have a brake honing stone in my toolbox).
