Tim,

this is not a flame just my personal experience.  I have a 1776 (69x90.5) in
my '70 Westy at 7.2 CR.  It is not as powerful as my 1835 cc 7.6 CR but it
runs much cooler and I expect it to last longer.  Ported and polished 041
heads and Dellorto DRLA 36 carbs make the 1776 powerful for its size and
still gets good gas mileage (18-20 mpg).  could get even more power at
7.4-7.6 CR.  bug guys would put it at 8.5+ but that would burn up in a bus.
I run an Engle 100 cam which is much better low end torque, I like it much
better than the 110 or scat equivalent (the 110 you really have to rev to
get a heavy bus moving from a standing start, I never get over 4500 anyway).

the 1776 is enough power to push me with my 091 trans at 70-75 down the
highway--at this low compression the heads run cool but the oil still gets
hot if I push it, may add an external cooler next summer.  If I had the time
and money at the time I would have gone for a stroker 74x90.5.  that would
have cost at least $400 more and take a few extra weeks that I couldn't
afford.

In my experience the most important factor is good heads with custom port
work--give you much more power per displacement.  go with reputable ported
and polished 041's (at least) port-matched to manifolds.  for carbs 36's
like I use will work up to near 2000 cc but 40's might get you more high
end.  I like the DRLA's.  If you need to find a head guy I would recommend
Steve Sands at www.proflowperformance.com. tell him I sent you.

what kind of early bus are you driving?  All that motor would be wasted on a
stock early trans, you need an 091 or a freeway flyer so it doesn't over-rev
when you want to do 80.  Think complete package:  displacement, compression
vs. cooling, head$, port work, carbs, trans.  If you do build your big
baddie please let us know how hot it runs!  also stay away from the empi
exhausts, CB performance sells some good stuff like the Quiet one, and you
will need J-tubes with 1.5" exhaust ports. or those expensive oversized
HE's.

good luck and have fun.
