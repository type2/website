Subject: How do you use fire extinguisher?

Got a question for those who used their fire extinguisher- has anyone
squirted down the vents successfully, and how do you open the engine
hatch to spray the fire?  The halon ext. I ordered does not have a hose,
but couldn't I use a clamp and attach a large hose to the nozzle so
hatch can be opened just a bit and hose inserted?
