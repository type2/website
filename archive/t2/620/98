Subject: Replacing Generator

I have a 1970 Bus with a 1600cc engine.  I am an armature mechanic.   I know computers more than cars.  I love my bus and have done several easier projects like the tie rods,  CV boots, and basic wire trouble shooting and so on.    

Recently the battery has not been charging so I replaced the batter, then the regulator with no positive outcome. So I now have a new generator ready to install.  Problem - Today when I finally got the generator loose, ready to pull it out, I discovered that there is a large bold holding the generator to the Fan.   I can see it but itbs larger than any wrench or socket in my tool kit.  

 

Ibve ran the test on the generator found on the type2 site and also tried to re polarize it with no change.

 

Question 

1.  What size is that screw/bolt?  

2.  Will getting that screw/bolt off enable me to get the generator out?  

3.  Are there any other things I need to know about on this project?

 

Thanks and stay on the Bus
