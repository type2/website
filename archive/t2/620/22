Subject: Removing Interior Panel

77 Westy

I need to remove the interior panel from my sliding door. My issue is getting the little black 'plugs' out without damaging the panel itself. Is there some technique Im not realizing? A special tool made for such a job? 

Thanks in advance for any thoughts on this.
