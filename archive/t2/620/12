1. Flush your entire system with new fluid.
2. Check the pads for wear.
3. Check your brake drum diameter against the spec.

I mention this last one because I've had a wheel cylinder blow due to 
excessive drum wear and therefore too much space for the cylinder to 
expand.  It took me 4 tries to figure out what was going on.
