Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Engine Question

  There is a guy on this list Nick Keen that is running a 78.8X90.5 in his bus and Matt here in town just built a 84X90.5 
for his bus. I run a 74X88 and am building a 82X90.5 for another one of my buses now.  All these engines so far run 
great and Nick is on his second one, got over 150K on his first. I now have 64k on mine nowand will put another 5K on 
it in the next 4 weeks.
