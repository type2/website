Hey there Laura,

I have heard your name mentioned around town through Lou and Rob Henley. 
When did they start testing emissions on pre-'79 autos in Meck. Co.? I don't 
live in Charlotte anymore(Moooresville now) not for like three years but I 
did spend most of my life there. I have had quite a few oldies mostly VW and 
an old '77 Land Cruiser Wagon. But I have never had an emissions test for 
them they were always safety inspections.

Thanks,

Michael Knight
