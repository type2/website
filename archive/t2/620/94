I know I'm chiming in kinda late on this but it took me awhile to bone up
on all the nuances. It appears to me that we can make the collector
insurance work for us if we all work together and declare every camping
trip an 'event'. The people east of the Rockies have been much better than
we have at planning events and getting lots of Busses out to go camping.
I, for one, promise to plan and publize an event in Northern or
Central Coast of California sometime during the next year.

 We're boned. I have no idea what the less stringent amounts to exactly but
 the collector insurance requirement is too restrictive.

 Latest news from http://www.geocities.com/smogrfg/ is:

 8/24/04--AB2683 Has Been Amended

 AB2683 has been amended. Here is what it means to you:

 Section 1 has the following language: It is the intent of the Legislature,
 in enacting the act adding this section, to ensure that vehicles, of the
 1975 model-year and older are permanently exempted from the biennial
 compliance requirement of the motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (smog
 check) program.

 - 1976 and newer model vehicles are to remain in the smog check program
 forever

 - Amendments added a link to vehicle code 5051 and placed additional
 requirements on 1976 and newer model vehicles as follows:

 - A 1976 or newer model vehicle will always require a smog check

 - When a 1976 or newer model vehicle reaches 35 model years old or older the
 owner of the vehicle can get a less stringent test as defined below.

 * To qualify for the less stringent test a 1976 or newer vehicle must meet
 the following requirements:

 - The owner presents proof that the vehicle is insured as a collector
 vehicle
 - No parameters are specified in the bill for the collector
 insurance(example -- mileage)
 - The vehicle must be at least 35 model years old or older
 - The vehice must pass a tailpipe emissions test for that model year
