Subject: Re: [T2] I'm starting to get it!

Hi Folks,

I have a good idea for a "model" ACVW engine -- how about one of those that 
sits out behind somebody's barn "just waiting to be rebuilt when I have the 
time"?  I'm sure there are plenty of folks who'd love to get rid of the 
blown-up 1600SP from their '69 Westy for free or for real cheap.  It would 
make a great 1:1 scale plaything for your kids, and who knows, they might 
just get it running!  You just have to explain to your kids that the hole 
punched in the case or in the #3 piston top is NOT STOCK! :-)

Good Luck....
