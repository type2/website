Hello List.
resilience
I have a question regarding the cv joints on my 68
bus. I have no problem with the joints them selves as
they do not clunk. They do not have any noticable play
in them. The only thing is that one of the clamps came
undone for an unknown length of time and I am afraid
that dirt has collected inside the boots. Would I be
safe just to remove the boots, clean out all the
grease with mineral spirits and repack with grease? I
am planing on going on a 6 hour trip to the mountains
soon and I want everything to be good to go. should I
clean out the old dirty grease or just repack them
with new grease? The joints have shown no signs of
failure, so I shouldn't have to replace them just as a
a precaution. Right?
