Subject: Pop Top conversions (was Re: [T2] It just died)

Hi Gary,

Welcome to the list.

It seems somehow appropriate that I would wind up getting your first 
post... In the winter of 2000/2001 I installed a westy roof from a 1974 
bus onto a 1979 transporter. With everything included the job took 
about 100 hours of work, which included paint prep and learning to 
weld.

As far as I know there aren't any "kits", but there companies that do 
the conversion and sell the completed product. In the UK I would 
recommend contacting Devon.... Perhaps they will sell the pop-top 
separately.  Most people who do their own conversions do what I did: 
Obtain a parts bus and transfer over the components you need from it.

If you want to see how I did it, you can visit my website at:

Happy trails,
