Subject: Subject: Brake maintance for a mountain trip

Hello List. I am going on a long trip to the mountains
and, I want to make sure that my brakes are up to the
challenge. I have a 68 bus so the brakes are pretty
simple. One of my wheel cylinders is blown and needs
to be replaced. As far as I know, the other ones do
not leak. Should they be replaced as a precaution?
What about the flexy hoses? if they don't swell when
the brakes are pressed, should those be replaced as a
precaution as well? This is going to be a 6 hour trip
and I don't need my brakes going out on the down side
of a mountain. what would you do?

Thanks in advance!
