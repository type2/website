How do people convince themselves that flying across country to buy a 30 year old vehicle to drive back sight unseen is a good idea?

Personally I think the money would be better spent on a return ticket. $1500 doesn't buy a very road worthy car for a cross country trip as he already found out. I hope he saves enough for the gasoline bill he'll have to pay to get it back home.
