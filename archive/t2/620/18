Subject: RE: [T2] smog test    AB 2683

	It looks like AB 2683 is a smog screen to deprive us of our VW's.

(snip)  
What does AB 2683  do? 
AB 2683 will improve air quality  and reduce emissions by eliminating the
"30-year rolling exemption" that  currently exists in the Smog Check
program. 
This bill will not bring any  vehicles that are currently exempt into the
program.   
(un snip)

From the text of the new law...

Section 3:
 (g) For purposes of subdivision (a), any collector motor vehicle, as
defined in Section 259, is exempt from those portions of the test required
by subdivision (f) of Section 44012 of the Health and Safety Code, if the
collector motor vehicle meets all of the following criteria:
   (1) Submission of proof that the motor vehicle is insured as a collector
motor vehicle, as shall be required by regulation of the bureau.
   (2) The motor vehicle is at least 35 model-years old.
   (3) The motor vehicle complies with the exhaust emissions standards for
that motor vehicle's class and model year as prescribed by the department,
and the motor vehicle passes a functional inspection of the fuel cap and a
visual inspection for liquid fuel leaks.

Looks like a roll back to 1970 to me.
It looks like a sneaky way to make the perceived problem of "older/poor
peoples" cars go away.
