Just don't forget a towbar, tow dolly, trailer, or at LEAST a huge toolbox full of parts and tools.... 

I agree though about western vehicles. My bus came from NM and continues to be nice and rust free (with the exception of a couple items easy to fix). I would not have gone out and driven it back though... I'm not THAT adventurous..
