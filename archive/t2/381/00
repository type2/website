The OEM boxes have much larger and more efficient cast heat exchangers
inside.  The replacement is a lot lighter and doesn't pass as much heat to
the cabin.

If you have "holey" boxes, they can often be repaired by brazing new sheet
metal over the holes.  It's not pretty, but it is to your advantage to
keep your original boxes in service.
