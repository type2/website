Subject: Thinking about "artistic" paint job...

Listees,

Lately I've been viewing my 71 Westy (http://deadsetjams.com/LJ/trip4.jpg) 
as canvas and I'm thinking about hiriing an artist to turn my bus into a 
work of art. I can hear the sighs now, this would not be a permanent paint 
job, as I truly wish I had the money to get the body work done and have it 
painted inside and out the orginal red. But that if that happens it will be 
years from now, so I am thinking about having fun with my bus and letting an 
artist turn it into his/her masterpiece.

My questions are this: Has anyone done this before? What kind of paint is 
best to use? If i do this, will I be banned from the list??? Have I gone 
mad?

And i'm well aware that this will decrease the value of my bus if i try to 
sell it in this condition, but I don't really care about that as I have zero 
intention of selling my baby and I bought her for $1200 anyways.

Thanks,
Daniel
