Subject: [T2] Spark Plugs Bosch vs NGK

Hopefully I won't add fuel to the fire, but... Doktor Tim has many
times commented to use the proper Bosch plugs in VWs. Terry recently
mentioned using NGK Platnium. What I find interesting is that in my
new longblock from Mexico it came with NGK plugs in it. Not platnium,
just regular ones. Anyone care to comment on vw's apparent switch to
NGK. At least south of the border.
