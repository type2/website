A recent experience with Bus Depot taught me that if they didn't list 
(read: carry/stock) a particular part, that they would be willing to get 
that part for you from a third party vendor and have it shipped to you 
from that vendor.  All you have to do is call/email and tell them what you 
want and they'll add it to your order.

I'm not sure if they *like* doing this on a regular basis (Ron?) but I 
do know that they can and will do it, and it's probably easier than 
ordering from 5 different places.
