What is your oil pressure?  If pressure is good (at least 30 at that speed/temp, preferably closer to 40) then I wouldn't worry too much if I had synthetic oil.  With dino oil, well... I don't have any experience with it at those temps so I couldn't tell you.  I've run synthetic in my bus for the last 100,000+ miles.

Yes.  I read your other reply and I had always thought that the rocker cover area was connected to the crankcase via the pushrod tubes.  I remember there being holes in the lifter bores to facilitate this, but I can't swear you are right or wrong without a disassembled engine in front of me.  I can say that switching to vented valve covers didn't do squat for my oil leak problem.  I still have occasional leaks from the covers, and from the breather box area.
