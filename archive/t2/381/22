Subject: Re: new old style bugs

Chris,

The website your looking for is BeetleMex. They sell NEW old style bugs. They 
manufacture the complete body I guess for sale in Mexico but then replace the 
chassis parts with one off of a US bug that was from the boneyard and then the 
NEW bug assumes the VIN of the old bug. They have one in the showroom at the VW 
dealer here in Jacksonville, NC.
