Subject: Re: [T2] Spark Plugs Bosch vs NGK

">Hopefully I won't add fuel to the fire, but... Doktor Tim has many
times commented to use the proper Bosch plugs in VWs. Terry recently
mentioned using NGK Platnium. What I find interesting is that in my
new longblock from Mexico it came with NGK plugs in it. Not platnium,
just regular ones. Anyone care to comment on vw's apparent switch to
NGK. At least south of the border.

I personally love the NGK over Bosch.  I believe I get better economy, power,  less fouling etc.  NOT the platinum, but just NGK .  I have been running them in my '75 Bmw 2002 for ten years and this is what I base my info.  BTW, bosch was the  stock plug in the bmw.  My humble opinion.  Paul.
