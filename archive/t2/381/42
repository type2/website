That's correct. Either the regulator is leaking down or the check valve in 
the pump is leaking down or you have a fuel leak in a hose or an injector 
is jambed or sticking open. If I've got 25 lbs + after 10 minutes rest, I'm 
not concerned as long as it's not hose fittings weeping. It won't create 
running or starting issues. If you are smelling gas fumes, it's not the 
regulator or check valve, those pressure leaks remain in the system. If you 
do smell gas fumes, it's a hose or injector leaking to atmosphere from 
pressure loop.
