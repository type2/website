Hiya Dave,

Although the AH series was in production (as opposed to production year) in 
72, 73 and 74, with that particular serial number your engine likely rolled 
off the production line in October of 1973, bound for installation in a 74 
vehicle.  Of course, that assumes that the total run of AH engines for the 
1974 production year (114, 418 units) was spread evenly throughout that 
production year.  And that may or may not have been the case.

Rated at 58 hp SAE, and 48 hp DIN, the AH engine series was earmarked for the 
California market only.  And there is a pretty good chance your engine was 
destined for an AutoStick application.  Assuming it's still there, notice 
anything peculiar about the oil pump?  Or the surrounding tin?  However, it's 
original application could well have been a standard Bug, a SuperBeetle, or a 
KG.

Hope that confirms what you need,

Mike
