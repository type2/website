You are quite correct Karl. Pulling the vacuum line will cause a over rich 
condition because the differental pressure jumps to over 50 psi. But that is 
not the condition I was attempting to describe.

My point is that the fuel rail pressure reading obtained with the line 
pulled is the same value as the fixed pressure differential at the injector 
tip in normal operation. The fixed differential is not easy to measure 
directly in the normal operating condition because of the vacuum component.

Nevertheless Bosch  L-Jetronic FI system is a constant  pressure (at the 
injector tip) modulated pulse time scheme.

Sorry for not making my example clear.

Chuck
