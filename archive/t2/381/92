The bigger question is whether having buses on the road for future generations is more or less important to you than having an extra 500 bucks today.

My 2 1/2 year old asked me yesterday from the back of the bus, "Dad, when I get big, can I have a bus like you?"

My eyes got watery, it was so sweet.

California will give me 2000$ for my two non-smogging buses right now or I can spend that much to get them up to snuff.

Guess what? No driving for me this summer.

Don't part a good bus!

Billy
