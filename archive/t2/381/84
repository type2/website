early carbed busses, all type IV's and some 914's had vented rocker boxes.
later busses did away with this setup and have only the breather on top of
the case. 

high crankcase pressure can be a sign of failing rings, as pressure blows by
the rings in into the crankcase, but the stock breather system should be
able to handle this unless it is not working. make sure the breather box and
hose are clear.

there are other causes of leaky head covers, most common is using (too much)
goo on the gaskets. the rims of the head get jeffed up with age and abuse,
so the gasket is resting on a bumpy surface. you can dress them flat with a
big file, but it is hard to do it with the motor together. and a new bail
might fix your problem if you don't have any of the above and your covers
are nice and straight and goo-free.
