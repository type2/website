mentioned using NGK Platnium. What I find interesting is that in my
new longblock from Mexico it came with NGK plugs in it. Not platnium,
just regular ones. Anyone care to comment on vw's apparent switch to
NGK. At least south of the border.

Unfortunately, at this stage of the game, a few more players are involved
than would usually be considered...Price comes to mind first, of course, but
even after that comes the new (or not) wrinkle...Independent testing ain't
what it used to be...Almost every product (especially auto-related) now
comes with an independent lab test that proves it to be superior to every
other product...Problem is, too many of the labs are independent (from the
product maker) but not from the ad agency touting the product. Like the
'expert witnesses" in many court trials, the labs are perfectly capable of
reverse testing to justify whatever claims the ad agency/manufacturer
requires...;-(
