Subject: Biggest Battry that will fit?

Okay so I am full of questions today because work is slow and I finally
have time to think about Possum. I tried looking in the archives to little
avail and what I am wondering is what is the biggest (highest amp
hour)battery I can fit in the auxilliary location of my bus. I am looking
at Optima yellow tops and see thqat they have a 55 apm hour rating. If my
fridge draws 5amps like it says it does then I should have 11 hours, but I
would never run it that low. I wonder if there is another battery that will
fit that has a higher rating like maybe 100 amp hours? Probably not one
that will fit in the stock location? If anyone has input I appreciate it. I
am looking for specific battery specs like say " you can fit a group ?? in
there and that should give you ?? amp hours".

Thanks,
