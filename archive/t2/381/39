Rick,

At the risk of starting 'yet another oil thread', I think 20w50 is too thick
of an oil for such a new engine. I would use something thinner, like 10w30,
until the motor is broken in, then I'd switch to heavier oil if you need it,
which you shouldn't until the engine has a few years on it.

It is normal for the valve clearances to tighten slightly on a new rebuild
as the valves bed into the seats. Monitor the clearances and adjust the
valves often in the first few thousand miles.
