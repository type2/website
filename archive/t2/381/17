Subject: Timing Scale

Hi Friends-

Does anyone have, or know of a picture of the timing scale for a '73 Westy?
Most of the numbers have worn off of mine, and I am having difficulty tracking
one down north of the border. Even if some one could give me a verbal
description, I could probably figure out the missing info.
Cheers,
Matthew
