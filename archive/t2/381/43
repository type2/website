Weren't we just talking about this on Friday...?

I drove to J*ck-in-the-B*x tonight...bus made a few clunking noises when
turning left. Pulled into the drive-through, ordered, and then bus wouldn't
go forward...engine, clutch, shifter felt OK; more clunking.  Shut down,
pushed bus out of the way.  Right outboard CV was dangling loose...WTF?

I walked home, got my rachet, allen socket, and triple-square thing. Then I
walked my original driving route back to JitB and found several cv bolts
along the way (what a coincidence).  Bolted it back up (4 of six) and drove
home.  A review of Bentley indicates that there are spacers and washers
(locking I presume) which should have been there. I swear I put it all back
just the way I found it when I R&Red the engine. The last person to touch my
cv's was a mechanic in Orlando, when I needed them fixed up on the road. He
wasn't really oozing scruples...

So anyhoo, BD lists the bolts, but no spacers or washers. Does anyone know
if the dealer would have these? Are the spacers necessary (I can probably
answer that myself)?

Thanks,
