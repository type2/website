Subject: Re: [T2] Oxygen sensor replacement....alternate source for

You need a VOM that will accurately indicate to 0.1v. Pull back the boot on 
the big green oxy wire terminal to the black oxy wire. Leave the connection 
connected. Hook up VOM + to this terminal and VOM - to ground. If the oxy 
is good AND the mixture is set correctly, you will see the volts vary from 
.3 to .7 volts at a frequency of 2-3 times per second. If it puts out a 
constant voltage, no fluctuation, then either the oxy is toast or the 
mixture is out of adjustment. That is all with the motor idling at 
operating temp.

Shut off the key. Disconnect the oyx. Restart and idle. Measure from the 
green terminal disconnected. Should be 0.5 volts steady. This is the 
reference signal from the ECU. If it's not 0.5v steady, ECU=BAD. If you 
ever have an over rich condition that fouls the plugs with carbon, the oxy 
will get fouled as well and stop gewerken.
