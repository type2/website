Subject: Re: [T2] Type IV cooling fan question

I can answer this one.  The change was between the 72 and 73 model year.  The 72 fan's center is sort of cone-shaped (I assume this was designed in to help airflow into the fan) requiring countersunk bolts which are allen-head.  In '73, the smog pump pulley assembly had to be mounted to the center of the fan so the cone was milled down most of the way to a flat surface and 13mm hex-head bolts were used.  

I'm not sure which FI busses used which fan - I thought they all used the flattened variety but I can't swear that they didn't go back to the pointy style once the smog pump was no longer needed.  I am sure though that for carbbed busses, 72 used the pointy fan and 73-74 used the flat fan.
