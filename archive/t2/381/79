I read it and saw nothing whatever of relevance to Stock vs other plugs in 
a T-IV motor, or Bosch ignitions at all. You develop rules of thumb for 
motorcycles and 2 strokes, then apply it to all types of engines. Put 
magnets on your fuel lines, that's a universal improvement if you listen to 
the hype based upon testimony and phoney data by interested parties. Don't 
misinterpret this opinion on platinum plugs as mine. I'm just reporting 
what those who know more than both of us multiplied by magnitudes know for 
certain about the issue. The extra cost of production is not justified by 
improvements scarcely measurable over the stock part. Now can you answer 
this. Which manufacturers install platinum plugs as stock from the 
factory??? Why????
