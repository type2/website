A seemingly simple question from a lurking member of the great unwashed 
masses of VW Bus lovers--How does one justify wisdom? Hordes await your 
reply! Teaching by insult is usually an oxymoron. However, it was 
effective in boot camp in the fifties. I don't recall a DI using the 
technique relative to sparkplugs but I do have "senior moments" that are 
occasionally "multiplied by magnitudes".
Have a good day---it seems you could use one. Most of your posts have 
been helpful to me and I appreciate them.  My morning coffee is enhanced 
manifold by this list.

Happily enjoying my love affair with Volkswagens for half a century. 
Wish other love affairs were as consistent---hmmm?  But some of them 
went by the wayside due partially to multiple buses along the wayside.
