If you talk to Jerry at NW ConRod, he will tell you of several motor 
failures wherein the only common link was Castrol for break in. He replaced 
a half a dozen engines before he figured it out. The cam lobes just went 
away. No such failures were noted with any other brands. These were new VW 
cams and lifters. Castrol must have changed something in their mix a few 
years ago because surely before these failures all within a few months it 
was being used by some for break-in without problems for many years.

typical, I set valves at .008 for initial break-in for this reason.

You can't time it dynamically at idle unless the idle is spec. Otherwise, 
the advance can be in play.

A worn throttle shaft can do this, or any vacuum leak. A cracked s-hose 
should be ruled out as well.
