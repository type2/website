Subject: Re: [T2] Best Spark Plugs for my 76 2.0L FI

I disagree.
The platinum tip plugs will have a preponderance of running cleaner for
a longer period of time Tim, with a longer electrode life.
As long as the plug is within the proper heat range, it will not cause
one iota of a problem---
And I don't care if the element was made out of Titanium--the heat range
is what is   most important---

And in my travels, and experience I have found the gold platinum tip
plugs to,last twice as long as the standard---run of the mill plugs, and
run cleaner for longer.

I have also found NGK gold plantnium tipped plugs to be superior to the
overpriced Bosch plugs anyday.

But this is my findings---

And this subject is another go no where--personal preference subject
like tire's, toilet paper, and jello--run what you have found to work
the best, regardless what Benz has to say---

Which doesn't even apply here.

Kinda like comparing a Kohler engine to a turbo Porsche.

The CC's are correct. The AP's are not, don't use them at all in your
motor. In fact, AP's are not stock for any motor ever made. They are a
marketing gimic to get you to pay twice as much for no benefits whatever
from the early ignition systems. 
Even Mercedes advises against platinum plugs for their later high energy
ignitions because there is no measurable improvement over stock plugs. 

Ted Scribes;

I have two brand new sets of plugs that came with my parts Westy. One
set being the W8CC and the other being the W8AP. Which set would be the
best for my 2.0L FI engine?
