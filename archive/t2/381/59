 I've not read of it elsewhere or verified it.  greg

You did read it but I believe the author included part of a description of the Vanagon. In Europe, the Vanagon
came out on 1979.  Here is the sentence from the write-up I saved from a post made on April 10, 1998 in the
description for 1979 buses: 1) Body made slightly wider (1.6 inches extra)

I can forward the complete post from my Hotmail account if anyone wants it.  It also has the mis-information
about 78 and 79 Calif engines being GE and the Fed engines being GD. Wrong, all 78 and 79 USA engines are GE.
