Subject: fuel pressure drops to zero

I've gotten some great explanations of the way fuel pressure 
regulation takes place on the Bosch system from Chuck and Karl. 
Thanks to both.

One final question.  Currently, with a fuel pressure gauge connected 
to my fuel rail with a T fitting, the pressure drops to zero within a 
few seconds after the engine is turned off. My reading of the 
archives tells me that this should not happen.  Some people report 
that pressure holds at 35 psi overnight!

Clearly, a  fuel pressure regulator that leaks fuel to the tank could 
give rise to this behavior.

Can anyone confirm that my condition is not normal?

Thanks, jack
