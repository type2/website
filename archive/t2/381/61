Subject: Antenna replacement

Our 1978 bus has a broken antenna and a broken antenna cable.  The 
antenna has a black base that seems to be mounted with two studs which I 
can not see.  It would be a simple matter to replace the antenna poll 
since is attached to the base with one screw, but this type of antenna 
seems to be discontinued.  bus depot sent a replacement antenna but it 
is of a different type and I can not see how one can possibly replace 
the base with a new type since it is blindly attached to the sill and I 
can't see how it is possible to get inside the sill to the back of the 
mount.  Also there is the antenna cable that is worn through under the 
dash.  input?
