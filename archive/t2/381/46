The CC's are correct. The AP's are not, don't use them at all in your 
motor. In fact, AP's are not stock for any motor ever made. They are a 
marketing gimic to get you to pay twice as much for no benefits whatever 
from the early ignition systems.
Even Mercedes advises against platinum plugs for their later high energy 
ignitions because there is no measurable improvement over stock plugs.
