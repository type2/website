Subject: Mustard Yellow Vinyl for sale

Because of a minimun order requirement of two yards, I have an extra yard
(actually slightly more) of the mustard yellow vinyl (naugahyde!) from
OkUpholSup(-at-)aol.com>
(Spirit Millennium No. 324).

Anyone need it?  I'd like to get my cost back (about $20 yard) - you pay for
shipping or arrange to get it through someone going to Westies in the Woods
this weekend.

Thanks.
