Subject: Engine Case Numbers

I'm trying to find out exactly what engine I have.  AH038475 are the
numbers on the front of the case. From all of the research I have done
in the books and on the internet I've found evidence that says it's from
a '73 or '74 Super Beetle 1600. If someone is willing to take a look at
their resources a double check my findings I would be grateful. Thanks
ahead of time.
