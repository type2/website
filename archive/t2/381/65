Subject: Type IV cooling fan question

I disassembled my two "core" engines of unknown condition and displacement 
this weekend so they would fit under my workbench out of the weather. Took 
them from engine w/cooling to bare long block condition.

One had a cooling fan with allen head bolts (just like CV joint bolts) and 
the other had 13mm head hex bolts. Which is original? I think one was a 
Type IV car engine in a previous life due to the dipstick placement.

Also both fans fad a single vane missing. Is that a big deal (balance 
wise?). Trying to decide if I should keep these fans or dump them.

What causes a vane to break like that?
