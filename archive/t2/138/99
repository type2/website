Subject: Fw: [T2] '78 Deluxe Westy-$16000- Worth it?

The real question is again one of usage. If it is to be a driver or show
car.
If all of you were to sit down and do the math, and include your personal
labor as well as what you have invested in parts and professional mechanics,
you might find $16,000 is not so far out there.
