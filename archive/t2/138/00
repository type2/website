Subject: Re: [T2] Found a vacuum leak but...

Thanks for the advise Karl. To clarify, I have a 1975 bus, using 1975 fuel
injection, 78 2 liter engine and distributor. The 78 single vacuum dizzy is
better than the 009 that came with the original bus. Is there an advantage to the
dual vac dizzy?
I stand corrected on my terminology, InHg it is.
I'll Check those vacuum ports Wednesday eve.
Thanks for the help

Yes towards the rear bumper.

78 single Vac.
