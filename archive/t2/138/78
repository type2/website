Subject: Sump Plate Sender Installation...

Hi everybody,

I got a oil temp. gauge with sump plate sender for my
1600 engine. It seems that the general concensus is
that the sender should not replace the drain plug and
should be installed somewhere else on the plate. My
question is, Where do I need to drill the hole for the
sender? 

Thanks a lot for your help,

For those of you going to Everybus, have a safe and
enjoyable trip...
