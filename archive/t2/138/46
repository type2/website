Usually they are just checked for straightness, perhaps shot-peened as an 
upgrade.  Not really necessary for a stock motor though.  You might 
consider checking the bearing clearances on the big end of the rods with 
plastigage before you rebuild, just to have as a data point.

Yes, and yes.  I think the bushings in the small end are pressed in and 
perhaps honed to fit.  If yours are still a snug fit, you may not need new 
ones.

Shipping to Rimco to be checked sounds like an unnecessary expense to 
me.  I bet that will run you $400.  If the engine hasn't been abused, it's 
very unlikely that it will need to be align-bored.  Type 1 cases need it 
all the time because they are magnesium and not as strong.  A type 1 
specialist is probably just in the habit of telling people to do it.

Normal.

The Y dimension comes in standard oversizes but I don't have a clue about 
the X dimension.

Standard VW parts houses should have them.  Try RMMW.

Shouldn't be necessary - I saw new ones for sale many years ago in Calif. 
but not recently.  I would bet money that yours is fine though.
