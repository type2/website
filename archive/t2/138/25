Yes - sort of.

It's called flocking. Rockler sells a kit for small jewelry boxes that uses 
something called Suede-Tex fibers.

If you could zero in on the glue used (regular upholstery glue?) and a 
source for large quantities of flocking then you might be in business.

Personally I would lean towards a layer of foam and a layer of upholstery 
to match the van or a neutral gray.

Would look nice either way.
