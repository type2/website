I never support it. I do remove the 2 upper rear bolts. The trans drops down
about 4" when I slide the engine out. The axles hold it up. The front mount
will pivot. The shift coupler will pivot as long as it is in neutral.
I remove my 77 2.0L by myself in 35 minutes. Piece of cake. Takes a little
over an hour putting it back in and driving away.
