All things are possible. Measure the advance at idle and several RPM's up=20
to 3000.  Right down the measures. Plot the data on a chart. Degrees of=20
advance on one axis and RPM's on the other. Compare your curve with the=20
curve for your existing dizzy. Skip the chart and just compare data given=20
in Bentley for your stock dizzy, or any other dizzy. If the data or chart=20
matches within 2=B0 throughout, it should work very well with all other=20
variables STOCK.

As the Webers are not stock, you must do several very specific tests along=

with any info Weber publishes addressing timing issues. Perhaps none. The=20

=20
data exists in perhaps 1 in 100 DIY's at best. Hire the best VW-Weber=20
knowledgeable mechanic you can find. Before he's through, he will have=20
PROVEN whether or not your dizzy curve will do, the carbs are running at=20

=20
and adjustment will PROVE the proper timing specs for your specific setup=20
that will provide clean and powerful running without dangers of overheating=

from leaning out even briefly and burning metals.

Any savy mechanic can measure the vacuum ports on the carbs to deterime=20
where to hook up an advance dizzy. Hopefully, your Weber will be sized=20
properly to give normal vacuum.  If not, then your advance curve data will=
=20
not fit well with stock curve requirements.

Your mechanic doesn't have to be an engineer, but he sure will have=20
understanding of engineering procedure to verify all operating parameters.
