Well some of you won't care, I know, but for those that do...my engine swap
is finally complete!!!

After 6 weeks of not driving, the wrong flywheel and some bad dual carbs we
finally got it back together today and I just drove it about 10 miles and it
ran great!!

Here are the specs:

Newly rebuilt AVP 2000cc engine
freshly painted engine tin
New vacum advance dizzy
new alternator
2 new heat exchangers
new flywheel and clutch
new braided fuel and air lines
new Bosch plugs, wires, etc.
new engine foam and belt

I had to reuse my single Weber progressive because the right Weber IDF carb
I bought has some problems. If anybody is good at redoing these carbs let me
know. I am going to have it fixed so I can install it.

I will be driving my bus to Everybus after all!!!  And I'll be leaving
tommorrow morning. See you there!!
