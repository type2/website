<< I have a buddy who has located a '78 Deluxe Westy, Dakota Beige, 14500 
miles, all original, no wear whatsoever, and is contemplating buying it.  I 
have seen this vehicle and it is in almost showroom condition.  However, the 
price is $16000 firm.  The camper has been kept in a climate controlled 
garage and I have no doubt this is one of the nicest campers in the US.


I feel $16000 is a really high price for something like this, even 
considering the condition.  What is the consensus on something like this?  Is 
he nuts to pay that much for it? He is really thinking about forking over the 
cash for it, but I'm wondering if buying something in lesser condition for 
$10000 less wouldn't be a better investment.

Depends (of course), can your buddy spend this kind of money without it really
hurting him? Can he keep it in the manner to which it has become accustomed?
I'd think using something like this as a daily driver would cause it to lose 
value
pretty quick. It's the originality that prompts the high price and everyday 
use
would require maintenance with NOS parts to keep the value up. Sounds like
that bus has crossed the line to trailer queen...An unrestored original always
fetches higher prices, but think of the consequences of a parking lot ding...
