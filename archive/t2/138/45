Subject: Rebuild machining questions

Hi all,

I'm in the process of rebuilding my '78 2.0L.  I have some questions 
concerning the crank and bearings - this is my first rebuild!

My experienced non-VW mechanic friend came over to look at rods and crank 
(rods still installed on crank).  He pushed and pulled the rods 
perpindicular to the crank, was very surprised that he could feel no slop.  
Especially when I told him the engine has 239,000 miles on it.  Do I need to 
have a machinist look at the crank?  Do the rods usually require machining?  
I have bearings for the crank end on the rods.  Do I need some kind of 
bushing for the wrist pin end?  Don't I have to remove the gear from the 
crank to change out center bearings?

My case is in pretty good shape (I had a Type I specialist here in town look 
at it).  He thought it looked pretty good, recommended packing it up (says 
he trusts no one here in Houston) and shipping it to Rimco in California for 
them to torque it up and test for ovality in the center saddles, align bore 
if necessary.  There are some slight discolorations on the saddles, and you 
can see where a part number from one of the main bearings has become 
imprinted onto the saddle itself.

OK, big question now:
If I have to have my case align-bored and they remove .00X", and then I have 
to have my crank machined and they remove .00Y", where do I find bearings 
that are .00X" bigger on the case side and 00Y" smaller on the crank side?  
If only the crank is machined, where do I get "standard" oversize bearings?

If the case needs to be align bored, wouldn't it be better to buy a new one? 
  Can a new Type IV case be had?

Again, I apologize for my ignorance, but would appreciate any help!

only wear I see is on cam lobes! - and possibly main bearing case saddles
