Melissa,

OK, so I finish the post, send it off, then notice I did it for the WRONG
year of bus!  I don't know why I thought '78, it's early here I guess.
Anyhow, I went and looked and the only difference between the '71 and '78
for those circuits is that on a '71 for the brakes you are looking for a
6-point connector, not an 8-point connector under the dash.  Otherwise
there is no difference in either circuit, so the advice holds.

I have used both the early and late diagrams depending on what I am
working on and I have to say each style has its pluses and minuses.  I
like the spatial info that you get from the early wiring diagrams, but I
also love the index on the late ones.  As happened here (by accident) I
will sometimes look up the wire colors on a late diagram and then flip to
an early diagram to see where the wires run and where the connectors are
located.
