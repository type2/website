My 7 seater is  72.  Working on the engine is, what is the term? oh yes,
fun, like the games Twister is fun.  I have often found myself almost
completely inside the engine compartment for certain procedures.  But, it
really isn't that bad.  I agree with David that it is easier than most V8's
or FWD V6's to extract the spark plugs.  Everything is logical and
accessible and simple.

you decide to replace your carbs, I will be interested in buying your old
PDSIT's from you.

The 72 has a lot of 1 year only issues.  But there are many things I like,
round bumpers, the PDSIT carbs, no emissions control devices.

Has anybody ever used 2 carburetor synchronizers simultaneously to sync the
carbs before?
