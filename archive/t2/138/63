You're welcome to a full scale paper copy of the tray area shape you'll need
if you cut it out of stock.  I had two cut out and epoxied them in a couple
of years ago.  Careful cutting, probably an excess amount of epoxy around
the perimeter (on a remnant of the old edge), and lots of good paint on top
of that.  They're both still there.

Just send me a postal address and I'll cut a copy (my template is cardboard)
out of sturdy paper and mail it to you.
