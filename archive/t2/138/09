Just so you know... Anything can be done with enough work and money.  Just
depends how easy you want it to be.  Richard Palmer grafted a bay top onto
his split.  But it was work....check out

The later bay upper beds had the roof cut out more than the earlier bays.
For the bed to sit flat you would need to cut out the outer layer of metal
on the roof.

Good Luck,
