Subject: Re: [T2] engine tin and dash paint color

Do not use regular paint.

Go to a good parts store or an autobody supply store (much better source, 
bigger color selection).

Look for vinyl dye. That is the only stuff that will work.

It works on vinyl and plastic. Regular paint may chemically melt the vinyl 
and most certainly will fail soon. It is not designed for vinyl.

Take your dash apart - separate the metal portion near the windshield from 
the vinyl portion.

Clean the plastic and vinyl with mineral spirits and then clean lightly 
with lacquer thinner.

You can rub pretty hard with the mineral spirits and the lacquer thinner is 
just a quick wipe to remove any oily mineral spirits. Constant contact 
between the vinyl or plastic and lacquer thinner might soften or "melt" the 
vinyl or plastic. I did not have any problems when I did my dash from 
anything chemically melting but that warning is based on other experiences 
and other projects.

Anyhow the mineral spirits is used to remove any body grease on the 
steering wheel or dash and to remove anything like Armor-All.

Paint the metal portion and dye the vinyl portion.

I tore down my dash COMPLETELY - removing everything and dyeing it. The 
more you can tear it down the better it will look - less edges from masking 
parts off.

There are alot of color available too.
