Subject: re: Pop Top Liner

Richard et al:

I posted the following on the 10th of April... FYI:

Folks, for what it's worth:

I recently bought a gorgeous Volvo 765 with nary a problem but a
sagging
headliner. I took it to a local Headliners Plus! guy, and was
consequently so

impressed with his work and rates, I went home, drove my 78 Westy
back

to him, and asked what he could do about that godforsaken mildew
stain

on the "fuzzy" crap that lines the inside of the poptop. (I had,
by that point,

spent egregious amounts of money on surely every
commercially-available

product... and nearly killed myself in the process a number of
times:

fumes tend to congregate up there!)

Well, he takes a gander, and in the end, for a mere $250, he
installed a
"marine-grade" headliner, a nice comfy kinda stuff, PADDED mind
you,

and (here's the kicker) applied 3/4" oak strips all the way
around

the inside of the poptop - to which he re-stapled the canvas
(which was
sagging on one side) and screwed them into the fiberglass.

It looks incredible - and is surely the
one-thing-I-didn't-do-myself of
which I am the proudest! I highly encourage other folks to
investigate

similar options, if $250 is reasonable for them.


Cheers!
