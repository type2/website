A friend was just at a Fry's electronics and got a good look at some Dynamat.
The original is a thick rubber with an adhesive backing, the Extreme is
a very soft tar like substance (kind of like a soft version of
windshield "sticky" cord) with a foil backing.


The amazing thing is that the original looks to EXACTLY the same as the
sound dampening pads I got from MCM Electronics.  And he says mean exactly.
It even has the same color (light blue) sheet of plastic covering the
sticky side.  In looking at the Dynamat site, the original speaker kit
even uses the exact same size (10"x10").  Well here is were is gets real
interesting...


...the trunk kit is 20 sq ft and cost $99 ($130 suggested retail), the
suggested retail for two 10"x10" original squares is $14.99.  MCM sells
the EXACT same thing for $.99 a square, that's $1.98 for two, and that
of course is 13% of the cost of Dynamat, or to put it another way,
Dynamat is marked up 857% over retail price!  Ouch!!


Talk about a markup!  And they don't even do any big advertising like
Nike.  I will take a wild guess and say the owner of that company is
raking in the buck big time.  Kind of irritating though.


He highly suggested anyone considering Dynamat look into the other
product.  (You can even get it for $.90 if you order 100 or more.)  One
thing to watch out for though is the shipping.  Since the stuff is
pretty heavy, shipping is a little steep.  He says he believes he got around 30
square, which ended up costing almost $20 to ship.  That still works out
to only about $1.66 a square.


He hoped thought some might find this information useful.
