While I can't directly comment on how hard/PITA working on a dual carb
setup is. You don't want to force this issue. I would get any specific
opinions about your bus from the mech (sounds like you have already)
and keep those at the back of your mind. Making a mech work on
something he either doesn't feel comfortable with or doesn't like will
only give you greif. I can see 2 months down the road him simply
saying "well I said you would have this problem, but you insisted".
Start looking around for another mech or buy the muir & work it
yourself.
