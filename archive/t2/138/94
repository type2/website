Subject: type IV cutting out

hey,

i have searched the archives with no luck.
so heres the scenario again.

-76 westy-
re-installed head temp sensor on cyl 3 after repairing
sendor wire. now bus cuts out (like clock work) at
start up. starts up, idles fine, cuts out, everytime.
start it up again and it runs fine, usually. the other
nite i started it up, and it cut out. started it
again, put it in reverse(up hill) , hit the gas, cut
out. started it a third time, hit reverse, no prob.

any ideas here. i know that i have seeen threads on
this list before about cyl head temp sensors and
cutting out, which is why im a bit suprised that i
cant find anything in the archives. at any rate,
thanks in advance. any and all answers, opinions, or
insights will be greatly appreciated.
