Time to learn how to do this work yourself. You'll save money, gain 
satisfaction, and be better able to care for it when it breaks down on the 
side of the road.

There is an English company that sells hard tog et carburetors and can 
rebuild your old carbs.

Get thee a new set (or rebuilt set I mean) and use your service manuals and 
the wisdom of this list and get the job done right.

You don't need no stinkin' mechanic.... <grin>
