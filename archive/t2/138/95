I have been watching this thread for several posts...and now have to jump=
=20
in.

I had one of these, yes I used two synchronizers...about 20 years ago.

I rebuilt the engine and carbs on my 72 and thought they worked=20
great....plenty of power(relative to the 67 I had before)...great brakes.
Compared to some of the Kadrons linkage setups, they vw linkage on that
engine was perfect...infinitley adjustable and it stayed where you put it.


Did 90+ mph on the istate on one of those unbelievable no cars anywhere
Saturday mornings where you can see for about 10 miles.  Never did it=20
again, but *never* had any trouble keeping up with any traffic....this was=
=20
not a camper.

I can't remember ever having to touch the carbs again...and I probably put=
=20
60k on that engine...got great 22mpg+ on the hiway(no head wind).


Rebuild/rebush them, make sure they are installed as the factory would,=20
synchronize them according to the bentley and drive on!

Cheers, dave
