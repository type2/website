Subject: Re: [T2] Dellorto carb experiences (long, technical)

I got my set of Dells while I lived in Italy. I took them off of an Alfa 
Romeo Sud (say sood - means South).

I bought a bunch of jets and such from CB and discovered that their 
recommended adjustments were too rich so I found a happy place somewhere 
between the Alfa settings and CB. The Alfa was too lean.

I was running 34mm venturis I think. A quick check when I get home will 
tell the tale if you like.

My recommendation would be to buy or build a air/fuel monitor and check 
your jetting.

I'm not sure what to say about your lower vacuum settings. Maybe the 
venturis are still too big and the vacuum signal is weaker and thus the 
fuel is not getting metered well.

I was running a stock 2.0 bus engine in my Beetle with an 050 distributor. 
Never had a bog or flat spot.

Have you tried a different distributor? Have you revved the engine with a 
timing light on it to be sure the timing is advancing smoothly?

What sort of fuel pressure? For my info - what type of fuel pump? (I had 
one of those noisy little helicopter pumps and won't use one again.)
