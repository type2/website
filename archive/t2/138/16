Subject: Re: [T2] more 79 cali distributor


My stock 78 fed dist doesn't have the retard either, but it's sitting in a
toolbox and the 79 CA is on the van without the retard connected.

My questions are should the 79 CA dist be timed the same as the 78 fed dist
when the retard is not connected,
and should I disobey my mechanic and connect it and retime it?

Jeff,

My 78 stock fed original does not have retard on the dist.

I'm pretty sure that it is timed at about 7.5 degrees and does *not* have
an egr.

Jeff, I think my total advance is about 40+ degrees...

Hope that helps, dave
