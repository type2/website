And another thought...What happens to the Bus you've left behind?
That could come back with a vengeance if it ever turned up again.
There have been tales of classic cars being stripped down to piles
of parts and added to enough to make three using a single title/
bill of sale sold in three different countries. Not worth it for a 
Bus, obviously, but a Bugatti perhaps...I'm not familiar with all the
VIN locations on a Bus, but I'd hate to have the Gendarmes walking 
up my driveway looking for the owner of the Bus with a stack of
tickets or somesuch...
