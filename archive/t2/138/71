Not sure I understand your question. Are you asking 'how to replace it?'. If
yes, it is a major PITA. Don't you love how they hid it under the tin above
the spark plug? The easiest way I have found is to get a 1/2" drive 12mm 6
point DEEP socket. I pack all the wire up in the socket.

You have a 74 with FI?  Is it an auto trans Calif version bus?
