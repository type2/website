Justin,

This is an example of something that always bugs me on the list...

Where in the world do you live!?  What is "Headliners Plus"

You make it sound like a chain, but I can't find a phone listing in Dallas 
,LA, Louisville or Atlanta for "headliners plus".  

I checked your isp and they are out of Louisville...but that really means 
nothing.

Guys(and Ladies)!!!  info, info info.  where, where ,where!

<end of rant mode><sigh>

Thanks for listening, dave<grin>
