Subject: Helpful Hint - gas gauge adjustment

Does your gas gauge not go all the way up when the tank is full?  You might 
be able to adjust it.  On the back of my gas gauge there is fastened a 
small metal box with two wires coming out.  I'm not quite sure of the 
function of this box but I think I heard someone refer to it as a "wiggler" 
and it appears to vary the voltage going to the gauge in a wave-like 
fashion with a frequency in the neighborhood of 1hz.  In any case, this box 
has a tiny adjustment screw on the back that must be grabbed with a small 
needlenose pliers.  When you turn it in (clockwise) it expands the range of 
the gauge.  The farther you turn it in, the higher the gauge will read on a 
full tank (and the lower it will read on empty).  When I first replaced my 
sender with a new VW one, the gauge would read about 7/8 full on a full 
tank and at the top of the reserve when empty.  Not acceptable.  I cranked 
the screw in a bit and now it is perfect.  Just above full when full and 
below the red when empty.

Junkyard research tells me that not all busses have this adjustment screw 
on the little box.  If you don't have it, it might be possible to swap in 
an adjustable one but do your homework first so nothing burns out.  :-)
