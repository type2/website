Early Rabbits with electronic ignition. Not the later ones. The early ones are
easy to spot by the connecter on the distributor. It will be a slip on. Later
ones have a metal clip. The coil will have part # 211 xxx xxx B on the bottom.
C is the later, wrong, one.

Do not cap the retard side. Leave it open.
You are not adding all the advances up. 21-25 is only the centrifugal part.
You also get 11-13 vacuum + 7.5 initial. [in you case 8]
8 + 11-13 + 21-25 = 40-46 [if you rev the engine with a timing light on, it
will usually go to the o in vor, past 40 on the scale]

Take a look at the specs for the 78 dist, 021 P or 022 S on page 75 of section
5 in the 68-79 Bentley, and compare them to the 039 C on page 80. Almost
identical except for the retard side. Always set the engine to the distributor
you have. If you don't use the retard side, subtract the total retard amount
from the initial correct timing. 5 after minus 13 = 8 before.
