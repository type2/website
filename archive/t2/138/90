Subject: Re: [T2] help with idle and cold start

We have a bus with a confirmed dead cold start valve.

It helps our van to floor the gas pedal when trying to start it cold.

My theory (unconfirmed) is that it moves the flapper in the flapper box 
causing the computer to send more gas to the injectors.

My .02 cents only.

Your idle problems I don't understand though b/c once started both our 
busses will idle perfectly no matter what the temperature.

My guess is that either your EGR valve or your injector seals are leaking 
and sealing once it all warms up.
