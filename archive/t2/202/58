Subject: horn button removal

Hi:

I need to replace the turn-signal assembly on my '79 bus, which I assume 
involves removal of the steering wheel.

Can anyone tell me how to remove the horn button. I thought I'd ask 
first, rather than destroy it and thereby learn how not to remove it.

Thanks.

Rob
