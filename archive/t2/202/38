Subject: there's lots of bouncing in the front end

Hi everyone
I am a proud owner of a 74 Westy.  I've owned it for about 8 months now and
really haven't had any serious problems with it yet. (knock, knock)
Recently it has become very bouncy in the front while I am on the road.  It
doesn't seem to do this when I'm at higher speeds but more likely when I am
going at the speed of 15 to 30 mph.  I know that this doesn't tell you much
but does anyone have any ideas?  
Thanks a lot
TARA
