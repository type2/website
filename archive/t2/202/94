OK, let me see if I can tell you what the pod is all about.
The pod is not VDO.
I cannot find a VDO pod, so the pod from the supplier is a 3rd party 
sourced one that comes in either left or right angled meter mount.
The pod I am getting would normally mount on the dash, and to the left side 
of the steering wheel, with the meters slanted to the right for easy viewing.
Upside down, it will mount so that the meters slant to the left.

To my mind, but unable to see an actual installation, I sort of thought the 
pod on the dash would be the way to go.

Now then, the vendor guy says he does not think I will like the pod being 
mounted on my dash, so he suggested the upside down scheme.

Maybe I should just order both pods, left and right sided configuration 
mount, so as to be able to make up my own mind upon receipt, and then 
return the one I decide to not use.

What you think ??
