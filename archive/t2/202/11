Subject: Re: [T2] floor pan replacement and part question

Jen,

The "Belly Pan" is not what you are looking for.  That goes underneath
the front of the bus below the frame members and covers where the gas
pedal and parking brake are.

I can't help you much on the floor pan.  I have a '73 that I replaced
the floor beneath the drivers side after sticking a boot heal through
it.  I cut out the rusted area and welded in sheet metal (cut from our
old washing machine lid).  I haven't seen underneath a 72 so I can't
compare for you.  Anyone else?
