I too had a fuel pump failure on a long trip but had no spare, and no parts
available (long week end and a long way from any shops). I managed to
continue my travels by connecting a small 12V electric compressor I had to
the fuel tank breather (in the engine bay), and connecting the inlet and out
let hoses to the fuel pump together. Then it was a matter of putting a few
holes in the breather hose so the pressure didn't build up too much.
This worked a treat and kept us going for a few days (and ~200km) until we
could get an electric fuel pump!
Handy to remember if your stranded without a spare fuel pump and have a tyre
pump.
