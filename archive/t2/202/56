Ooh, 2 years, a true martyr.

VW can sue anyway, even if you win, you
have the expense of lawyers and such.  I'd be willing
to bet that if VW wanted the domain, they would have it.

Even if the domain names are safe and secure, that doesn't
change the fact that nobody in their right mind would
trade a running and driveable bus for those domain names.

Now, if were type2.com, that would be different ;-)
