I just bought a Raytek handheld with a backlit display and all for $10 at a 
garage sale. Even came with a good set of batteries. Seems to be very 
accurate. Also a good tool for pointing at your wife and proclaiming 
"You're hot stuff!" and pointing at your sleeping kiddo and saying "he's 
out cold...".

I hear that Radio Shack has something similar for around $50 but I have not 
checked up on it.
