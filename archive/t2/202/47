Correct, as stated in my original post. What I'm trying to determine is
whether or not this will have a detrimental effect when running with carbs.

No. The cans are the same diameter. The stroke is longer on a 2l. I confirmed
this yesterday at the local VW FLAPS by comparing head gaskets for 2l and
1.8l heads. They are identical. (Different part numbers, but identical.)
