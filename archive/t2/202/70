Hey, volks!=20
  I have a question for ya'.=20
I bought a '79 Westfalia for parts ($225). It's a few miles from here, =
and we're going up on Saturday to strip her. She's all rusted out around =
the roof, apparently. I have in mind to take all the camper gear (very =
good, complete) and the tent top and put them on a '71 transporter that =
I bought, also cheap ($575, blown engine).. The latter is a very nice =
vehicle, very clean overall, and runs, shifts and handles good now. This =
is the one we went up to Couer d' Alene with an engine for (with another =
type 2, of course), installed it and drove it back 1,600 miles, camping =
on the way. So, it passed the first road test! >:0)
I had bought this '71 for restoration. Then I found out that she had a =
'73 nose (Someone else had pointed this irregularity to me before I =
bought it, but I took a chance and bought it anyway). Someone had done =
an excellent job on replacing the nose.. you can hardly tell! But it was =
replaced, and it is no longer an original, so I figured she was a good =
candidate for a camper conversion.=20
Does anyone have any advice, links, warnings (such as "STOP, don't go =
there!") on this kind of a project? Thanks in advance..=20
ps.. By the way, I have found another even better '71 to restore now.. =
$635, no engine.=20
Regarding the conversion, I am not concerned with anything except the =
interior detail around the inner entry to the upper tent berth. I want =
to do a good job of it and wonder if anyone has any words of advice on =
that.   Jan B
