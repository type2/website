In my opinion, this has nothing directly to do with the fuses, although =
sometimes two things at once can be wrong.=20
I would check the chassis to engine (in this case, transmission) ground =
first, and then I would go to the turn signal on=20
the steering column. I have a '71 and I just had a problem with the =
brake lights not functioning properly.. the problem
was dirty contacts in the turn signal assembly. It took me about 1/2 =
hour to fix. The ground strap would take about as=20
long to fix. It may be loose or the contacts between the strap end and =
anchor could be dirty. In my opinion, nothing will '
make a vehicle act wierder than a bad or missing chassis/engine/tranny =
ground. I've never seen this problem in a  VW,=20
but I've seen it in a '71 Ford pickup. It took an experienced mechanic =
to prove it to me. I was dumbstruck! Jan B
ps.. Regarding fuses, you can check them visually AND with a little =
volt-ohmmeter (under $20, lots of places)..or, you can use=20
a timing light on either side of the fuse when they are in.. If only one =
side lights, then the fuse is either bad or it is loose or=20
sitting in a corroded seat. If both sides of the fuse are dead, don't =
worry about it as yet..
If a fuse is sitting in a corroded seat, just spinning or turning it a =
few times will usually make contact.=20
I worked for almost 26 years as a telephone installer and repair..<ahem> =
woman.. I know a little bit about DC circuits. DC=20
circuits are very prone failure to "cold joints".. a little bit of =
corrosion or oxide builds up between contacts or even in a poorly=20
soldered joint or connection, and the electricity will not flow. This =
happens especially where there is no or low voltage flowing through that =
circuit.=20
So, you will have this happening on fuse blocks, but normally just the =
friction involved in turning the thing between your thumb and forefinger =
in it's seat will get it going again.=20
Here is another problem.. If you have a poor ground or connection, what =
may and often will happen is that the electricity going through that =
part of the circuit will essentially be going through a resistor. DC =
current produces heat when it goes through a resistor.. That heat can =
begin to ruin your wire, especially right near the place where the =
current is not flowing. That's why I said that stiff or hardened wire =
can sometimes be a giveaway that something is going on there.=20

To me, everything that you are experiencing suggests that your chassis =
ground is loose. That is the first thing that I would check. Make sure =
that none of the leads are pulled off your voltage regulator or =
generator as well, but I don't think that is the problem. Go under the =
vehicle and you will find a large, braided strap going from the =
transmission to the frame. I think that is where your problem is.=20
