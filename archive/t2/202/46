   Hi All.

  I just finished an oil change and tune up on the Contraption (73 Westy =
1700cc dual Solex), in preparation for our circle tour of Lake Huron and =
Georgian Bay
(Michigan and Ontario) starting this weekend. I have found a prob. Some =
times when I turn the ignition switch to the first position to check for =
my idiot lights, I get nothing. If I wait 2-3 sec. they come on. Also if =
I turn the key off then back on they light up. I cleaned and tightened =
the ground wire to the battery but still the same.
   Is my ignition switch failing?
 Can someone explain to me how to by pass the switch if I'm on the road =
and need to hot start the bus? I don't want to be stranded. How do I hot =
start it? Wire from battery to starter??

Thanks for any help.

Keep Bussin
