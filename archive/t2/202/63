Subject: Re: [T2] Ignition Switch Trouble??

Yes I think so. The insides of the switch are nylon and it is greased. Each 
position of the key represents a small nylon button that moves to make the 
copper contacts do their thing (at least this was the way it was on my 
Italian spec '72 Super Beetle).  Eventually they wear down too much or they 
get stuck.

I think this may be the problem.
