You can always make patterns of floor coverings by using paper and tape, =
scissors and exacto knife. It would be slow for something like this, but =
you can make a good pattern. The home improvement stores have rolls of =
heavy pink paper that is good for making floor patterns. You can cut an =
entire kitchen floor like this. I've done it. On vertical areas the =
paper would sag and buckle a bit, so you'd need to find something with a =
little more body. Non-corrugated cardboard should work, but not so easy =
to find. An piece of linoleum flooring could do also and would be easy =
to cut and work with. On using old kick plates as panels, some of them =
are so distorted that they aren't 100% reliable.. but they would do to =
make a rough first generation pattern, and you could cut a bit oversize, =
then true it up after by marking and trimming. Nothing beats those =
little premade kickplate panels, though. They are accurate, easy to =
install, and the material is just right for the job. They don't crack or =
break if someone pushes on them.   Jan B
