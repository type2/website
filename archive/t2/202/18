My final comment...it would seem all this information can be distilled down
to this with still some uncertainty.

GL4 - if you can find it, use it
GL5 - avoid like the plague for manuals
GL4/GL5 - ditto
MT1 - not for passenger vehicles
GL5/MT1 - safe like GL4, car intended like GL5

If GL5 would normally be suitable if it weren't for the corrosive properties
of the additives, the addition of the MT1 designation may make it suitable
for VWs...
