Can you verify that all 4 spark plugs are firing? Have you pulled each 
while the engine is running to check?

The other thing to consider is a stuck or burnt valve. A compression check 
will tell.

Lastly and least likely would be a bad injector. I THINK you can pull the 
wire to each injector and see if you pull one and find no difference 
meaning that cylinder is not firing - - - and this could be related to any 
of the reasons above.

Good luck.
