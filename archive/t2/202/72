Subject: Re: [T2] patterns for panels

Well if you have a nice shop set up for woodworking, then I guess it wouldnt
be that hard. I bought a sliding door panel from Bus Depot (TMI Made) and it
was well worth the money I paid for it, it looks better than the ones that
came on the buses originally. and it was made of a more durable material.
