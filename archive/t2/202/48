Subject: Head temperature sensor


What do these things look like? Specifically, what does the business
end look like? I'm putting new heads on my bus this weekend and want
to put a head temperature gauge in it while I'm at it. I know the
preferred mounting location is #3 hole, but I don't know how it gets
mounted there.

I'm going to have some ports on the heads that will need
to be plugged, and am thinking that mounting the sensor in one of those
makes more sense than right on the spark plug hole, as it would be
more permanant. 

Not knowing how the sensor mounts, however, this is pure speculation on my
part.

Thanks.
