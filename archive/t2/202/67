Subject: patterns for panels

Does anyone know if there are patterns available for various inside panels?
I've got a  '78 bus and was looking for patterns for the front door panels,
kick panels, front carpet and the pedestals. I can do it without them, but I
figure someone must have patterns already made up.

Thanks
Mat
