Hi Guys,

Potentially silly/stupid/dumb question here, but is there only one size =
in the dome of the end caps that press/push onto the front hubs (with =
the speedo hole in the passenger side (left for Oz) end-cap ), or were =
there 2-3 sizes in the dome itself?

Thing is, I scored a set of 15x6 mags from a 1995 Audi A4 from a guy at =
work for $200, as I knew the stud pattern (5 x 112) and offset (45mm) =
were right for type 2s, but I just tried the never fitted spare on the =
front of my '74, and the centre hole in the wheel is maybe 1-2mm too =
small to fit over the dome of the end hub end cap :o(

Anyway, before I run out to buy tyres for these wheels, and get the =
centre holes in all 5 wheels reamed out by 1-2mm to fit over the domed =
caps on the front hubs, I thought it'd be worth asking if anyone knew of =
alternative end-caps (different year, of beetle, or something) that will =
fit onto the spindles, but are 1-2mm smaller on the domed cover?

Any information and/or assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Regards,
