No, no degree.. just me.=20
I live in Inglewood, CA.=20
I just retired 6 mos. ago.. a buyout, after the fall of the WTC.=20
I will be looking for something later on. If you have anything, let me =
know.=20
I am trying to catch up on a loose ends after so many years working in a =
service industry.. you come home pretty tired sometimes. Even when I was =
still young I was frequently coming home too tired to eat. It was rough, =
but honestly, I loved it. I guess I like a challenge. My last two weeks =
I volunteered to go up to Santa Rosa to work, and I did not shirk or =
shrink back from anything. I was on my way out, but it was a joyful way =
to end a carreer of service. I had a blast! I hung drop lines that their =
local boys had been tagging as "NTF"s (no trouble found), or bandaiding. =
I fixed one man up with three new lines (#'s) that he had been trying to =
get in for almost a year.. no one would help him. I ran one drop through =
the oak trees to a cabin overlooking the Russian River. It was all a joy =
and a pleasure and a wonderful way to top off that carreer. My last =
excellent telephone adventure.. and I made a lot of money, too!  :0)=20
I did some high tech stuff and I worked with business accounts, and I =
was a grunt out in the field. I loved it all. What a super, super job! =
Most of all, the people I met over the years in their homes and =
businesses have my lasting love, respect and thanks!=20
