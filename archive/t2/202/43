Leave the radio off, and the window down !
Listen very hard to your engine!!

If you hear pinging, get off of the gas IMMEDIATELY !

Right now, you might retard the timing just a bit, and if possible, add an 
octane booster fuel additive, or just go to a higher grade of petrol.

When your engine pings, it is in a very bad state of mis-match of the spark 
plug explosion as a function of time to the corresponding piston position 
within the cylinder.

During ping state, forces within are quite strenuous and destructive.
