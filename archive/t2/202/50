Tom,

Hmmmmm...what year/engine

Fi fuel pressure regulator is a "sealed" unit and *not* normally 
adjustable(there "are" ways to do this though).

Carbed engine is usually only adjustable by changing gaskets under the 
fuel pump....

Cheers, dave

Now, that they are in the right place, my bus does something odd.  
when I start it, it idles at about 750-900 RPM then after about 30 secs. 
it jumps up to what i am guessing 1200 RPM or Any thoughts on what would cause this?  How dependent is idle speed on vaccuum?  Could this also have something to do with the fact that I adjusted my fuel pressure regualtor?
