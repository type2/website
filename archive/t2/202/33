Subject: Re: [T2] Head swapping question

The F.I. 2 liter engine has smaller valves to minimize (I think) the intake 
pulses that would confuse the AFM. They also came with mild cams to help 
the same problem.

The only other problem I see is that the 2L heads are going to have a 
larger hole for the top of the clyinder than you need and I do not know if 
this will cause sealing problems or not.
