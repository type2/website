Regarding the '71 with electrical problems..=20
If there is ONE thing that you do, check your ground strap on your
transmission. Take it off, buff it up where it bolts on to the engine =
and
tranny with a wire brush or sandpaper and rag wetted with a bit of =
solvent.
This is the number one cause of wierd gremlin problems, in my =
experience.
What happens is that the DC current in any particular part of the =
harness
starts to seek around for a ground and bleeds into other parts of the
circuitry and wiring, causing wierd problems.
You may also want to repolarize  your generator according to Idiot book
instructions.
As for blinkers and so on, none of this will work properly if your =
grounds
are missing or loose on the taillight and turn signal assemblies (each =
should be=20
checked).=20
 I solved some real wierd problems like that by simply taking the turn =
signal
assembly on the column apart.. two screws, easy..and cleaning the shiny
little nubs on either side of the center.. You can see them easily when =
you
operate the turn signal in your hand.. there is a contact that will move
over them. If these contacts have a build up of crud on them, as mine =
did
(black, yukky), then your turn signals and brake lights will work
intermittently, or not at all. Solution, a little rubbing alcohol on a =
swab
and a quick pass with a rag, then back together again.
By the way, if you have trouble with your turn signal assembly shifting =
back
and forth on the column, tape some electrical tape and wrap it a time or =
two
around the column just under the lower edge of where the turn signal =
housing
sat, and put that assembly on, then take your tape and wrap around and
around, stretching the tape slightly as you go. You don't need a big =
ball of
it.. You will be surprised how nice it firms up that assembly for you.
Before you start your little project, you might want to bring out a =
ziplock
baggy or two and a white bedsheet, so that if any parts drop on the =
floor,
they will be easy to find and not roll out the door. On a scale of one =
to ten, this job is a two.=20
