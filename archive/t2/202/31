I'm not sure but I think it is installed like an oxygen sensor - just a 
bung welded into the pipe someplace after the collector (where all the 
pipes come together). I think they tune the engine until the EGT is the 
coolest or the hottest (I can't remember) and this represents maximum power 
of the engine.

I know the racer crowds and the airplane guys all use them.
