Subject: Re: [T2] idle woes - was engine woes

Ahhh...this is a dual carb engine with an electric fuel pump.  engine is
from a 72
I think my high idle woes are from out of synch carbs.  I put the unisyn on
them last night and the right one was WAY out.  Any thoughts on why I would
be getting smoke coming out my breather hose?
