Hi,
From you description I would suggest you check the shock absorbers (dampers). Push down hard on a front corner and release suddenly - your van should go up then return to the normal position, more oscillations than this would indicate a worn out damper; a visual inspection of the dampers may show a fluid leak which is a definite sign that replacement is needed.
If only one damper is worn out I would still replace them in pairs ie both front and/or both back at the same time.

Also between the ends of the front axle assembly there is a smaller diameter (15mm) bar known as the anti roll bar which helps to stop longitudinal roll of the body when only one front wheel goes up or down relative to the body. If this were loose then the ride would become more bouncy. Its unlikely to be broken as they go with a bang that you will known about followed by a very worrying and load rattle.

Good luck
