 From the note it turned out to be the license plate light was shorting 
to ground.  I have seen this happen on quite a few older vehicles where 
problems turn up after replacing bulbs.  Note that these problems will 
rarely blow a fuse as they just provide an alternate current path and 
not a short to ground with enough of a draw to blow the fuse.  Yours was 
very likely a very similar type prob and you hit a bump or something 
that broke the alternate connection.
