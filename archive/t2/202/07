This problem has got to be in your fuse box. I'm sure you will
eventually find the problem there. That's where you've been working and
the evidence you give indicates juice is running almost randomly through
the box and grounding in the same random manner. To isolate the problem
you could pull one fuse at a time and see if the problem disappears.
Remember that the systems that belong to the fuse you pulled will not be
working, but if everything else goes back to normal, you've found the
problem circuit. Go to your manual so you know which fuse is for which
circuits. Double/triple check every fuse location and every connection
in and out of both sides of the box, and make sure that no hot leads are
going to ground anywhere, and that no connectors are making contact with
anything they aren't supposed to be touching. Also, feel along each wire
as far as you can from the connector to see if you feel any cracks or
bare spots that could allow spart to arc to ground or to another
connector or wire. That's about all I can think of. Good Luck.
