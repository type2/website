Subject: electrical gremlins - just about to leave on a trip...

Hello all; 

Sorry for those on both lists - I had to post this both places for maximum
coverage...I need ideas fast...

I finally thought my '71 Westy was ready to go for early tomorrow morning
on
a 3 week trip...fired it up to go for our goodbye dinner, and the brake
warning light was on...shite...

When I hit the brakes, warning light went off... ??? When the headlights
are
off, brake warning light is also off. When the headlights are on, with the
brake warning light, the right turn signals and the brake lights don't
work.
When the headlights are off, things are ok.

Additionally, and this is a good one, when I have the headlights on and
this
problem is happening, and shut off the ignition, the engine keeps running
until I take my foot OFF the brakes...then it shuts down...

I know this is abstract and obscure. Please help if you have any ideas. I
needed to leave early tomorrow morning. I have not fooled with the
electrical system other than replacing some bulbs that didn't work. Checked
timing and dwell recently, but didn't unplug anything. Checked gas heater
fuse because it wasn't igniting. Fuse seemed fine.

Cheers all 
dan
