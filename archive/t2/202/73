Ow! my head hurts, please line wrap.

I'd say go for it. The late bays have a very nice layout. One thing
though. The top (metal roof section) of a camper is different than
that of a regular hardtop. I was told that it is a direct decentant of
the sunroof bus, but haven't confirmed that. If you wanted to get the
pop-top to work on your 71 you will have to cut off the entire roof &
weld or epoxy it on the 71. There just isn't enough clearance under
the top for it to sit down correctly w/ the cot. With that said it can
be done, I seriously looked at it for a while, but ended up getting an
old sportsmobile top that fits like a glove on my 79. Greg Potts has
some pics on his site about what you want to do, though.

My suggestion is to just have a hardtop westy.
