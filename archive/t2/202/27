Sounds good, just be sure to work out the brake equalization since the bores
of the calipers are probably not the same (among other things, like weight
distribution and transfer during braking). If either end has even a tendency 
to lock-up before the other it will lead to rather exciting maneuvers when
stopping...Even more so on wet or slippery surfaces...
