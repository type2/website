Hi

Yup this is very common practice in the UK at the moment all the big 
dismantlers in the UK are at it. Parts are coming in from the US, Australia, 
South Africa etc etc. Its not just parts either lots of rust free bus's are 
leaving the US this way at the moment. I guess this will continue while ever 
people in the UK are prepared to pay over the odd's for spare parts and 
vehicles :(.

My own bus is a 1970 2 bertha westie imported from the states in 1976. It 
still required a lot of welding when i bought it but was still alot more 
solid underneath than many UK bus's that were up for sale in my price range.

Resently my sisters van a UK 72 devon failed the MOT because the front axle 
was rotten/rusty. The MOT tester told us we couldnt repair the front axle by 
welding it as it was too rusty and that we had to fit a new one :(. These US 
parts arent cheap the rust free axle from the states we bought from 
volksheaven cost us $280 US dollars ! On one hand this is very expensive i 
think, on the other hand we had no choice but to 'pay up' as the bus would 
have been off the road until we found a rust free UK axle if there is such a 
thing ...

(MOT - an annual inspection every vehicle in the UK older than 3 years has 
to pass to be allowed on the road in the UK)
