Subject: Head swapping question


I appreciate everyone's patience with me while I try to
figure this out.

I'm still working on getting replacement heads for my '74 westy 1800.
Today I found a local rebuilder who has some nice 2l heads that I can
get for a good price. These are rebuilt, and has new seats, valve guides,
and all new valves. The 2l will bolt right on to my 1800. The main difference
is that the intake valves are smaller. I understand that this is because
the fuel injection system works better with the smaller intake valves.

I'm going to be running carburettors for a while yet, and wonder if there's
a serious drawback to using the 2l heads with carbs for a while.

If not, I think I'll get these, which should last me a while until I can
afford to build the new engine.
