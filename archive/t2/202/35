Weber.... Standard issue center mount carburetor conversion. In Hawaii 
where the weather is mild I expect it will be fine if carefully tuned. Many 
were delivered untuned and many folks drove them like that for years.

If you clean it you will find the model designation someplace on it. Weber 
put this on all of their carbs.
