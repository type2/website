Subject: Re: [T2] Torqueing front hubs

Thing is, Bentley provides a torque spec for this, and as original poster,
my torque wrench also does not work backwards.

I like the thick washer tip.  I do not have a dial caliper.  I think this
kind of think is a bit intuitive, really.  I have never used a torque spec
for the front hub an any car that I have owned.
