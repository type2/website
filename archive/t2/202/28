Subject: window help

I am having 2 issues with my 71.  The drivers side window keeps falling off 
the track.  i pulled the panel off and it looks like the metal piece that 
holds the window has rusted off from the unit that allows it to move up and 
down.  I think i need to replace the entire track, arm etc.  my question 
is...how do i remove this from another bus without destroying the metal 
piece off the new one.  I cant get the rusted one off, not sure if it is 
glued on of just rust.

2nd problem.  my gas pedal has lost the right rocker spring underneath that 
holds it up, i currently have wedged a small cigar box there to hold the 
pedal in place, does anyone have a pedal they are looking to sell, trade, 
or is there a home remedy i might be able to try?

Thanks in advance

Rich
