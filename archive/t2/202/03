which bulbs??? it sounds like 12v is getting accross lines somewhere or 
a ground is now floating.  Take the sockets that you changed the bulbs 
in out of the housings so no contact is being made to anything and 
remove the bulbs.  Then check for the problem. I dont mean to cut 
anything here just pull them clear where you can see the back sides of 
the connectors and check for corroded out wiring.
