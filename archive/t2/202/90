Subject: RE: Dual battery Relay

Ok, here's what I did...

(Big thanks to John Rogers for his suggestions and info!)

Red wire on the relay (30) went to the positive terminal on the main
battery, brown wire on the relay (85) went to ground, black wire on the
relay (fused relay [86]) got spliced to a wire which was connected from the
voltage regulator to the lowest left hand male spade connector here
http://members.bellatlantic.net/~vze3t2qs/bus/engine006.jpg (not the one
circled in red, the one below that, it receives power only when the ignition
is in the ON position and when the bus is running) blue/red wire on the
relay (87) went to the positive terminal on the Aux. battery.

I've verified that the aux battery is getting power delivered to it when the
bus is running.

My questions... in the directions for the battery relay it said to connect
the Blue/Red wire to pin 2 for aux battery charging on the 12/7S socket,
there is a diagram showing alternative wiring where the blue/red goes to the
aux battery.  Is this alternative wiring supposed to be done in conjunction
with the wire to the 12/7S socket or is it ok to be independent as I have it
done?  If it should be done in conjunction, what is the 12/7S socket and
where is it located?

Also, as far as I can tell, the way this works is that when the bus is off
everything is still being run off of the main battery, but if I drain it, I
have the aux battery to jump start myself... (as long as it's charged) is
this correct?  Is this continuous drain and recharge of the main battery
safe (or smart) to do? Or should I rewire the things I want to run when the
bus is off to another fuse box which would be connected to the aux battery?

Thanks!
