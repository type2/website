Hello All   I know this is a little off for this list but I don't do the 
vanagon list, I'm in need of the H shape water pipe # 025 121 438 that is 
located under the exspansion tank. This part is NLA from the smart people at 
VWoA. I guess they just want you to throw these things away and buy a new Van 
from them. :) If anybody has one of these please let me know, new or used, 
Thanks  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing salem Import Service Salem Va
