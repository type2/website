Chris,

I'm not sure I would call it breather hose, but after I saw the pic I 
understood what you were after.

Unless you just *have* to have something with a vw part number, you can 
probably do quite well on sizing from a flaps like NAPA. 

It just needs to be gasoline quality stuff.

Cheers, dave
