Subject: [T2] Stock radio antenna location on a 68 Westy Camper?

My 72 Westy has a Bug antenna on it! It took me a long time to figure this
out. There seems to be a very common type of antenna. But mine is definately a
Bug one.  When I bought my Bus (in 1998) I didn't know there was any
difference. I had to replace mine because it was broken when I bought it. Most
likey the previous owner never got creative enough to look at Bug parts!
