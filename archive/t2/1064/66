Subject: Re: [T2] Speaking of Heaters, who's got a QUIET plug in they

Courtney... I chose a Caframo electric heater... the one I bought has many
features that come in handy .
it has 3 wattage setting.. if you're camping with others.. you can select
the lower wattage and not blow a breaker.. but still have heat.
the fan in it is wide and high volume,, but slow moving,,, so there is very
little fan noise.

the shape of it makes it very hard to tip over..

> Like most people, I have a small ceramic heater I plug in at campsites
with power, to get through the night. Mine however is quite loud when the
fan cuts in. Does anyone have a model that is quiet and they'd recommend? I
don't mind a BIT of fan noise, but mine comes on like the radiator fan in my
car. :-)
