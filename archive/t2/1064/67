Subject: Re: [T2] Speaking of Heaters, who's got a QUIET plug in they

To put out the same heat for the wattage, a smaller heater must run a 
smaller fan harder and thus it is noisier.  The bigger the fan, the 
quieter it can be.
I use a ceramic squirrel cage heater from "World Marketing of America" 
bought years ago through Camping World.  The heater lays flat and can be 
adjusted in angle of output. The ceramics are safer (no glowing element) 
and quieter if squirrel cage design, just like the cooling fan in your 
bus, AND they can be adjusted to face UP, important in the back of a 
camper so the heat just doesn't go on your feet.
