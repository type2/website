Subject: "moustache Bar"

I know the answer is prolly no....but sometimes 'independent thinkers'
automotively...have found a way... in this case...can the moustache bar rear
motor mount, be mounted to the engine, with the heater boxex/exhaust, already
installed?  I mounted everything, and thought I could put rear mount on
last,..so...looking for an 'easy out" solution, before I have to take exhaust
off.  Motor is out and on stand.  Thanks.
