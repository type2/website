my new GEX engine with 4 new pistons and cyl failed after 3k miles,
when torn down the "NEW" pistons were of 3 different makes (Mahle, VW,
Cofap) and were at rebuild balance tolerances. since the VW pistons
had not even been avaliable for several years it was pretty obvious
that these were not new.

I won a suit against them in small claims court for "non conforming
goods" ie: what I was given was not what was advertised.  I have yet
to recieve a penny.

the warranty is worthless.  and less than that they want you to send
the engine back to them at your cost, and then they tell you it is
your fault and quote you a very high price to fix or send it back to
you.

if they paid you to take the engine it would still be too expensive

let the buyer beware

YMMV
