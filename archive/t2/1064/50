My 1968 Kombi is not in front of me, but I believe the antenna is on the
driver's side.

It is attached close to the driver's side door, about the same height as the
bottom of the fresh air vent screen in the middle of the nose.  The car has
been in the family since new, so I'm confident that this is the original
mounting location.

This isn't the best picture, but you should be able to get a rough idea from
it.  You can download it and open it up in it's original size for a better
view.
