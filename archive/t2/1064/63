[OVT] How to remove crank pulley??


I am trying to install an adapter to make
a 1500 engine (case NOT drilled for an engine hanger bar) fit into a 1970
westy. I need to remove the crank pulley to get to the oil pump cover top
studs. Soooo, is removing and re-installing the crank pulley as easy as
loosening the big bolt and removing then vice-versa for re-installation? OR
are there any special tools I need or other considerations when removing a
crank pulley??

PEACE!
