I'd think you could pull off the fan housing and then unbolt the motor 
mounts from the block?

However, I don't know if there'd be anything else in the way.  If you 
have it on the stand it should be pretty obvious what's blocking it from 
coming off?  Maybe if you just pull the muffler off?

Sorry.. don't have an engine on the stand to look at ;)
