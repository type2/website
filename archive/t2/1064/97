Subject: Speaking of engines, anyone ever bought a Bernie Bergman motor?

A current post is asking about GEX engines, and has recieved the usual warnings, but has anyone ever purchased a Bernie Bergmann motor? He advertises in gorgeous colors in the usual VW rags, but I've NEVER heard any feedback from anyone. Just curious. Typically Type 1 motors.
