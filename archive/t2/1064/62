Subject: How to remove crank pulley??

I am trying to install an adapter to make a 1500 engine (case NOT drilled for an engine hanger bar) fit into a 1970 westy.  I need to remove the crank pulley to get to the oil pump cover top studs. Soooo, is removing and re-installing the crank pulley as easy as loosening the big bolt and removing then vice-versa for re-installation?  OR are there any special tools I need or other considerations when removing a crank pulley??

PEACE!
