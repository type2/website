After installing a BN4, I too went a similar route.  My cost was $300, including the mufflers and
install.  Although probably not as loud as Greg's Harley setup, this to is a bit louder than the
stock setup.

I asked the list a while back when I did this, what the affects to torque/hp would be.  By the
seat of my pants, it seemed that my low end torque took a slight hit when I made this exhaust
change, and more online reading seems to show that that may be due to the lower amount of back
pressure.  Anyone on the list have thoughts on this?  Would it be worth trying to fit in a cross
over pipe of some sort to increase back pressure?  Am I just thinking about this all wrong?
