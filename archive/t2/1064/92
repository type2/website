Subject: GEX is bad because ...

I hate to distract from my "Need a 1974 Engine" post but the mechanic has found a couple of engines.  One being a GEX, which apparently for $200 comes with an extended 36 month/36,000 mile extended warranty.

I've read lots of posts that say to stay away from GEX but I haven't saved the messages.  I was gonna check the Type2 Archive before posting the question here but I keep getting an error message.

So. Why should I stay away from GEX engines?  

Thanks, 
Steve
