My daily driver is my bus, and it shows.  While the rust has increased ten-fold since I've been in
the Colorado area, I blame a lot of that on not taking the time to toss a couple bucks at the
local DIY car wash to spray the thing down.  Doing that would surely reduce the adverse affects of
the exposure.
