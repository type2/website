Subject: Header Pipes made by European Motorworks

For those of you interested, here are the pipes I bought privately. It appears
they are made by E.M. as kindly suggested by Scott Lyons. The only diff I see
is mine are chrome plated, and have a slightly dff. stud mounting bracket on
the head end. Looks like the new one as shown at E.M. might be better.
