Seriously!  I have a couple spare just because they keep breaking!

However, I think they were breaking recently because I didn't have the 
bracket hooked up on the opposite side (it was broken).  Hopefully now 
that I've fixed that bracket the alternator bracket won't break 
again......  .. . until I back into a hole again while offroading ;)
