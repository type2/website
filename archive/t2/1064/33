Subject: Pictures of heaterbox replacement headers for my 77 Baywindow

http://www.flickr.com/photos/chookvw/?saved=1

Here is a shot of the replacement headers for my 77 Bay that will get rid of
all the crap on the exhaust system. Would appreciate any input again, on what
I will need to be aware of re: brackets, cooling, etc, when I take the
heaterboxes off. I notice there are ducts coming down from the fanshroud etc,
to blow through the heaterboxes. I suspect I will have to close these off? Any
brackets to alternator etc to worry about?
Thanks,
Courtney
