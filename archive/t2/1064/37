Subject: 32/36 weber...

I swapped out one of my 32/36 weber carbs for another that I'd cleaned and spec'ed...
This carb was already on a square manifold that connects to a pair of original FI runners
(injector ports plugged).
Although I don't have any leaks, the carb doesn't seem to warm up and I'm running on the
choke much too long. Anybody with this setup (or similar) with a method of bringing some
heat to?it...Something under it to transfer heat from the top of the engine to the manifold?
A jury-rigged heat riser??
It's obviosly on a 2L...?
