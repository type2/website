Subject: Bought these today, to replace my heaterboxes

http://www.shoptalkforums.com/viewtopic.php?t=123291


So here are some replacement headers  I bought for my 77 baywindow, to get rid
of the heaterboxes. I am wondering what else is attached to my heater boxes
that I will have to be careful of, when using these? Any brackets etc? I will
attach a header/collector and single quietpower to these headers. Any
suggestions, are welcome, screaming at me is acceptable. :-)
