One might oddly enough want to watch the "washing down."  Having lived all my
life in the rust belt before coming to AK (where stuff rarely rusts) I can say
you are often better to leave the dry salt/snow ON the car, and the car
OUTSIDE, not in a garage so that the snow sublimes off in the low winter
humidity, washing ONLY when it warms up and stuff starts to melt, and avoiding
frequent into the garage warm up, melt but not washed off cycles.  Corrosion
requires an electrolyte and dry salt isn't a particularly good one, wet salt
water is, unless you REALLY clean off well, each time you spray down you just
make a nice electrolyte solution to creep into the cracks, crevices, frame
etc.
 
Just a FWIW.  YMMV, very much on this one.
