Subject: Speaking of Heaters, who's got a QUIET plug in they like?

Like most people, I have a small ceramic heater I plug in at campsites with power, to get through the night. Mine however is quite loud when the fan cuts in. Does anyone have a model that is quiet and they'd recommend? I don't mind a BIT of fan noise, but mine comes on like the radiator fan in my car. :-)
