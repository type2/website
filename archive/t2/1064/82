Subject: Rear passenger motor compartment wires?

Hi, the bodyman has cut some wires off during his escapades, and there are 4
wires....brown with pink dots....brown....yellow with red stripes....blue, and
they hook into the passenger side engine bay loom, right next to the duble
ground wire to body tab.  Since I cannot find my plug in for the firewall
mounted ...regulator????..would these wires hook to that missing plug...or?
Can't find diagram in Bentley...if anyone wants to point me there.  Thanks
Squid
