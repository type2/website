Subject: Need a 1974 Engine

Unfortunately the mechanic just called and said my '74 Camper has thrown a rod, is frozen up and needs a new engine.  He's checking around but hasn't found anything yet and doesn't sound too optimistic.  

Any suggestions on where I might find an engine?  Rebuilt, used, new (cough)??

I'm in Kansas City so I may have to drive to get it of have it shipped.

Thanks for any help.

'74 Westy (in sad shape)
