Subject: Injector rail fuel hose length

Hey Everyone,
I'm going to be changing out my four injectors with newly cleaned ones, 
and I wanted to cut some hose and put it on the injectors ahead of 
time.  I was curious if anyone knew the exact length that the hoses are 
supposed to be?  I could measure the ones I have on there, but I just 
guessed the length the last time I reinstalled the injectors (obviously 
long enough to fit the barbs in on both ends).  I know, this is a goofy 
question as the length I have on there now seems fine, but I just 
thought I'd ask if there was a "preferred" length ;)

Thanks,
Mike
