Subject: electric fuel pump wiring?

Hi, I have installed a rotary electric fuel pump, and now I need help in where
to wire it to...so it shuts off when motor is not running.  It is installed on
a '74 Westy 1.8 L.  Can any list member assist...as to where to wire it to for
the 'hot' terminal and any other useful info on this setup? TIA

PS  it is mounted on frame connector, passenger side, just below fuel tank
outlet..(the frame connector with the holes in it)
