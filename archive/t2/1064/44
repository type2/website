Subject: Stock radio antenna location on a 68 Westy Camper?

Hello all,

 

I am fixing up the nose on the bus and among other things, there are two
radio antennas mounted on there.  Neither appear to be stock (and neither
are hooked up) , so I ask, what is the stock radio antenna location on a 68
Westy?

 

I plan to weld up the holes for the non stock location and try to get back
to how it should be.  

 

Thanks for your help on the matter.
