Wow. I just bought a replacement battery for the Guac, same series (47
something? I should have written it down), but it's a solid inch longer than
the one I had. I thought that was the point of the series designations to
have them be the same size?

Anyway, I had to loosen the taillight bucket to get this one in. Tight fit,
but it's in there. I hope it solves my cold start issues!
