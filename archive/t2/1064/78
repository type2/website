Yep, Mr. Dearing is correct! So I made my own tool by drilling a piece of angle-iron and running a couple of bolts thru it and through the holes in the pulley, then I backed off the pulley nut put a big socket between it and my angle iron.  Started tightening up the nuts on the bolts and the angle iron and backed off the pulley that way...worked great!
Peace! John Baker
