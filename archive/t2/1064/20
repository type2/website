Well, I've been driving the bus this winter. '

I've got to say, the bitter cold seems to be really hard on the bus, moreso than the salt!
So
far this winter I've had to replace a transmission,(thank you bryon and brad) rear wheel
bearings (thank you scott), brake shoes (thank you john), broken fuel line, and crazy electrical gremlins
running amok. (The big downer has been working outside in the bitter
cold.) 

So far I've been driving to -25c (-13f) before the windchill.

Interestingly,
during the warm months I recall putting my hand over the defrost vents
and thinking "damn that's pretty hot". Now that it's -20's, that front
vent is barely warm enough to clear the windshield!

This weekend
I plan on taking the time, and washing the bus down good, going over
some of the surface visible spots of rusting with some compound and
wax, then re-spray some rust preventer here and there. I also need to track down some gremlins and fix my washer fluid pump. Of course today it's mild...when I'm at work. Tomorrow, when I CAN work on the bus, the temps are supposed to be frigid!
Only a few more months of cold!
