Hi Everyone. Just wanted to say that I have been to Busfusion several times
and it is one of the best VW events for bus owners.  To be honest at the VW
events that include all things VW I always feel like the bus lovers are some
what segregated. At bus fusion the buses are the stars of the show.  Great
organization and a beautiful location make this event worth the travel
time.  Obviously I4m a huge fan.
