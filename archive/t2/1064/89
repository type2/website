Subject: center mount carb heat...

I think I may have found a solution to my cold carb problem...I picked up a hot/cold gel pack at my FLAPS
(Friendly Local Auto Pharmacy Store ;-)
It's relatively malleable, so I could squeeze it between the manfold and the engine case and it "seems" to
be conducting heat...A scientific test of touching the manifold after a short run indicates that it's lots warmer
than it was without anythin'...;-)
