Changing the length or diameter of either the intake or exhaust pipes, or
combining them into a header all have an effect on the power generated at a
given RPM.
Here's a good primer: *http://tinyurl.com/bkaz3q*
the Dellorto carbs I had on my '72 had interchangeable "velocity stacks" of
different lengths for fine tuning. I miss those carbs.

"To take from one, because it is thought that his own industry and that of
his fathers has acquired too much, in order to spare others, who, or whose
fathers have not exercised equal industry and skill, is to violate
arbitrarily the first principle of association, 'the guarantee to every one
of a free exercise of his industry, and the fruits acquired by it.'"
