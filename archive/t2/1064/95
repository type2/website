Subject: Re: [T2] center mount carb heat...

Tony, I remember using a 12volt bulb wired into the system on my old Beetle engine that had a Holley Bugspray carb on it. The 12 volt bulb kept the icing from being so bad on that carb/manifold combination. Maybe one of those pathetic 12volt heaters that are sold as car heaters (which are useless, too small volts) might give off enough heat to blow on the carb/manifold combo and provide enough heat to keep the cold away?? You could install a remote switch on the dash to turn it off and on when needed?
