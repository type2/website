Subject: suggestion for where to slap in extra gauges

	I do believe as how I've bin able to slap my first pic on your Samba:
http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/518901.jpg
	The gauges don't look too flash as I compressed the pic to a 
truly skinny 36K.  I only just started digital photography  ...

	This position on top of the dash in front of the steering 
wheel minimises deviation of sight from normal driving line-of-sight.
	General list to starb'd is due to my being in the S. 
Hemisphere  -  and in a RH-drive camper.
	Tilts (yaw & pitch) should be carefully adjusted wrt 
reflections in windscreen, before you finally lash down the panel 
with a scrap of bicycle innertube going down thru the screen heater 
vents (which are not seriously obstructed thereby).
	The 'sunshade' on top is worthwhile (a scrap of Corflute) to 
minimise stray light to & from the gauges.
