Subject: [T2] Differences from vw pancake to Porsche 914 pancake

Hey everyone, new to this vw Bus thing, but getting pretty envolved in the 
craze.. I'm looking to upgrade power on a vintage pancake bus, I've 
researched converting to a watercooled, and that looks to be difficult, the 
next thing I was thinking, and have heard, that the Porsche 914 engine, is a 
direct bolt in, what is the differences between the vw pancake and the 914 
pancake? Pros cons if you know.. I would appreciate it..

Case
