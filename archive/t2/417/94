Subject: RE: [T2] Belly Pan?

Ah,
This would make sense as both of my vehicles are what the manual
referred to as a 'station wagon' model.  They are excellant for so
many things.  with the middle seats extracted and the back seats
strapped down, I have about as much room as a long bed pickup truck.
Except with a height restriction because of the roof.  Which is good
because here in Oregon it only rains once a year.  It starts in
September and stops raining in middle July.  No frills.  No deluxe
trim, no rubber strips on the bumpers, and no belly pans.  But I
still have my middle seats and heater attatchments which is more
than a lot of volks can claim...  :-)   Thanks for the edjumakashun.
