The bus depot has them in their catalog for $39.95, but I can't find them on their website.  Probably worth giving them a call.

VW auto salvage place would be a good bet too.  You may want to try: http://www.wayoutsalvage.com/.  I've never ordered from them personally so can't vouch for service/quality.

Mine was stuck in the back of a parts bus I got for free.  After banging out some of the dents and applying some por 15 it came out quite nicely.
