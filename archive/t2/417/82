karl,

there were also dished 914 pistons, but they have a much smaller dish (6cc
vs. 15cc) than a bus. the flat pistons were found on european models, though
it is common to see them on us models which have been rebuilt.

i have a set of the 914 pistons in my bus motor, they give a CR of about
7.8:1.
