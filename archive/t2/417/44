Yes pholks,

for those of you who don't know, having buttloads of beaters in the yard is not cool to the neighbors who have to share an eyesore with you as they come home everyday.

the problem with america (here I go) is that everyone's so busy screaming about what they're own rights are that we've forgotten that your rights end where your neighbor's begin.

I won't even get into the lost art of common courtesy.

I must be getting close to 30,

Billy
