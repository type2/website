Subject: Nuts an bolts reference

Does anyone know where I can find a quick reference for all these codes for
nuts and bolt sizes that are listed in the Bentley manual. (ie. M8 bolt, M10
washer, M12 nut, etc) ?? I cant seem to find a reference in the book, like
M8=13mm X whatever.  I want to go to the hardware store and make sure I am
getting the exact replacement.

Thanks,
Dave
