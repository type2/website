I have a 1979 Automatic Westfalia, delivered and sold in Canada. My bus has the
original BA6 gas heater. My bus has the front pan (as all buses do) and I have
the belly pan that covers the  bottom of the bus.

I am certain that all buses that came with the BA6 received this belly pan. The
other option that my Canuck Bus has is the dual-speed fans in the front ducts
(Stanadard option on Canadian buses (maybe europe too?))

They are noisy but WAY cool...
