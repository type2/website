Hi Brian,

I would be happy to sell you my OEM Bilstein jack, but I think you would be
way happier with one of the scissor jacks that Bus Depot sells.  I use one
for my '72 Bus and one for my '85 Westfalia.  It is way more stable than the
original jack, has a built in handle instead of a big nut and it's a steal
at 35 bucks.  Here's a link:

If you are dead set on the original style jack, let me know and we can work
something out.

Anyone here happen to have a spare jack with the lug tool and handle they'd
like to sell?  My dad borrowed mine to use on his 181 and it worked so
perfectly he wants one too.

thanks,
