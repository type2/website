Subject: Belly Pan?

I always thought that it would be a good idea to have
a skid plate like piece to protect the bottom of my VW
and it's components and such.  I wondered why all the
VW engineers in their infite wisdom didn't put one on.
 Now I learn that in fact they did, and my poor 74
Westy is missing its.  Gosh I'm clueless

What the hell...does anyone know of a place where I
could get one, as i've never come across one in all of
my parts searching in the past.  A used one is fine, I
can always clean it and such, just not rusty.

Thanks 

P.S.  for the love of god do not put screws to hold up
such a pan.  Speaking as a person who used to have
take skid plates and the like down off of cars at
Jiffy Lube.  You need to be able to put a socket on
there with either an impact wrench or at least a
ratcher and breaker bar.  I can't imagine the pain
that could be caused with screws, (very bad idea).
