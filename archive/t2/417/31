Subject: Question for All the Water Cooled Converts

Just curious, VW in Mexico used to sell the water cooled Bus (exactly like
ours) up until 2001. I'm not sure how long they produced them, but there's
got to be a way to get parts for the Bus. With that in mind, how come people
are looking for alternative water cooled motors when they could get a direct
drop in motor from Mexico?
