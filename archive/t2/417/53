Subject: Re: [T2] Question for All the Water Cooled Converts

"Why would anyone want a Wasser engine in a pre-79 bus? Why the heck!"

172 ponies of the VR6 persuasion, with a horizontally mounted radiator under 
the middle of my '70 is an attainable goal, and MUCH cheaper than a 911 
flat-six conversion.  The latter would be my first choice, but my wallet 
(and my wife) prefers the former.  My nostalgic view toward retaining 
originality ends at the drivetrain.  Keeping a Rhineland powerplant is good 
enough for me. :^)
