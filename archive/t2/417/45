Subject: door handles

Hi,

Anyone have any experience with after market door handles for a bus?   Mine 
is a 72 and I have found them at Rocky Mountain Motorworks for 19.95 each.   My 
bus was restored last year and the driver side door handle has now broken, 
the entire tumbler fell apart when I put in the key.   Their price seems OK as 
long as it is good quality.   I really don't want a used one if I can help it.  
 Is it possible to rebuild the ones that I have?   As always any guidance is 
well appreciated.
