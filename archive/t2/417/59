Subject: Re: [T2] EGR question

If the input to the EGR valve is properly sealed off then leaving it in
place isn't affecting a thing.  If the "pinched off" spot is leaking then
the EGR valve - off idle and before WOT - is a source for a vacuum leak.
Check to see that the pinched off spot isn't leaking and, if it isn't, leave
things alone.
