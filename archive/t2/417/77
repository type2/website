Subject: '70 Westy color code (off white)?

I've  been trying to get the color code for this bus, but can't seem to 
find it.  It ought to be an easy one since at least 80% of the '68-'71 
Westies are this same off white color.  The ID plate says 5239, but I 
know this isn't the same as what was on the (missing) silver sticker.  
Can anyone whelp me out with either the name of this color, or the code?

THANKS!
