Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] neighbors suck/65 project bus FOR SALE/trade

Actually.. I meant to say.. "on my property". I don't have any cars sitting
on the grass.
On the side of the house behind the fence, I layered out pavers and parked
my 84 Fiero there. The pavers connect to the patio and pool. But the car is
well off to the side where we keep the garbage cans.

The 81 TransAm and 73 Bus are in the garage.

The 87 Fiero, 97 GrandAm, 97 Ford Ranger, and the 2002 Jetta are all parked
in the driveway.

All the cars except the TransAm are in REALLY good condition. The TransAm is
too.. I just don't have the hood on, or the front right fender.

As I read replies to this thread, I find myself asking if it's really such a
bad thing to require people to NOT park cars in their front yard.  No
offense, but I don't think I would want to live on your cul-de-sac.
