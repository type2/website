What's next? A charge for taking our money to the bank.


Give me a break.

Next time you're in the restaurant don't tip the service folk and explain
that it wasn't included in the price so why should you pay it?
And as for Wal-Mart...Yes, they charge for everything included in getting
a product out the door...They're very precise about this and as a result
Wal-Mart carries nothing that doesn't "move" and buys its product on the
basis of "price"...(Wal-mart must support hundreds of Chinese factories...
Go thru' the store and see how many "made in America" stickers you can 
find? ); then see how many local stores that may have carried something
special that you're interested in are left... ?-(
