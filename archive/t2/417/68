Oil temp. The 914 center console had clock, oil temp and volt gauges. The
oil temp senders were often but not always rated for 400F and matched to the
temp gauge. I don't believe the 400F sender will work with any VDO gauge you
buy from the online vendors. Luckily it's cheap and easy to replace the
sender unless you've already put the oil in. The rating for the sender is
printed on the side of it.

Sounds great. I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
