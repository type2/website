That's funny, since I have no idea what W.A.S.T.E stands for in Tony's sig 
line. Whenever I see the end of Tony's messages, W.A.S.T.E. along with the 
addition of NJ always brings to mind Toxic Waste dumps and super fund 
sites, .  I'm sure NJ is a nice place to visit, but there are certain 
stereotypes in has to overcome.

Scott in CA
Wearing sunglasses, flip flops, Hawaiian shirt, loading my board into the 
DC, to catch some rays and waves all that is a sanity break from dodging 
traffic and bullets on the freeway while traveling at 15mph backed up for 
50 miles, and to hell with the 9mm, we mounted a 50cal full auto in the bed 
sticking above the roof of the DC after folding in some silicon valley tech 
to make it controllable from the driver's or passenger's seat, works great 
for clearing a path when absolutely needed.  (CA stereotypes & bus content )
