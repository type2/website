Subject: hardware for stock muffler install

hello list.

recently a friend gave me a stock muffler setup. however, it is missing
the gaskets & nuts to mount it.

instead of taking this big item into the hardware store with
me, can someone tell me what size nuts to buy for it?

to elminate confusion, a picture if the item i have is here:

also, where is the easiest place to obtain the gaskets & what
kind of goop (if any) should i use when installing?

TIA,
