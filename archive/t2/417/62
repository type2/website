Hello Jaseon,

I would just leave it in place if you think you are
going to make it opperational one day. As long as it
is blocked off at some point and it does not leak,
keeping the link in place is fine. IF you take it off
and put it in a box some where, there is a better
chance you will loose it and won't have it when you
need it. 

The 73 (I think) heat exchanges have an EGR port on
them. There is no connecting pipe made to connect this
port to the late model bus EGR filter on my F.I.
engine. I want to make a tube by cutting the ends off
an old EGR tube and brazing a length of copper tubing
in the middle. This will allow me to make it almost
any lenght and shape I want. I have to get a torch
first.

Just thought I would share.

Take care!
