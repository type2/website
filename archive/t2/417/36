Subject: Vendors, shipping costs and my money

Hi All,
    I don't usually get involved in these threads, but I'm in some
kind of mood today.  I don't mind paying shipping costs because it's
my choice where to buy parts for my bus.  In fact, I try to spread my
business around to my FLAPS, on-line, and catalog companies because I
need them all.  And let's be realistic, it's the consumer who pays all
of the expenses of a PROFITABLE business.  Sure the owner is
responsible for the expenses, but the cash comes from my pocket in
exchange for the products and/or services they provide and that I
want.  I think some folks get upset at shipping expenses because they
are listed separately.  Don't forget, you are also paying the
electric, heating and air-conditioning, state, local and federal taxes
incurred by the business, waste disposal and on, and on, and on.  Just
imagine how much cheaper the parts would be if you didn't have to pay
for all that stuff.  I guess there are only 2 alternatives.  The first
is to go work at one of the vendors who sell to employees for cost,
the other would be to start your own business and sell to yourself at
cost.
    Please excuse my ramblings and I hope I didn't step on any toes
here.
