Subject: Re: [T2] Belly Pan?

My Westfalia has a "belly pan" that runs from the crossmember that the spare
tire carrier attaches to back to just short of the nose of the transmission.
I presume it's there to protect the gas-fired heater the Westy has, which my
regular Vanagon doesn't.  Don't know if that's the "belly pan" in mind that
started this thread(s).  It's held in place by hex-head screws of the
"sheetmetal" sort.
