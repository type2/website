Ah, Gil.  Methinks that your post sounds a lot like a whine...

My response was to listees' complaining over having to pay BD's shipping
charges.

I'm a sole proprietorship, that means my son and I do everything ourselves.
If I'm on the road, I'm not in the shop casting.  If I'm packing an order,
I'm not making the product for the next guy's order.  Time is money,
regardless of where that time is spent running the business.

I can't think of much to say in response to your rant, except that you
should set up your own mail-order/Internet business and try it for a year or
two.  And live entirely off of your profits, no side work.

I'm not just a retailer, I'm a craftsman, an artificer.  I refuse to set
prices that rip me off for my efforts, and I refuse to rip off my customers
by deliberately and consistently over-charging on either product or
shipping/handling.

Compete with WallyMart?!  You've got to be kidding!  My products are
American-made with American-produced materials.  Not a "China Syndrome" deal
like WallyMart's.

I admire your restaurant friend.  I spent 200 hours +/- of R&D on a fort kit
that I produce and retail; that's $7000.00 in R&D labor alone.  The kit
sells for $128.00, but it would sell for something like 5 times that amount
if I tried to recover my true costs.

I'm a whiner for wanting to cover my shipping costs?  I respectively
disagree.
