As I read replies to this thread, I find myself asking if it's really such a bad thing to require people to NOT park cars in their front yard.  No offense, but I don't think I would want to live on your cul-de-sac.  

Not so many years ago I had roommates and multiple non-running/registered/insured vehicles yet somehow I kept them out of the front yard and never had any problems with neighbors or police.  In California even.  Parking in your front yard is asking for trouble IMO.  Park 'em on the street (if registered), in the garage or in a fenced BACK yard.  If none of those are an option for you, move or get rid of the cars - it's as simple as that.  Nobody wants to look at a yard full of non-op cars.
