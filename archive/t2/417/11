Did you reinforce the area around the holes?
Nice looking seats, btw.  I went with Porsche 924 seats, black vinyl.  I didn't reinforce the two new holes I drilled to mount the seats, because I didn't know as much back then as I do now.  I did at least use large washers to spread out the load a little bit.
