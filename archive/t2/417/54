That was me. :O)

The weekly trip to various shipping centers comes out of the company's
budget; it isn't free.  I can either divide it up between each customer's
shipping costs, or I can increase the retail price on my products.  Either
way, it comes out of the customer's pocket, just like in any other business,
brick and mortar or mail-order.
