Subject: Exhausting work

Hi All,

I successfully drilled out the broken exhaust stud on my 70 Westy, tapped it
to 10mm, and put in a
 step stud. I am now ready to bolt on the new muffler. Does any one have some
installation tips they would like to share? Like using some sort of sealing
goop
or only doing it during the full moon?

Thank You

-Jeff
