Subject: FS: 14" Studded snow tires (Colorado)

Hey all,

I have a set (4) of 14 inch studded snow tires that will fit a late-model 
(baywindow) bus. They've been sitting in the back closet gathering spiders 
since I got them last year. I sold the bus before winter came around, and so 
I'd like to sell them to a good home.

The tires aren't brand new, but have plenty of usable tread and good studs 
on them (I can measure the tread if you'd like, as well as get the exact 
size off the tires ... don't remember off the top of ye ole head, but I 
checked when I bought them to make sure they'd fit.) I DON'T want to ship 
these, so you would need to pick them up in Aspen, Colorado or I can help 
with delivery within a 100-mile radius (could meet halfway, etc). Price is 
negotiable, but I'll ask $100 for the set ... which is less than I paid.

Email if you're interested: whoajesus(-at-)hotmail.com

Thanks!
