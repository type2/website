I truly hope the buyer gets the bus. As has been mentioned, "Mikey" has already received compensation for the bus.

The man in Germany paid $20,000 and did everything by the book. It would be terrible if she got the bus, purely out of sentimental value.

The buyer shouldn't be punished for not knowing the vehicle's full history.
