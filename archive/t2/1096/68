Subject: zits archives

Hi Bob,
           There are comic archives, but not theme based.  You will have to
look through years of strips to find the bus themed ones. Fortunately, Zits is
pretty good every day. If you look around the various newspaper web sites some
have better archives than others.  I like the Houston Chronicle comics page,
but the Seattle PI, is good too.  "Save image as" is your friend.  Amongst the
list members I'll bet we have them all.  They are copyrighted so it is
inappropriate to load them onto the web site without permission.  The artist
may well let us do that via a link to his site tho.  Perhaps you might ask
him. jon
