Well, I can't condone this due to the potential fire hazard, but it wasn't
uncommon for me to drive to work (or to go skiing!) with my Coleman Blackcat
heater duct-taped to the folding table (the one that flips up over the sink
cabinet in a 73 Westy).  Can't say it made it toasty, but when the temps
dropped below 10 in Colorado and I was pushing that 20 MPH headwind at 60+
it made all the difference between freezing and just being a little cold :)

Cheers.
