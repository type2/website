Actually, according to this article that I found this morning, Allstate is
(legally) claiming ownership and is auctioning off the van on the Internet:

The current bid is $12,100.00 USD:

I understand that this is how it works, but I fell a bit sorry for the guy
in Germany who's out $20,000.00.  He thought that he had a clear title.
