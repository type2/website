Subject: horrible squeak from front end

The other day the minor squeek from the front end got considerably 
worse.  Grabbing the front bumper and pushing up and down slowly makes 
it squeak.  If I do this really fast the squeak diminishes.  Listening 
from underneath I cannot isolate the sound.  I though it was coming from 
the upper arm on the drivers side.  In any event I got a grease gun and 
found all 5 of the grease fittings and greased them until greased 
started oozing out of the joints.  The squeak persists, although it 
seems to be a little less.  It's a squeaking rubber noise.  Where to go 
from here?
