my '73 bus, which I owned in '74 still had the factory original muffler on it
which exited on the left side.  A picture diagram of it can be seen on the
bus-boys website under the 72-74 bus exhaust section in the extreme upper
right of the diagram.  I will take it that there are no back-pressure issues. 
thanks to all for the responses.

This muffler is probably from an early type 4 or 914.
On both of these vehicles the exhaust exited on the drivers
side.
