Subject: Floor and body parts removal

Hi gang,

I'm in the process of clearing all of the pedals and levers off of the front
floor of the donor bus. I looked under the bus to see what I had to do next.
How difficult is it to remove the front and cargo bay floors? What do I need
to remove in order to do this? I think I have all of the stuff that may get
in the way removed. I'm attempting to remove the doglegs from both sides
too.

Thanks in advance,
Bob
