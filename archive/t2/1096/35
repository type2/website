Thank you everybody! Just got back from a test drive and everything is good.
No oil leak and the %$#(-at-)^& alternator light has gone out! I think its running
a bit cooler too but I'll have to drive it some more to see. Anyway, the
sparks didn't seem to be from any short that I could find on the DF, D+, D, or
B+ wires. Like some of you mentioned, I think that it was the ALT cover tin
that was shorting to the post underneath it (post for black ground wire). So I
just insulated everything really nice and made sure that post wasn't touching
the tin, put it all back in and started the car with no trouble and the
battery is now getting a good charge from the alternator. Thanks to everyone
here this ship is now ready for sailing. My bus is happy and bound for
Portland. Thanks again everyone. Till next time....
