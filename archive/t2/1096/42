Subject: Wires to the Starter (1971 bus)

Volks,

I'm reconnecting the starter on my '71 bus and I'm trying to figure out
what the last wire is for.

There are three wires which come out of the wiring harness near the starter:
1) red/black, heavy gauge, spade connector, attaches to term. 50 of the starter
2) red/white, heavy gauge, ring 
3) red, heavy gauge, spade connector

AFAICT from Bentley, the red/black comes from the ignition and should be 
attached to the solenoid spade connection (terminal 50).  The red/white should
connect to the same bolt as the positive battery terminal (outer bolt on solenoid).

But what's the last wire connect to?  As mentioned, this is for a '71.

Cheers,
   Avocado Tom
