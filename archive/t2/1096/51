Subject: Re: accelerator pedal

So I anxiously await the parts, they arrive today. They are different.
The accelerator rod is shaped differently and much longer that the
original, and the accelerator pedal lever doesn't come close to fitting.
Now I can't tell if I was sent the wrong parts, or the PO has changed
the pedal so radically that this 'kit' doesn't work with my pedal.


Kevin,

I wonder if you have the RHD version? As I'm in Australia I have a RHD
van and it has a long lever from the pedal to the centreline of the
vehicle.
