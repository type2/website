I like Mark's idea - give the buyer his money back and return the bus to the seller, though at some cost. Remember - she's already been paid out.

Jamie - how would you feel if you lost $20,000 of your hard-earned cash that you saved for years and years to buy your dream car, only to have someone tell you that you're just going to have to eat it, because it was discovered that it was stolen?
