Subject: Re: [T2] Phrydae Phollow Up on MicroBus Stolen 35 year Ago

wow... what a loophole for theives... steal it , store it for 5+ years,,
then get a title and sell it...
gawd,, that is how a LOT of harley davidsons were homebuilt ..

"California DMV checks all registrations against the FBI's National Crime
Information Center for theft, said department spokesman Armando Botello.
But, unlike the insurance database, records of vehicle thefts are purged
from that database after five years, according to the center's Web site. So
someone can apply for a new title after that."
