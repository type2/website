Subject: Brake line leak bad location

69 westie

I have a leaky brake line in the section that goes the length of the
bus (from front to rear). Mine is a European delivery with a complete
belly pans side to side. All I know is that the leak is somewhere
under the welded pan. Todd is bringing me the the brake line tomorrow,
but have no idea how to make this work w/o cutting the pan out. I do
not want to do that. Someone else has to have had this problem! All
ideas welcome!

TIA

Ric
