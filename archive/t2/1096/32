I have seen that happen before.  Check the clearance between the cover 
and the terminals underneath it carefully.  There is not much and if you 
use too many washers or the wrong kind of nut, etc. it can contact the 
cover and ground out.  Inspect, and before installing the alternator use 
a multimeter (on one the ohms settings) to check for shorts between 
ground and the wires in the harness.

The good news is that if this is your problem and you didn't melt any 
wires, you probably did not damage anything and once you resolve the 
issue you will be good to go.
