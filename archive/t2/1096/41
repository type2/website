When I was living at -45C, same as -45F, I used 10W30 in winter,
probably not the brightest idea, but, I did it.

It never failed to start.

They used sand instead of salt.

Anyway, I put in an espar cabin heater (worth more than the bus).
However, the most important thing I did was ensure the heating stuff at
the boxes was working.

Next, I bought some of that fiberglass insulation with foil on it.

After confirming the integrity of the paper tubing, I wrapped it and ty
wrapped it for as far as I could go.

This provided the best I could do.

Naturally, as -20C approached, I changed to thicker oil.

I have some heat without the cabin heater. You have to pay attention to
the details on how the controls work.

The cabin heater eats fuel. But it is nice when you are resting.
