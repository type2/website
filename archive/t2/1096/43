I can't find my bentley nearby, so I don't have a wiring diagram, but 
I'm guessing that coil power is supplied by the same spade connection as 
the ignition.  That's a total guess though, but I thought I remembered 
that the coil is powered off that line, but I could be wrong.

Does the wiring diagram show more than one wire connecting to the same 
terminal?
