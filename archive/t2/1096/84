I agree, the rub that is pointed out, if she wants to buy it, she should
really pay the $20k.  She was paid out, IN FULL, for the bus by Allstate in
'74 or whatever, and for that matter doesn't really seem like she wants it
that much.  If Allstate sold it to her for $4-5k or something, I'd lay good
odds it will be on the bay with a BIN of $20k in a week.  And I don't hold it
against her, I'd probably do the same, her little lottery win.  The German
guy, bought the bus, the guy that restored it felt he was doing so on a clean
titled vehicle (hopefully.)  If he is legit, then he deserves his money, the
German guy deserves the bus, and "Mikey" deserves what she was already paid 25
years ago, if she saved the cash then, she could be given first dibs to buy it
for $20k today for sentimentality but she has no more right to it than
anyone.  And I'm not even really sure Allstate has that much claim to it
anyway, I didn't follow in the beginning weeks
 ago, but isn't there a statute of limitations sort of thing on stolen goods
anyway?  Finder's keepers beyond 15 or 20 years?

Jamie - how would you feel if you lost $20,000 of your hard-earned cash that
you saved for years and years to buy your dream car, only to have someone tell
you that you're just going to have to eat it, because it was discovered that
it was stolen?
