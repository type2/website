Subject: RE: [T2] Zits Comic does it again

 Is there archival comics we can look at. It would be fun to gather them all
to take a look at the progression of the story.

-Hi Mike:

About 4 or 5 years ago, the ZITS kid stole the front seat and tires from his
mom's car and took the bus for a smoke belching spin around town.  
According to the story line, the van had sat for years in the back yard as
it was being saved for the kid by his dad.
