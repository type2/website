Subject: heater tube temps

Hi,

I recently replace the long section of heater pipe with galvanized
hose pipe.  I've then use larger diameter flexible dryer hose to
surround, insulate and protect the heat pipe. It's working great. I
want to take this a step further and blow canned foamed insulation in
the air space between the two.

The product labeling indicates that once dry the foam could combust at
temps above 240 degrees (F). I'm thinking the heat tube probably
doesn't get this hot but wonder what those with more experience think.

Thanks

peace
