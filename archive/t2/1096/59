I found the spot weld and used a wire brush to take the paint around them
off so I could see them better. Are the floors welded to the chassis?

Doglegs - spot welds around the seat pedestal/wheel arch there are at least
30; seemed more like a thousand ;-)  Similar for floor pan to "inner
firewall" or whatever you'd call that area which has the heater  
vents/louvers.   At the heel area to seat pedestal lots more spot  
welds. There are also a few more spot welds which attach the middle part of
the front floor to the frame.  The doglegs also have an  
attachment which goes to the outside - the ~15 cm x 1.5 cm vertical   
piece between the front margin of wheel arch and lower part of the front
"lip" - the "dividing line between front sheet metal and wheel  
arch sheet metal"- it's actually 2 pieces which appear to be only 1.   
Also quite a few spot welds  attach the rear of the arch to the B-post
- have to get you head in the wheel well to see the position.

Lotsaluck!  :-)
