Just one final note from our own experience:	Check the voltage going  
into the
battery again.

We destroyed a brand new battery on our first trip away because the  
PO had
'fiddled' with the alt wiring plug and there was one strand of copper  
shorting
from one wire to another (don't know which ones) so the battery was  
getting
14+ volts constantly and boiled dry.
