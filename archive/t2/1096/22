Subject: Radio install question

I am attempting to install a new radio in my '78 bus.  Browsing the archives I
see that I want to connect the red power wire to the buzzer socket but my
question concerns the yellow wire that needs a constant power source to
maintain memory.  Do I need to run that wire all the way back to the battery
or is there a connection up front w/ constant power that I can piggy back on?

TIA, as always!
