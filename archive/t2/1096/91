Subject: Re: [T2] camper sticker

Jamie says it all.  I'm looking for the best IMAGE that can be used to
duplicate the sticker.  I have a sticker man ready to go.

Note.  The one for Bay Windows are slightly different from the Vanagon
Westy.  An image of both would be great to obtain.

Thanx

Have a Happy & Safe Holiday To All
