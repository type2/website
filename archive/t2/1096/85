Subject: re: MicroBus Stolen 35 year Ago

I wish I had my mom's 67 T-bird, too... the thing is, she was paid off for the
bus, she no longer has it... what if the bus was crushed for a smog credit
instead of found?  

Sorry...  I understand she may want it back, and that's
fine, but she would pay "fair market value" for the bus, as in the payoff she
signed a release saying she gave all rights of ownership to the insurance
company...

Now... don't think I'm a butt.  My opinion is this - If the ins co
wanted to do the really righteous and cool thing, they would offer to sell her
her van back for what they paid it off for, adding **real***  inflation
costs...  but betcha some greedy F#&* who works for the ins co says naw, we'll
sell it to her for some inflated price, after all, we'll get an extra couple
grand for our multi-billion dollar insurance company by making the original
owner pay $45000 rather than $12500 that is what her payoff + inflation costs
are...  

I think she is SOL.  Really.  I have NO faith the ins co will do the
"right" thing...  I know better from many funky experiences dealing with ins
co's.  But the real, honest bottom line is the bus ISN'T hers because she got
paid the then market value for it, and she did with the $$$ what she did.  Van
is theirs (Yes, it is, just as if you put a van in storage for 30 years, it's
still yours, not someone elses), not hers.  Sad, but true.

I
agree, the rub that is pointed out, if she wants to buy it, she should
really
pay the $20k.  She was paid out, IN FULL, for the bus by Allstate in
'74 or
whatever,...

... And I'm not even really sure Allstate has that much claim to
it
anyway, I didn't follow in the beginning weeks
ago, but isn't there a
statute of limitations sort of thing on stolen goods
anyway?  Finder's keepers
beyond 15 or 20 years?

discovered that
it was stolen?
