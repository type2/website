Subject: Re: Alternator and EGR Light on, 77 automatic.

I'm having a similar problem. Just pulled the engine on my 77 (standard) to
fix a nasty oil cooler leak  and got it back in and fired up today. Drove 1/2
mile to gas station then another 1/4 mile after fill up and the EGR and
alternator light came on. Got out, checked the belt that looked maybe a little
wobbly. So I threw on the spare belt and tightened it super tight (no
wobbles). I thought that would fix it but after the 3/4 mile back home and a
few start ups the lights will not go back off. I just want to know if maybe it
takes a few minutes of driving/charging for the light to go back off. I'm
fairly certain that I've wired it all up correctly and the alt is about 2
years old, battery is about 6 months old. Any ideas? Please tell me I can just
go drive it around a couple blocks and that will do the trick ("I've got an
idea...maybe if I drive just a little further...then it will just fix
itself").

Thanks to all on this list, you guys are awesome!!
