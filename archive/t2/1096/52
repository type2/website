Subject: Heater Hose

The hose leading from the heater blower down to the right heat exchanger has been severed.
Is there a formal part name for this hose or part number?  Also, does anyone know of a parts distributor
that may have this hose?  A distributor int he UK would be preferable.

Thanks,
Josh
