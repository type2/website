Subject: Re: [T2] RE: [Bulk] [T2] Floor and body parts removal

Bob,

Take a look at some of the suppliers who have actual pictures of the  
panels in addition to looking at the exploded parts diagrams; it  
should make it easier to visualize what's under the paint.

mamotorworks.com has some pictures and hopefully the following link  
will work

I've not attempted to remove a floor from a 68-71 model but a friend  
talked about all the spot rivets securing the floor in the split  
window version.  I don't see how you could consider installing new  
sheet metal without doing a rather complete removal of the older  
material.  I was able to replace both left and right front floor  
panels but having to keep/patch the middle 1/3 was not only a poor  
option but a lot more work.  I was not able to find (in the States)  
the middle piece but I have been told that it is available from a  
supplier in the UK.  Unless you're good at welding (and I'm not)  
buying panels is much better than trying to patch them.

I'd like to suggest that you DO NOT use an impact hammer to remove the  
spot welds - perhaps I could have been more careful but I got carried  
away with the quickness, not realizing that I was bending or putting  
dents in the remaining material.

Have fun,
PAT
