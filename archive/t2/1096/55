snip> Also, does anyone know of a parts distributor that may have this hose?
A
distributor in the UK would be preferable.

A suitable hose would be available from an aircraft supply house. 
Silicon-rubber fibreglass-reinforced, typically red, with a spiral wire
reinforcing. This hose is widely used for ducting air around aircraft engine
spaces.  You should be able to find something suitable without much trouble. 
There are still a few viable remnants of the, once-great, UK aircraft industry
surviving in dark corners of the islands. Alternately, a few enquiries around
the F1 hotbeds in Oxfordshire will yield a supplier, as it is widely used in
racing cars for similar purposes.

This is what it looks like
