I used some spare hose that came with my Espar Airtronic.  Espar is the 
american division of Eberspdcher.  You can probably source the hose from 
a local distributor or trucking firm.  It seems to be very durable, and 
was designed for the high temps.  I bet you can get some on the cheap. 
It's the larger hose seen at http://pictures.radom.org/d/536-2/IMG_1396.JPG
