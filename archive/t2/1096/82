Subject: Wanted: Rear Bumper (68-71)

Well, after many waits and false starts, my '68 is finally headed to the paint
booth next week.

The problem is we've determined that the back bumper, although repairable, is
going to be more money to fix than it's worth.  So, I'm trying to get a rear
bumper in their hands so they can paint it at the same time they shoot the
bus.  (I probably shouldn't use that term since the SFPD actually did *shoot*
the bus back in the early 70s).

So, if anyone within 100 miles or so of Annapolis, MD, has a bumper in good
shape they'd be willing to sell, please contact me off-list.  Samba searches
turned up nothing east of the Rockies.

TIA.

Greg U
