Subject: late bay westy top wanted in North East

Hi everyone, I am looking to get rid of the hightop on the bus and put on a
westy  pop top,
We are having another girl in the spring so i need the extra sleeping room.
I am willing to trade or make a purchase, I am in massachusetts.
if you are interested in the hightop it is  a Contempo hightop, pretty much
exact to the Safare top but its got roll out windows on it..and of
course, ill have to have another top before i can get rid of the hightop.

here is a linik to a photo, the vent on top is now a lexan skylight that is
urethane'd on and does not leak...Joe
