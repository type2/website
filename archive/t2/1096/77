Subject: Re: [T2] Phrydae Phollow Up on MicroBus Stolen 35 year Ago

yah,, I'd be bummed royally,, but  with Marks idea... the guy who restored
it is out the cash then......
especially if i checked with the 'system' to ensure it wasn't stolen.

and the thieves still know that 5 years is no time to store a valuable
vehicle... california needs to keep records forever on stolen items....

I can't believe this loophole exists in calif...  it is very easy to smoke
someone on a title here in Ontario canada... but as i understood calif.
titles... without the original... it is impossible to retitle it in calif...
with a few legal exceptions..

if this was precious artwork... i think there would be a different opinion
..... and i think investing in V W is like precious metal ..artwork.. so
what is the difference..

like you pointed out........ just glad i am not involved...

someone tell you that you're just going to have to eat it, because it was
discovered that it was stolen?
