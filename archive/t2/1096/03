Volkswagen a LONG time ago produced an adaptor pipe to go in place  of the
throttle positioner (more correctly called the governer on  splitties), part
number 211-129-585 A.  My father and I installed one  on our 67 Deluxe 21 
Wdw
shortly after we bought it new in June 67 and  tossed the governer in the
trash.  Best thing we ever did.   Finding the adaptor is pretty difficult
these days 40+ years after the  fact, I haven't seen one in over a decade


hey jim  I have a couple of these spacers but really don't want to  sell 
them seeing as they are hard to find.  I liked the governor cause if I  ever 
loaned my bus out , which I do it seems at every naturalbus, I don't have  to 
worry about them hurting the engine. It will not run over 62 mph and you  
can't over rev it  later  mark dearing
