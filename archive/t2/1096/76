I reckon the DMV should be liable for their loophole.  The car dealer should have some liability as well.  The bus should go back to the insurance company, who still rightfully owns the vehicle as the original owner had been compensated clear back in 1974.  I feel bad for the guy in Germany, its not his fault that the car dealer was either not forthcoming about the history of the vehicle, or ignorant about it.  The DMV needs to change its policy about purging its records.  If they don't I might just set up shop selling 5 year old cars.  What a joke.
