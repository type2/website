Subject: Re: [T2] Wires to the Starter (1971 bus)

John Baker has the correct answer.  From January 1971, the red wire with a
spade connector also connects to the push-on male terminal of the solenoid
along with the red/black wire from the ignition switch (most 12V solenoids
of the period had two male terminals for this purpose).  The red wire
connected to terminal 50 of the diagnosis socket.  Just leave it
unconnected, as since the diagnostic equipment no longer exists, it is no
longer needed.
