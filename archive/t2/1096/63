I bought similar hose for my '78 heater system.  When the heater is off,
the warm air is blown aft from the flappers to foot-long steel pipes and
finally out behind the rear bumper.

The hose is 2" diameter with spiral wire reinforcement vulcanized inside.
It was found at a marine supply store in California (West Marine).  The
nautical application for this hose is a "wet exhaust".  The exhaust from an
inboard engine is routed from the exhaust manifolds, through the 2" dia.
hose and finally exiting through the transom just below the waterline.

There is plenty of shoreline in UK, and most likely many marine supply
stores who may sell this type of hose.  Best of luck,
