Subject: Re: [T2] Removing throttle positioner unit

Volkswagen a LONG time ago produced an adaptor pipe to go in place of the
throttle positioner (more correctly called the governer on splitties), part
number 211-129-585 A.  My father and I installed one on our 67 Deluxe 21 Wdw
shortly after we bought it new in June 67 and tossed the governer in the
trash.  Best thing we ever did.  Finding the adaptor is pretty difficult
these days 40+ years after the fact, I haven't seen one in over a decade.  I
recommend obtaining a good used single port manifold from a 67-70 Bug or
Ghia, a 68-70 Bus to account for the proper height (these are taller than
the 66-67 Type 2 manifolds,) so that the Accelerator Pump mechanism doesn't
bind against the Generator.  Or just leave it as is with the butterfly wired
open.  And it will look original in appearance.
