And recirculate your heat (worth the plumbing and not hard to do on a T4
bay...)
 
And if you got a big ole westy hole in the roof, plug it with something (I
used to wedge a 6" piece of old couch cushion foam tighlty in the '78 when I
drove it for a couple winters over I68 (then US48) from WV to Western
Maryland.  And have fun passing the idiots in SUVs, a good set of studs, and
off you go.
 
Both make a big difference folks.
