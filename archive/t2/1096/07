Subject: Re: [T2] Brake line leak bad location

I have a 64 DD which has the full belly pan. The brake lines run along one 
of the frame members outside the pan. So, why not run them outside. You can 
clip the line on with some nice stainless hardware.

I have a leaky brake line in the section that goes the length of the
bus (from front to rear). Mine is a European delivery with a complete
belly pans side to side. All I know is that the leak is somewhere
under the welded pan. Todd is bringing me the the brake line tomorrow,
but have no idea how to make this work w/o cutting the pan out. I do
not want to do that. Someone else has to have had this problem! All
ideas welcome!

TIA
