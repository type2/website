As a general note, that stuff is way good shit.  One one of my many 81's that
came without any heater connections, I couldn't at the time locate the bits
for initally and I got some of that stuff (McMaster-Carr sells it, I didn't
realize it was aircraft stuff at the time) and it survives just fine even
attached directly to the exchangers, probably good for 500-600F I'd bet.
 
But FWIW regular ole black defroster hose from any good FLAPs in the US will
"probably" survive attached up to the little steel tubes off of the exchangers
those are going to, and I'd assume something like that is available in the UK,
so the silicone is a bit of overkill probably.  I like overkill though, but
the other is available all through the US at least in several sizes.
