"It sounds like a wire has come loose which is just the sort of thing that can
happen when you have the engine
in and out!"

First of all, thanks for the advice everyone, I love this list.
....So I definitely have not failed to imagine the possibility that I have in
fact goofed the wiring...so I have been religiously scanning all the
connections and referring to the wiring diagram. I am 99% positive that I have
wired it correctly. I seem to have some handicap when it comes to the
electrical part of "wrenching" because I'm pretty intimidated when it comes to
making electrical tests with the voltmeter. I've been reading a lot of the
archives on this list, studying Atwell's charging system tests page, and
looking at at all I can to learn how to properly check this system. But
honestly I am a little nervous.......so I was hoping some of you truly noblest
of the most virtuous of peoples could maybe mention a couple tests I could
make, just to make sure I have continuity between all the components.
Thanks again!
