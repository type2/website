Agreed. That person needs to be investigated.

The DMV is clearly responsible for this snafu. They need to change their  
policy on what databases they use to identify stolen vehicles. The DMV  
should pay the German his $20,000, the dealer for whatever money he has  
into the van, and the insurance company should hold title to the van. Then  
the original owner should have the first option to purchase the van back at  
not more than the original $2,500 plus interest & inflation.
