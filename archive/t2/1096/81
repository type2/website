The DMV  is clearly responsible for this snafu. They need to change their   
policy on what databases they use to identify stolen vehicles. The  DMV  
should pay the German his $20,000, the dealer for whatever money  he has  
into the van, and the insurance company should hold title to  the van. Then 
 
the original owner should have the first option to  purchase the van back 
at  
not more than the original $2,500 plus  interest & inflation.



Sounds good except for who has the german guys $20,000   ???    I think 
they should be the ones giving it back, not the  DMV.    Now maybe the DMV 
should pay for the dealers cost,   rest  of it sounds right  later  mark  d
