Well we are making progress.

From the explanation you gave, I "suspect" that the one
thing that is missing is the connection between the 
charging terminal on the alternator and the battery.

IF your bus is still wired as it was from the factory, the 
charging wire (large wire in loom from alt) goes through the 
front sheet metal to the "battery" connection at the STARTER.
The positive battery cable also connects to that same terminal
and that is how the battery gets charged.

I suspect and have seen MANY times that the "charging" wire
from the alt is NOT connected at the starter.

Let me know. I DO NOT suggest full fielding VW alternators
under ANY conditions (weak diodes) and 30 seconds of full field
will kill just about ANY alternator.

I have also seen (on rare occasions) the egr counter box (on
speedo cable just in front of driver in the water catcher) short
out and cause charging problems......just unplug it if it is still
there.
