"3) With engine running, I tested the voltage at D+(red/blue)  and DF(green)
and got 1.5 volts at both terminals (test failed: according to Ratwell's 
page
I should be getting around 14V at D+ and 5V at DF), indicating "a diode
problem in the alternator")"

Due to the above test that I made earlier today I determined that the 
problem must be in the alternator and decided to take it out for testing. 
When I got it out and took off the three 8mm bolts and metal cover, which is 
on the back and has the grommet and wire loom coming out of it, I noticed 
that the connector for the wires DF, D+ and D that go to the voltage 
regulator was not even plugged into the alternator. Holy Crap!!! It must 
have wiggled out when I was putting the engine back into the car, probably 
when I was pulling the big fat wire through the engine tin to connect it to 
the starter.
So, after whistling away with excitement and getting it all back together, 
then checking everything twice for snugness, I go to put the negative ground 
strap back and..........ZAPP!!! Sparks all over the place! What the??? There 
must be a %&$#in' short in those wires somewhere. So unless anybody thinks I 
should do otherwise, I'll be doing it all over again tomorrow. I think Zeus 
must be pissed at me.....
