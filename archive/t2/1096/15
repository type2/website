That's a new one on me. In all my years of working with Type 4
equipped buses and early Vanagons, I have never seen an exhaust that
exited on the left side. Are you sure it isn't aftermarket or custom
built from a muffler shop? Exhausts also got more complex in the later
years. Early exhausts were simply one-piece muffler units that bolted
straight to the heat exchangers.

 72-73 buses from the later exhaust?
 The earlier ones exited out the driver's side (left) with a somewhat more
 complex tailpipe system than the later ones which exited out the right
 (passenger) side.  I know the displacement increased from 1700 to 2000 cc's
 over the progression of these bus engines.
