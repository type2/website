I'm coming into this a little late, but here goes.

Questions first:
Does the "battery" light come on when the key is turned on?
Does the battery light go off, then come back on?

Now the answers:
The battery light should come on when the key is turned to the 
"run" position (ON) to indicate that the exciter circuit (small blue
wire from regulator to alternator) is grounding at the alternator.

Once the engine starts, and the rpms exceed 1500 the first time, 
the light should go out. (depending on the state of your battery/wiring/
grounds it may at times glow ever so slightly) 

The normal charging rate at about 2000 RPMS should be between 13.8
and 14.5 Volts checked at the BATTERY.  

IF the above is not happening, disconnect the connector at the 
voltage regulator and use a TEST LIGHT (every VW mechanic should have
one)
clipped to the POSITIVE battery terminal and probe the blue wire in the
harness
that goes to the ALT.  The test light should light (engine off, key out,
harness disconnected at regulator)  

IF the test light does not light, you have a bad alternator OR more 
likely since everything was working before, a broken or disconnected 
field (exciter circuit) wire between the regulator and alternator.

I could go on with there test, but it would work better if you can answer

the questions and verify the tests indicated first.
