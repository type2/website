Subject: exhaust ponderings

hey folks, does anyone know if there is a back-pressure difference between the
original type IV exhaust which came on 72-73 buses from the later exhaust? 
The earlier ones exited out the driver's side (left) with a somewhat more
complex tailpipe system than the later ones which exited out the right
(passenger) side.  I know the displacement increased from 1700 to 2000 cc's
over the progression of these bus engines.  The reason I'm asking this is that
I've got a new original muffler and tailpipe (from the earlier type IV
engines) which exits out the left side.  I know this sounds weird, but I like
to look out my driver's rear view mirror to see if there's anything weird
coming out of my exhaust pipe so I like the left hand exit of the exhaust
pipe.  I don't want to install this muffler on my '78 2L FI if it will
unnecessarily restrict the exhaust.  Do any of you think this is something
with which I should be concerned?  many thanks, Greg T. Quincy,
 Fl.
