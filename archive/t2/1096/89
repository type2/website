I'd been meaning to reply to this thread for a while, but I haven't had 
a chance because I've been way too busy.  However, I picked up the beta 
version of the megasquirt3 and it allows for 4 EGTs, so my plan is to 
eventually load up an EGT sensor on each manifold and monitor the temps. 
  The new megasquirt also supports sequential injection (vs batch 
injection like the stock system), so that means I can adjust the amount 
of fuel flow to each cylinder and make sure that all of their EGTs peak 
at the same point.

I won't be able to do anything in the immediate future because I have to 
figure out some method of getting cam timing into the megasquirt (for 
the sequential injection), and the expansion board that allows you to 
hook up thermocouple inputs hasn't been released yet.  But when they do 
release the expansion board, I will wire everything up and see what kind 
of data I can gather - should be interesting.
