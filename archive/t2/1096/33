I do it routinly to get 120 ac from an alternator... and have never had a 
bad experience,, but there is a risk there.. if there is a bad diode or 
connection ,, it will pop it... destructive testing is never a good practice 
,, but in my experience.. nothing has gone wrong while full fielding... ymmv

very good to know... other than that , there really is no circuit for a EGR 
to mess with the charge,, other than the common fuse to the 2 lamps.. 

many items under the dash act up once the water starts making its rounds 
leaking from the window..
