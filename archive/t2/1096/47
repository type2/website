Subject: accelerator pedal

Dang, I sometimes really hate having to mail-order all my parts...

 

The accelerator pedal linkage on my bus was having problems. It turned out
that the L-shaped bracket,(Pivot Lever?) with the pivot pin coming out the
side had an issue. Basically one of the holes in it had wallowed out, so it
was sort of oval shaped, and was giving me a sloppy accelerator pedal.

 

So I looked online for the part, and could only find a kit, but it was only
~$25. It included all the little parts, and a new pedal, although the new
pedal was plastic. I figured, I could just reuse the pedal, and replace all
the little hardware while I was working on it.

 

So I anxiously await the parts, they arrive today. They are different. The
accelerator rod is shaped differently and much longer that the original, and
the accelerator pedal lever doesn't come close to fitting. Now I can't tell
if I was sent the wrong parts, or the PO has changed the pedal so radically
that this 'kit' doesn't work with my pedal.

 

If I lived in somewhere near a VW supply house, I could just walk in with
the bad part, and say-I need a new one of these.

 

So the end of the story.I found the right part at another online vendor. Now
I have a $25 kit, that is useless. Is it worth an hour of my time to re-pack
this and try to return it. I will try.

 

Thanks for listening..
