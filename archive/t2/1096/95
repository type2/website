I don't understand how a Westy top is going to get you any more sleeping 
room.  Two kids can easily sleep in the full-width bed in the top of my 
Safare camper, might even be able to sleep three if they are little. 
With some redesign, you could potentially sleep four kids up there in 
two short, full-width beds.
