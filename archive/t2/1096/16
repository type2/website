Subject: Re: [T2] exhaust ponderings

This muffler is probably from an early type 4 or 914.
On both of these vehicles the exhaust exited on the drivers
side.
To the original poster, I run Vanagon square port heater exchangers
that have the same dual outlet, three bolt flanges as these early
mufflers.  I run a 73/74 muffler with an egr muffler adapted to 
connect from the muffler to the intake and a right side outlet.  
I have been running this setup for over 10 years and have not 
experienced any excessive exhaust heat (muffler still has the 
original paint intact) or power loss problems, nor have I had any 
valve failures.  This is on a late, hydraulic 2.0L in a 75 ASI camper
that is driven as my commuter EVERY day.

I can see no down side to using this muffler.  If an egr system is
available
or can be adapted, use it. EGR leans the mixture AND cools the 
combustion chambers.

We can choose to pick them up or expect that someone else will.
I choose the first.
