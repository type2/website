Subject: That bloody fuel smell

Volks,

I just *know* this has been hashed a hundred times, but I searched the
archives with little luck.
I'm one of those "when I have a tank and make a wide turn, I smell gas"
guys. Can someone point
me to a procedure?

I think we should submit responses to the library, under "fuel" - givers?

Cheers!
