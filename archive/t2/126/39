Christopher,

Err... Umm.... ahh.... err.... I don't know?

I am sorry, but I don't see the picture.  Are you talking in the air
intake towers at the rear corners of the bus?  These tubes... about 1/4"
in diameter?  do they seem to just go up. U-turn and come back down?

If this is them, then they are indeed part of the vapor recovery system,
along with the charcoal canister.  the tubes start in front of the
firewall on top of the  gas tank, come back to thoes loops that are
anti-siphon devices, then to the charcoal canister.  The charcoal canister
has a linked system that blows air thru it and into the intake where it
goes into the cylinders and the gas vapors are burned.

If this is *not* what you are talking about, please post again!
