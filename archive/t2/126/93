Subject: Re Cargo door rubber and pop-top seal in Phoenix--

Yes, Mesa/Tempe sales is one-- But I buy mine at an upholstery place on the
Southwest corner of Cave Creek and Bell Road--they have a great selection of
all kinds of automotive rubber--I found what I needed for my Fridolin there
many years ago--The prices all run Less then 2.00 a foot  and it is 1st
class stuff--I send a lot of Bus people up there and they save a ton of
money--, uj
