i am changing the motor and rear axle plus a few other parts (drivers =
side window mechanism... small things) intoa 77 westy.  my van is =
currently a 77 7 passenger.  the seats are in excellent conditoins, and =
the interior is decent...  the floor pan is rusting pretty bad though.  =
i am wondering a) how much do you think i could get if i salvaged it?  =
b) how much could i get if i sent it to the crusher  c) does anyone want =
a 77 parts van?  brakes work great...

Ben
