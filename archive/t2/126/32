 I think you may just have the piston cocked in the bore, if it was me I
would try to recenter it by 'carefully' applying pedal pressure, I say
carefully because there's nothing to keep the piston from popping out now
that you've pulled the rotor. Like others have suggested, look around and
see how parts look, you might want to replace seals while your there. If
your objective was to just drain the swamp and forget about the gators- then
recenter the piston, get a big ass c-clamp 8" or bigger, find a piece of
scrap to protect the piston, pull the cap to relieve pressure, make sure the
clamp is centered on the piston so you dont cock it again and tighten that
sucker down, you might be surprized at the force needed to retract the
piston. Thats my answer and Im stickin to it, ymmv
