Subject: NW Upstate NY Carabus port?

Hi Volks,

In order to speed our way to Everybus as gently as possible, the "Slowpoke
Carabus" from Southern Ontario is exploring the idea of leaving Ontario on
the evening of Tuesday April 16th.  One of our buses is Adam Narraway's 68
westy, and since this is its maiden voyage under his care we want to go as
easy as possible, leaving time to deal with any roadside incidents that
might crop up.

Leaving Tuesday night would put us across the border and several
traffic-filled hours of transit closer to EveryBus when we awaken Wednesday
AM. This gives us a clear shot all the way down to Virginia on Wednesday,
which in turn could put us on-site at Everybus on Thursday night.

We're hoping to cross the border at Buffalo/Fort Erie around 10PM, and would
like to find a reputable and affordable accomodation not too far off, maybe
between Buffalo and Rochester.

Please P-Mail me if you have any suggestions.

Thanks!


Happy trails,

Greg Potts
