Got a 68-79 Bentley? Section 5, page 3 has a picture and tells about them. The
pic only describes 70/71. Later models are the ''same thing, only different''.
Your 76 should have a cannister on the left half of the gas tank panel. The
thin hose from the right end of it goes up to the tee where the left and right
tubes meet back near the hatch. One thing to watch for is about where each 2
is in the pic: on your bus and later ones, there is a rubber connecting hose
that self-destructs and disappears. Then you fill your tank, and because the 2
lines come off the top of the tank, you end up with gas running out those
tubes.
