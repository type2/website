Subject: Help! Torsion Arm Installation

Hi all,

I'm currently in the middle of installing my torsion arms w/ new ball 
joints, and am having trouble getting the last inch and a half of the upper 
torsion arm flush w/ the torsion bar (on the right side).  The lower one 
went in w/ no problem, and the majority of the upper one went in easily, but 
it just will not flush-up.  I've been using a piece of wood and a sturdy 
hammer to encourage it.... Can I bang on the arm itself?  I don't want to 
damage it.  Any help greatly appreciated, I wanna get my bus on the road by 
the end of the weekend!
