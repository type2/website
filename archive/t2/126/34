Subject: Re: [T2] stuck during break pad replacement job continued

open the bleeder , for this piston , and it wil probally go in easely [the 
way you normaly take out  air , don,t let your brake fluidlevel go to far 
down ,refil  if this doesnot help take a peace of metal about 1 meter long 1 
cm thick and 4cm with , put it between de disk and the piston al the way to 
the inercircle of the disk , then use force! , after this with the metal 
still in place push  the break padel . then push the piston back [ repeat 
this 10 times ] good luck co
