Greg,

Jim is correct, and you ought to buy the gallon, but do not be
disappointed if you wind up with a lot of left-overs.  7.4 is dry-to-full.
If you are not willing to pull the trans out, put it over your shoulder
like a baby and let it barf down the back of your shirt (like a baby :),
then you will not get anything like all the old fluid out.  There is
always some caught in the shifter housing if nowhere else.  If you are not
pulling the trans, pick a hot day and park the bus nose up or raise the
nose to get the most old fluid out.

And... as always....  Pull the fill plug before you drain it! :-)
