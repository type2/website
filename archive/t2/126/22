Subject: Stuck during break pad replacementjob ( BOTTOM BLEEDER BOLT DOESN'T BLEED)

Hello.  I am new to the list and this is my first posting.  I am
replacing the brake pads on my 76 camper and am unable to get the break
pad closest to the outside of the wheel in place.  I think this is
because the bottom bleeder bolt isn't bleeding, so I can't get the "I
don't know what it is called" to compress.  Does anyone have any
suggestions as to what I can do to get this job done Thanks for your
time.


Phillip
