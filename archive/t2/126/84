Subject: Re: [T2] Could I have found THE problem?

You had at least better remove the heads and have a good head shop inspect
them.  Chances are your head studs just backed the nuts off with time, but
you may have developed a "blow by" situation which will in time cut a
channel in the cylinder to head mating surface causing that cylinder to
loose it's compression.

If the only problem you have on the heads turns out to be loose studs, a
simple and inexpensive fly cutting procedure will clean them up.
