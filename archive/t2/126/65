Subject: Re: [T2] Manual trans fluid

One other thing I neglected to mention: API category MT-1 was issued in 1995.
If you read the pdf on GL-4 from Pennzoil, it is dated July, 1995. As big a
company as Pennzoil/Quaker Sludge
is [and now they are owned by Shell] you have to believe that if MT-1 was the
latest and greatest thing to happen to GL-4, then they would have made a
reference to it!! Not one word is said.

And that link to carcare/faq?
http://www.pennzoil.com/carcare/faq/default.htm#top
Scroll down to the bottom. copywrite 2001!!!!
Read thru all of it. Look for MT-1 anywhere....... nope, not there.

I just went back to the Chevron link Jamie sent. Under the section of
applications it says:

"Applications

These lubricants are excellent for all types of automotive and industrial
bearings and gears, particularly those operating under severe temperature and
load conditions. They are suitable for top-off of limited slip differentials.
They provide excellent wear control even in the presence of small amounts of
water.

Their exceptional thermal and oxidation stability, and antiwear performance
permit longer gear life and extended drain intervals.

Chevron Delo Gear Lubricants ESI are the only nonsynthetic gear oils approved
for the 750,000-mile extended warranty program in Dana/Spicer axles (see Eaton
PS-037).

Chevron Delo Gear Lubricant ESI SAE 80W-90 is the only nonsynthetic gear oil
approved for extended service in Meritor (formerly Rockwell) axles for 500,000
mile oil drains."

NOWHERE is transmission mentioned! Only gearsets and axles and limited slip
differentials.
Pick up a bottle of any gear oil that is not marked GL-4. On the front it will
say GL-5 and 'for manual transmissions'.  Read the fine print on the back.
Usually it says something like "this gear oil is suitable for any transmission
that requires GL-5". The key word there is 'requires'. A VW transmission is
not designed to use GL-5.
