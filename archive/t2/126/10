Subject: sold bus, sad, need support

Bus lovers,

I have sold my '72 camper and am a little torn. I am surrounded by many
buses but, non of which, at the moment, do I share the road with. I have
sold her to a wonderful couple. This is there first vw bus experience. They
are planning a road trip at the end of the summer and want to do it in a
bus. Buck (the official new owner) is very excited to learn all he can about
buses and is going to be helping out at the shop this summer, part time. He
seems to have the "bus bug" bad. This is the most rewarding part, I guess it
makes me feel good to share the love this way, by giving up a part of mine.
What will the next bus be? Thanks for the ear.

waiting for resurrection or dismantling,
