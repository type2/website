Subject: Re: [T2] stuck during break pad replacement job continued

I've had it happen on a 4wheel disc brake GM following the 'correct'
procedure. Went out and bought a big ass clamp instead. But, unless I'm in a
hurry, or its a car I've worked on before, I pull the piston and clean and
replace the seal or O ring and bore, but no even when canted in the bore
I've not found any damage. "But" experiance has taught me to stop when
something gets stuck so as not to do damage. On re-reading I think I would
have suggested the same thing as vwbus and crack the bleeder valve, the
little crud can gum things up.
