I didn't know you *could* damage a Detroit Diesel except through stupid
modifications or neglect. We had two 6V71-powered generators in Berlin that
were installed during the 1960s. They were started and run six hours a week,
plus as many hours as needed for power outages, and never needed any repairs
at all. We pulled them out and sent them back to the US in 1992; whoever has
them now probably hasn't had any trouble either. (I saw the 2404 book on
them. Oil changes and cooler service were about as harsh as maintenance
got.)
