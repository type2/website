Phillip,

on almost every brake pad i have ever changed, the C-clamp method
that someone described earlier has worked like a champ.

also, i might be asking the obvious here, but the cap on your fluid
resevior (sp?) is OFF while you are attempting to push back in the
caliper, right?

also, could it be that the caliper has bitten the dust? i don't know but
those are just some ideas...

good luck.
