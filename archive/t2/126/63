Subject: Re: [T2] head temperature sensor

HI Chuck,

How is everything? I got a chance to change my fuel filter today and 
unfortunately I am still experiencing the same problem.
My bus starts, runs, and then dies about 30 seconds after. I can immediately 
restart and the same is repeated.
I have a fresh air filter, fuel filter, head temperature sensor, and plugs. 
I am also pretty sure there are no vacuum leaks.

When I took off the old fuel filter there was some rust and dirt in the 
filter. Nothing too extreme though.  I was hoping that the new filter would 
make a difference. It did not.

I am at a loss here. I seriously thought the problem would be solved. After 
I started the van and let it die I checked my spark plugs. They were bone 
dry. It's obvious that there is no fuel reaching the engine when it dies. 
Any other suggestions?

Thanks,

Matt

Matt,

That is a great looking Bus. My '77's paint is in poor condition. It has a 
sun roof a with new seal I put in two months ago. I have also replaced the 
engine, wheel bearings, CV's, exhaust and most everything else. When I 
bought it in '95 I drove it home on the freeway only to find out that I had 
lost the rear brakes and had a fuel leak spraying out of a hose in the fuel 
distribution manifold.  I knew nothing about this year bus and it looked 
like I had bought trouble. I was really green. It took me two days to get a 
rear wheel off that the PO had put on with an impact gun. I am still working 
off problems on this old bus.

I am a 69 year old EE. When the cold war ended I retired. My wife Bev and I 
have had three boys and 3 girls. All grown now.

As to the filter change to minimize gas spillage,buy a couple of fuel line 
clamps and clamp before and after the filter and yes be ready to replace 
cracked looking hose. I just used a good grade of NAPA FI hose. Its lasted 
for over 6 years. If the filter keeps clogging you may need to clean the 
tank. I would autopsy the old filter to see what kind of junk is in your 
tank.

Good luck and stay off that bike!

Chuck
