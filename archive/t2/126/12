I have a 77 deluxe westy. Tonight I went to a baseball game and left the =
refer running on battery for about 4 hours. The battery monitor shows =
its is fully charged before I left the bus. When I returned I could not =
start the bus. I have the factory two battery set up, so I thought the =
main battery was isolated and would not drain with the "RV" battery.=20

I tried switching from one to two and also to both, same result.=20

Are my batteries weak, or are they somehow connected and not isolated?

You ideas would be appreciated. The camper battery is a deep cycle.

thanks
