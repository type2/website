Subject: Re: [T2] Structural/Frame diagrams for Bay Bus/DC/SC?

There is a guy on eBay who regulalry sells frame Dimension 
chars. I know he had a vanagon chart a little while ago:

http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=1811805868

Who knows maybe he carries Bay charts too, or may know where 
to get one.

Also, I have a first ediion VWOA Vanagon manual (pre-bentley 
but the same format) that has a body section (section 50). 
That gives several key frame dimensions right to the 
milimetre. I think the part number for my book is W 42-020-
123-1 if you could find the Bay equivalent it would certainly 
help.

Thanks,
Chris
