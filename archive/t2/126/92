Subject: Re: [T2] That bloody fuel smell

I know this may sound stupid, but when driving my 76 Bus 2L I would smell
fuel while turning corners (don't remember if I did when going straight), I
thought it was the carb, or a fuel line, but could never pinpoint it.  Then
one day while driving, the #3 spark plug came out of the head, I guess it
slowly worked itself loose, and when I put it back in and tightened it up,
no more fuel smell.
