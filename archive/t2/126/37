Subject: hissing sounds / charcoal canister and HEAT!!!

Ok, on this topic, what are those tubes/pipes/whatever that go up into the
air intakes up on the side of the bus, and seem to connect just above the
motor in the firewall stuff? Mine are connected to nothing at all, and
appear to be missing whatever connects them to each other, or whatever else
they go to....

I looked around and the only disconnected hose I found came off of the top
of the charcoal filter, perhaps this is where those two tubes should be
connected to?

Any suggestions appreciatted.

As for the heat in my bus, wow. I finally figured out what everyone meant by
wiring the heat flaps ALL the way open. All I did in the past was verify the
dash lever for it actually moved the line, which it did, but not even
halfway open it turns out. I wired those all the way open, and wow do I have
some heat now. I never would have believed you could get this much heat from
a bus before... crazy german engineering.
