Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Pump Relay Testing

Find the in-line fuse holder on the left side where a second battery would be.
On the back end will be one black wire going towards the back of the bus, the
other wire goes to the double relay. Is it connected to the + side of the
coil? Or is the wire just sitting curled up behind the taillight? [The other
wire coming out the front end goes to the backup lights]

PS, buy a Bentley bus manual!
