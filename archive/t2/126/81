I have verified the batteries on the deluxe westy are indeed isolated. =
However if the aux battery is fully drained, when you turn the ingnition =
to start the batteries are reconnected and the aux battery pulls power =
from the main.=20

I my case the main battery was too weak to sustain the draw and thus the =
failure to start the engine.=20

The question to the group is what do you recommend as the best =
replacement for the main battery? I have a deep cycle for the aux, but =
would like to put the heavist duty I can in for the main.

Thanks=20
