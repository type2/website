Both Chuck and vwbus make excellent points I had not thought of.

You may have the piston canted in the bore.  If you do, and the caliper is
off, just drop the caliper and old pads back into position on the wheel
and stomp the brakes once or twice.  That will straighten it back out!

If this is true, tho, I would worry about the surface of the bore being
marred by the piston edge digging into it.  This has never  happened to
me, which is why I didn't think about it, but if it did, I would seriously
consider replacing the calipers, as that one is probably going to leak
pretty bad around the piston/bore.

Chuck, has this happened to you?  Was it OK after you straightened the
piston out?

What vwbus says is an excellent check for swelled brake lines.  If you
have real problems getting the piston back in with the bleeder closed, but
it goes in easily with the bleeder open, then the flex line is
clogged/dead.
