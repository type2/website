Hey Karl,

Thanks for the reply.  I originally wrote this for my
subaru forum, hence the dodging of the real isuue. 
Which is the impending head job, lack of power,
obsolete motor, propensity for overheating, dropped
valves, etc.

I have had to repair solder joints in the ECU already
too. and my air sensor is gonna go any day.

I know e-81's; they are bulletproof, easy to work on,
strong, and all around a good motor.  And, I have
plenty as I have been an older subaru freak for
several years.

Oh Yeah, they also use ea-81's in experimental
aircraft, you won't see our beloved type 4 in those.

The Kennedy adpator is about $500, and radiator
routing hoses will put me back another $150.  A custom
radiator (to fit in a fake spare tire looking thing)
would set me back about $500 too.  I am sure there are
several other incidentals, but worth it in my opinion.

Thanks and Kindest Regards,

Mark
