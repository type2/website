Phillip,

As someone else mentioned, a C-clamp is a good way to compress the piston=20
(take the pad out first of course).  You need to make sure it's centered so=
=20
you won't put side-loads on the piston.  Also, you should uncap your brake=
=20
fluid reservoir and make sure it's not full so it won't overflow when the=20
fluid backs up into it.  Sometimes it can take considerable force to=20
compress the piston - with a decent C-clamp you won't have a problem=20
though.  Let the list know if you still have trouble, that's what we're=20
here for.
