Here is the Valvoline site on gear oil. It is dated 2001. Not a word about
MT-1! Read all the different types of GL-4 and the key phrase about each one:
"should be used where an API GL-4 oil is specified by the manufacturer."
http://www.essport-online.com/gear_oils.htm

Here is a BP site from Australia from 1999 that does not know about MT-1
either!

Here is another gear oil website:
http://www.lubrichem.net/ProductsCatalog/Products/ATF.htm
Here is the section on GL-4 [nothing about MT-1!]:

LUBRICHEM GL-4 EP Gear Oils are mild EP gear lubricants designed for a wide
range of automotive and industrial applications. They are specifically
recommended for manual transmissions and differentials in automotive, truck,
and off-highway vehicles not requiring a GL-5 product. API GL-4 gear oils may
be used wherever GL-3, GL-2, or GL-1 gear oils are recommended. Available as
SAE: 90 and 140.

Here is the definition of SAE J-308, gear oil classification system: It is on
page 13 of this pdf:
http://www.munroeequipment.com/lubricantformulation.pdf

API GL-1    Low additive treats, Most industrial applications,
API GL-2    and Special automotive applications


API GL-3    Medium additive treats, Automotive transmissions,
API GL-4    and Moderately loaded axles


API GL-5    High additive treats, High off-set hypoid axles,
API GL-6    and Shock loaded gear boxes
