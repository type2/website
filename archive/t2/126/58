Subject: charcoal canister revisited

Thanks all for the feedback, I think I know what is happening now.
Essentially, my recovered vapors are currently dumping into the engine
compartment
via that smallest hose coming out of the charcoal canister, or something to
that effect.
I am going to borrow back my bently tonight and see if I can't figure out
what connectors
I will need to get this system back in place. You know, ive had this bus
worked on by this
and that person over the past year, some of them VERY good at what they do,
and nobody ever
pointed this out to me, or said something was wrong. Its either something
that just started recently (I dont think so) or not that important of a
system to some people...

either way, if they built it with it in place, they obviousley thought it
was worth the extra money to do so, so ill follow suit.

thanks again,

Christopher
