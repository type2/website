Subject: sell, or store to fix later.

I've got a bunch of minor repairs that need to be done to my 77 
riviera.  It has a 2 l fuel injected engine, and needs the following 
work done.

-new shocks
-is missing on one cylinder (this could mean a lot of things...)
-needs new alternator and voltage regulator
-needs to have the heater cables hooked back up.
-needs steering adjustment.
-needs to have the heater fan hoses hooked up.

I'm back in school to train for a new career in animation, so I won't 
have the time or money to do the work for at least another 6 months.  I 
thought this would be a good time to sell it, but on reflection it 
seems that I should at least collect the parts I need to do some of the 
work later.

If you were going to store your van in an apartment parking lot for six 
months, what would you do to it besides just making sure that it was 
clean inside and the batteries were disconnected?

thx,
