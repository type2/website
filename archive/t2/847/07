Back from Buses by the Beach Bus BRR.  A great time had by all with 14
buses Bays, Vanagons, Eurovans in attendance.

My 12 year old daughter came running out of the house as I was
unloading the bus today with the JC Penney insert from the South Bend
Tribune Sunday paper.  There is a full page ad featuring a Blue and
White VW Camper.  Not sure if it is a Westy or a Riviera type.  I
believe it is a pre-73 as the turn signals are below the headlamps.

Anybody else see that ad?
