You can mount 69-79 wiper arms just by changing the wiper shafts that come
through the cowl. See:

The only other thing you would need are the cap nuts that would hold the
later wiper arms on.  See:

http://www.airheadparts.com/index.asp?PageAction=VIEWPROD&ProdID=4213

Both are made by VWG and sold thru Airhead Parts.
