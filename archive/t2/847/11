<<I guess a photo of a Studebaker would've been in poor taste... >>

The old Studebaker grounds were kinda neat---wrought iron fence with
brick poles every 20--30 ft. with a Big wrought iron S on top of them.


The Tire Rack was using one of the buildings for it's operation 3-4
years ago prior to getting into their new mega building  , and I went
over there and had new hoops put on Eva.

Pretty neat area, and to think not too long ago this was a bustling
automotive plant operation.

A ghost town.
