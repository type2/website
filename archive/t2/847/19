Daniel,

I also have a '71 bus.  The one time that I had a wire short out in the
engine compartment it burnt out the ignition switch before it blew the fuse.
It sounds like you may have the same problems.  If that's the case, you only
need to replace the electrical portion of the switch.  It can be a fairly
cheap and easy thing to do.
