Subject: Lower Bellhousing Case Stud Movement ?

I was just going to put my engine on the engine stand today and I  
noticed there is a tiny bit of movement from one of the two lower  
"bell housing" bolts that bolt up to the tranny (studs from the case,  
Flywheel side). Its just a little jiggle if I try and move it up/down/ 
side. I am going to give it a bit of a tighten (two nuts on the stud)  
to see if thats all it is however I thought I would just ask for a  
few thoughts on the matter as always.

If its unclear just what I am speaking of I will post pics when I get  
back out there.

Thanks.
