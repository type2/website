Subject: uggh.  cv boots.  again!

I had all 4 cv boots replaced at the begining of August.  By mid October 
both boots on the drivers side were torn and I replaced them myself.  
Like a moron I allowed the CV to come apart.  It was fun.  Now the inner 
boot on the passenger side is torn.  Is it common for 3 of 4 boots to 
fail in 2 to 6 months?  Should I replace the other one that was replaced 
in August while I'm at it?  I don't really have the option of not 
driving it to work tomorrow.  Knowing what a job it was last time it may 
have to wait until the weekend.  The tear is on top, so there's little 
change something will fly up in through the tear.  The grease is all 
over the place.  The starter looks real pretty.  So replace them both 
knowing how new they all were or just the torn one?  Can bad things 
happen driving it for a week like that?
