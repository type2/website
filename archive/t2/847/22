Subject: Re: [T2] uggh. cv boots. again!

I bought the german boot kits from my local vw store, that come with boots,
bolts (no washers or plates) and the clamps - however those metal clamps
will rip your boots - they do not allow the boot to move at all once they
are installed. i.e. especially if the boot is initially positioned to far
towards the opposite end of the axle (towards the other cv) thus putting
extra strain on the rubber - and possibly when the axle is traveling to its
extent - lifting high or extra low (bumps or jumps :) the boot will tear.

I have always just used a zip tie - snug - but not killer tight and never
had a broken boot - nor had it leak.

good luck!
