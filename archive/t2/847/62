My buddy's company has a small warehouse on Watts St (Waaay downtown,
NYC) and another company was doing demolition nearby...They've got a
Sprinter but it often sits for weeks between use...Last time they went to
start it, it wouldn't. Since it was still under warranty, it was towed back
to the dealer for service...Long story short: Rats from the demolition
site had taken up residence in the truck and were eating the wiring... ;-(
