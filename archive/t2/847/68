Gee, how'd you ever get their tiny little legs apart?


Bus content:

IMHO, stored cars (machinery in general) deteriorate much more rapidly 
than those in use. You'd be money ahead to take a loan to have the 
vehicle professionally repaired now rather than store it and fix it 
later yourself. You will have the benefit of driving a car you truly 
want to be in as a side benefit. How much is your time worth? Add that 
to the equation.
