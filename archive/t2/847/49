6 months -- a part here and there when you can afford it. Keep it and
collect parts. Do the little things when you have 10 or 15 minutes to spare
(heater cables/hoses, ?steering adjustmen?) so the list is shorter when the
6 months is up.

Storage.

StaBil in the fuel -- and run it for a few minutes after mixing in the
StaBil to get it into the injectors.

If you can scrounge up the money, or a friend with a garage, put the bus
inside. Nothing falls apart faster than a non-running vehicle stored
outside (unless you happen to live in NM or AZ).

Keep a trickle charger on the battery -- hook it up once every 2 - 4 weeks
and fire the bus up. Idle it for a few minutes to get it up to temp. Drive
it around the parking lot if you can. You need to get it warm enough to get
the condensation out of the crankcase.

If it's not in any condition to be driven around the parking lot every few
weeks then you need to get the weight off of the tires or you'll be
replacing those when you get it running again.
