Subject: Lifespan of a full flowed type 1 in a bus

I can think of no reason why a well built type 1 motor would not get 100K with or 
without the filter. They did originally anyway. (stock set-up, no idea on oversize 
motors).
I would guess even a new Mex/Brazil motor would do that out of the box?? (I have one, 
but have yet to use it)
As for bearings, type 1 motors suffer from the case deforming under load as much as 
bearing wear, that's why 1300TP motors are sought after for re-building.
