Subject: Re: [VB] Engine Tin

John,

Tin is not identical. I converted my 70 bus SP to doghouse a few years ago 
when I rebuilt the engine. Bought all the doghouse tin from a Beetle and had 
it powder coated. Found later that front vertical tin is different in order 
to seal the engine compartment to the body. Possibly could have modified the 
original non-doghouse piece but I bought the correct piece from someone on 
the list. Also if you are running an original 70 generator as do I, the tin 
at the end of the generator is specific to accommodate the larger bus 
generator. Also, lots of fun trying to get all the pieces to get the cooling 
flaps to work. The doghouse requires a step in the bracket that operates the 
flaps and special extensions for the flap operating arms.

Virtually all the problems I ran into during the rebuild and conversion were 
solved with the help of people on this list.
