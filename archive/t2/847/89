Subject: [T2] pair of wiper arms 68- 2 different ones?

Although my pictures showed the entire wiper arms, they didn't show the side 
bolts on a good angle...
So, mine have sideways bolts too...
I know they are very hard to find...and if Chris doesn't have any I will 
change them for the 69 model...
Thanks for your kind answers...
I'm glad you treated me so well  as you do with  "native english speakers".
Once more "OBRIGADO!" (thank you!)

Best regards from Lisbon, Portugal
