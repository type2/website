If you read the site, they show the costs of running it. About 1.50 Euros to
recharge the tank for another 2-300 km. That is cheap, compared to gas.

Zero gas??? How does that air get compressed if not by some 
Energy source? Hydroelectric...Natural gas...Newclear (wink, 
Wink)...Ethanol (BTW, corn's no free ride, either...Since a gal- 
Lon of ethanol already has a $.59 per gallon subsidy in addition 
To the petro-based fertilizer, insecticide, and farm machinery 
Used to grow it...)
