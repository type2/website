Subject: Broken links on type2.com Ron Van Ness page

Not sure who to contact regarding the above. Most of the links on page
http://www.type2.com/rvanness/index.htm
are broken.

For instance the oil cooler article points to
http://oilcool.htm/
but it should point to http://www.type2.com/rvanness/oilcool.htm instead

I would be willing to fix this if required
