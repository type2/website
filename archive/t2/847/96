Subject: Re: [T2] Help with heat needed

Part of my heating problem was I had more cold air leaking in than hot air
coming from the heat exchangers. I removed the front fresh air grille,
removed the fresh air flaps. They were covered in surface rust, so while
they were out, they got sanded and given a double coat of rust bullet. I
found some self-stick 1/4" insulation tape and cut it to fit the edges of
the flaps. The old insulation was non-existent. Reinstalled everything.
Wow, what a difference. No more cold air blast and I can actually feel
heat!  I can't really cover up the grille with anything with Alabama
weather. It's 20F one day and 70F the next.

I also wrapped the long paper heater tube with fiberglass insulation and
sealed with duct tape (an Alabama staple). Works ok for me.

Oh, if you plan on replacing the stock fan with a bilge blower, you better
have some sort of flap system in place like the stock setup or your engine
will run HOT HOT HOT!  Don't ask me how I know.
