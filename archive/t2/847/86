I seem to recall reading an article that detailed putting insulation
behind the front grill to prevent any cold fresh air from coming in.
The reasoning being that the fresh-air flapper valves don't always
completely seal enough to prevent cold air from getting in. I don't
know why you would want to insulate the tube that carries cold air
into your bus.
