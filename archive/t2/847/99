Subject: 68 westy sell or parts

Funny how the topic of 68 only wipers came up, just happen to have a set,
'course their still attached to the bus. As per the subject line, I have too
many buses and this has to go soon or its going to get parted out. We're
staring at the possibility of a move and we've got waay too much stuff.

Good stuff, complete bus, fresh engine, good shifting tranny,most of the
westy interior(minus sink/icebox combo)early 68 so it has smooth poptop.
bad stuff, usual rocker and front floor rust. Basically a bus with good
potential with some tlc.Looking for $1100.usd. I've got lots of pictures,
just ask and I'll send you a link. Bill of sale only, have owned it for over
four years and have never gotten around to jumping thru ICBC's hoops

If it doesn't find a home in the next month, then all the 68 only bits will
be available, including the one year only beam that fits the splittie. I
really want it to find a good home, but space,time and money have run out.
thx all
