Subject: Re: [T2] Bluetooth in a bus?

I use a logitech bluetooth ear piece with my Treo 650 and it works  
really well as it sits snugly in your ear hole and has a covering on  
the mic that seems to work well both at canceling out wind noise but  
also keeping my voice clear even when I am winding up the bus. The  
headset I have is the "Logitech Mobile Traveller Bluetooth Headset"  
you can find it all over, Staples etc, for around 50 bucks.

I have own a few bluetooth headsets and I like the Logitech quite a bit.

There are a bunch of aftermarket bluetooth head units (stereos) but  
it seems to still be a "new" market outside of the newer VW and Audi  
offerings, http://www.halfbakery.com/idea/Bluetooth_20Car_20Stereo I  
would like one in my bus though at some point !
