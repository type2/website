****Aren't there 2 different wipers used in 68?  Correct me if I'm wrong.
  *The "earlier" being similar to Splitties and just "clipping" over the shaft and...
  *The "later" having the sideways bolts/nuts.  
   
  I have the "later" 68 only arms- the bolted kind.  
  But, a local 68 DC (you know who you are :-) and the pictures that Joao just sent me confirm the "earlier" kind without the sideways bolts.
   
  Or, did someone just put splittie wipers on these 68's (without the sideways bolts)?
