Hmmm,

That's an interesting thought on the soap bars inside.

I wonder if there would be anything that smelled severely obnoxious that 
you could put inside, but that would disappear in a few days after 
getting back and opening the bus up.

Maybe something that smelled as bad as a decaying body.

Most people(vandals included) might make a wide berth of your van after 
sticking their head inside for a few seconds.  Too bad "eau d'skunk" isn't 
available ....most people give skunks and skunk smells a wide berth!

Just a thought, dave
