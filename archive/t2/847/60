Thanks for all the suggestions. My neighbor gave me another one to pass
along similar to the Irish Spring Soap.  She said to leave a box of
moth balls in the center of the bus with a few holes punched in it. 
She said that this will also prevent vermin from taking up residence.

I'll be keeping a six pack of "good" beer in there with the reciept.  I
figure if I'm going to be thanking them for not vandalizing my bus, I'd
better pay them off with the good stuff. :)
