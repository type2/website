Subject: Re: pair of wiper arms 68

Somewhere on the internet there is, or used to be, a site that tells about recalls for various cars. I think that's where I read that those side bolt wipers were a VW recall back in '68 or '69. The great advantage of this later style is that it will grab virtually any wiper post no matter how much its been destroyed by its original arm and not let go. Visualize grabbing on to one of your digits after hitting it unexpectedly when your wrench slips.
