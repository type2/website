There are a lot of funny statistics on that website. A agree that the 
car seems to violate a couple of the laws of thermodynamics. If you 
are taking ambient air pressure, pressurizing it, then depressurizing 
it to run the vehicle, you can't end up with a net heat loss. The air 
out of the drive "motor" may be cold, but the compressor system will 
require some cooling.

Another couple of statistics I found on the site that seem specious:

Any compressor that can compress enough air in 3-4 minutes into a 
state to run the vehicle for 200 kilometers would be pretty 
impressive! I can barely get my air compressor to make 110 psi in 3-4 
minutes and that compressor head weighs 65 lbs. A small SCUBA 
compressor runs on a 20 HP gas engine and can take 8-10 minutes to 
fill an 80 ft^3 tank to 2800 psi. That is almost 200 bar, the 
"working pressure" of the tanks they talk about. And we have to 
immerse those tanks in water when filling them or they get to 150 
degrees during compression.

Well, I guess the proof will be in the pudding. If it is as good as 
they make it sound, Ford will buy their patent and bury it in that 
big warehouse they show at the end of Indiana Jones.
