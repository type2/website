Subject: Re: [T2] suggestions to fix a teeny little exhaust leak

Most sealants use sodium silicate as the base material- you can get a 4 
pound tub of it at Home Depot as "Furnace cement" for around $4.   I've 
used it on leaking muffler/upipe/heat exchanger connections in 
conjunction with fiberglass braid that I also embed with the cement and 
then wrap around the leak and tie together.  Wear mylar gloves as it is 
messy, but the excess will wash off with water.  Let it totally dry 
before driving and heating it up.  I've done this on a cross country 
trip and it will last 5,000 mi- eventually it can crack and let the leak 
come back.
