Since I dislike mothballs, I use fabric softener sheets stuffed all 
along the sides of the top bed to discourage the critters from chewing 
the poptop as they have done in the past.   Any accessible cavity is a 
favourite nesting site that will rust out as mouse pee collects there; 
remember the holes in your support beams (the one behind the engine is a 
big offender) and bottom cavities of your doors and the heating 
ductwork- make sure all the tubes are sound and closed (not accessible) 
from the engine bay.  Any rusthrough 1/2" wide they can get into- found 
them nesting in the fiberglass above the board liner of a camper or next 
to the light buckets in the cavity of your kick panels.
