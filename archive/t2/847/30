Subject: Clutch problem

Hello guys

After installed a new clutch set (throw-out bearing, disc and pressure 
palte) , I found if I pushed the clutch pedal all the way down I was unable 
to engage any gear but if I pushed half way the gears engage easily so I 
gave a less tension to the calbe and did a test drive with out problems I 
let the car parked all nigth long with a reverse engage, this morning it was 
almost imposible to disengage the gear with the engine runing or not, after 
a while I manage my self to free the shifter and ride the car againg but 
this time was terrible the way the gears engage if they finally does.
I took the flywheel to be resurfaced and have no free play in the pedal.
Any help will be higly apreciate like always.
Thanks in advance


Roberto
