Subject: Oil pump size

Wilson writes that 1971 engines got an oil pump with 26mm gears while
1970 got 24mm.

In my original 1971 case (number starts with AE) I discovered an oil
pump with 21mm gears. The pump looks pretty worn with backlash of
0.010' or more, so I wonder if it may be original. If not original
someone replaced the 26mm by a 21mm at some point, for some reason....

Anyone knows if there were 1971 engines that came out of the factory
with 21mm gears ? Karl ?
cheers
