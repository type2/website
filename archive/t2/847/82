No. Only '68 wiper arms will fit in a 1968 Bus.
 
 
 ****Aren't there 2 different wipers used in 68? 
 Correct me if I'm wrong.
 *The "earlier" being similar to Splitties and just
 "clipping" over the shaft and...
 *The "later" having the sideways bolts/nuts.  
    
  I have the "later" 68 only arms- the bolted kind. 
 
  But, a local 68 DC (you know who you are :-) and
 the pictures that Joao just sent me confirm the
 "earlier" kind without the sideways bolts.
    
 Or, did someone just put splittie wipers on these
 68's (without the sideways bolts)?

The split arms with the sideways bolts are the NHTSA
recall replacement arms for split buses. 

Split bus arms are straight ended.

68 only arms fasten like the earlier split bus arms:
You have to lift the blade/arm away from the glass and
tighten/loosen the screw.

69 up arms are held on with a cap nut.

All bay window arms have a 45 degree bend at the end
and the end is looped into a U.
