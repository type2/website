Subject: RE: [T2] uggh. cv boots. again!

<SNIP>
I had all 4 cv boots replaced at the begining of
August. By mid October both boots on the drivers side
were torn and I replaced them myself. Like a moron I
allowed the CV to come apart. It was fun. Now the
inner boot on the passenger side is torn. Is it common
for 3 of 4 boots to fail in 2 to 6 months? Should I
replace the other one that was replaced in August
while I'm at it? I don't really 

Yeah, replace the last one...obviously there was a
quality or installation problem all around.

BTW, when you bolt the CV's back on make sure you have
the 3 spacer plates on each CV (12 total), buy ALL NEW
lock washers (24 total, the VW dealer should still
have them cheap), and torque the bolts correctly.
Until I figured out these three things I had a CV fall
off about once a quarter...
