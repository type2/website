Very fun little car to bomb around in. Would LOVE to have one... Friend
had one when we lived in Italy. We carried all sorts of stuff in it. I
have one now but it's only 6 inches long... 

Designed to carry farmer's eggs across a newly plowed field. I believe
it too. No car rides as smooth except very expensive cars like a
Rolls... Now collision safety is another topic... <grin!>
