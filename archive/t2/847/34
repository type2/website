Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch problem

It sounds like you have the wrong pressure plate installed - at least those
were the symptoms i had when i had swapped a '81 vanagon engine into my '73
bay window - however I could shift into all the gears when the engine wasn't
running - but as soon as the engine was running it would shift at all!

I would look at the fingers in the middle of the pressure plate - make sure
they are exactly the same.

BTW the year of your bus and what size/kind of engine you have would be very
helpful to diagnose a problem as this.

good luck!
