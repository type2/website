From Courtney:

If you read the site, they show the costs of running it. About 1.50 Euros to
recharge the tank for another 2-300 km. That is cheap, compared to gas.

My friend Harry Houck plays with EV's [Electric Vehicles] and once had an electrified Thing.  He next wants a
single cab.....
I had forwarded the Air Car site to him and he replied back:

"The EV brains commented on this. There's no physical way to hold enough compressed air for any range. Huge
problems with freezing when the air expands and heat when you compress it. Electric is the way to go, motors
and batteries will only improve in efficiency, weight, cost."
