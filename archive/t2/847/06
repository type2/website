Subject: wiper switch for Bay

I'm looking for the right part number for the windshield wiper/washer switch for a '74-up Bay that Richard Atwell speaks of in his "Essential Upgrades" page.
   
  The one that can double as a switch for an electric washer pump.
   
  Has anyone made this upgrade and can you help me out here? Thanks!
