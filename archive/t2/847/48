I doubt the theory of  'double life' but having a modern spin on filter as 
compared to the OG screen has to be a plus.  I don't know of any new auto 
that just has a screen on the pick-up side of the oil pump.  It also 
provides a venue for an external oil cooler if the type of VW you are 
driving or the type of driving you do warrants it.

It is vitally important to use quality components when doing the 
installation, use high pressure steel braided hoses with the correct 
fittings, not rubber hoses and hose clamps.  I also use a Berg pressure 
release oil pump cover, the max. pressure is 55 lbs. even when the temps are 
down into the 30s.  As far as losing prime at oil changes the pump doesn't 
go dry same as when you drain the oil without a FF system and draining the 
oil out of the oil hoses at oil changes just disconnect the coil wire and 
spin the motor over 'til you have pressure.

I drive a '61 Westy towing a '71 Sears trailer(heavy) loaded with camping 
gear and have over 20k miles.  2017 motor and FF tranny and ALL my miles are 
highway miles at 65-70 MPH, I only use my Westy for long camping trips no 
around town driving.
