February 19, 2006 - Copperstate VW Show and Swap Meet 
UTI Arizona, Arizona 
The Copperstate VW Show and Swap Meet is Back! 

After losing our former location and being unable to have a show in 2005,
The Wolfsburg Registry VW Club of Phoenix Arizona is proud to present a
bigger and better show for 2006. UTI Arizona has generously offered their
huge facility lot as our new location for this year. Please join us for a
great day of VW related fun on Sunday February 19th. Details and directions
can be viewed on our web site at www.wolfsburgregistryphx.com.
