All sizes of pumps will fit and work as long as they are for the right kind
of cam gear - dished or flat. I've never looked too closely at the diameter
of the pump gears, they are all the same iirc. As the pump gears get taller,
the pump sticks out of the crankcase farther, so any pump from 21mm to 30mm
could be used. The 21mm pump has a really thin flange where it overlaps the
case, and when the pump gets to 30mm this flange is about 3x as thick.
Thicker pumps (than 30mm) are possible, but not needed for a mild engine and
some will say not needed for any engine. A 26mm Schadek pump is a good
choice for almost any engine. If the book says 26mm for your engine, use
26mm. If you are full flowing it would not hurt to use a 30mm pump.
