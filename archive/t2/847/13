Hehehe.. sorry, just had to laugh at that one.  The cv joint spins so

You know, mine were cracked for a while.  It should be ok for another 
couple weeks as long as they don't get completely drenched or filled 
with tons of dirt.  I know I've run with broken boots for at least 1000 
miles before I was able to change it out.  I would change it as soon as 
possible, though.
