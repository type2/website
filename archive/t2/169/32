Yah, that was my thought, sort of.  I would leave the con rods off as well
to prevent floppiness.  I don't even think you need a cam.  Just the case,
the crank, and dist drive gear.  A degree wheel pulley on the rear, a
motor with similar pulley and a belt to drive it.  the case and crank
could be absolute junkers, as there would only be minimal lube (probably
put some assembly lube/grease on the mains for the demo), but minimal
speed as well (200RPM would be plenty)  If the case were truly dead, we
could use it for the bonfire later:-)

We shall see how ambitious I get :-)
