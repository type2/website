Hi Kevin.

I want to do the same to my 70 Westy. I have cut the rear out of a later bus
 that was heading to the Junk Yard. I took a welding class this spring and
have
 a small MIG, worth every penny . I think but welding it will be a little
tough so I plan on lap 
welding it. The only problem will be the support bars. The piece with the
hatch has two, 
one forward of the hatch and one behind. There is only one bar in the bus,
right in the 
middle of where the hatch goes. I think I will detach the bars from the
donor piece by
drilling the spot welds and fabricating it into position on my bus before
cutting the hole.
Anybody else done this?
