Check. toward the rear, hell of a time, right on top of stop smashing 
rubber.

Check, all point down.

You're right, I hate that theory, but it does make some sense and is 
something I didn't think of or consider. After I lowered the bus and stared 
at its front end perplexedly, I figured that it had to be something with the 
torsion bars, if only they had been labeled when they were removed from the 
original bus. Of the two bars only one had the original weld(broken of 
course). I installed that weld end to the drivers side, upper tube. The 
other bar strangely had no weld nor any sign of ever having one. My old bars 
had welds to drivers side BTW.

So with your theory I would need flip the bars around and put the weld to 
the passenger side? If they are upside down then the 3 set screw holes per 
bar would not be there. Maybe I'm not understanding you correctly. When I 
installed the arms and the center set screw I took an awl and felt/looked w/ 
mirror for the hole before I put in the set screw. The bus does steer and 
roll, however, and that is all it will need to do at the body shop where it 
will be for the next three months until I get a chance to work on the front 
end.

Any other theories out there? (Pertaining to my front end)

Thanks,
Brandt
