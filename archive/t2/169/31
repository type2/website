Just A thought... what about a motor and trans out of the bus on a table ,
that way everyone could see what was happening right there. Thats just my 2
cents.

I would love to do this on a bench where everyone could watch.  I know
that there is such a thing as a distributor test stand, but I have never
seen one, much less owned one.  If anyone has more knowledge of what one
looks like, or better yet has one, could you pleaase let me know?
