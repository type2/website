Ah. A problem near and dear to my luddite heart...
You can put tubes inside "tubeless" or radial tires
but they should be marked "radial" tubes...Here's
the reason: Bias ply tires usually have a smooth
interior, but some modern/radial tires have ribs
molded into the inside of the tire. A regular tube
doesn't have the thickness to withstand the pos-
sible abrasion. Another reason not to put tubes
in tires that don't "require" them: Cheap tubes
just poke the filler valve thru the hole in the rim.
Better tubes have a threaded extension valve with
a locking nut and gasket to keep it in place and to
prevent leaks from rubbing at the hole in the rim.
Essentially, tubes are a PITA and if you don't need
'em don't use 'em.
