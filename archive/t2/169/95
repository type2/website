Maybe and maybe.  Some years had a gasket originally, some did not and in
replacements some have and some do not.  I would say that if you find
gaskets when you pull the heads off, then do replace them, but there are
those who will disagree with me on this.  My reasoning is that unless you
are performing a total rebuild or at least going to pull the cylinders off
the pistons for new base shims, if you just delete the gaskets, you will
raise your compression ratio (CR) a bit.  If you want to do all the
measurements and calculations to see where it is and will be, more power
to you, that's the correct way... me, I am lazy... if it had gaskets, then
I replace the gaskets and the CR stays the same :-)  Of course, since you
will be replacing the heads, this isn't strictly true, but...

Definitely!  In the gasket set will be two thin metal gaskets and two
thick bakelite gaskets.  The thick gaskets are for FI, don't use them, use
the thin ones which are for carbs.
