Subject: Lining up the ducks :-)

Volks,

I am planning to run a clinic on distributors, dwell, timing, and vacuum
at High Country and I am trying to think of how best to do this.  I could,
as I did at EB, just wander around with my instruments in hand, but when I
am working on a bus, pretty much all you can see is the seat of my jeans.
Amusing, perhaps, bot what you would call useful :-)

I would love to do this on a bench where everyone could watch.  I know
that there is such a thing as a distributor test stand, but I have never
seen one, much less owned one.  If anyone has more knowledge of what one
looks like, or better yet has one, could you pleaase let me know?
Especially if you are coming to HCBF and can bring it????  As a secondary
thought, if someone who is coming has a case, crank, and dist drive gear,
that would also work.  I could at least set it up on a table and
demonstrate what happens in the dist as the engine spins.

I am trying to think of a way to demonstrate advance on a stand and
frankly cannot.  The vacuum advance is easy enough... do a static time,
pull a vacuum and see how it changes, but with the mechanical, you
actually have to be spinning the shaft.

Any ideas would be very welcome!!!
