Subject: Re: [T2] monitoring 2 batt with one voltmeter

Just in case anyone else is wondering...  (the poles vs. throws on
switches are a dyslexic's choice slice of hell), see this handy page to
explain the different kinds of switches...

I think what George is calling for is switch form C to connect the
voltmeter to one or the other battery.
