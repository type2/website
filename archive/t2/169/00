Subject: 68 crew and 78 Westy for sale near Dallas, Tx.

Volks,

On the way to work today I noticed a 68 crewcab at an estate sale.  They 
are asking $6,000 for it.  It looks very, very nice - the owner is the 
service manager of a local VW dealer.  Paint looked to be relatively new 
and looks to be the stock pearl white color.  Interior near perfect.  No 
visible rust on rocker panels.  The bed floor was a bit wavy and there was 
some rust on the inside of the gates that had not quite been fully 
repaired.  The guy I talked to was not the owner but seemed to know a bit 
about the history of the bus.  He said the bus was pretty rough when the 
owner got it, so he has apparently done a LOT of work.

In back was a '78 Westy that turned out to be for sale also.  Price was 
listed at $4500 but marked down to $3500 "today only".  It was tan colored 
with brown stripes and was an automatic.  Westy interior was in very good 
shape although there was some warping of the wood panels inside.  The top 
was not popped but he said the canvas could stand to be replaced.  No rust 
anywhere that I could see except for the very beginnings of some light 
surface rust around the side window seals.  Front windshield seal was old, 
but no apparent rust in the channel.  My guess is that this bus was stored 
under a roof until very recently.  Brand new tires but they were 
195/75-14LT with a 1485lb load rating - not ideal.

I didn't ask, but my guess is that these prices are somewhat negotiable at 
this point as the estate sale has been going on nearly a week.  Any 
interested listmembers may contact me directly and I'll find out more for 
you and/or take pictures, but please only ask me to go over there if you're 
SERIOUS about buying - thanks.

The owner's name is Will Prince and his work number is 972-231-4691.

-David
