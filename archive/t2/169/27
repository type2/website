Q : Does "Lobro" indicate brand name, or is it like "xerox" ( or "VW " :)
indicating any cheap copy of a brand name part ?
Turning the race one ball in rotation does make a difference.
There is considerably less articulation in one position, wherein
the races lose half the flex in the in/out direction. ( Axial ?:)
The correct orientation will display a small segment of the inner race
opposite a large segment of the outer race. A correctly assembled
CV joint will display twice as much articulation.
You may have to wait a very long time to use those new CV joints,
if you turned the used ones to apply torque forces in the opposite direction,
as this provides unused surfaces of the races to wear.
They may be more properly stored back on the supplier's shelf.
