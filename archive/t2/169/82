Well, to answer my own question.  I was sure that there was somebody that had
been in this situation before...but no answers.  So, grabed the bus by the horns
and charged ahead.
 
The hold down stud is indeed in a blind hole.  The stud itself is an M8-1.25
stud, about 1 inch long, the hole is a bit deeper than that.  Had to hacksaw a
slot in the head, and turn it out...only it wouldn't turn with my screwdriver (a
dremel with cutting disk would have given a wider slot and allow for a bigger
screwdriver) so ended up using pliers to turn it out.  Went and got a stepped
stud, M8-1.25 X M10-1.50, wanting to keep the same nut.  Drilled the hole first
with a 5/16" bit, then a 21/64" bit, then tapped with the M10-1.50 tap.  Cleaned
it all up, double nutted the end, and threaded it in.  Thought about locktite on
the threads, but it ended up so secure that I went without it.  Took the nuts
off and installed the dizzy (thanks again to Karl) and secured the hold-down
clamp.  All nice and tight.
 
Next stage is to replace the shift rod bushings, finish the battery tray
replacement, then install the engine and tranny as a unit and start the engine
up and set the timing.

With this in the archives, it should answer somebodys question in the future,
unless I am the only "lucky" one to have this happen to them.
