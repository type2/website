My other car has a sunroof. :-)  Mercedes-Benz recommends a special
'slide paste' to lubricate the friction parts in the sunroof
mechanism.  It is supposed to not attract dirt like grease does.
If this stuff is applicable to the VW transporter sunroof lubrication
needs, hesitate to get it from your local MB dealership parts counter.
They only sell it in a large costly container, and you'll use only
a fraction of it in a lifetime.  Try this source for a small film
container size portion $3.50... Performance Analysis Co. (865)482-9175.

As Dave put it, Sunroofs Rock!!!
