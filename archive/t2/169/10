Subject: Re: [T2] monitoring 2 batt with one voltmeter

Chris,
I did this with my 2 battery setup.
#1 Use a digital voltmeter, they are much more accurate than VDO's and will 
give you the voltage within a 10th of a volt. I found mine at a hot tub shop 
for around $40...good quality made in the USA. I mounted mine on the ashtray 
front...fits perfectly with a large readout.
#2  I used 2 heavy duty all metal toggle switches installed on the lower 
right front dash next ot the steering wheel shaft. One was tied into the main 
aux battery line (It has its own fuse box behind the glovebox) and the other 
was connected to I think #11 on the Bus fuse box. I used common ground for 
both.
     This setup allows you to see the charging voltage from the voltage 
regulator when your running, to either battery or if your not running what 
the voltage is on either batt. If both happen to go on at the same time while 
you are running  its really not a problem as the main battery is being 
charged with a 6 or 8 gauge wire 2 feet away while the  secondary battery 
will receive little more than a trickle charge on a long running 12 gauge to 
the front of the bus and back.. This actually is a good way of recharging 
your auxillary.  I have left them both on while stationary with no problems. 
I have a regular 55amp Alternator.
I have had this setup for about six monthes with no problems.
Hope this helps,
Jeff Raven
