Subject: Access Panel

I'm looking to add an access panel to my '72 bus.  It's such a pain in the 
butt to work on things with only the rear panel for access.  Does anyone 
here on the list have experience with making a homebrew access panel?  I'd 
like some tips, since I'm definitely going to want to keep the 
noise/heat/fumes from the engine compartment to a minimum inside the bus.

Also, I hate the curtain rod system and am thinking about making a velcro 
design instead.  Does anyone here have tips on this or something similar?

Thanks!
