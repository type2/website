Subject: vacuum advance;one more time

According to Jim Thompson's wonderful spec list, the stock 
distributor for my '71 T2 generates a vacuum advance of 2 - 5 degrees.

I happen to own four DVA distributors. I've had the advance and 
retard measured for each. None of the four has a vacuum advance less 
than 8 degrees and most are in the 9 - 14 degree range.

My questions:
1. Why is the correct vacuum advance for a '71 T2 so low?

2. Since I don't own a distributor whose advance comes anywhere close 
to these low values, what will be the down side of using one of those 
I own with a much higher advance.

Thanks, Jack
