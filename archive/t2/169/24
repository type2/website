Well, I've had a good look at the 'tight' new CV's. They are definitely =
not locked, they do move, I just need to put a screwdriver handle =
through the spline to turn them. There doesn't seem to be any build up =
of dry lubricant/packing grease so I don't think that has any affect. I =
took Dave's advice and turned them 'one ball' each way, this made no =
difference so I put them back to how they came (tough job!). My local =
supplier assured me this would not impact on the life of the CV's I was =
just surprised at the inconsistency of the 4 CV's. I was more concerned =
about the ones that move freely, they move easier that the old warn ones =
I put back in!
