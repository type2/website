Hi Volks

I have been out of the list since november because I have been working =
on the bus and there is no time to be in touch. I found that mine is  =
1977 Westfalia camper but the configuration is very unusual, baywindow, =
1600 cc, engine code AS (maybe the papers are wrong), disk brakes =
without servo, no fridge, stove or A/C, but the most strange thing is =
that the electrical system looks like the 1971 acording to the =
Bentley=B4s VW service manual type 2, perhaps is because the bus was =
exported to Venezuela, South America (all the info from the M codes are =
allready check), any clue about wath year it could really match?
My concern comes because just before I got the bus the engine was =
rebuild and a new crankcase was installed and there is no engine code so =
how could I choose how many degrees after or before to set the ignition =
timing?
I have another tricky question, this time is for the distributor=B4s =
gurus, my bosch 015 start to fail very often so I decided to take it =
appart to see what the problem was, and I found that the upper part of =
the shaft, the one that is attached to the weigths of the centrifugal =
advance comes out off place. My research guides me to figure that there =
must be a circlip or some kind of retainer over the lower part of the =
shaft to hold the upper in place, I tryed to find a criclip that would =
fit but I could not, so I made a retainer from scratch using a washer. =
The bus has been running nice for a week now, any suggestions about it?
One last thing, when I started to experience problems so I took out the =
distributor from my 1965 6V bug and it works fine on the bus, the only =
thing  was that the sound system fails (some kind of loose of power) =
when the rpm are high, after I switch the distributors the problem is =
gone, somebody could know what is happening?

Thanks in advance for your support

From the sunny lands of Caracas Venezuela

Roberto
