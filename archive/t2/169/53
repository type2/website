OK I'm not a big fan of testing fuel systems by letting fuel run all
over the place. I assume that your 80 v'gon is FI. If that's the case
not only is your fuel pump supposed to move liquid but it is also
supposed to pressurize your fuel loop. The only way to check this is
with a pressure gauge you connect to that little hose bibb on one of
the metal lines near the injectors. Only then can you properly
diagnose your fuel pump (unless you have an intermittent problem like
mine). 

Since it ran smooth (I assume smoother than the run & die before) I
would suspect that perhaps something is in the way in the tank. there
might be a blockage of some sort causing this. Just a suggestion, but
worth checking out.
