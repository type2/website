I agree the pump is trying to pump a constant volume of fluid. But
there is a world of difference between pumping liquid into a pail
(this is called zero pressure) and pumping liquid into a pressurized
container (in our case the fuel loop). You cannot just say "well the
pump pumps this much fluid with no load on it therefore it must pump
out the same amound at 50psi".

no, the FI system has to have enough pressure in the loop to perform
properly. A lack of the proper pressure will cause bad running engine.

Sorry bad analogy on my part & you snipped out my point on this which
basically was the safety issue. Testing pumps to see what they do is
much safer if the fluid you are pumping isn't volatile. That was all I
was refering to, not that pumps will magically work different w/
different liquids through them. and yes you are correct the physics
involved here are uniform.

I just advise against it. that's all I'm saying.

No, no contridition here. You should be replacing fuel lines in the bus
to hopefully prevent engine fires, not to track down a fuel delivery
problem. This guy still doesn't know that his pump can deliver the
required volume at operating pressure. So we haven't eliminated the
pump yet. What he can do w/ the gage is to hook it up, run the engine
untill it quits & make notes of what the loop pressure does. If it
keeps going down then it quits, chances are he is starving the pump
either from a restriction in the line or bad filter (which he did
replace). The lines I was refering to "can't replace" are the two
metal lines coming out of the fuel tank, while they are small other
than trying to clean them, if there is a restriction at that point
then he can't simply remove them & replace them w/ a new set.

We aren't testing the fuel lines. Well not directly. I am suggesting
testing the entire circuit as a whole, depending on the results he
gets from testing he should be able much more acurately to diagnose
the real problem. Replacing the lines can be part of the repair, but
shouldn't be part of the repair process.
