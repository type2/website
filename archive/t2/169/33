Subject: new AFM & temp sensor

Well the yesterday I finally got my rebuilt AFM from Ron. I put it on
and immediately noticed it ran like crap. Check the vacuum,timing &
fuel, which all came up normal & in spec. I checked the AFM per
Bentley & everything was fine. Then i checked the temp 2 sensor. Was
only about 1100 ohms cold. So this is outta spec. Strange that my old
AFM ran fine w/ it out of spec. But then again the old AFM was out as
well. I know that bad temp sensors cause rough idle & some jumping,
all of which I have now. Has anyone experienced a good sized loss of
power throughout the rpm range when it is out of spec as well? I'm
picking up a new one this evening, but was wondering if anyone has
seen this as well.
