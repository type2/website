Subject: runs rough when cold, won't start when warm

I just unhooked the fuel line behind the fuel pump and cranked him over.
Fuel went everywhere and he started up and ran smooth for a few seconds
until the fuel ran out. Is my next step the fuel lines? Why would it run
smooth until I put it all back together? Once again, any help is
appreciated.
