Subject: Pilot Bearing question...


Ok I've pulled my engine.
I removed the flywheel and unless I am mistaken the pilot bearing should be in the little hole behind the flywheel.
I think there is a well worn outside ring of one but how to get it out?
There is almost no lip on it for anything to grip. And even if I dig up a bearing puller somewhere I am wondering if it would even be able to hook on it. 

Looking forwards to your thought and ideas.


This was my first engine drop and
it went with remarkable ease.
Hopefuly I will say the same with the install. :-)
