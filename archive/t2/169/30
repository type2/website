It's a brand name; Lobro/GKN is the original supplier to VW.  Incidentally,
new Lobro CV's will be extremely hard to turn by hand.  This is normal and
they will work fine once installed. Like Richard, I am actually a bit more
surprised that the other two he bought move freely, as that is not   common.
