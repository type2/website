I am really far from an expert, but used to sell/consult for water
well pumps. little different, but work much the same. In those pumps I
saw both complete failure & reduced performance. So I have based my
opinions on my experience w/ pumps in general.

Actually you can:
So quoteth Sir Bentley: "you need a fuel pressure gauge to test the
fuel pump and the pressure regulator"

Instructions for testing the regulator are located in section 10 page
11 & fuel pump testing on page 20. But for both of these tests you
have to have a pressure gauge.

but your correct that you can't just hook up the gauge & expect it to
say which one is defective (if either). there are seperate tests for
both items.

true. But you can't just replace them :)

I'm sorry, but what you suggest sounds more like replace & see if it
works. We are very fortunate as VW owners to actually have very good
procedures to test almost everything on a VW engine w/out paying an
outrageous amount of $$ for testing equipment & when it's not possible
to test it Bentley says flat out "you can't test it" like the afm.

Actually the focus is the fuel system as a whole. If he picks up a few
diagnostic tools w/ a little time & the bentley he should be able to
narrow it down to the culprit.

nah, just test the one in there.

it's usually cheaper to test first then replace only what is broken.
Aside from replacing the lines (for safety) that's all he should
replace until determining broken parts.
