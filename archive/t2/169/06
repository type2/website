I've been pondering that question myself for the past 4 or 5 weeks.  The 
Yokohama Y370's (currently not available) lasted a whopping 18,000 miles on my 
73.  Very even tread wear, and I rotated them periodically so I'm comfortable 
that they didn't wear out do to incorrect allignment or anything like that.  
All the same, they wore out WAY sooner than I expected.  And the past 8000 
miles on them has made me hate them more and more.

After a lot of digging around and changing my mind, I finally ordered a set of 
the Michelins from Tirerack.  They're a few more $$ than the others, but not 
enough to deter me (and besides, you get a free set of Motorola radios when you 
buy 4 - whoohoo).  I've run Michelins on several vehicles in the past including 
a set of 195/70/14 passenger tires on my bus and I've never had a single 
complaint about any of them.  I'll know better if I like them after I've driven 
them for a few months.
