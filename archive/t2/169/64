I format my messages to look appropriate before I send them. If someone would care to inform me via pmail of how to do this more efficiently, I would appreciate it.

Of course this is true. My contention is with how pumps fail. Do these fuel pumps fail in such a manner as to incur reduced efficiency before complete failure, or is is all or nothing. Someone with more experience with these pumps would know better than I. My postition rests more on an all or nothing pump. Your point is valid.

You're still leaving out the pressure regulator. Simply sticking the guage in the loop will not tell you whether it's the pump or the regulator. Each must be isolated, which brings me to my volume/time method. Though not foolproof, it helps make an educated decision about where to go next. You can't driveway test the regulator like you can the pump.

You're talking about two tiny large sweep 90's fixed to the tank. Wire brush & solvent?

We ARE testing fuel lines. And pumps and regulators. The focus is NOT the circuit as a whole. We're past that. This guy has directed us to the fuel system. We are now trying to help him isolate the PART of the fuel system at fault. Pressure gauge tells you low pressure. Is is restricted lines? Fuel pump? Regulator? Injectors?.
When he goes and buys his pressure gauge and tells you that he's proven his suspicions of a suspect fuel system, we're back to square one with zero knowledge of which part is at fault.

1. replace fuel lines
2. check injector electrical/spray pattern
3. perform basic pump test
4. replace regulator with known good.

This process addresses the troubleshooting and maintenance issues in a logical, productive manner with thought to cost.

Jason has made many valid points, and I believe I have too. 

YMMV
