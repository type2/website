Hi all,

I have a set of owner's / campmobile manuals for sale---

The owner's manual has a little wriytig in it-but basicly is in good
shape, and the campmobile suppliment is perfect----

$30.00 or both, plus whatever it takes to get to you--which will be
$4.00 priority mail---

Thanks,

            ______________
