Subject: what dizzy is this?

Hi volks, have a question on a dizzy I found while cleaning the shed last =
night. I'm not at home at the moment so I don't have all the numbers off =
of it, but I know it says 070 for the last three digits and has a vacuum =
canister with two outlets on it. My question is what is this dizzy, heck, =
what is it for, and will it work on a stock 1600 dp 34-pict3 for my bus? =
I'd like to try it if it will improve my gas mileage (17 mpg highway). =
Thanks, Mark & Tiffany B. 1960 EZ Camper, 1960 Beetle, 1974 Beetle.
