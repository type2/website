A pump curve is to show what a pump can do at varying demands. The pressure requirements of the bus f.i. system are constant, unlike most civil engineering. This pressure is supplied whether at idle or at full engine load, and is maintained by the regulator. The basic pump check is probably a 90% reliable method here.

I see where you're going, but I think in terms of driveway physics, if your pump is putting out the specified volume/time, you can assume it's effective enough for our purposes. Furthermore, I don't believe the type of pump water/fuel really has any bearing. We are talking about a 'fuel' pump pumping 'fuel', so there's no apples/oranges problem here. The physics is uniform.

Nor do I, but nobody says you have to test it under your bus half soaked in gas, smoking a butt, either. Take the pump off, get a fused circuit on a 12v battery in a clean, controlled location.

You're contradicting yourself. You say replacing fuel lines is a must for any bus, but perform some verification anyway. Just change the fuel lines! It needs to happen, so do it and see if it solves the problem. You're having logic-block here. We've also (depending on who you agree with here) eliminated the fuel pump, and with the lines all off, there shouldn't be any "you can't replace" and the metal ones can be visually inspected.

Buying a 30.00-50.00 pressure gauge to test fuel lines you should replace anyway doesn't make sense as a starting point. Fuel lines are maintenance items, requiring replacement by nature. Perform this ritual before buying instruments.
