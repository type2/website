Subject: Re: [T2] Tire Question (Donning asbestos 

i have the winstar on my bus but have only drove about
70 miles since i got them and mostly on the I5 in so
cal.  they seem to ride very nice and much better than
the car tires that were on it before.  my main problem
though is that their were low profile tires on it on
the front before and they dropped the back end to
level it out so now it is sitting a bit high in the
front but i'll take care of that when i get off of
working 6/12's in a few weeks.
