Subject: '78 Paint codes ?

Hello List,

Tomorrow "Vegas Bus," a '78 Sagegreen Westfalia, will go to the body/paint 
shop to spend the summer. I have spent the last week getting him/her/it 
ready (glass out, roof off, engine out....) and have two questions. Sorry if 
they are often asked.

1) What is the paint code for the rims? Kinda silver-gray and also, my "U" 
shaped hinge on the slider door, (rear, beltline level) appears to be the 
same color. It may seem trivial but is it the same color as the rims? It's 
same color on my '79 Sagegreen Westy too BTW.

2) What is the paint code for the bumpers? They are white. And while I'm at 
it, how do the new bumpers that one would obtain from one of our many fine 
vendors, compare to the old? Are they the same gauge? Are all the new 
bumpers created equal? Same place? Brazil?

Ok so kinda more than two questions. Thanks a bunch and I know the Sagegreen 
paint code is L63H as well.
