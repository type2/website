Subject: What have I done?(front end)

List,

I Finally got the wheel bearings I needed to finish my front end job and get 
the bus(78 Westy) off jack stands. However, when I lowered the bus the upper 
torsion arms are still resting against the rubber stop. The whole front end 
is rigid when I shake the bus. The only give is in the tires. Everything 
made sense when I put it back together and I was careful to make sure 
everything was lined up right. I even torqued everything per Bently. I can't 
figure out what is going on as there is only one way for all this to go back 
together. Right? Also I am pretty sure there is no mystical force in my 
carport that is holding my bus up. However, this is Utah...

I replaced both tie rods(Bus Depot), all torsion arms(bus-boys) with new 
ball joints, both torsion bars(Busted-bus)mine were broken, new stabilizer 
bar mounts(a joy), new KYB gas-adjust shocks, and new brake pads, plus the 
wheel bearings(all from BD).

The torsion bars matched the old ones in all optically dectecable aspects. I 
also have a set of rear shocks that I suppose I could of mistakenly put on 
the front if that is even possible. However, they are a few miles away so I 
can't check the part # to be sure. But I don't think I did this. Did I 
somehow mix up the lower torsion arms?

Any theories, thoughts, and/or revelations pertaining to my front end would 
be appreaciated. Unfortunately I'm out of time and therfore won't be able to 
fix whatever is wrong. The bus goes to the paint/body shop via trailer 
tomorrow and I go to another state(WY) to work for the summer.
