I think that the distinction here is between "tight" but movable CVs and
incorrectly assembled (locked) CVs,  If the CV can be moved (even with
some force) when new, it is not incorrectly assembled.  The use of dry
moly lubricants by the manufacturer can make new CVs very stiff until
they run a bit.  I've never received an incorrectly assembled new CV.
