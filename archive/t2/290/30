Working flaps can increase heater air flow when the engine is cold by
diverting some air that otherwise would flow over the cylinders into the bus
via the heat exchangers. But this is a small gain. Most important is keeping
cold air out.

Make sure:

-- your fresh air vents close tightly,
-- your windows have good felt and scrapers,
-- your jalousies close snugly,
-- your doors, rear hatch and poptop have good seals

and you will have gone a long way toward keeping out drafts, which is
probably what your girl friend is feeling.

Our buses may never be toasty warm in winter but they can be draft-free.

Cheers,

John Rogers
