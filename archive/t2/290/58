Jeff:

As always, there's a "range" of answers to all of your questions.  If you're
in the "I love this car, I'm going to drive it forever and I have unlimited
money" camp then there's one set of answers, and if you're in the "I'm
broke, I just want to get this thing running and sell it to the next fool"
camp there's another.  So...

It happens.

If the engine was really the original engine and basically sound, and you
just happened to catch a bad head, then I'd say "Yes, it's OK."  I'd
probably opt for having the head rebuilt by a good rebuilder, but you could
also buy a new AMC head, though some folks believe it's not good to mix VW
and AMC heads.  Big money answer: pull both heads and send them off for a
rebuild.

Bus Depot and other online vendors have them.

Because of the way VW cylinders wear it's generally considered a waste of
time to hone them.  They wear somewhat egg-shaped and you can't hone them
round.  No bucks answer: leave everything in place, get the rebuilt head and
slap it on.  Assuming the rebuilder doesn't have to do a serious compression
cut (or, if you get an AMC head) then CR's shouldn't be materially changed
from what they were "at the factory" and you'll get by.  Let the next owner
worry about it.  Big bucks answer:  Pull the P&C's and get new.  CC the
heads.  Get the shims you need from Bus Depot or Cal Imports or some other
VW FLAPS.

See #4.  Unless you know something you're not telling us, I would think the
rings on a 51K original engine would be fine, so I'm not sure why you're
thinking about doing this.

If I was just getting this engine back together for the next owner, then I
wouldn't.  If I was *slightly* more concientious, then I'd gently "round"
the sharp edges of the ding with some very fine sandpaper before putting the
engine back together.

This engine may have been seriously overheated at some point in its life.
The new AMC heads have the seal "built in" to the head, which probably is a
better way of going.  VW itself recommended doing away with the seal at some
point and placing all shims between the case and cylinder.

Your picture doesn't really show the important part of the lifter: the
contact point between the lifter and the cam.  Good lifters have a somewhat
"rounded" contact face while worn lifters are much more flat faced.  Try and
get a look at the cam lobes for wear.  They tend to wear in such a way that
the lobe gets "notched" right on its high point.  Any serious notching means
it's new cam and new lifters time.  Low, low bucks answer: put them back in
the bores they came out of.  Slightly more concientious: disassemble, clean,
bleed.  A little more bucks: New lifters, though they're not going to live
long if the cam is worn.  Big bucks: you know.

What's the "problem cylinder?"  I thought this was a head problem, mainly.
Well, since you've taken the head off with the engine in the car, it seems
like you can put it back.

Don't know.  I've always used generous amount of anti-seize on the stock
studs and have managed to get them on and off OK.

Unless the studs were damaged I'd chase the threads, clean them up and
re-install them with a little Permatex gasket sealer on the threads.
