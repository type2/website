Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Calipers Binding (kind of long)

One thing to check is the free-play in the pushrod between the pedal base and the MC.  Its length is adjustable and should have a specified amount 
of slack or the MC never lets completely off.  On my 71, I rebuilt the calipers and replaced the hoses and still the calipers were sticking -- then my 
mech spent 5 minutes backing off the free-play.....
