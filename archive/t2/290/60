Are you saying it has the California exhaust setup (catalytic converter not
inline with the muffler but tucked next to the left-side exhaust manifold,
O2 sensor, etc.), California ignition (hall effect distributor, etc.) and
California FI components?  I suppose there would be nothing wrong with VW
putting a California engine in a Federal car.  Or maybe a PO did a complete
swap-out?
