the last Digest I got contained 24 messages.

2 were from the Bus Depot, suggesting that they carry a specific part, and 
included the part # and the price.

1 was from another vendor.

You all can read, so I needed rehash the details. I offer this:

If a post contains a price posted by a vendor, referring to itself, that 
is a commercial advertisement.  Everyone knows how to work e-mail, and can 
quite easily e-mail someone off the list that has asked about a part.

If a vendor wants to provide helpful information, that is wonderful. 
Sometimes a vendor will know what exists and what doesn't, and that is 
good information.

It doesn't take rocket science for a person that needs to buy that part to 
followup, in private, with that vendor to find out about pricing and 
availability.


I have no beef with any of the parts vendors. This list shouldn't amount 
to a form of targeted advertising, though.  The guys that are online could 
easily set up their own mailing lists for people that are interested in 
receiving periodic e-mail about parts and specials.

oh how I pine for the days of the 5 line .sig file....
