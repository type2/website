I think I'm agreeing with Karl...the following came from a contradictory 
post in the library under "year and identification changes": (credit to 
Josh Rodgers)
maybe I should just not wonder, except and love the engine as is, and move 
forward.


1979 Chassis# 219 2153 964 (July) Engine# GE 0 055786
2000cc, 72hp, AFC Fuel injection
Remarks:
(a)Last year of the beloved Baywindow.
(b)Vanagon starts Aug. 1979.
(c)Hydraulic lifters.
