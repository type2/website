Remove and install the OEM style for the inspection and reswap the old for 
the H4's when you get home...

Make sure that they are properly adjusted so that no cops have any reason 
to bite for headlight violations.

DO go for the headlight relays. BIG difference (yellow to white light). 
Total cost is about $25 for 4 relays ($1.99 Parts Express) and some wire.
