Subject: Hopefully last starter problem question

OK, so, I have now taken the starter out of the car,
and got it to work fully one time, but now it still
just plunges the solenoid without engaging the motor
at the same time.  I can't seem to find a solenoid to
purchase by itself, and am scared that that may not
solve whatever the problem is.  Pretty much, the more
I investigate the problem the more I get confused.  I
would like to replace a $10 part and have it work, but
can you buy parts for the solenoid?  I think I may
drop the cash and get a new one.  Do I really need a
bosch?, the checker down the street has an autolite
for about $40 cheaper than rebuilt bosch's.  Advice?
