I wasn't watching this thread closely, but just in case this wasn't already
said,

The left heater lever marked MAX on the '73 '74 Bus will operate the aux fan in
the engine bay, *IF* the alternator is putting out voltage,,, 

So, the fan won't work unless the engine is running, and the alt is charging.  

There is a relay that gets its signal from the output of the alt. and from the
ground on the heater lever, 

Hope that helps
