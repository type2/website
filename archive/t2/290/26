The catalogs have new mirrors if you want to go that route.

Another route is to polish or re-chrome the mirror if need be. One lister 
told me that he replaced mirrors by breaking out the OEM mirror and using 
silicone to glue in another mirror cut by the local commercial glass shop.

This is the method I'll use.
