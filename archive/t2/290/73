But it is 20 years old.

Yes.

You run the risk of the other head suffering the same fate.  Most rebuilt heads now have special procedures done to keep the seats in place.

>2. Is it OK just to replace the one head?

Depends.  There are subtle variations in heads (like combustion chamber shape) that can have big consequenses.  If you just want it to run, you can do it.  If you want to drive to Alaska and back next summer, do both heads.

Swap meet, NAPA auto parts.  Not a VW-specific tool.

No.

Depends on compression/leakdown results.  If okay, there is no need to replace rings and hone cyliners just because you removed the piston for another reason.

If the rings are replaced they will, otherwise probably not.

Don't break a ring.  :)

I got mine from Rocky Mountain Motorworks.

I wouldn't recommend doing rings on only one side.  If you do them, do all four cylinders.  Otherwise leave them alone.

No, it will quickly fill in with carbon deposits.

VW now says not to use the head gaskets.  You will have to make your own decision on this one (I still use them).  You can lap the cylinders where they seat against the head to improve the seal.

Do you have more time than money, or vice-versa?

Can't answer this as I haven't done this job on a Vanagon.  I did it in my '73 camper though, once.  The next time I pulled the engine at night and worked on it in the tile entryway of my apartment.

Dunno about this one - I'm not sure the thermal expansion properties of stainless are compatable with the aluminum head.  In my experience the stud isn't the problem, the nut is.  You can get brass nuts and/or stainless nuts, and combined with anti-seize you should be okay.

Depends on the rust.  Light surface rust is normal.  You said heads but I think you meant cylinders as the heads are aluminum and don't rust (they do oxidize a bit though).

Loctite.
