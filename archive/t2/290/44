Subject: Re: [T2] colorful levers (was: Heating Problems)

On the '70 Westy the left and right red levers open the left and right heat
exchanger vents and the left and right green/blue levers open the left and
right vent fresh air vents.

The small knob under the front seat is there to open and close a valve that
directs warm are into the rear through a vent just under the step-down. This
is done through a curved hose under the bus. You may wish to check it, as
with buses as old as ours this hose is often broken. If this happens water
can get in and rust the valve shut and/or rust through the ducting causing
hot air loss.

Why isn't the right level coming down all the way? Check under your dash to
make sure the mechanism simply isn't bumping against something. If it isn't,
your cable may be frozen,  or the heat exchanger vent may rusted shut, or
cable may need to be adjusted.

You may wish to crawl under to inspect.

Cheers,

John Rogers

No. It is just a cable connector.
