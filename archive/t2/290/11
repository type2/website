I can go you one better.  My dwell meter is the SunPro that is available from that surplus web site.  Total was I think $16 including shipping brand new.  Got THREE digital multimeters at Harbor Freight on sale for $3.99 each.  They are the yellow ones and I know they are not Flukes but they do provide useful information and for basic voltage and resistance checks they work just fine.  Timing light - I got a name-brand one at a garage sale for $5.  My point is not to try and one-up you Chris, but just to strengthen your argument that adequate tools can be obtained inexpensively if one doesn't insist on flagging down the Snap-On truck with their credit card.  Leave Snap-On tools for the professional mechanics unless your ego just can't take the hit.  :-)

That's a great score Chris!!  I'm jealous.  :)  I recently got a new-looking Proto 1/2" breaker bar at a swap meet for $7 which I thought was very good.  I have found swap meets to be the best source of cheap tools.  Here in the Dallas/Ft.Worth area we have several large automotive-theme swap meets per year and they always have tables full of Craftsman wrenches and sockets.  Sockets are generally $1 or less if you buy in bulk and wrenches are a buck or five depending on size.  Always way less than retail and a good way to complete a set if you are missing one or two.  I got a Craftsman sandblaster there a couple of years ago for $20, some 4'x6' rubberized carpets for $4/each (nice for the garage) and don't even get me started on air tools!  Got an Ingersoll-Rand 3/8 air ratchet for $10 a couple of years ago among others.

Heck yeah - the beam type are great.  I've seen the click-type fail and of course they are much more expensive.  My beam-type Craftsman torque wrench was bought new for my first type4 rebuild back in 1988 and it still works just fine.  I think I paid about $25 for it.  Since it technically has no moving parts it should last forever, but if it does fail it will be obvious.

Same here.  My friends make fun of me for my random assortment of wrenches and screwdrivers but I always have what I need to get the job done and I spend that money on more important things.
