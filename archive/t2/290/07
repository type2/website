No sweat - apology not necessary but accepted of course.

I worried quite a bit last night that I might have replied too harshly to a 
message I misunderstood - limitations of the technology of e-mail.

Don't worry about it one bit. We're all working on the same side against 
the evil rust monsters... <grin>

Take care.
