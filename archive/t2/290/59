I am not sure where someone came up with the idea that GE is a 1979 California
engine. I have seen that at 2 places. It is totally wrong. GE means it has
hydraulic lifters. Hydraulic lifters came out in 1978. These are all GE
engines, along with all USA 79 engines. I know one of the places that shows
this false info is here:   http://tunacan.net/t4/reference/case.htm
