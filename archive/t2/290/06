Oooh - that's ugly!!!!

I bought my first '72 Westy in North GA one afternoon. It was sitting on 
wet ground and I did not want tog et wet (duh!) crawling around under it so 
I bought it. Decent engine, blown tranny, excellent exterior and interior 
and the price was right at $1500 or so.

Got it home to find everything underneath rusty red and needing immediate 
attention before some real damage occurred. I didn't want to do the work 
but was saved by fate when my '78 Westy arrived driven by a friend. He was 
cussing it because he could not get it to run. Not a mechanic - just a driver.

I sold the '72 to a 3rd friend, traded my Accord to the fellow with '78 
(recently arrived from NM back in 1996 - maaaaybe) and have been "in love" 
ever since with my '78.

Can anyone define early stages of rust, medium, and later stages? Basically 
what rusts first?

Mine has rust at all outer seat belt mounting points - the two between the 
front seats and doors, the two rear seat belt mounts that are in the rear 
fenders, the front of the rockers has rusted away (the single layer of 
metal at the rear of the front wheel wells where to plastic plugs were), 
spot rust in the outer face of the front door steps and just below the 
holes at the end of the frame rails at the rear of the body (above the 
bumper). The passenger side battery tray was salvageable but like Swiss 
Cheese (repaired with a layer of metal impregnated filler and then 
painted). The driver's side was ugly but functioning.

I had rust perforation in the lower windshield opening, and in the lower 
portion of the rear window opening.

Where does rust get found next?
