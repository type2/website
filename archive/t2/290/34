The vast majority of mirrors come from south of the border and some vendors are quite honest and will say they can't guarantee that you'll get matching mirrors: some have a black bead around the edge and some white.  I've seen these on other busses and they look cheap.

For a little bit more you can get a German mirror.  Someone once told me that Hagus was the OEM for the mirror back in the day but I'm not 100% sure.
