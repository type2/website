You basically nailed all of the problem spots.  Battery trays, rocker panels, outside seatbelt anchors, underneath the windshield.  Other spots can happen depending on conditions.  For instance, if a bus is parked in a wet environment under a tree it is not uncommon to see rust in the rain gutter area because of leaves sitting there and trapping water.  If window seals are bad, there can be rust in the floors underneath them (happened in my bus over the engine compartment).

Stages?  I guess surface rust is the first stage, followed by bubbling/pitting and finally holes in the metal.  Once the rust gets to the bubbling stage I don't like dealing with it anymore.  Much rather have a bus with stage 0 or 1 rust and no drivetrain than one with a rebuilt drivetrain and rust holes in the body.
