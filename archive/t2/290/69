Yes, the rubber is all new... installed by PO.  He run the rubber lines
straight from wheel well.  I noticed where there is supposed to be a metal
line coming from the wheel well to a bracket and then rubber from the
bracket to the caliper.  Could this extra length of rubber cause part of the
problem?
