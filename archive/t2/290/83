Subject: alfa engine in bay camper

I am looking for information from anyone on how difficult it is to install
an alfa boxer engine into a vw van. Mine is a 69 bay camper. Wondering where
to purchase (or make from drawings)adapter plates etc & where the best place
would be to mount the radiator. Any info appreciated. Situated in Dublin.
Regards
Rob
