Unlilely, this engine is worn out. Start with the Bentley procedure for
rebuild.
What was the Compression? Oil pressure? Consumption? Service history? By
Whom?
Oil change interval? piston ring gap? ring land clearance? thrust bearing
endplay?
valve guide clearance? Engine bolt torque spec? etc., etc.........

Valve seats don't usually drop during a compression test.
(You were just lucky 8^). Bet you had a reason to do that test, though.....

other.

Chamber volumes must match. ( Compression ratio). Deck height must match
too.

> 2. Is it OK just to replace the one head?

Which one? They are both in need of a rebuild! And what about those main
bearings ?
Have you read any good books lately?
