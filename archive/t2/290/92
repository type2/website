I have a set of the German replacments from Bus Depot.  Several years old
and no trace of corrosion.  However, the plastic lens surrounds
deteriorate in the sun and crack.  I removed the surround, mounted the
glass in the housing with double-stick foam tape, and filled the gap
between the lens and housing with hot-melt glue.  Looks closer to the
original than the plastic lens surround.
