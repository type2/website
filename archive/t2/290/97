>First of all, check http://www.oldvolkshome.com 
distributor specification page to be sure that
the dizzy out of your bug will work on the bus. 

Agreed.  This will tell you what the bug dual
advance dizzy should be timed at.  Since you are
going to have a strobe, you should check total
advance both centrifugal and vacuum to ensure
what you have.  Remember that rebuilt dizzies can
have different innards than their dizzy case part
# may imply.  

>Bugs seem to be more receptive of the 009 than
buses are, 

Amen.  Much easier to keep the engine wound out
(driving with elan per Muir) in a bug than a bus.
 

>Just be sure that you get the timing set
correctly for each dizzy, the 009 can be set 
statically at 7-10 BTDC, while the vac dizzy will
have to be set with a strobe light,  see the
oldvolks page to see where it should be timed.

Strobe is preferable for either.  If you can set
the 009 statically at 7-10 BTDC-- basically
meaning that you have a degree pulley-- you could
do the same with a dual advance dizzy by
offsetting the static timing by the amount of
vacuum retard.  Again, despite what St. Muir
says, strobe is preferable.  

>As for removing the dizzy, just turn the engine
by hand til the rotor lines up
on the notch in the dizzy case, indicating that
#1 is at TDC. 

And verify with ye olde screwdriver down the #1
sparkplug hole method.  See below.

>i noticed that the TDC notch is in a completely
different position on the 009 than on the stock
dizzy.... And make sure that you replace the
spark plug wires in the correct place on the new
dizzy, remember that #1 will likely be in a
different position on the vac dizzy. the #1 wire
should go on the cap directly above where the
rotor now sits, 

I've never seen a dizzy (stock, 009, 010, 050 or
otherwise) that had the TDC notch on the dizzy
case in a different position.  I have however,
seen many dizzies installed improperly, which
doesn't really matter BTW except that #3 may be
retarded.  In other words, the dizzy doesn't care
where #1 TDC is.  Another point is that you may
have to change the orientation of the dizzy, thus
where #1 TDC is, to fit the case.  For example,
when fitting a bug dual advance on a typeIV
engine.  

I hope this makes sense.  Happy bussing.
