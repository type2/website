I have the genuine German Hagus mirrors for $24.95 each. I have to import
them right from Europe, as Hagus shuttered their U.S. office a few years
ago.  Part numbers for '68-79 are 211 857 513F (left) and 514F (right).  I
also have them for Vanagons.

There are a few different knockoffs out there, from both Mexico and Taiwan.
Even the best of them rust much faster than the German ones. (If you've used
Mexican or Taiwanese chrome hubcaps you know what I mean. Unfortunately in
the case of hubcaps, there is no longer a German alternative - a situation
that will probably occur someday with mirrors as well.)  The worst of the
knockoffs almost instantly turn to rust, can look noticably different from
stock, and can have problems with the glass (defects in the reflective
surface and/or premature failure of the bead that holds the glass in).  If a
retailer warns you that they may not send you matching mirrors, this would
seem to imply that they're just buying whatever's cheapest at the time. The
cheapest of the knockoffs (which are typically sold for $15-$25) can be
bought wholesale for about $5.  Frankly, that's about $5 more than they're
worth.

While I do list aftermarket ones on my site, denoted by an "OR" suffix
(these are the better of the aftermarket ones, and run $19.95), the German
ones are well worth the extra few bucks when you have a choice - which isn't
always.  The German ones sometimes go on backorder from Europe (often for a
month or longer), but I do tend to have them more often than not.  At the
moment, I have them.
