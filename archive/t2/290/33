Infrared non-contact temp gun. $10 if you are lucky and find a nice Raytek 
at the local garage sale (like me) or $30 at radio Shack I've heard.

Run it, shoot it to find the hottest point NOT under the spark plug.

I have not done this test but have used a head bolt versus the sparkplug - 
just know that you've got an approximation of the head temps versus proof. 
Easy to spot trends. Numbers are not important. Of Stan said this too.
