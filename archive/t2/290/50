Subject: Re: [T2] Door mirror restoration

In a moment of unreasonable cheapness, I bought a $1.00 12" square mirror
tile from a home improvement store and cut/nibbled it down to the shape of
the old one, sanding the edge to a pretty darn close match (yep, you can
sand glass).

I don't even remember how I fixed it in there, but it couldn't have been
very fancy.  I do remember I used a bead of glazing compound around the edge
just to finish it off, but you can hardly tell it's there.

5 years later or so it's clear solid and uncracked.  You don't have to buy
everything.
