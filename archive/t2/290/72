Good issue here Joe--and expressed perfectly-- I do believe this is
fair--whats good for one should be upheld / honored by all.

Ebay: the polls are in!
If we do in fact have a "no advertising" policy, including eBay, then we
should enforce it across the board. I have seen days where half the
posts were dedicated to the Bus Depot. I like the Bus Depot. I have
always had good experiences with Bus Depot. However, if we have a
policy, it should be enforced across for all. If I can't let the list
know about the tailights I am putting up on eBay, then Bus Depot
shouldn't be able to tell me about the new tailights they just got in.
Or change the policy.
