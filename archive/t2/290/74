(I've already replied to Joe offlist, but just saw that he included the
list with his message.)

The charter reads:

"--Do not try to advertise your eBay auctions or other auctions on the
list. We filter heavily for this. If we want to know what is for sale on
eBay we will go there and look."

This applies specificly and directly to auction advertising, not
advertising in general.

All nonauction advertising is handled on a case by case basis.  If you
have an issue regarding advertising posted to the list you're welcome to
voice your comments offlist to type2-admin(-at-)type2.com.
