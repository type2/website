Right! I agree with Ronnie (below), though I think I said it a lot more 
tediously.

********I think it's great to get a heads up when something new or a
better version of something old is made and becomes available. I think it 
sucks to get a ton of emails about every little widget everyone put on ebay. 
Thats why they have a search engine. If you want to sell a part on the list 
offer it to the list first, rather than just using them as a pool of bidders 
to increase your final price. Everett even has a section on his site 
(thesamba.com) dedicated to ebay ads if thats what you're after
