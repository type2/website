Hi Greg.

I too drive a 79 with a GE code engine.  It is fuel injected, and some of the components are federal in designation (last three digits on Air Flow Meter are 020, instead of 022), as well as a single vacuum advance distributor with points, which the 79 California did not have.  It had breakerless ignition.  I just figured some series of PO's had assembled the engine with what components worked together (ECU,AFM), and from what I understand, the cases themselves are identical for all 1700,1800, and 2000cc engines, with the exception of the 914 case which has a different location for the oil filler tube.  

I've also been confused about this supposed California designation.  A different PO installed an extractor and quiet pack exhaust, removed the filter and sealed up the EGR, so I don't have a catalytic converter or exhaust afterburner.  No O2 sensor.  But the driver side sun visor has an emissions compliance blurb.  What gives?
