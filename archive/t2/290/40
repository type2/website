Subject: Side Mirrors

If you are thinking of getting new side mirror, go to
a pick it yourself junkyard and get one for $5, that
is what  I did, much cheaper than paying $50 for mine
from a parts dealer or more than $100 from the dealer.
 The first place I went to had 4 Vanagons to choose
from.  I'm sure its even easier to find buses
