70 westy~ replacing inner and outer wheel bearings

can someone please decipher the bentley and muir descriptions on how to
replace the inner and outer rear wheel bearings? maybe if there were
pictures of the certain things... i get to a certain point and cant
understand what i am supposed to be doing!

i have removed:
drive shaft (but the "end caps" seemed to have stayed on the car)
outer drum
outer race? i guess...

is the inner bearing attached to the drive shaft? or do i just ignore
that thing?

so confused,
chris
