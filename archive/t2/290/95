The problem is that sometimes you run into something really 
cool on ebay. Maybe it is a Jalousie window for a Vanagon, or 
a sliding rear window, a shortened van, vw monster truck, or 
whatever. Something that other listee might very well like to 
see, and certainly van related.

The Vanagon list does not police eBay auctions, and things 
have not spiralled out of control. At most I may see one a 
day, and since I generally get a hundered or so e-mails off 
of the Vanagon list that is a pretty small percentage.

I understand the need to keep spam off the list but honestly 
type2 takes itself WAY to seriously. As a side note I think 
it is silly to have to add the [...] when I want to 
substantially quote content. Most of us have moved up from 
our 14.4 modems.

Thanks,
Chris
