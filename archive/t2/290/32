Two options: take it to a local rebuilder for an estimate or diagnosis for 
small $$$. Replace that solenoid and take a chance. I'll bet the solenoid 
is your problem. Can you power the starter by applying the cables directly 
to the starter terminals? If so that says the solenoid is bad.

Be sure to tear it down and clean + grease everything while you've got it 
out. Check shaft bushings for wear and brushes for wear.
