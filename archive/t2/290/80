Perhaps this is not the forum to be taking this up on but the post and the
follow up really burned me as I have about a month ago, ordered a front
baywindow rubber seal from Bus Depot.
IT NEVER CAME.
A while ago I ordered the MIDDLE window of a transporter bus, which some of
us know it has a slit for the vent wing, which has it's own seal, anyhow, I
got back a very BACK window seal, they sent me two of them.  When I sent
back the first one I also circled ON A PICTURE of my bus WHICH seal I
needed, low and behold, the WRONG seal comes again.
Then I get a call from a woman at Bus Depot telling me how much I owe
them??? WHAT?
I just sent back a rear side marker lens (they sent me the wrong color) and
two seals and she says that there is a "discount" on one seal and how much
it is, I tell her I paid already and she says I have to talk to another
person about that and they would call me back, NOT.

So, to this day, I am still waiting for the '76 bay front windshield seal
for one of my buses.  I need it to continue body work.

So RON, can you look up my name and see why everyone likes to blow me off at
your company?

Peace,
Sunshine

Mine is both the best, and in stock.  $19.95 gets you a genuine Volkswagen
seal. Everyone else has repro's, and for more money.  Part # 211 845 121D.
