Subject: RE: [T2] What is the deal with H4 lamps?

1) Are they that much brighter?
-Using your stock wiring and running the same wattage H4 bulbs as your stock
lights, they are not technically brighter, but they have a much better
designed reflector and lens configuration that focuses the light where its
needed.

2) If they are brighter, why?
-See above

3) Do they give off a less yellow, more natural light?
-They yellow that your seeing may be from the voltage drop due to resistance
through your old light switch and wiring. If you put in relays, you'll get a
higher voltage to the bulbs and have brighter lights.... this is true even
with your stock lights. If you install H4s and use your stock wiring, do not
use h4 bulbs that are higher wattage than your stock lights. 

4) What do you think, ....think you could get away with them not being DOT 
approved for regular use?
-With all the varying lights that all these new cars have, I doubt very
seriously that you would get nailed during and inspection for having H4s. If
you did, I would try another inspection station.
