I sure can. There is certainly a logical explanation that does not involve
"everyone blowing you off."  We are not in the habit of simply "not
shipping" customers' orders, or calling and asking them for money that they
don't owe us. None of that makes sense, and I can certainly find out the
whole situation.  Of course, first you will have to give me your name.

I will then be more than happy to look into the matter and take care of it
OFF LIST -  which is how you should have emailed me.  There is absolutely no
reason to post an email like this to a thousand people, when a simple
private email would have sufficed.  It is rude to me, and it is rude to the
rest of the people on the list whose time you are wasting.

I have always and repeatedly said that I encourage and welcome all comments
on Bus Depot products, orders, etc., directly to my personal email address,
ron(-at-)busdepot.com . You have the direct email address of the owner of the
company, and an open invitation to use it.  Not every company can say this.
I personally read each and every comment, complaint, suggestion, etc. sent
to that address,  and reply to every single one.

Of course, general questions about orders, products, etc. that don't require
my personal intervention should go to sales(-at-)busdepot.com instead (where
you'll get a reply from Cheri in about a day), or by phone to the below
number.

This now goes off-list.
