It's made by TMI, as is the VW upholstery sold pretty virtually everywhere
else, given that they are by far the largest VW upholstery supplier. The
only difference is the price.  TMI's quality is generally good, although
their delivery can be a bit slow unless they happen to have one on the shelf
when you order.  (Like most vendors, we have them dropship the upholstery
directly to you when you order it; allow a few weeks if they have to make it
to order.)
