I made my own.  Put in two, small, high quality, speakers--sounds great!

I just mounted the speakers in holes cut into a piece of 3/8" plywood
(real-estate sign), then held the plywood up under the speaker grill with
three screws through existing speaker grill holes (from the top, down),
in the rear.  I attached the front to the existing (not sure if stock) screw
that holds the metal strap that supports the front of the radio.  I painted
both sides of the plywood piece matte black to be unobtrusive.
