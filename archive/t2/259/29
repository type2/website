Subject: on fuel pumps...again

On my 74 the vent line has a short length of hose
which
goes through a hole in the tin that covers the heater
box.
This is original configuration as far as I can
determine.
Question: WHY? 
Seems like a bad idea! If the diaphragm were
to rupture gas would flow through the vent hose right
on
to the heat exchanger box. ?????

2ndly.. Ron is selling "new?" mech. fuel pumps for
about
$100.00... anyone out there bought one and are they
German or Brazil? I didnt find a rebuild kit on his
site
tho. Maybe missed something there.

Again.. TIA
Dan
