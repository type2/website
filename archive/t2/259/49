Subject: Re: [T2] The Westphalia Waltz

Named for Westphalia, Texas it is still a well known fiddle tune in Texas. 
It was played by all the Western Swing Bands during that era.

"Cotton Collins, a fiddle player for the Lone Star Playboys, composed a 
"no-name" waltz in 1946. After a dance, local citizens suggested the song be 
titled the "Westphalia Waltz." It was first recorded by the Lone Star 
Playboys."
