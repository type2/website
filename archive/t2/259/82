Subject: VW Trends Turbo Articles

Any turbo enthusiasts out there?

After reading through my latest  VW Trends magazine a couple of times, I
can't help but be intrigued by the idea of turbocharging as a way to give
our "underpowered" vehicles a bit more muscle. The article where they bolted
a system to a stock mexi-beetle engine was very interesting. Both torque and
hoursepower nearly doubled.
Is there any good websites out there that talk about turbocharging flat 4s?
Reading the magazine left me with many questions.

The engine was a fresh stock mexi-beetle engine. Because it was a low
compression engine and this was a low boost system ( about 6 psi), it was a
simply bolt on application. No special turbo grind cams were installed. the
distributer was modified slightly to limit the final advance, but no special
knock sensors or trick ignition systems were required. I guess I'm
interested in what type of turbo engine configuration would make a torquey
decent hoursepower daily driver, not a high rpm screamer.
