Chris,
Its even easier than 10 gazillion parts.  If you don't want to go the RS 
voltage indicator way, Try this chip on for size

http://www.national.com/pf/LM/LM3914.html

This is a linear bar graph display driver.  You hook up your LEDs, set the 
upper and lower voltage limits and away you go.

Here's where you can buy them in small quantities for around $3.00

Back in 1983 (yikes!), I used three of these devices, a frequency to 
voltage converter and made myself an LED tachometer for my car.  I put the 
LEDs in a straight line, had green for normal, yellow for 3 or 4 close to 
red line and red from red line up.  I had fun with it, but it drove my wife 
nuts.
