Subject: vanagon seat belts into baywindow - pics?


Anyone have any pictures of how they installed Vanagon seat belts into their 
baywindow? I picked up a nice set from an 85 vanagon this past weekend, and 
while I see a few different ways to maybe do it, id like to see a picture or 
two of someones working system if possible before I start drilling away.

Two of the three connections simply replace the old ones, but the retracting 
seat belt mechanism itself is what I am a little fuzzy on where to install. 
The lock on the thing seems really sensitive, so I am guessing I will need 
it to be almost perfectly below the top shoulder belt piece or it will twist 
the fabric and lock up every time.
