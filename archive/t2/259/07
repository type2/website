Subject: Re: [T2] Bay seats

I have a 70 poptop westy that had terrible seats when I got it. I bought a 
pair of later (I think 77 seats) They have headrests, that get in the way of 
the kiddie cot. But lo and behold the headrests come out and when we go 
camping the kiddie cot is there.
I use it as a great place to put stuff when camping.
