Steve,

You do not need to replace them in sets.  Just the bad joint is enough.
At the same time, if one went, it is time to clean and regrease all four.
Generally, in my bad-luck experience, if one is gone I know I will find at
least one other that is going.

My advice is to buy two new joints or one rebuilt half shaft (which will
give you two guaranteed-good joints). Pull the dodgy half shaft and clean
up the old joints, see which CV(s) is/are bad. Grease and install that
halfshaft with two good CVs. If you wind up with a good CV at the end of
this, pull the other halfshaft and do the same on it.  This provides you
with a point where you can stop and order more CVs with the bus remaining
functional.  There is nothing like pulling the halfshaft with one spare,
discovering you need two and having to clean and regrease a bum CV that
you know you will have to pull again and replace in a couple weeks :-(
