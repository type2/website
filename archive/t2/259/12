Subject: Seat covers question

Thinking about restoring my front seats in the 75 bus. Found what looks
to be an excellent price at Bus Depot on part number 432115. Can anyone
tell me their experience with this product? I have always gotten good
stuff from them but this price seems a bit too good compared to other
vendors so I thought I'd check the lists' opinion.
Thanks,
Tom

P.S
It is possible to change an oil pump on a 2L engine without pulling the
engine. Just finished the job.
