The stock doghouse cooling system is about as good as it's going to get,
that is true, but one could always convert to the 911 cooling shroud. This
brings the total modifications cost to at least $1800+.
I love a good responsive throttle with plenty of horsies just as much as the
next guy, but WOW, that's alot of money!
Just my thoughts...

Have a great day!
