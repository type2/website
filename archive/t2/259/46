HI Volks,

Found these song lyrics whilst searching for some music stuff....
Now I know this is not how you spell Westfalia as in campers,but this
is how the song title is spelt OK ?...no need to tell me...
It's a Polish folk song with English translation...and I like their thinking ;)

Anyway,maybe some of you Westy owners might be amused and since there
is no music provided I don't know what the tune is.However,perhaps it would be
a good challenge to come up with one around a campfire at a gathering
of Westies sometime...? I'm sure someone would have an acoustic guitar...
I'll leave it with you...(sorry I missed Friday)

Cheers,
