I agree with Bob's method, particularly with the back-and forth
techniques.  My technique with "tight" plugs is about 1/8 turn out, 1/16
turn in, 1/8 turn out, and so on.  You always want the plug to come a bit
further out with each cycle, but not far enough to build up carbon and
corrosion in the threads which will strip things.  Regular squirts with
aerosol Liquid Wrench or your favorite penetrating oil, while cumbersome
inside the tin, are also very helpful.

After you get the plug out, chase the threads with a tap or with a
home-made chasing tool.  I made mine from a 3/4 inch reach plug by
breaking the ceramic out of it, removing the electrode, and making two
cuts down the axis of the
threads with a hacksaw, 90 degrees apart.  Clean up any burrs on the
threads with a small triangualar or somesuch and bend the four thread
"segments" outward slightly to put some outward pressure on the threads.
Spray carb cleaner on the threads and screw in the thread chaser.
