Subject: fuel pumps and compufire

On Compufire:
  I have no experience w/this product. I Have run
pertronix for a number of years now ( 5 or 6 ? ).
made for vaccuum or mech. advance dizzy. Be sure to
specify when buying. drops right in for the most part.

Fuel Pump: original 1974 mech fuel pump. It started
leaking through the vent hose. so I replaced it with
 one from Bry's (now gone) salvage yard. I would like
to rebuild the original. On the "cam" that is operated
by
the rod in the engine there is a "pin" that it rocks
on.
The manual calls it a pin with a "C" clip. On this one
there is no "C" clip and the "pin" has a slotted head.
I attempted to unscrew it but it only turns a little
over 
1/4 turn and hangs or feels tight both ways.
  I need to get this pin out so I can remove the Cam
to remove the pump diaphragm... the manual calls it
the Operating lever.
  Also, has anyone bought a rebuild kit.. and where
from? Did it come with new gaskets and and a pump &
cutoff valve diaphragm both?
TIA
Dan
