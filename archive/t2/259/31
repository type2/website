Hi Volks

I was trying to take out the sparkplugs of my 1600DP engine, the numbers =
1 and 2 cylinders sparks come out easily but the number 3 and 4 are =
stuck. I tried to take them out using my 1/2 inch socket bar but they =
are really stuck, if I try hard they maybe go out but I am afraid to =
broke or mess  something in the heads.
It is normal ?, it is my first time with this problem
What could be the cause for that ?

Thanks Roberto
