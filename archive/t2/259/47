Hi guys

I took the spark plug out but......., they came with some material of =
the  heads in the treads, I cleaned the sparks plugs and the heads hole =
and tried to put them back but the treads in the heads are torn so =
what's next, try to put the helicoils with the heads on or take out the =
heads and do the job, I am a little bit concern about the debris that =
may be into the cylinder.
It is my very first time putting a helicoil or taking out the heads. =
Which way is safest ?

Thanks

Roberto
