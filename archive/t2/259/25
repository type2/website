Subject: Shocks

Hi Gang,

While waiting to install my new AVP rebuild, I've gone looking for other
sorts of trouble I can get into...

My rear shocks are shot, but I've been unable to find any replacements...the
ones installed by the PO were coil-overs.  I've considered using stock
shocks and possibly adjusting the torsion bars BUT the wheels on my bus are
apparently larger-diameter Audi wheels.  Since the shocks have to replaced
anyway, buying coil-overs would save me the trouble of doing the torsion
bars, and I'm afraid that the larger wheels might require the coil-overs to
maintain clearance...any comments on my thought process here?  Anybody know
where coil-over shocks might be had?

Thanks,
RickG
