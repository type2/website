Hiya Listees,

I really don't expect a definitive answer to this question, but I'd really be 
interested in what other bus pilots think.  

When I was renewing my dash I pulled apart the instrument cluster with the 
gas gauge and the warning lights.  

Of the four warning lights only the highbeam indicator had (what appeared to 
be) a "blinder" in it.  This small piece of black plastic fit in the 
indicator light opening perfectly and had a small hole in the center.  The 
net effect was that, when the high beams were on, the "blinder" would allow 
only a small circle of light to show on the blue lens.  The other three 
indicator lenses all light up totally.  So...........why the "blinder" effect 
for the highbeam indicator?

Just outta curiosity, what'cha think?
