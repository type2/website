what a down right post. i agree 110. i put a head rest in my doublecab. in
fact i have a spare headrest for the middle passenger up front. luckily i
inherited a 2/3 front seat from a furniture/lumber/window/plumbing/all-else
recyler [BRING to those int lane county] for $5 with holes for headrests.
cheap protection. found headrests in a few weeks or less - complete.
headrests.

i use a 75 for camping and remove the headrests for the cot. they's stiff
muths. i guess we need'em stiff or they wouldn't ractet up and stay.
oooph.    did anybody criuse their bus to the eugene celebration? these
pilots did... http://www.bootbus.com/

They sure look right, and the Westy child's cot fits in over them, but the
lack of headrest does present a problem.  Whiplash.  I got one.  About
ten years ago--it's pained me every day since.  No, fortunately it was in
my '70 F-250, with the headrestless bench seat.  No damage to the truck,
though the rear-ender got her 323 totalled.  I'm afraid I gotta' encourage
headrest seats for folks who dare venture out where the idiots swarm.  8o|

I'm installing leather Volvo seats, with the adjustable lumbar support and
12v heaters.  Yuppiemommies seem to total these cars before the seats
get much wear.  Check 'em out, at a wrecker near you.
