They sure look right, and the Westy child's cot fits in over them, but the
lack of headrest does present a problem.  Whiplash.  I got one.  About
ten years ago--it's pained me every day since.  No, fortunately it was in
my '70 F-250, with the headrestless bench seat.  No damage to the truck,
though the rear-ender got her 323 totalled.  I'm afraid I gotta' encourage
headrest seats for folks who dare venture out where the idiots swarm.  8o|

I'm installing leather Volvo seats, with the adjustable lumbar support and
12v heaters.  Yuppiemommies seem to total these cars before the seats
get much wear.  Check 'em out, at a wrecker near you.
