Subject: Re: cleaning out shavings when tapping for plug insert 

I seem to recall a number of methods of cleaning the cylinder cavity to
allow an insert to be installed when head is in the engine- 1. stick a
flexible tube through the plug hole and vacuum the shavings (Tape the
tube to a vac hose end, make sure piston is down). 2. Blow out the
shavings- put compressed air up the tailpipe with the ex. valve open, or
add compr. air through the plug hole.  With a narrow extension on a
blower nozzle, one could add the air right through the plug hole?  Hard
part would be lining up the tap when heads are in.  I mark the CEILING
above the plugs that shows the location of a ratchet centerline to the
plug hole; makes reinstalling plugs much easier.
