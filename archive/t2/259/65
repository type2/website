Subject: Some more Westy Questions (sorta)

Hi:

I have to admit I've never fully understood the various notations about
tires.

On my '81 Vanagon the door sticker reads:

7.00-14 8PR         33/40
185 R 14 C 6PR   33/48
185 SR 14 reinf.    33/40

while the '82 Westy's sticker reads:

185 R 14 6PR       33/40


What I have on the Westy are Uniroyal Laredos which read:

LT 195/75R14  93/900 M+S  Load Range C

So:

Are the Laredos "up to spec" for the Westfalia?  I'm thinking the answer is
"No", but I'm not sure.

If  they're not up to snuff I can move the Bridgestone 603V Load Range D
tires I have on the Vanagon over to the Westy, but should I limit pressure
to 33/40 or go up to the 33/48 I have in them now?

TIA.
