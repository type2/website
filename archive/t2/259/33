Before you go any further, wait to see if others differ on my thoughts.
WAIT !

1st off .... Make sure the engine is totally cold.
You want the spark plugs and engine block to be the same temperature.

Now then; they do have to come out some day, so............
Put the proper wrench to them, and turn them until they come loose.
At the first sign of them coming free........ STOP.
Turn them back in the tightening direction ever so slightly.

Do this repeatedly;
working them out,
and then back in ever so slightly,
then out,
until they are free.

What you do not want, is for an improper thread striping to continue up the 
block as you free the plug.

After they are out, determine what has happened.

Before you try to put another plug back into the block, let us know what 
you think you have found.

Before you go any further, wait to see if others differ on my thoughts.
WAIT !
