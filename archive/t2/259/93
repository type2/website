The problem isn't the shroud, it's the finning on the heads and barrels.
The doghouse fan already moves lots of air past the cylinders, but the
fins can only transfer so much heat to the air.  I doubt that the 911
shroud will move that much more air past the cylinders, and the air isn't
as well directed inside the open plenum.

It sure does look kewl, though!
