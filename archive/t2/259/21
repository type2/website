Folks,

Take a look (-at-):

http://www.thesamba.com/vw/classifieds/pix/60452.jpg

I have a 78 Westy, and the pic above is to a Splitty Sundial.
But I'm wondering,
were there every similar canvas covers for the loafs?  Mine
doesn't have the
snaps at all... Sure would like the canvas not billowing about,
and a clean look
from the back seat.

Thanks!
