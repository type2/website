The engine will start and run, correct?

If yes, then here is an easier way to adjust the valves.
Get a remote starter button. Connect it to the starter solenoid post where the
battery cable connects and to the little spade connecter on the soleniod.
Press the button and the engine should spin.
Remove both valve covers.
Watch any pair of rocker arms.
Press button.
When the exhaust valve JUST starts to open, STOP.
[If you go too far, just keep going and look again]
Adjust that cylinders intake valve.
Rotate the engine with the button.
The exhaust will open and close, then the intake will open and close.
JUST as the intake closes, STOP.
Adjust that cylinders exhaust.
Go to next cylinder.
Same procedure:
Exhaust just starts to move, adjust intake.
Intake just closes, adjust exhaust.
No need to go up and down and make a bigger job out of it.
