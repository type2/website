nikki,
	google had the vacuum page cached here:

As far as your question about burning up valves due to vacuum leaks, I
hope this helps. So we know that an engine is basically a pump for
air, sure it does cool things like convert fuel into power, but it's
also a pump. This pump pulls in air from the outside & does stuff with
it. In a good system all the air is accounted for in the fuel/air
mixture. The more air you introduce into the combustion chamber for
the spark plug ignite the hotter the explosion will be. The only
example i can think of for this is a charcoal grill. next time you
grill out (away from you bus :) don't open all the vents on the bottom
of the grill. You should see that the charcoal burns at a lower temp,
which means longer wait for the burgers. The engine works the same
way. since air is a so-so thermal conductor (say verses water) we vw
owners have to watch the temp that our heads get from how hot the
explosion is. 

A vacuum leak introduces extra air into our "pump" which isn't
accounted for by the carb (or fi system). this means that more air is
present than we really want for a good slightly cooler burn. this is
why it's dangerous to run a lean (or extra air) mixture. While it's
called lean, most cases it's actually an increase of air not decrease
of fuel that is the proble. It's just a leaner mixture if we compare
the volume of air. Hope this helps, & good luck.
