Subject: 74 Bay Alternator issues

My alternator stopped charging the battery about a week ago. If I check my
voltage at the battery, it's 12.15V where the engine is running or not. I
checked the belt tension, cleaned all the connectors, and still get the
same results.

So I pulled my alternator and voltage regulator and took them to AutoZone
to have them tested. The tested OK (although the alternator didn't test
right the first time - but the guy moved his ground connector and it
started putting out 14V+.

I'm trying to avoid spending the $100+ for a rebuilt alternator at the
FLAPS (Beck-Arnley is $90 and Bosch is $130).

Anybody have any hints as to where to look next? About two weeks ago, I
installed an push-button starter switch (thinking that the mechanical
switch was broken). It didn't help, it still takes about six tries to get
the starter to kick in. Could it all be a problem on the starter?

I also tried running a ground from the body of the alternator to the
battery, still 12.15V. And then, for kicks, disconnected the ground off
the battery - the engine immediately died.

It looks to me like the alternator is really dead. Is there anying
internal to the alternator I can check?
