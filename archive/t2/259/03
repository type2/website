73 is the same as 72 and back. I am talking about the canvas, not the frame.
[No, you cannot swap the canvas between them, but the material is the same]
Here is page 18 of the 73 owners manual:

Top left corner, it says: 'an additional cot for a child'.
Bottom right corner, it says: 'The child using the canvas cot should weigh no
more than 150 lbs.'

I think the key here is the weight max: 150 lbs.
