Not strong enough.  The key number is the "maximum load" number on the
sidewall, which as I recall is too low on the tires you mention.  It
should be at least 1540 pounds and the Laredos are about 1400 pounds.

That being said, the tires you have are a lot better than the passenger
rated tires some folks are running!  I bought two of the Uniroyals before
I got wise and now use them for spares.  Since they are M/S rated and the
bridgestones are not, I carry them along when I head for snow country.
They should also make good tires for chains as they are slightly smaller
than the 185R14s.

Use the pressures on the data plate behind the seat.
