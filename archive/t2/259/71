Subject: EGR Filter (again)

Hi all,

I've read through the archives, so I think I understand what the EGR system
does and why...

But, I'm in CA, so I have to have at least the appearance of a functional
EGR system.  I recently replaced my EGR filter, and the guts rusted out
within months...I'm concerned that the rusted filter guts could hurt my
(newly rebuilt) engine? BTW, the rust from the filter only pours out of the
downstream (engine) side, so I'm pretty sure this junk came from the filter
itself and not the exhaust system.

If I block off the system, does anyone know if the CA smog folks would
notice?  (I've only smogged it once in CA, and I think I just got really
lucky)

What if I just clean out the filter guts and use the hollow filter
shell...I'm thinking that any stuff from the exhaust system would be less
harmful to the engine than the gobs of rust that came pouring out of the
filter...any thoughts?


Thanks,
RickG
