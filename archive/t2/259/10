Subject: Metal brake lines

I'm having a hard time finding metal brake lines that go from the hoses to
the calipers/wheel-cylinders.  RMMW seems to the only place with info and
parts. Can someone confirm these lengths?

Front Left 211 611 735 170mm
Front Right 211 611 736 170mm

As for the rears, ETKA says: Rear 191 611 994E 4,75x0, 7X free length 600mm

Is this info stating to start with 600mm and flange it at 475mm?

Also, has anyone bought an entire kit, 211 698 996C?
