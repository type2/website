Subject: Car hauling companies?

A friend ;-) needs to move a shiny new Intermeccanica 356 replica from either
Washington State or B.C., down to Texas, and is torn between bringing a
flatbed trailer from Texas and doing it himself, or just hiring a car moving
outfit to deliver it. Does anyone have any personal experience with good
movers over these types of distances, or advice on this? Prices? Names? The
car is an absolute gem.
Thanks,
Courtney
