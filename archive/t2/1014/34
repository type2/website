Subject: Portrait of Peregrine

While going through some files, I found the only picture I have of  
Peregrine from out on the road. This was taken at Organ Pipe Cactus  
National Monument a couple days after the infamous Y2K, on an  
entirely uneventful trip (nothing blew up or broke).

It's a really blurry picture because I took it through a telephoto  
lens I'd bought the week before and never tried out; I was on a  
hilltop about a quarter of a mile away.

Later that day, I took a lot of pictures closer up with an Olympus  
point-and-shoot, but the camera destroyed the film for some reason.  
So this is it. The only picture.

While it is a terrible picture of a bus, it sure shows how tall  
saguaro cactuses grow!
