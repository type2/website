Subject: webcam 107i and bigger valve heads

i have a 1.8 1975 FI ED engine in my 77 automatic bus.  iam having the
engine rebuilt and have a few questions.  i would like to switch to
hydraulic lifters and the #107i looks nice.  i have researched it to
my capabilities and it still looks nice.  i already have the rebuilt
41mm intake and 34 exhaust heads and was wondering if anyone knew or
could speculate in an educated way on how the #107i and these heads
would work together?  i'm really only looking for realiability and
cool running temps.  keep in mind this is a 3 speed automatic that i
would like to drive on trips on the freeway, preferably at something
close to freeway speeds.  if any other engine info is needed, please,
let me know.



thanks,

jeremiah
