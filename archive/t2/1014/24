Subject: [T2] Front Door Window Seal Install?

I'm trying to install new window seals on the front doors...these are the
inside seals on the windows which crank up and down.  It was a little hard
getting the old seal out, but getting the new ones to snap into place seems
almost impossible. 

Anyone know any tricks to this, or do I just need to remove the windows  :0(

I recently replaced all of the window seals, as well as the frame for the
wing vent window, in my driver's door.
I wouldn't call it a trick, but you'll most likely have to get the glass out
of the way.  
Let me suggest that you try this
1.	Remove inner interior panel
2.	Crank window half way down
3.	Remove bolts holding window lift channel to the window regulator and
place the window on the bottom of the door

Once the glass is out of the way you will probably have enough room to
install the inside window scraper.  If that doesn't get the glass out of the
way enough then you'll have to remove the window regulator from the door so
that you can get the glass out of the door.  Also, if I remember correctly,
the forward edge of the inner scraper has to tuck between the vent window
frame and the door so you may have to remove the hardware that holds that
frame in.
Hope that helps.
