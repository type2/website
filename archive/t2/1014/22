For a complete tutorial on how to run your car on hydrogen, search on YouTube for "Hydrogen Fuel - Engine Fundamentals #1" 

This series makes hydrogen look like a very beautiful alternative to fossil fuels.

There are 10 such videos, a very complete tutorial, so just increase the number after each video, or search for "More from this user" after each. The user who put up the videos is *srawofni.

*One comment he makes, by the way is that hydrogen can currently be bought from welding supply places for about $2.00 a gallon!
