What are the specs on your new mufflers?  Brand name, price, etc? I know
very little about mufflers, but I have heard over and over that the stock
muffler is very restrictive and contributes greatly to CHT's.  I would like
to let mine breath a little, and the dual muffler set up you came up with
looks really nice.  Great job!
