Subject: RE: [T2] Front end thumping sound

Thanks for the advice I'll keep the list updated.  Jacked here up, removed
wheels, nothing obviously loose.  Wheels seem to teurn freely.  Like I said
earlier my front drivers side tire is in bad shape and will be ordering two
new ones ASAP.    I will get a lube job done this week too.  Thanks
