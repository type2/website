--------------------------
Contrary to the name, I am in Colorado.  Used to be in California.   
The heat does get to the windshield but not enough in my opinion.  The  
simplest solution for this right now is to put a 12v fan on the dash  
until I can figure out how to better route the heat up front.  On our  
trip to Moab for turkey day, I used some dryer ducting that run up in  
between the front seats.  Kept the feet nice and toasty.  I need to  
brainstorm more on how to route the air up front without taking the  
ducting outside of the bus.  Any thoughts out there?

Peace, Troy
