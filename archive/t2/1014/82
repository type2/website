Subject: sqeaky new shocks

I installed the German made Boge front shocks that Bus Depot sells
about 3 months ago. The improvment was noticable immediately.
I have noticed that they make a lot of noise. On bumpy roads as the
bus is moving up and down I can hear them sqeak. It sounds like its
coming from both sides.

It doesn't do it all the time, usually on bigger bumps where the bus
goes up and down. Always on speed bumps. Is this normal for these?


thanks
Eddie
