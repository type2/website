Subject: Karl has left Fresno

He left on turkey day and made it up safely. He'll be fully on line in early December up in Coos Bay Oregon when they hook up his cable, but may log on at the library until then. 

The bus supply in the local salvage yards has been declining for a few years, but I'll try to snag the hard to find parts. 
We'll miss him around here, but he's as close as the computer.
