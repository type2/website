Subject: re:car hauling companies

I have not needed to do this. But have looked into it before, as I may need
to do it in the near future. Some things to check out-if you are concerned
about the exterior of the car-pay extra for covered cargo-or else the car
can get rock chips, and most definitely will be covered in diesel exhaust
soot. I don't think a car cover can work for something like this-because the
hauler may need to move your car, and they probably don't want to be
bothered with removing and replacing a cover.

 

Make sure everything is strapped down in the car, I've heard bad stories
about buses getting hauled across country-and the battery not being strapped
down, which eventually bounced all over the engine compartment during the
trip. I have no idea which auto you speak of, but the owner may want to
check out to make sure everything is strapped down.
