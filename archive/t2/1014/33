Subject: '77 Westfalia needs new home

Hi to All--Happy Holidays!

I have a '77 Westfalia that is currently parked in the Las Vegas area. 
Mo motor or trans. Also, I am the legal owner, but I cannot locate the 
title. The van is in pretty good shape with practically no rust--CA/NV 
car--minor front end damage from previous owner, but not serious. Has 
been sitting 9 years--interior cabinets intact but need some veneer 
work--regluing or redoing--the dry heat has done a number on the glue. 
This was a great van and can be put back on the road by the right 
person. I am moving back to soCal and have no way to transport this. I 
do not want to see it scrapped. I am open to offers, suggestions, 
trades or whatever. It needs to go in the next month. Mike in Sin City, 
on the way to Joshua Tree.
