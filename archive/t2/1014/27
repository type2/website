Subject: Exhaust Flange Refresh

Aloha Gang,

I finally got my new muffler in and am very excited to put the system
back together. However, the first thing I need to do is cleen up the
surfaces of the old flanges in the rest of the exhaust system so that
they fit all horrorshow. They are slightly pitted in the areas between
the holes, and the pitting does in fact create a slight gap - not a
serious one, just a small one.  I started hand filing the surfaces
down ,after I removed the rust and fragments of the old gasket, but
noticed that the metal was definitely raised on the points were the
holes are.

I want to take my angle grinder to them just to flatten them out
nicely, I'm just not sure exactly how flat they need to be to seal
properly or if they even need to be completely flat at all. I took
them all to a local Carquest in order to have the surfaces sanded, but
the guy couldn't fit them on his machine due to the awkward shaping of
the parts.

Any advice y'all got would be wonderful.
