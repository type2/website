Subject: Vanagon BA6 gas heater into bus questions

I have found an air cooled Vanagon sans engine and trans, but with a BA6 heater.? The folks that stripped it for a buggy apparently didn't want it, and they are willing to give it to me if I take it off, and are also going to roll the Vanagon over so?I can get at it. Nice folks.
I read on the tech pages about what I need to remove; the?heater itself, all ductwork and thru floor vent, the relay, the switch/timer, the safety switch, the fuel line tee, and the fan.?
My '78 Westy has a functional BA6, and I wan't to install this one in a '77 7 passenger bus that I am rebuilding for my daughter.??I can use my '78 as a reference for the install and wiring, but I am unfamiliar with Vanagons.? As it is some distance from home, I'd like to get everything in one trip.
Concerning?the switch at the dash levers--?I would imagine that the Vanagon heat/defrost levers?differ from the bus levers.? Can the switch be installed on the bus levers, or will it take a switch from a bus?
Is there something besides the above mentioned componets that I should nab?
If anyone has done this removal/reistallation before I'd appreciate any?pointers you might have.


Also, is there anything else on the Vanagon that I should grab that I could use on either of my buses??
 (I already have the retractable front seat belts)
Thanks in advance
