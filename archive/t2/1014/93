Subject: Re: [T2] sqeaky new shocks - try this

  Did you lightly gease the bolts/studs as you put the shocks on?
   
  Are you torqued to factory specs?  Install the lower end first and incline to the rear about 30 degrees then torque the lower nut to 18 - 25 ft lbs.  Then pull the top forward, put it on and torque ato 18 - 25 ft lbs.  Most way over torque the nuts on the shocks. 
   
  Use a silicone spray lube on the bubber bushings, might help.
   
  IMO they do not and shold not make noise.
   
  Good Luck,  John
