Subject: Front end thumping sound

Well the bus started a strange thumping/ thwating  sound from the front end
yesterday  and today I confirmed it has not"gone away".  Sounds like it is
coming from under the front seats.  Most noteable on decelerating around the
50- 45 MPH  mark.  I know I should not keep driving, but am kind of forced to
so I am driving slow.  No noise bellow, at, or above that speed,  but when I
slow down it is present.
  Removed underpan.  Nothing obviously loose. (damper  Will jack up tommorrow
and reinspect.  Any ideas where I should look (knowing this is vague I have
never been good at describing sounds)?  Worried this is a in the support beam
(?) issue due to possible bad front tire?   Could have a bad tire (had a wierd
bump in it and I was trying to get the $ for new fronts)  caused something to
break?  The ride was on the rough side before and when the noise is present
the handeling and ride is not more or less worse,  just louder and much more
worrisom.  It snowed in CO today and I was able to go to work slow and didn't
hear it,  but it is a reality I must deal with.
  78  Transporter   Fi   Stock and 1800000  ori.  miles!
                    Peace
