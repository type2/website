Hi Rob,

Unless you already own all the parts that this bus needs; skip it.  
For the cost of what that one needs to be made to run, you can do  
much better.

As a parts bus, it *might* be worth $500, if the engine runs. If it's  
a camper, then $800 is reasonable, again... if the engine runs.

Judging from the telus email address, I'd guess you are west of me;  
buses tend to be a bit rarer out there until you get near the coast,  
where they are a lot more common than here. If you're in the  
prairies, it isn't worth as much to part out as it would be in  
Vancouver, where there's a much better local market for used parts.


Happy Trails,

it has seen better days - cracked windshield, no brakes and bad steering
box (according to owner), bad rocker panels, dog legs, battery tray, and
driver's side rear corner by tail light is punched in. The floors look
pretty solid and the owner says it had a rebuilt put in it about 8 years
ago - 1600 DP, not that I heard it start up. While I was inspecting the
underside, I noticed that the part of frame where the rear torsion tube
is attached, was pretty rusty - the underside part of the frame was
completely rusted, but the sides were still there, supporting the tosion
tube. So my questions are -
1. Can this portion of the frame be repaired  - is it worth it - or is
this the end for this bus?
2. If I get it solely as a parts bus, how much is it worth?

The owner is asking $800 Cdn.
