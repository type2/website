Subject: in need of a 72-74 carb setup

hey guys, new/old listee here.. I just picked up a 72 bus with a 2.0  
in it.. not correct i know.. but the po put type 3 carbs on there and  
the worst 009... i hate the 009.. I am looking for a Set of Carbs...  
and the crazy three hosed balance thingamajig... Please dont hesitate  
to call 801-337-4438 or e-mail me back. I appreciate the help.. I  
would be willing to do a trade etc also if interested.. as the t3  
carbs are pretty hard to find.. I am just having trouble with  
acceleration... with a 2.0 it should have no problem cruising at  
65-70,,, or getting there at a descent rate.. any and all help info  
insight would be appreciated.

Cheers!
          Jason
