Subject: rusty frame question

I'm looking at possibly buying a '68 Bay window thats been sitting in a
field for the last 3 years. Fairly complete and straight, good nose, but
it has seen better days - cracked windshield, no brakes and bad steering
box (according to owner), bad rocker panels, dog legs, battery tray, and
driver's side rear corner by tail light is punched in. The floors look
pretty solid and the owner says it had a rebuilt put in it about 8 years
ago - 1600 DP, not that I heard it start up. While I was inspecting the
underside, I noticed that the part of frame where the rear torsion tube
is attached, was pretty rusty - the underside part of the frame was
completely rusted, but the sides were still there, supporting the tosion
tube. So my questions are - 
1. Can this portion of the frame be repaired  - is it worth it - or is
this the end for this bus?
2. If I get it solely as a parts bus, how much is it worth?
 
The owner is asking $800 Cdn.
