I pondered that same question for quite some time before I did the 5-sp
conversion in my 73 Westy.

It seems that NO 914's or 911's (at least up until the G50 transmission
showed up in 1987 to deal with the ever-increasing HP in the later
911's) ever had anything more than a pair of engine mounts on one end
and a pair of transmission mounts on the other end.  When removing an
engine from those cars you typically remove the tranmission/engine as a
single assembly since neither is supported with out the other.

Based on that knowledge I decided the additional transmission mount was
not necessary and went without it.  As one astute Porsche guru pointed
out to me, with the engine bolted to the transmission with those 4 big
bolts, it might as well be a single piece.

As long as you build good solid brackets for the transmission end of
things and your engine bar is strong and securely fastened you should
not have any problems.  Unless you're planning on 250+ HP that is :)

My 2 cents.

Cheers.
