Do a VIN search and see the smog history of your vehicle:

Well, I went to the site, typed in my 10 digit VIN for my '78 and found that
California had a record on my vehicle!!!

Now I know it was in California at some point of its life, like, 2004!!!
Encinitas, none the less...

Hey, Tim, check your VIN . . . .
