Subject: WTB '70 master res. hose

yesterday my welder friend stopped by and helped me install a new 
accelerator pedal/hinge/pivot bracket mounted on a 6"x8" sheet of 16 ga. 
plate.  All of these parts on my 70 bus were shot.  particularly the 
worn pivot bracket which was causing a lot of squeehaw torque stress on 
the hinge.  So it's all nicely and sturdily welded down, with '71 model 
pivot which has a little different geometry (shorter cable?).  I'm 
planning on using POR putty to fill the gaps in the original floor pan 
which has a lot of rust pinholes otherwise, this is a practical and not 
resto solution on a bus full of practical non-resto solutions. (can send 
pics to those interested, I don't have them posted online).

Anyhow, to make a long story short, via welding we managed to ignite 
briefly the 70 brake reservoir hose where it passes under the floorboard 
(and also to extinguish it rapidly).  Does anybody have this part from a 
70 bus? hose + plastic clip (attaches to floorboard next to steering 
column) + upper reservoir + grommet to attach to lower reservoir.  the 
grommet was leaking so this part needed attention anyhow, so glad to 
give it attention.  Before I call Busted Bus or theBusCo in the morning, 
please let me know if you have any of this stuff handy.  I assume the 
hose is special stuff.
