Hiya Will,



I had a problem (leaking) with the grommet on my 70.? I looked for quite a while and could not find that grommet anywhere.? I believe I read later (via Karl if my memory serves) that this part is a NLA.? In any event, I was forced to find a suitable replacement for the hose.? I took the old hose off and ran it down to my local hydraulic supply store.? I explained the situation to the tech at the counter and he set me up with a hose resistant to brake fluid (and all kinds of other stuff) which would also clamp to the upper and lower reservoirs without the need for a grommet.? Installed that sucker (that was a bit hard because the replacement hose is much more sturdy than the clear plastic original - had to "massage" through the bends) and have not had a leak since.

Replacement hose is marked......AEROQUIP? FC332-08? AOP? 1/2? RATED? 250? PSI? 17 bar? 060
