Ah, autumn when the leaves turn colors and the electric heater questions
pop up on the type2 list...

300W is very little heat.  You are drawing 25A from the generator which is
very high for a sustained load.  You might be able to defrost a tiny area
on the windshield but forget about being toasty warm!

Best route is to make sure that the stock heat system is working properly.
If you want mega heat, a gas heater is indicated.
