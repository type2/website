Subject: how cool!

So, I'm up at my parent's place going through old stuff, and we dug out 
their original drive-away tent.  They have everything for it, too.  I 
haven't unfolded it, but I will when I get back home.

I don't plan on selling it, as it seems like it would be a neat vintage 
item to keep... what's it worth?

thanks,
Mike
