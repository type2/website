Five years ago I ordered from a TX based company at <http://www.por- 
guys.com> but the website seems to have changed hands...

The POR-15 company website helped me locate that vendor (to minimize  
shipping expenses) but I don't see the link anymore so you may have  
to call the head office to locate a dealer. I bet there's one in your  
town.

I'm also going to be doing the POR-15 treatment to a fuel tank but  
the temperature right now is not good for it.
