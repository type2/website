I also ride a motorcycle in the winter. It seems to me, the best way to keep
warm is to buy a 12v heated motorcycle vest that you have under your normal
coat. I saw a show on TV where the military was using a heated vest on a
test subject in a subzero freezer. The subject had bare arms and hands, but
was able to keep warm and have manual dexterity as long as the vest was
keeping his core temperature up, which in turn kept his extremities warm.
Once they turned off the vest, he started having chills and lost all
dexterity in short order. Of course, this wouldn't work if you had a bus
full of passengers, but if you are driving solo it might be a good option
that wouldn't cause fumes or tax the charging system or wiring.
