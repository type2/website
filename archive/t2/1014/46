Make sure you get the thermal cutoff sensor. It's mounted in the tube
forward of the BA6.

Don't forget the coil and fuel pump are mounted separate from the heater.

One of these days I'll install mine. It was supposed to happen this
weekend, but I spent the whole weekend looking for a new home (getting
out of this $1360 a month apartment). We think we found a perfect
place, so it'll have been worth it.
