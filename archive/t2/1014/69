I used the POR 15 treatment on my old 74 bus' fuel
tank. It worked very well. There was not a bit of rust
left in it by the time I used the sealer. I highly
recomend it. It does take a little time to do but is
worth it. I used to have pictures of the inside of the
finished tank but they have long since disappeared. 
Good luck!
