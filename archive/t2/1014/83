Subject: Re: [T2] sqeaky new shocks

Probably the bushings, not the shocks themselves. There's a writeup
somewhere (maybe in the archives) on how to properly install the
shocks. You want to install the top bolt at an angle, then torque the
shock to the bottom bolt, IIRC. Something like that.

Anybody know what I'm talking about, or is my memory playing tricks on me again?
