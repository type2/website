-------------------------snip

(?) issue due to possible bad front tire?   Could have a bad tire (had a
wierd

bump in it and I was trying to get the $ for new fronts)  caused something
to break?  The ride was on the rough side before and when the noise is
present the handeling and ride is not more or less worse,  just louder and
much more worrisom.  It snowed in CO today and I was able to go to work slow
and didn't hear it,  but it is a reality I must deal with.

Devin,

 

I had this one.

 

It sounded to me like I had a pop can under my feet.

 

Naturally, I kicked into full catastrophic mode. I looked everywhere.

 

Saw a 50 year old VW veteran mechanic. His name is Ivan.

 

He removed the hubcap and the noise went away. Completely.

 

Told me to remove the caps, wirebrush the inside cups on the edges. Apply
grease all the way around the inner lip and put it back on the bus.

 

Fault detected and cured----1 minute 40 seconds. ;-)

 

Hope your fault is the same.

 

Alan
