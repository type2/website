Subject: Engine oil  ZDDP levels

Hi list,

I've been off the list for a year or so because of moving to a new 
location. In perusing the last several months posts I noted the thread 
on engine oil SL vs SM rating and ZDDP levels. As I read it the only 
automotive oil (non diesel, non motorcycle, etc). that contains the 
older ZDDP levels is the Castrol Syntec 20w50 Classic Car formula. 
Apparently this is a new oil and I have not seen it yet on the shelves 
in my area. In talking to a local flaps guy about the ZDDP situation, he 
told me that he uses Valvoline VR1 20w50 in his Mustang V8 because it 
has higher ZDDP levels. I googled 'vr1 zddp' and found a lot of posts 
including this one which is supposedly a recent comment from Valvoline 
on their VR1 oil :

Since it is a dino oil it is cheaper than the Syntec. It sounds like 
this would fill the bill for our VW's. Any comments?
