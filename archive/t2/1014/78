That is a real stinkin nice, slick, and easy setup, nice looking and I bet nice performing if you had a slightly warmed over engine.  As stock heat isn't much even with a recirculating rig if you end up somewhere real cold, the BN4 or a BA6 is about the only real way to go if you need it anyway.  How about for defrost though does enough get forward, or does it never matter in California?  I wouldn't worry much about overheating the engine or oil temps, relatively speaking.  I bet those less restrictive mufflers run cooler than heater boxes and CERTAINLY cooler than the late Cali bus/vanagon setup that smacked the big cat converter right up against the drivers rocker box.
   
  Real cool.
