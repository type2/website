Hi Rob,

I'd have to agree with the other list members. Rust in that area of
the bus is arguably the hardest, most expensive and most time
consuming to fix. It will only get worse. I've seen (owned) a few
buses that have had the rear torsion arm tube rust out completely. The
last I had caused the wheel to  bow outward drastically, making it
unsafe to even tow from the front.  I bought these buses strictly for
parts. I paid $600 US for that one, but it was a '73 Westy with a
complete interior and a good running boston bob rebuild with 40,000
documented miles.

I see good buses in driveable condition in the $1500 price range from
time to time. I would pass on this one and keep your eyes open for
other deals.


If you want to see some pics of some badly rusted out rear torsion arm
bars, let me know :)
