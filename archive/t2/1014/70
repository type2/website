My favorite is actually Master Series (www.nomorerust.com).

I got hooked on it about 15 years ago when I was into restoring my 57 Chevy I
owned then.  A local antique parts and restoration shop carried and used it.
Since then I have used it for undercoating, gas tank repair, base coat before
priming and painting, etc... and have been very, very happy with it.  The only
drawback I have had is that it usually takes a month or more to where off my
hand (probably an exaggeration) if I don't take the necessary precautions with
gloves.  I have worked with it on a 50 Chevy coupe, a 48 Chevy pickup, a 55
GMC Suburban, several types of street rods, T-buckets, and even my latest
devotion to my VWs.

Hope this helps,
