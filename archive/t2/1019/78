OK, I was wrong. The SAE standard (DOT approved) headlights allow MORE
upward directed light than the ECE standard (reference Richard's most
excellent site http://www.ratwell.com/technical/BoschH4.html and
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headlamp). One reason for this is because
roadsigns in Europe are lit or highly reflective, while those in the
US are typically lit with our headlights. That said, I don't recall
ever being flashed for my headlights shining into oncoming drivers'
eyes.

While I applaud you for your extensive work, Richard, there are a few
problems with the comparison you've referenced in those photos. A more
accurate representation of whether the beam is shining in the eyes of
oncomers would be a shot from that perspective, or a shot of the light
pattern thrown on a vertical surface. Your shots are good for
comparing the beam pattern on the road surface, but it is impossible
to tell from them how much light is being thrown above the road
because there is nothing there to reflect it back.
Incidentally, it is very clear from these shots that the beam pattern
for the H4 lamps extends much further than the sealed beam lamps on
the left side, closer to oncoming traffic, which is exactly my point.
SAE  and ECE spec headlamps do not have a symmetrical beam pattern;
When correctly aimed, more light is thrown to the the side of the road
(very well illustrated in your shot of the sealed beam light pattern).

Is this Bosch H4 conversion ECE approved (are they stamped with the
E)? The ECE standard also requires that the beam pattern be
concentrated to the side of the road being driven on. This is a
function of the optical design of the lamp, not just the aim.

I have the Hella lamps installed on my bus, and would be happy to
participate in a comparison. We could take a night shot of the beam
pattern projected on a wall/garage door. I'll forward one to you as
soon as I can; you have the H4's and could do the same. This
comparison would help complete your Bosch H4 page. For the sake of
consistency, I'd be happy to pop over and do the photos at your
place... you get much better results with your nighttime shots than I
do, and we could go have a beer...
