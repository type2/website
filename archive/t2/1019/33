Subject: Rotella weights?

I was looking at the Rotella oil today and found 5w30, straight 30wt, 5w40,
and 15w40, but no 10w40 which is my normal winter weight oil. Is this just a
stocking aberation on the store's part, or does it not come in 10w40? I'm
getting ready to put my bus back on the road soon and would like to use the
rotella if I can.

Thanks,
Dave
