First of all, I would get an oil temperature gauge so you know how hot
the engine is getting.  IMO the cylinder head temp gauges do not provide
much useful information with respect to overheating of the entire
engine, only momentary info about the temp of the cylinder head.  You
may not be overheating - the dipstick test is inconclusive at best.

Regarding dieseling, I was never able to completely eliminate this
problem from my engine no matter what I tried (and after nearly 20
years, I think I tried everything at least twice).  I just got used to
performing the following procedure when I turned off the engine:

Trans in 4th gear
Clutch in
Engage parking brake
Right foot firmly on brake pedal
Turn off ignition
Wait one second and release clutch pedal to prevent dieseling
Smile and get out of bus

When I got back, the motor was running fine, but it was very hot. I don't have a temperature gauge on it yet, but I could barely touch the oil dipstick tube. It wasn't so hot that I couldn't keep my hand on it, but it was pretty borderline. Any hotter and I probably couldn't touch it.
