Subject: Re: [T2] Batteries that fit in the later Bay Bus

Thanks to all for the comments.  This is her starting battery-The gr 42 
NAPA battery (Exide?) served Nyssa well, considering her extra cranking 
to start a bus with a faulty cold start valve.  It is dated 2001! and 
still takes a charge, but has lost CCA so that while it may serve in 
Savannah, a cold day here (NJ) required its replacement.  My exact 
measurement of her battery tray shows that beyond 11 1/8" it will not 
fit between the tabs on each side.  The gr 41 batteries are too long. We 
settled on a 24F Sears Gold battery, water checkable, 700CCA and 120 
RC-with no extra battery, that is important for her to camp with her 
radio/internal light on. It's 3 yrs replacement/100mo total warantee, 
and Sears are everywhere. The indented hold down is not as strong as the 
extruded lip on a 24, but it has a handle, an important consideration 
with a 41 lb battery. The XPS Dell computer she has a backpack for 
weighs a lot more!
   The 24F is tall (8 3/4") It will require pulling the air cleaner & 
heat hose to the aux fan to install/remove.
