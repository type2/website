>I think this is just a case of improper aiming: there is an aiming
specification for ECE lights and I'm sure more than a few buses have
headlights out of alignment because the PO turned the wrong screw trying
to undo the ring the holds the lamp in place.

Changes in suspension can also cause misalignment. The PO replaced the
rear shocks on my camper but it appears the headlights had been adjusted
before this. Of course I only discovered that they now pointed severely
downwards the first time I was driving out in the countryside.
