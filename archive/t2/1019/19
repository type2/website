Subject: Fan belt removal

OH! AJ      So I have spent the last hour + trying what you said and came in
from underneath.  I put the one bolt I removed in from the top back in.  The
other one the hex one is just loosened.  I think my problem is that I can't
get the bottom bolt to lossen.   It is cold as hell in COlorado now and I am
about to put it back together and deal with it later.   So what is the trick.
The 10mm bolt is the one underneath in the hard as hell place to get too?  To
the left of the thermostate cable in between the oil fill tube?  How would I
get a jack up in there?   WOuld I have to remove the heat exchanger?  What a
PINTA!!??   Thanks Duroc S!
