Subject: RE: [WetWesties] Anyone running the cip1 5x112mm 5 spoke empis

I think they give you those sizes for the bay window bus crowd.  The 165R15
and 195/50R15 tires would be low profile anyway.

I've been running 195/70R15C Continental VANCO tires on my EVC and love
them.  Definitely not for off road, but great on the highway.  They were not
fun to get (and I work at a Dealer!), but was worth the wait for me.

If you read the description: Special note: These wheels will fit your bus
with a 165/15 (ACC-C10-6655) tire, or a 195/50/15 tire
(ACC-C10-6723).Westfalia owners may require a 8 ply tire, if so check with
your local tire dealer for a 15 inch 8 ply tire to handle the weight of your
Westfalia.

There is NO WAY you are going to find a 165R15 in Load Range C or D ( I
think), or even the 195/50-15. Has anyone found a tire EVER that would be
Westy suitable in the mentioned sizes??? I think I am out of luck with these
rims for a Westy??? There rims have been VERY popular in Europe as viewed in
many Volksworld displays, including on Westies. I just think they are not
running the correct tires.
