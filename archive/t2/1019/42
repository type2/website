Rotella-T 5W40 is made from a Group III basestock (hydrocracked 
petroleum) It's marketed as a synthetic, although some would argue with 
that label. It's becoming fairly common for Group III oils to be called 
synthetic - the most recent formulation of Mobil1 has apparently also 
changed from a true Group IV (PAO - PolyAlpha-Olefin) basestock to a 
Group III. The hydrocracked basestocks are much less expensive than PAO 
basestocks, so paying last year's prices for this year's Mobil1 is a 
ripoff.

Rotella T 5W40 is reasonably priced (~$14/gallon at wallymart). Good 
stuff.

5W40 has only ever been available as a Group III/IV/V basestock oil 
(not as traditional oil using viscosity enhancers), AFAIK.
