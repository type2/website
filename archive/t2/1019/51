Subject: ID my trailer hitch??

Hi all,

I re-discovered an old trailer hitch in my basement this afternoon.  Looks
like a bus hitch.  Anyone have an old "Draw tite" catalog or way to tell me
what this hitch works on?  Engraved on the hitch is:

Draw tite
VW005 FJ

Okay detectives, what applications does this hitch have.  Thanks for any
assistance!
