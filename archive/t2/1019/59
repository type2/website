Subject: Re: [T2] Thermostat

go to www.germansupply.com and look at how to put a Type1 thermostat on your 
bus. Type2 thermo's are long gone, but check www.thesamba.com for one, or 
else get the beetle style and modify it (I did, it's a no brainer with a 
pair of pliers). the germansupply website has a "how to" on doing it. Get 
the spare parts from him while you're at it. He is a really good guy.
