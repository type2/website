This video was of a test of the capabilities of a newly installed
crash test facility, NOT a test of the VW T3 Doka they smashed--- note
the absence of dummies and checkerboard timing marks. That orange Doka
was a junker, a very badly rusted 20 year old vehicle formerly owned
by the German highway department. They smashed it at 100km/h (62 MPH)
head-on into a concrete wall with 1000kg (2200 lbs.) loaded in the bed
to show off how powerful their new catapult system was.
