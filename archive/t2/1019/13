Subject: Re: [T2] Batteries that fit in the later Bay Bus

Mike got his already, but here's another
consideration: I got a group 27 deep cycle / start
battery from Costco (Johnson Controls mfr. > same as
Interstate) because I wanted as much as I could get
with the 1200watt inverter. I had to add a half-inch
thick pad of plastic to raise the battery enough to
clear the obstructions in the floor of the battery
tray and added a universal type hold down. It's
probably the largest capacity battery that will fit in
there without cutting anything!
Hard to nail down the exact specs on this battery -
made by Johnson Controls for Costco brand appears to
be 600CCA - it's got a label on top, but I'd have to
remove it to read it! It's a real bitch to check the
electrolyte level without removing it at least part
way. For all the difficulty you'd best really need the
capacity! -BaH
