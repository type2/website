Subject: Buses by the Beach BUS BRR! February 9th and 10th, 2008!

 Happy New Year Bus Volk!



It's time to start the official countdown to the *4th annual Buses by the
Beach Bus BRR!* at beautiful Pokagon State Park

(www.in.gov/dnr/*park*lake/*park*s/*pokagon*.html<http://www.in.gov/dnr/parkl
ake/parks/pokagon.html>
) in Angola, Indiana!    Fire up the Boxer and spend an evening tobogganing
with fellow bus pilots and start off the '08 Midwest bus camping season in
style!



Go to the Buses by the Beach website (www.busesbythebeach.com) and click on
"Events" to see the 2008 Bus BRR flyer.  Check the "Multimedia section for
cool pics from previous years.



*Schedule:*



The fun starts this year at around 1:00 pm on Saturday, February 9th.  We
will have a big pile of firewood (please don't bring your own  Emerald Ash
Borer problems!) and start the Pot Luck Crock Pot Chili.  Bring your best
Chili, Stew or something to share. There are electric hook ups on each
campsite.  Get the buses  leveled, pop the top (and insulated!) and start
the heaters.



Then, it's off to the wild toboggan runs for some 35-40 mph runs on the two
side by side refrigerated tracks.  Back to the campsite later on for all
different kinds of Pot Luck Chili, music (Bring and instrument if you play
one!) and great bus talk around the big fire.  Make sure to include the
fantastic brunch at the rustic Potawatomie Inn on your calendar for the next
day, Sunday February 10th, before hitting the road.



The famous and fashionable Buses by the Beach Bus BRR hoodies will be
available again for $30.00 each .  Long sleeve and regular Tee-Shirts from
past bus gatherings will also be on hand for sale.  NEW THIS YEAR:  Genuine
Buses by the Beach Logo glass ware to hold your favorite beverage!

 *All *proceeds once again benefit the Phoenix Society for Burn Survivors.

Last year, the daytime temps were unseasonably cold and the low at night was
-5 degrees.  Despite the cold, we were warm in our '87 Westy, JoesVan with
an electric heater running all night.  Most campers lined their poptops with
Mylar sheets before bed and ran small electric heaters or kept the top down.
The next morning everyone contributed something to a community breakfast
around the fire, despite the cold.  Average temps for Angola, Indiana are
highs of 32 degrees and lows of 14 degrees with a mean average of 24
degrees.  This has been the case the 1st two years.

*Basic costs:  *

Gate entry:  $5.00 Entry at Gate*

*Campsite with electric hookup and use of heated comfort station with
bathrooms and showers:  $17.00 for one night (We will again be at Campground
