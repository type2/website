What was in the back of the van was the front of the
van! Kinda like "What's the last thing to go through a
bug's brain when it hits the windshield!"

A few years back I had a local VW wrecking yard to
play in. I paid a lot of attention to how badly the
wrecked vehicles were damaged. The worst damage I ever
saw on Bay buses left plenty of room to survive. Maybe
broken arms / legs / neck, but survivable.

The Vanagons, however, were scary. The worst I saw had
the drivers seat as the forward-most point of the
vehicle. The front end was peeled away to the
passenger side. There was no floorboard or anything
ahead of the drivers seat. The passenger seat area, in
this instance was almost untouched. It all depends on
the forces in the particular collision.

My bus survived a head-on with a Ford Probe and the
Probe was totalled and undriveable, the driver was
also undriveable and spent some hospital time. Her
insurance did not cover the payments she had yet to
make on her car. The impact point was directly in
front of my body. I drove the bus home and, after
re-adjusting the brake rod, drove it around for
estimates!
