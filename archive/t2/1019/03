>I don't have a temperature gauge on it yet, but I could barely touch the oil
dipstick tube.
Without a temp gauge you can't really be sure if you're overheating. I don't
think the "touch the dipstick" method is supposed to be reliable with type 4
engines.

>When I first turned it off after that run, it dieseled for a quick second
I had a bout of dieseling on a long trip a couple of years ago which was fun
for bystanders whenever you stopped and the engine kept chugging. I cured it
by setting the valves, though I have solids and you have hydraulics.

>Someone suggested my timing might be a bit too high
Incorrect timing can definitely overheat (and damage) your engine.

>although my choke is not working, is it necessary that I fix that?
I have a weber progressive and had a lot of trouble starting in cooler
weather. The choke and fast idle certainly help as does the hot air inlet I
rigged with a non-VW air cleaner and hot air from the stock location. When you
say your choke isn't working, what is wrong with it?
