Subject: RE: [T2] HID conversion kit for T2

I should be more specific. People flash me when I have my H4 BRIGHTS on. With
the stock lights, I just left the brights on all the time, (since they are the
same intensity as a modern vehicles dims). I never once was flashed with my
old bulbs.

Some H4 headlights are not DOT approved for the street, that is true. But they
function perfectly well and if aimed correctly (like mine) and are completely
safe. I am certain that Europeans who use these exact lights are not having
head-on collisions as a result. They just arenbt approved by the US
Department of Transportation.

The Bosch H4 conversion kit is not DOT approved for street use for a
reason; the same reason people flash you. The beam shape is not
flattened at the top sufficiently to keep the light, even when on low
beam, from shining into oncoming drivers' eyes. A recipe for a head-on
collision. Yes, they are bright, but no brighter than the street legal
Hella conversion available here:

four bucks cheaper.

Be courteous, be safe, be legal.
