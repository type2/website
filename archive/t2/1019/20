Sorry for the stupid question? but
  I have removed the hold down bolt/screw and lossend the hex bolt and still
am unable to move the alternator?  Trying to replace the belt??

Here are a couple pictures,, from this web page
http://www.ratwell.com/technical/Alternator.html

this one is viewed from under, by where the dipstick enters the block.

the upper arrow points to a tin screw, ,and just past that is the other bolt.

Once you have both bolts loose.. then the alt should swing along the adjusting
bracket.

If it doesn't ,, then you might have to remove the bracket..
