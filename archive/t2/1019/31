Subject: RE: [T2] Busaru Hot ~ Partial Solution

I have pulled some with no fans and some with fans on each radiator. Some
kits had only one radiator and some had up to 3. Some of the radiators were
mounted under the cargo floor of the bus and some were mounted in place of
the front skid plate.

I think it depends on the installer and the kit. There were 3 or 4 different
companies offering the conversions to my knowledge.

The one I pulled from your bus, Jon, only had the 2 fans on one
radiator. The other was bare.
