Subject: carb know how reality check

Hi all, I have a '68 westy, running an H30/31 PICT carb and I would 
very much appreciate a reality check: when I turn the idle-air screw 
(aka idle mixture screw) in all the way that should kill the engine, 
right?  If it doesn't, then air is getting in somehow?  I took the carb 
off and removed the idle adjustment screw and the idle mixture screw 
this morning and shot some wd40 in there to clean it out, and then 
followed up with a small pipe cleaner.  took out the bowl screw and 
clear gas flowed out.  Last tune-up I turned the idle mixture screw all 
the way in and the RPMs went way down and stalled the engine, just as I 
expected.  Now that's not happening.  From what I can tell the Bentley 
manual doesn't get into this problem (though I may have missed it).  
So, what is happening?  Thanks in advance.  Kind regards, -eric.
