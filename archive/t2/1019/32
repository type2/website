Subject: Camped in the bus new years eve!

Hello list. Happy new year to all!

I went to a friends party for new years eve. It was a great time. I
drove the bus with every intention of sleeping in it that night, along
with my girlfriend and her brother.  It was great. After 11 years of
bus ownership and being an avid vw camper, it was my first winter
"campout". Holy crap was it cold out. My little coleman catalytic
heater worked great. If I had two of them it would have been closer to
comfortable, but just one kept us.....well.... alive. It was about 18
degrees Fahrenheit out at 2:30am when we decided to crash. We then
drove home around 7am with ice on the outside of all the windows. I
couldn't keep the windshield free of fog for more than a minute, I had
a roll of paper towels for just this purpose. The heat doesn't work in
my bus...missing the pipe to the front, and the cables for the flapper
boxes.

The bus hasn't been driven since it got cold. I was amazed by how well
it ran, and how quickly it starts in the cold...almost instant Fuel
injection is worth it for the cold starts alone, forget about all the
other benefits. Its hands down the best retrofit you can do to an
older bus.

Also....

my exhaust leak stopped popping.... I know there is/was a leak at the
head/heat exchanger seal that caused popping (backfiring). it
apparently has stopped or doesn't happen in the cold. could carbon
build-up seal a small leak over time? The engine is so much quieter
without this noise.

the bus is really drafty... even more so when driving :)

i need to get my heat working asap.

happy new year everyone
