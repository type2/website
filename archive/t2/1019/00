Subject: Bus running hot!!!

Hey guys,

     Well, I've made quite a few accomplishments on my Bus the past couple of months and I'm ready to try to make it totally roadworthy. The wiring is done, all maintenance is done, and it runs really well. Perfect idle, and plenty of power.

It's a 73 VW Bus with an 1800cc T4 with hydraulic lifters, a Webber 2-bbl progressive (it was on there when I got it), a mechanical advance distributor, an Accel Super Coil, and an electric purolator (4 psi) fuel pump.

Now, I just took it for a spin yesterday, it was an 8 mile trip, that took about 30 minutes which included sitting at a drive through with the enging running. I was nervous as hell the entire time. When I got back, the motor was running fine, but it was very hot. I don't have a temperature gauge on it yet, but I could barely touch the oil dipstick tube. It wasn't so hot that I couldn't keep my hand on it, but it was pretty borderline. Any hotter and I probably couldn't touch it.

I have all the tin work, plus the flaps and the spring. Someone suggested my timing might be a bit too high, but if I adjust it any lower, then the bus has a hard time starting (although my choke is not working, is it necessary that I fix that?).

When I first turned it off after that run, it dieseled for a quick second, just 1 rotation. It had never done that before, but I also had never taken it for this long of a drive before. 

What do you guys recommend that I do? The engine tin and seals are all in place. Other than that, the Bus drove pretty well. I probably need new tires, and it needs an alignment after I redid all the steering components. But it otherwise did well...




Thanks guys...


Todd
