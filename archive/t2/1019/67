Subject: Re: [T2] HID conversion kit for T2

I have never been flashed using my H4 lamps in my '74 Westy, my '73 
Panel, or my '93 EuroVan.  If you have the standard bulbs and they are 
adjusted correctly, they will not cause problems for oncoming drivers.

I've driven quite a bit in Europe, and never had problems with oncoming 
drivers.  The only thing I noticed was that my rental car had much more 
even lighting than any DOT approved vehicle I've driven in the US.

The Hella Vision Plus conversion will likely give you better lighting 
than the original or halogen sealed beams.  I prefer the E code lamps, 
but you add them at your own risk as they are not DOT approved.

The link to JC Whitney has misleading information.  There are no part 
numbers listed, but the Hella Vision Plus 7" replacement is not a 
sealed beam or as JC Whitless states (Seal Beam), as there is a 
replaceable bulb.  Also the list price is way off.  I show this 
available form 2 of my suppliers.  One lists the retail at $48.20.  
This should include the bulb, but they do not state it in the ad.  They 
also state "trouble free bulb replacement"  this may be true in some 
applications, but on a Bus, you still need to remove the trim ring and 
lens unit to replace the bulb.  It looks like if you order 2 today, you 
get free shipping.
