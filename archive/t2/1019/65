Subject: Door seal first aid

The side and rear-facing door seals on my 1976 bus are worn down 
(shrunken) and dripping across the top edges when it rains. They are 
mostly intact otherwise, eg. no major tears. Is there any preferred 
way to make these watertight again, at least for a time, without 
replacement? I have tried domestic stick-on foam strips, but they 
just get pinched or torn off. Thanks for any advice on this.
