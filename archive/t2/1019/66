Subject: Re: [T2] HID conversion kit for T2

The Bosch H4 conversion kit is not DOT approved for street use for a
reason; the same reason people flash you. The beam shape is not
flattened at the top sufficiently to keep the light, even when on low
beam, from shining into oncoming drivers' eyes. A recipe for a head-on
collision. Yes, they are bright, but no brighter than the street legal
Hella conversion available here:

four bucks cheaper.

Be courteous, be safe, be legal.
