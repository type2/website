 Seems that I am blowing grey smoke now.  Or was I before and didn't realize
it.  Seems worse then before.  Thought I only did
at start up, but it is cold here so I have just figured it was the cold.
Could a belt change cause this?  Or is it posible I just didn't realize it
until I had use of a garage?

Are you sure it is not white smoke from condensation in the exhaust?

If yes, it is normal to see it when cold starting.
