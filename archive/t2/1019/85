Subject: Re: [T2] Is winter driving in an air tight bus possible?

Just wanted  to say thanks for everyone suggestions on how fix my problem.
 
It turns out my front hinges on my 69 Westy were shot. I did not  notice how 
bad they were until I went to install a canvas top.
 
I could find new hinges any where, so this weekend I remove the  fiberglass 
top and machined my own.  I actually impressed myself.  Something MacGyvered 
from miscellanous parts actually worked!  And it  looks OE (though a little 
shiny) and works better.
 
My next step is to install canvas.  Any one have any  suggestions?
 
Brian
