Subject: Sliding Door fell off! What holds nylon glider there?

While I was picking up a fixed tire, my SO got out of the back and the 
door fell off the track onto its rear corner!  I took off the track 
cover and got the door back onto the rear roller, but saw it fell off 
because the nylon positioner/glider had lost what appeared to be a 
plastic push rivot that held it to the roller/latch assembly (was still 
in the assembly)- I see a recess behind the nylon glider- wasn't this 
supposed to be bolted on wsith a nut back there?
The mechanic that made over the bus had replaced that glider...hmmmmm
