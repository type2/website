Subject: Fan belt removal

Thanks for the advice.  After much effort I got the new one on.  Worked better
when I switched to a wrench instead of the socket set.  Used a jack, wrench
and wooden rod.  Also installed the new timing scale!  Looks great wish I had
a camera.  One question.  Seems that I am blowing grey smoke now.  Or was I
before and didn't realize  it.  Seems worse then before.  Thought I only did
at start up, but it is cold here so I have just figured it was the cold.
Could a belt change cause this?  Or is it posible I just didn't realize it
until I had use of a garage?
Happy New Year to all you fine bus people!
