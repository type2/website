How do your plugs look?  How about the tail pipe?  You may be running 
lean, but most Webber setups I've seen run rich with a black sooty 
exhaust pipe.

I tried the webber progressive on my '74 1800 and was only able to get 
it to run well in warm weather.  The long manifold allows the fuel to 
condense and unless you find a way to heat it, you will get poor 
performance and poor mileage in cool or cold weather.

What distributor are you using and what is your total advance?  My '74 
had a Bosch 009 on it when I bought it.  It had great power in 1st or 
2nd gear, but nothing left in 4th.  I switched to an original type 
distributor and put on dual aftermarket carbs.  It shifts smoothly and 
drives well in any gear and I have some power left even at highway 
speeds.

My engine also seems to run hot.  The oil temp will slowly climb on 
long highway trips.  I solved this by adding an external oil cooler.
