Subject: Re: [T2] Busaru Hot ~ Partial Solution

Hi, I drive a '77 westy and am also very interested in the subaro
conversions. I admit I have no experience with them, however there seems
to be no problem with not having enough cooling.
By closely following all the threads on the subject there almost seems
to be too much cooling. I myself don't want to have a rad at the front
and am wondering if anybody has ever installed one
underneath the van between the 2 frame rails? I'm thinking that there
would be plenty of heat from the water system that you could remove the
BA6 heater and have a rad right there. Then
with a louvered (to direct the air)  metal plate, with a wire screen
over it to protect from rocks and debris? Has anyone tried this or
thought about it?

Bernie,
