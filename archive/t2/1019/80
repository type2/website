The ECE lighting pattern is especially good at illuminating signs at the side of the road.

Some folks have installed RHD H4 headlamps into LHD vehicles and that does cause serious glare for on-coming drivers that has perhaps given these headlamps an undeserved bad rep.

I don't have any testing equipment so I'm limited in what I can measure objectively. Subjectively there is no glare.

True. You have to assume the light pattern is contiguous and falls off as it appears to in the photos.

There's a photo I took of the sealed beam high beams that doesn't appear in the article. Compare it to the other lamps I tested:

Look at the the DOT H4 (last photo). Personally, I've never bee able to stand the light from any high beam but this one is especially powerful. I don't know what this is so designed but they are legal and when I'm on my H4 equipped motorcycle, the result it the same: I can bathe any vehicle cabin (except trucks) with blinding light.

It's true and that's what makes them so good but it doesn't generate unwanted glare.

It depends where you find them. Here in USA they are SAE DOT approved with the ECE pattern. Technically there are a motorcycle headlamp which prompted me to do the article in the first place to prove their suitability. In my opinion, no problems.
