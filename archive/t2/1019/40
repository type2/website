Subject: Re: [T2] Rotella weights?

That is true AFAIK, in fact I didn't even know the 5W40 existed, shell has a line of cheaper stuff which is not Rotella BTW, I thought Rotella was only in 30wt and 15W40 diesel weight.  I used the 15W40 year-round while in WV FWIW except if the summer drifted consistently into the 90s.  In the day 5W40 or even 10W40 weren't considered "good" oils because they had too much viscosity modifiers to cover the temperature spread and weren't strictly good at either end of the spectrum.  Classically "car guys" wouldn't use anything with over a spread of 20, though I don't know if that logic strictly holds in todays modern world.  But, best engine I've ever seen taken apart at 100k miles still was one with straight 30 winter, 40 summer, for WV climate though.  YMMV.
