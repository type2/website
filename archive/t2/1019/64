I used the H4 kit (NL910CH4) from Bus Depot in my '68 Double Cab. WOW what a
difference and with no negative effects, except people now flash me. One of
the best upgrades I have made. My '78 is next.

Anyone had any luck with installing an HID conversion kit on a bay window.
Would like to improve the lightning as best I can.

Recommendations?

Thanks.
