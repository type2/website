 OH! AJ      So I have spent the last hour + trying what you said and came
in from underneath.  I put the one bolt I removed in from the top back in.
The other one the hex one is just loosened.  I think my problem is that I
can't get the bottom bolt to lossen.   It is cold as hell in COlorado now
and I am about to put it back together and deal with it later.   So what is
the trick.
The 10mm bolt is the one underneath in the hard as hell place to get too?
To the left of the thermostate cable in between the oil fill tube?  How
would I get a jack up in there?   WOuld I have to remove the heat exchanger?
What a PINTA!!??   Thanks Duroc S!

I am puzzled by the term "10mm bolt".

The lower bolt goes thru the tin and fan housing from the outside. It is an
8mm bolt with a round head and a flat on it to stop it from turning. You
loosen it from under the bus with a 13mm wrench. Loosen the upper one at the
slide and loosen the lower nut. Alternator pivots in.
