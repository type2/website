Subject: Fan belt removal

Sorry for the stupid question? but
  I have removed the hold down bolt/screw and lossend the hex bolt and still
am unable to move the alternator?  Trying to replace the belt??  Any
suggestions.  I have tried my books and the archive (which is in need of a
better search engine) and feel like I have removed the bolts needed.  Any
suggestions?   Thanks
 Oh!
               It's a 78  FI Transporter
