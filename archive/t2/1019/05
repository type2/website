those blocks of plastic/nylon/whatever break if the track is not
smooth, old, or poorly lubricated, or you look at em crosseyed

Bus Depot and others have em at a fair price.
buy a few and I put mine on with a recessed nut/bolt
can't remember exactly what thier called, it's late and I'm tired but
they fully recess and look and work almost like the rivet, and a lot
easier to replace when needed.

not a hard repair. the door is heavy so be carefull
