Subject: Oil Type

Hey guys,

    Normally I use synthetics and whatnot in my motors, but I was reading that
Shell Rotella is a great motor oil in it's own right. I still normally use
synthetic, but I thought I'd give this oil a try.

I bought 15W-40 Shell Rotella. Is this too heavy of a weight for my motor? I
typically only use the weights that the dealer recommends, but I have no idea
what VW recommends.

I live in South Florida where the ambient temperature ranges from 85-100 with
80%+ full humidity.

Sometimes it gets hotter, and on rare occasions it drops into the 50s during
the winter.


FYI, I have an 1800CC T4 with hydraulic lifters.



Thanks!!!

Todd
