Hey guys, its pretty cold out here in utah.. ya know those heater  
blower setups they sell in jc whitney etc for 85-125 bucks?? its a  
freaking bilge blower.. save yourselves a bunch of money and go to the  
marine store and pick up a 3 inch id bilge blower and shove it on that  
front tube.. works great and ya get 145 cfm. not bad for 24 bucks..  
but heres my question.. does anyone have a thermostat setup for a 72  
type 4 bus motor??im sick of it taking forever to warm up... need that  
thermostat.. can anyone help??
