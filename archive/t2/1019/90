Hi Courtney,

I would think that the Michelin Agilis in 205/65TR15 would be a suitable
choice.  The outside diameter should be almost the same as the stock 14"
(assuming Agilis 185/RR14 which is fantastic for stock wheels).  They are
Load Range C (1875lb), will fit nicely on the 5.5" wide rims and they are
readily available at tirerack.com for $135.00 (US)ea.  Here are the stats:

Hope this helps.

European owners??? What tires??

I am drooling over the new 5 spoke empis that are now available for the 68
up

Bays. The only thing is they are 15", and thus you need a compatible Load

Range tire for them. Here is the link:

If you read the description: Special note: These wheels will fit your bus
with

a 165/15 (ACC-C10-6655) tire, or a 195/50/15 tire (ACC-C10-6723).Westfalia

owners may require a 8 ply tire, if so check with your local tire dealer for
a

15 inch 8 ply tire to handle the weight of your Westfalia.

There is NO WAY you are going to find a 165R15 in Load Range C or D ( I

think), or even the 195/50-15. Has anyone found a tire EVER that would be

Westy suitable in the mentioned sizes??? I think I am out of luck with these

rims for a Westy??? There rims have been VERY popular in Europe as viewed in

many Volksworld displays, including on Westies. I just think they are not

running the correct tires.
