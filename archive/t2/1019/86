Subject: Anyone running the cip1 5x112mm 5 spoke empis on a bay? - UK or

I am drooling over the new 5 spoke empis that are now available for the 68 up
Bays. The only thing is they are 15", and thus you need a compatible Load
Range tire for them. Here is the link:

If you read the description: Special note: These wheels will fit your bus with
a 165/15 (ACC-C10-6655) tire, or a 195/50/15 tire (ACC-C10-6723).Westfalia
owners may require a 8 ply tire, if so check with your local tire dealer for a
15 inch 8 ply tire to handle the weight of your Westfalia.

There is NO WAY you are going to find a 165R15 in Load Range C or D ( I
think), or even the 195/50-15. Has anyone found a tire EVER that would be
Westy suitable in the mentioned sizes??? I think I am out of luck with these
rims for a Westy??? There rims have been VERY popular in Europe as viewed in
many Volksworld displays, including on Westies. I just think they are not
running the correct tires.
