They can be designed either way.  The important thing is that the
shrouding be tight and designed to prevent recirculation.  I plan to use
pusher fans above a belly-mount radiator with the airflow being downward
into the low-pressure, fast-moving air below the radiator.

They don't provide much pressurization because they are well inside the
boundary layer of the air around the body.  If you visualize them from
above you'll see that the opening points more to the side than to the
front.

My feeling is that they changed to a more "scooplike" arrangment after
observing the addition of aftermarket scoops to splittie buses.  Scoops
were very "in" in the late '60s, and louvers weren't.

This one worked well because it only had one high point in the system.
Air bubbles had little choice but to go to the radiator.  The system still
has to be kept full for proper operation, which isn't difficult with a
conventional pressure cap and overflow reservior.
