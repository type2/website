The biggest problem these days is the japanese marque "tuners" installing
JDM (Japanese Domestic Market) HID lights in US vehicles.  Same problem
with the cutoff.

Years ago, I often drove from the US (all sealed beams then) to Mexico,
where many vehicles came with H4 european headlights.  I was struck with
the lack of glare from the H4 lights.

It does stand to reason, though.  With a sealed beam, the lens and
reflector are disposable items, made to sell for a few bucks.  H4 lenses
and reflectors are expensive by comparison and can be much more precise.
