That is the location of the aftermarket radiators for the A/C systems on
buses. They worked pretty well, so I am sure a radiator would work there as
well. Probably two in series would be enough to cool a small motor. However,
it would be wise to put an aluminum metal expanded aluminum mesh over the
radiator(s) to keep large rocks from denting the vanes. That is what the AC
units used.

The A/C units also used two electric fans per radiator, so I am sure a
regular radiator would need a large cooling fan as well.

Hi, I drive a '77 westy and am also very interested in the subaro
conversions. I admit I have no experience with them, however there seems
to be no problem with not having enough cooling.
By closely following all the threads on the subject there almost seems
to be too much cooling. I myself don't want to have a rad at the front
and am wondering if anybody has ever installed one
underneath the van between the 2 frame rails? I'm thinking that there
would be plenty of heat from the water system that you could remove the
BA6 heater and have a rad right there. Then
with a louvered (to direct the air)  metal plate, with a wire screen
over it to protect from rocks and debris? Has anyone tried this or
thought about it?
