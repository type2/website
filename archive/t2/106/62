Subject: high idle on a type 4 engine

I am finding that my engine conks out when I set things up to the 
regular speeds and use the gas heater I installed which uses less 
current than the old one.

How high can I go. I am running it at 1000 to 1200 rpm, timed to 
7.5 degrees.

Am I going to hurt anything?
