Hello, all.  I'm new to the list.  Have searched previous posts and not f=
ound the specific info I'm looking for, so here goes.  Have a '71 Westy. =
 All stock engine and parts.  About 20 K on a rebuilt engine.  No probs o=
ther than recently it will not start after it's fully warmed up and I shu=
t the engine off.  If I wait over a few minutes and try to restart it whi=
le it's still warm, it will not start.  The engine/starter turns over no =
problem.  Getting good spark at the plugs.  Cold start, no problem.  Have=
 a starter relay installed.  Cleaned and checked all the important electr=
ical connections.  Clean plugs.  Strong fuel pump.  Carb adjustment, timi=
ng, dwell...no recent changes.  Appear to be right on.  Ideas?  =20
Thoughts?  =20
