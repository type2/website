Well I am excited about my new engine coming for my 72 Camper, but I =
have some questions about the old engine.=20

Since the time I got the bus, whenever I would fix an oil leak  a new =
one would occur. In fact the new push rod tube seals only lasted about 2 =
weeks. I have been living with the oil leaks for a while now. Just =
adding oil. =20

Well I was told by some on the list last year when seals kept blowing =
all the time I had bad rings. So I went ahead and ordered my rebuilt =
engine. But I want to fix the old one to put in my 73 Transporter. I met =
a guy here in town and when I told him I had bad rings he helped me to =
check it out. He removed the oil filler cap and felt over it and then =
reved the engine. He said there was no pressure, that it was fine. I did =
have the oil breather capped off and he said it should be open and =
preferably routed back to the carb or something, but there isn't a place =
for it on my single Weber Progressive.
He told me to do a compression test with and without oil and that may =
tell me whats going on. Here are the results:

No oil added
3 (110)        1 (120)
4 (115)        2 (120)
With oil added to the spark plug holes:
3 (130)       1 (150)  damn!
4 (110)       2 (120)

Both the front cylinder readings jumped up a bit. My spark plugs were =
very black and sooty looking. What does all this tell me? What else can =
I do to test the engine before we pull it tommorrow?

If you made it this far the original engine in the 73 has this reading:
3 (70)           1 (130)
4(120)          2 (130)

Something is definately wrong here!! No 3 cylinder is way low. I know =
its the one that typically fails, but what can I do to investigate this =
further. Should I use this engine or the 72 engine?

Thanks for all the wonderful help!
