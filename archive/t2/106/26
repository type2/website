Actually, if you don't need a CAT (or EGR filter), any '72-74 bus exhaust
will fit on a '79-83 bus or aircooled Vanagon (except for California
emissions, which requires a CAT anyway).  By far the best choice among them
is the stock '72-74 bus setup.  It will outlast any of the extractor systems
by a large margin; much heavier gauge steel, and really not any more
restrictive. (Far less restrictive than the '79-83 system, in fact.)  Also
we sell a stainless steel version which will last even longer.  About twice
the price of the others but worth the difference many times over, as many on
this list will attest.  You put it on once and you're done for a long time.

If you do need a CAT, we sell direct replacement CAT's, mufflers, and
tailpipes for '79-83 busses and Vanagons - all comparable to OEM quality and
much cheaper of course.   As always, remember to ask for your listmember
discount.
