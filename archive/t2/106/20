There are no problems with putting the *block* from an '80 into a '73.  I
have the block from an '80 in my '73 even as we speak.  You need ?M10?
rather than ?M8? (or is it M12 rather than M10?) bolts to hold the rear
mounts on because the Vanagon block takes larger bolts, but otherwise, no
big deal.  There are even advantages to having a V'gon block in a '73!
You get a spare dipstick!  Perfect place for a dipstick oil temp sender!

There are also no problems with installing V'gon P&Cs in a '73.  More HP
is a good thing!

There are serious problems with installing V'gon heads in a '73 because
you will need to track down the one-year '79 exhaust system to fit the
square port heads that the V'gon had and the '79 had, but the '73 didn't
have.

There are also serious problems with the fans shroud, tin and alternator.
Vanagon shrouds, tin, and alternator will simply not fit in a bay window
body.  No doubt with a tin-snip and MIG welder, you could "arrange"
something, but it would be a project!

Basically, if you have someone willing to give you a running V'gon engine
and you want the extra HP, yes, it can be made to work.  If you are
picking up a V'gon engine with a dropped valve (very common, see my last
post), even better!  Replace the heads with '78 heads and you are off and
running!  *BUT* you want to swap everything outside the block for bay
stuff, 'cuz the V'gon stuff won't fit.
