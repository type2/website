Depends on your flywheel:
72/73 1700 uses a 210mm clutch with 8mm bolts.
74/75 1800 uses a 215mm clutch with 7mm bolts.
76 up 2.0L uses a 228mm clutch with 8mm bolts.
The 8mm bolts are 1.25 pitch. 1.25 is the 'standard' pitch for a 8mm bolt.
That is why the pitch is not given. The 8mm bolt normally uses a 13mm wrench
[Japanese cars use a 12mm wrench].
The 7mm bolts use a 8mm triple square socket.
