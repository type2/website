Subject: Arrghh!! Help! The indicator arm is  busted!

Hi everyone,
I really need some help FAST!
Tonight I drove 3 hours from my house near Orange,
about 300kms west of Sydney, into Sydney & just as I
got off the freeway the indicator arm on my 77
Microbus started playing up.
The left hand indicator wouldn't stay on & the RH one
would stick when I put it on.
Finally after I'd arrived where I'm staying until
Sunday, I was showing a friend the problem & it broke
all together, JAMMING the right hand indicator ON.
What's the deal with changing it over?
Is it difficult?
Could it just be some loose screws or am I in for a
new assembly?
How do I get the horn button out & the steering wheel
off to have a look?
Please answer as quick as you can.
Tomorrow morning I'm supposed to pick up a HEAP of
parts to help put my 72 single cab on the road, I have
an engagement party in the afternoon & on Sunday I
have my own birthday lunch to go to.
How long will this take me?
I'd appreciate any help.
I looked in the type2.com archives & couldn't find
anything.
:-(
HELP!
Andreww Wood
