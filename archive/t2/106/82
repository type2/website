68 busses have a two year only beam(68 , 69). the beam will fit split
windows also. The front doors are one year only due to the door handle,
doorlock pull on the window frame, and lack of clearance for a light
switch/door buzzer that is on the A-pillar on 69-79. The belly pan is 68
only I believe. No rearwindow defroster.
windshield wiper arms and posts. kick panels. dash switches configuration.
 I think that's it.
