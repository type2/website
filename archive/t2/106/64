You will hear lots of opinions about these carbs, mostly from people who 
have no real understanding of how they work (John(-at-)aircooled a notable 
exception).  I have run single Solex 34's and dual Dellorto 40's, which are 
similar (in size at least) to what you are considering.  I also have a 
2-liter hydraulic engine.  I tried several different jetting combinations 
with each.  I have dyno graphs and fuel logs from about the last 5 
years/70k miles to back me up.  Overall I found that:

You will lose some top-end power with the 34's
You will probably get better gas mileage with the 34's

As with most things, it depends on what is most important to you.  If 
you're price-conscious, the lower initial cost of the ICT's and the 
slightly better mileage (think 1-2mpg better) make them the attractive 
choice.  If you're power-hungry, and/or want flashy carbs, ante up for the 
IDF's - you will pick up some horsepower above 3000rpm.  Frankly, dual 40's 
*should* be capable of better mileage than single 34's but I haven't 
figured out how to make it happen... yet.

The reason some people call the IDF's "racing carbs" is because they don't 
have chokes.  My Dellorto's don't have chokes either but they do okay in 
mildly cold weather.

It really has nothing to do with your carb choice.  If I were you I would 
go with the '74-'75 clutch setup using the flywheel from the same 
year.  The '76 and later setup will not fit well in your 72, and there is 
basically no disadvantage (other than obtaining the pieces) to the 215mm 
parts (74-75) vs. the 210mm parts (72-73).
