Sounds like the seat has pounded into the head, or maybe even dropped ( I
can't imagine you not hearing that happen.) The manifold is warm because the
combustion is blowing past your intake valve and slaming your flow meter
shut thus creating your other symptoms.
Iwouldn't even start it because you risk dropping the valve and or seat thus
grenading that piston/cylinder/head and possibly the rest of the engine.
Bummer but at least it is repairable.(new/used head)
Good luck
Brian

   one cylinders intake manifold tube tobe much hotter than others,

   Air intake Meter to swing wildly while idleing, So much so that the
double relay fuel switch clicks on and off rapidly;

   Slight rpm surge when returning near to idle?

   Also I replaced a faulty lifter in #3 cylinder and after being sure that
the pushrod was seated inside of the lifter-
   the rocker arm sits against the valve-stem even with the ajustment
completely retracted, I.e. the valve
  is sticking out much more than others are.

appreciates them.
