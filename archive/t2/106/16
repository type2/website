Subject: Re: [T2] 78 Bus 2 Liter AVP rebuild. Valves & Compression questions

I also am in the process of speaking to AVP about and engine build. I will be going with hydro cam & lifter from web cam 107i, 96mm pistons, bigger valves 41x36mm and want the CR at about 8:1. Erin is checking with Leonard today to see if he would build this engine for me and a price. They have been really patient with me so far. All the info I have heard says that the bigger valves will make a diff on fuel injection as I will also be using mine. Check out www.shoptalkforums.com for more info on that type of thing. I should know tonight if they will build the engine for me that way or not...
