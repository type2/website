         Well, folks, all I can say is let the games begin!!  I was hit from 
behind by a full size Chevy sedan about 2 weeks ago.  I go word from the 
other guys insurance that the checks in the mail for the damage on my Bus. 
(I'm letting a lawyer handle the rest).  I'm to receive $1300 to fix my poor 
little 69 Rivera Camper.
         I thought for sure they were gonna they and total it, so before they 
called I did a little homework.  National Auto Dealers Association or NADA, 
has a website with the values, and my Camper is valued at $3,000 for low 
retail and $8,000 for high retail.   Absolutly some crazy numbers, but they 
work to my favor.  I also had all the accident info close at hand.  After the 
accident, I wrote down every I could remember, time, weather conditions, 
light conditions, pavement conditions, and everything else I could think of.  
I then did a quick estimate on the Camper.  Most folks may no have the 
knowage to do your own estimate, but you can do this.  Most body shops don't 
have a clue where to get old VW parts.  You can make it easy on them and do 
the parts shopping for them.  I wont meantion any names, but I found a parts 
place on the web.  The prices for the parts is the highest I've ever seen.  
$125 for a rear aprom, $75 for a deck lid.  I printed the pages to let the 
body shop know these were for real.  I then got a real estimate with these 
parts.  Estimate came out to about $1300.  I can wait till the show season 
starts or I stumble across them at the bone yard, then I'll pick up the apron 
and deck lid, I figure maybe $50 tops.  The rest of the money go toward my 
restoration fund for my bus.
I guess the main things are, don't be bullied, do your home work, have the 
right answers, and above all stay calm---time is on your side.
                                                                              
                   Peace,
