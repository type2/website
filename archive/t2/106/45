Amen!  Not to mention you *care* more than most mechanics!   There isn't
anything technically difficult involved, just tedious work.

Good idea!  I have the sockets and not a torch, so I go for the hub nut
first thing, but heat is your friend in these situations, and the drums
are built to take it as long as you apply it evenly.

Make plans to do the other side real soon, as I will bet on it
starting to leak.  That was my experience.

Hmmm.... I tend to back the adjusters all the way in, put the drum on, and
then adjust them back out.  You have to do some adjusting, no matter what,
and it is just easier to get the drum on with the adjusters all the way
in.

I know!  Ain't it tho!  99% of the time, I can do new pads on good
calipers in <20 minutes!

Mark, this is a sure sign that the flex lines in the front are swelled
shut on the inside.  the pistons should go back in with only moderate
pressure.  If they take excess pressure, it is because there is a blockage
in the line.  The MC will apply tons of pressure and will blow fluid past
them to appply the brakes, but the return is slower and those blocked
lines will eat your new pads!

BTW, a Vice-Grip 12LC pliers will make pushing the piston back in an
easier task.  Forgot to mention that in the original post.

Mark, again I believe this is a symptom of blocked flex lines, tho your
attribution to a topped-up resevoir is interesting.  That should not make
a difference, but if it did, it did.  I have had this symptom and
replacing flex lines cured it.  Next time I experience it, I will check
the resevoir as well

Good job!  Good to have a report from *recent* experience.  I've done a
lot of brake jobs, but that is over many years and I average 6 months to a
year between them, so the memories are not always fresh.

> It is just tedious, frustrating, and you will end up swearing.

Yah, I strongly agree...  the swearing is a mandatory part of the job,
unless you are enough of a saint to merit divine intervention  :-)

Which is about right... most shops charge $50+/hr for labor.
