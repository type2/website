Subject: Any Seattle area listees?

Well this isn't a really bus related question, but I'll make it into
one.  I'm wondering if anyone around Seattle on the list has an
extra room to rent out in the September/October 2002 timeframe
as I'm figuring on doing an away rotation at UW med school during
one of those months.  If anyone does, give me a holler.

To make this bus worthy, anybody want to lay odds that I don't
buy a bus with a blown engine, rebuild it and drive it back after
the month is up (see current plethora of nice buses without
engines in Washington/Oregon on samba 8-)

And perhaps for more content, I'll exchange bus work labor for
rent as well.  I'm pretty handy, I'll bring my toolboxes.

Anyway, if anyone can hook me up, I'm a grouchy, loud mouth
opinionated, 32 year old "non traditional" medical school student,
but I'm mostly quiet and pay my bills.

Thanks.
