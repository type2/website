No evil Dupont, spawn of the devil *-)

Actually VariPrime is the only good product they ever made, but
since all their topcoats are junk...  I'd rec one of the PPG NCP
line, or standard old DP40 even though it isn't self etching, it
does just as well.

My opinions of course here are the sprayable polyesters because they
never shrink.  Z-chrome rust defender is my favorite for price ($45/gallon
at my local budget supply place) and because I've had good luck with
it in WV subject to salt, etc on vehicles that I now have 7 years out
from the bodywork/paint.  The Sherwin Williams may be good stuff
but as always watch mixing lines too much, if you spray Dupont, spray
it all the way, PPG all the way, whatever.  I spray the Z-chrome over
DP40 because PPG says you can put polyester filler over DP40 and I
know it works.  That stuff is liquid gold BTW for doing quick extreme
high build, as it never ever shrinks back in like any conventional
primer surfacer will.  You can actually get away with some amazing
crap bodywork if you need/have/want to.  I've sprayed it direct on
150 grit scratches, hit it with 320, topcoated and done.  You do have
to watch to use a big enough tip, and maybe thin with a bit of
acetone as it can orange peel significantly.  With paint it is all sort
of personal experience and preference.  I spray PPG cause the PPG
guy was closest to me in high school and gave me 15%, and they
also were first around here to have computer color match.  Once
you get used to line you tend to stick to it.
