I'm really happy with them.  They ARE a pretty penny, but do very well
in Mud and Snow (read: Mt. Shasta bus trip), although they aren't
much for ice -- then again, what is?

That said, I should qualify all of that by saying I haven't necessarily
seen them cut down on the effects of crosswinds as much as I had hope
to, however, this is a hard thing to quantify -- how do you compare your
old tires in a x-wind to your new tires?  It's all very subjective.  I
*think* I've noticed an improvement over my passenger-car tires, but
I *am* still effected by x-winds -- go figure, I'm driving a bus.

hope this helps,
