Subject: Further Brakes Discussion

Its my first VW bus (71 Westy) and I'm working to get it roadworthy.  =
This means I need to do the brakes (ran a stop sign driving it home b/c =
the brakes failed -- scary!).  Is there a complete list of ALL the parts =
required to completely replace the brake system (m. cyl, calipers, wheel =
cyl., hoses, steel lines, etc.)?  I hate hydraulic fluid so I'd like to =
do it once and call it good. =20
Thx once again
Hal
