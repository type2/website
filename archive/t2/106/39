Subject: 72-79 Pressure Plate bolts

Quick simple-ish question here that I really need to know quickly:

What is the size of the pressure plate bolts on the 72-79 flywheel?  The
Bentley claims M8x20, but that size is not in a format I recognize.  Usually
it is something like M8 diameter x 1.25 thread x 20mm long.

Any help is greatly appreciated... Trying to get a '74 Westi engine in and
to Edisto Freeze Yer Toe by midnight tonight :)  I have a side bet with Dave
Easterwood for a 6-pack of Guinness that this bus will get there, and I hate
to loose bets!  


Thanks,
