I believe unless stated otherwise. it's assumed to be course threads.
Which should be what you said M8 dia x 1.25 thread pitch x 20mm long.

but do yourself a favor & make sure you get the correct bolts. These
have those "teeth" on the underside of the head which should dig in
and help make them lock into place into the washer. I can imagine it
would be very bad to have one of those babies back out :(
