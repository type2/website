Tim,

Every sign you mention above is classic for a dropped valve seat.  Sorry
to be the bearer of bad tidings, but if you take a compression reading on
cylinder #3, I will bet you have 0 psi compression. Once th  ehead is off,
I will further bet on #3 intake from your description.  Depending on the
miles  on the engine...

0-50K    - one rebuilt head;
50-100K  - two rebuilt heads;
>100K    - rebuilt engine.

YMMV and the above is a *very* general rule of thumb.  Check compressions
on all 4 cylinders, obviously, see if the other 3 are even and high or
even and low or all over the place, but I would bet money that at minimum,
you need one rebuilt head.
