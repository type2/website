Not a conclusive test.  The engine needs to be under a load (like full 
throttle) to be sure there is really no crankcase pressure.  Simply goosing 
the throttle isn't going to tell you squat.  If you *really* want to know 
the condition of your rings, a leakdown test is THE way to do it.

He is right, it definately has to be routed somewhere, or at least 
vented.  You can't cap it off and expect not to blow oil past your 
seals.  You should route it to the air cleaner housing - if there isn't a 
port, you can install one.

Yeah, the one cylinder went up a bit with the oil, but they were fairly 
even when dry which is a good thing.  Sooty plugs mean rich mixture, as 
long as they weren't wet.  My guess - there is nothing major wrong with 
that engine and the oil leaks would slow down or stop if the breather box 
were plumbed to the air cleaner or at least vented to the atmosphere.

I agree that this engine definately has a problem!

Try the oil test on the low cylinder, that will tell you whether it's rings 
or valves.  Regardless, the other engine would be my choice.
