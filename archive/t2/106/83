Welcome to the list.
After you tried the previously mentioned suggestions and have found out 
what's "ailin her", I suggest that you install a Tiger 581 CDI unit 
manufactured by Universal Corp. This is just an added insurance policy for 
your bus. Your points will last around 30K and you will be shootin heavy 
spark to your plugs...look it up in the archives for more info.
