Subject: Re: [T2] Arrghh!! Help! The indicator arm is  busted!

Put a flathead screwdriver under the edge of the horn buttton, not under the
aluminum ring. Pop the horn button off. Big nut under the horn (27mm?) holds
the steering wheel on, remove it.Unhook horn ground wire, lift steering
wheel off.(sometimes a hassel, plastic hammer swung from underneath helps
immensely,) also mark steering wheel and splines with a felt pen so when you
put your wheel back on your "handlebars" are straight>
Now you can see the 4 screws that hold the signal/wiper switches on. The
plastic arrangement that opens and closes the switch for each indicator is
probably broken. Take 4 scews out, remove busted switch, reinstall new one,
assuming you have been able to find one.
Hope this helps.
Good luck
Brian
