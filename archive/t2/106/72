I have started selling new calipers, rather than rebuilt, after seeing a
high rate of return on the rebuilt ones.  Mostly stripped threads and the
like; signs that the cores were getting a bit ratty from so many years of
reuse and rebuilding, or maybe just that the rebuilders aren't as careful as
they used to be.  Same sort of thing we see now with rebuilt bug engines;
most of the cores have been rebuilt so many times already that they're just
not good for another rebuild.  It's a scenario that's likely to worsen as
original parts on busses get older and older.

So now I import brand new ATE calipers, at $95 each.  A little more than
rebuilt, but these are brand spankin' new in the blue ATE box.  Haven't
taken a single one back yet, and I've been selling them for about two years.
Plus, no core deposit to deal with.  Certainly an option to consider,
anyway.  (One note: they fit '73-up.  For '71-72, rebuilt is, unfortunately,
all I can get.)  Part # 251 615 107 (left) and 108 (right).
