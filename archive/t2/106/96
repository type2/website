Subject: Re: [T2] Need Advise On Clock Repair

Hiya Terry,

And it only gets better from here on.

Know this right off the bat............there are not a lot of places which 
service automotive clocks and those that do charge an arm and a leg.  This 
leads me to this alternative, there is a good article on clock repair in the 
Type 2 Library.  You might just want to give it a look-see.

If it's still a pro you need you could do worse than contact Gillis Clock & 
Watch in Seattle.  (206.365.5367)  They did a very nice job on my VW clock.

Best of luck,

Mike
