Subject: Re: [T2] Dual Carburetors and  clutches

FWIW, dual 40 IDFs are too SMALL for a stock 1600, let alone a 2000cc
engine. We offer this with a "1600S" option, where we rejet the carbs to
32mm venturis. This is available on the 40 or 44 IDF carbs. Be REAL careful
on who you get carbs from; the jetting on them supplied by weber is
COMPLETELY WRONG for VWs. It was derived in the early 1980s, and today's
fuel is oxygenated, so the jetting with the carbs isn't correct as they are
shipped out of the box (we rejet them to our specs before shipping), and
this is simply going to cost you $$$ and time to re-jet them.

Last tip: reset the fuel level, they are wrong out of the box, this is
normal when they are shipped. Fuel pressure can not exceed 3.5psi or proper
carburetion won't happen.
