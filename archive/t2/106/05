Subject: 72 Westy for sale, CLEAN

    A customer just came in and has a 72  ( from AZ) Westy for sale that is
stored in Iowa since 1991. This is an absolutely rust free OG paint Westy,
blue over white. He installed a Rebuilt GEX engine in 1991, which now has
about 700-1000 miles on it, new shocks, etc. etc.. A very clean bus from the
pictures. The gentleman bought it to haul his RC airplanes in, spent a ton
of money repairing the bus, then parked it. He is 72 years old and doesn't
want to fool with it. so his loss is your gain. He is asking $3500.00, but
it couldn't be picked up till the first of  March, when he leaves Havasu
back to Iowa.
   I will give his phone number to any SERIOUS buyer so as not to disturb
him with a bunch of tire kickers.


thanks for looking   Ronnie
