Hi Mark,

Thanks for the reply. Here's how I came to my conclusion--basically by
ruling out scenarios you list below.

1.-.3  No vidence of overheating in any of other three pistons or jugs. If
dizzy, timing, running lean etc. were to blame it should have showed in one
of the other jugs. (There was a slight scorch mark on the bottom of the top
of #3 piston [again, remember the entire driver's side head was loose; #3
had less than 60 lbs of compression before retorquing, 125 lbs after]).
Clean cooling fins and all tin in place.

4.  Foreign objects? Possible. Burn hole was at bottom of top and side of
piston. But evidence was of melting, not breakage.

5. Rings grooves were good. In fact the rings themselves were still good
though they had a hole under them. No breakage, proper arrangement
120-degree difference in gaps, etc. Had the piston not burned the rings
would have been just fine.

6. Valves and vale seats fines. After extensive testing, including removing
the valves from their seats and and examining the lap edges and seats with a
highpowered photo loup, I could find no problems and reused the same head.
Compression now tests 125 lbs.

Thus I'm forced -- until someone comes up with a better explanation -- to my
original conclusion that the meltdown was a result of bad leak between the
cylinder and head. But I'm always open to having my eyes opened.

Cheers,

John Rogers
