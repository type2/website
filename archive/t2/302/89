I don;t mind someone turning a profit but I found that if they sell

independently wealthy so don't like to spend bux I don;t have.


I have nothing personal against Eastwood, they provide a service to restorers 

that aren't willing to do some leg work.  However, I feel that their prices 

tend to "add value" to "restored" vehicles by creating a false sense of what 

the tools/materials really are worth.  >>

FWIW, Somebody's gotta pay for the glossy catalogs...I've found that East-
wood (and others) tend to be a department store for a particular hobby.
The convenience of having almost "everything in one place" is expensive.
And, yes, some things are a bit (!) oversold...A guy I knew had an East-
wood metal shaping tool that was the same as a Harbor Freight special
and a $200 price difference...
