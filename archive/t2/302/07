Subject: heater flap seals

     I have to replace the seals in my heater box under the dash.  I have
some instructions I got off of the list.  I have 2 questions I want to be
sure about.

1:  I believe my lower #4 lever that is supposed to control air to the back
is hooked up wrong.  When I move it, the flaps under the heater box move.
These are the one you can see & feel if you remove the heater trim panel
under the radio.  Is this correct?

2: What type of foam should I use for the flaps?  I understand the flaps are
about 1 1/4" wide.  Do I use the foam weather-strip with sticky on one side
or what?

     I only want to do this once so any help would be appreciated.
