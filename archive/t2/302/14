Well, rock tumblers change sharp pointy rocks to smooth round rocks.
They will also change the sharp pointy threads on your bolts to nice
smooth round threads.  To a lesser extent, they will do the same thing to
those sharp pointy hex corners on the bolt heads.

I don't think that this is what you had in mind!  :)

My method is to take all the hardware and put it in a paint can with some
lacquer thinner.  Close it up and leave it for a few days and it will get
rid of all the
built-up grime.  Doesn't work for rust, though.  You might try a dip in
muriatic acid for that, but proceed cautiously with this as the acid is
nasty and will eat metal.
