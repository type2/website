Chris-

You're likely too get a lot of differing opinions on this. I also use 20w50
in the summer but I feel it's a bit stiff for starting at temps below
freezing. I dropped to a 15w40 and now the bus starts a lot easier on cold
mornings.

That being said, if you're only going to use the van for a couple of days
while moving, the 20w50 will probably be OK, just be sure to let it warm up
thoroughly before starting to drive.

Regards,
Dave
