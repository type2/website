Is the bus running ok? I have a Pertronix unit that usually shows ~55
degrees, so (like you suspect) 85 is right out. I would double check
that the dwell meter is hooked up correctly & has a good ground. Other
than that, if you need to leave soon just put a set of points in & run
with it. There is sure nothing wrong with running them, the elec units
just seem to be a nice improvement.
