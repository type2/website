Subject: RE: [T2] aftermarket headers

hey in the same way, recently i bought a set of 914 header, they have more
length but once cut the flange seems to fit exactly on my 1700 cc heads.

I didnt try it yet, when summer will come ill try to fitt them all...

it was cheap i got them for 30 $ Ca, flange at both end seem exaclty the
same as flange on heater box!!
