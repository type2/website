Subject: Type 4 Case Align Bore Question?

Send it to Rimco in Santa Ana - They'll align bore it as needed and sell you
the right size bearings etc. You should send your crank and rods there too
so you get everything done at once. The shipping costs would be outweighed
by peace of mind. Could run you a couple of hundred plus shipping.

I've used them and am a satisfied customer.
