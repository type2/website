Eric,

I'm sure you must have tried just about everything in the world including
one of those super strong magnets to fish around in the opening.

Reminds me of when my 2 year old apparently swallowed a small sea 
shell....we found it on the changing table *after* my wife took the boy
to the e/r for an xray.

Just a thought......as I would hate for you to tear it down and still
not find it.  :((  But not near as bad as having your cam gears find 
it<sigh>.

Cheers, dave
