If the bulbs are good check the switch. Sometimes the dimmer portion of the
switch burns out and you get no dash lights. You can put a piggy back
connector on the switch(sorry don't remember which number connector, but you
can figure it out on the diagram) and bypass the dimming feature and just
have the dash light come on at full brightness with the headlights. You only
get full brightness but it's a cheap easy fix. I only use mine at full
bright anyway.
