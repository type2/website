Subject: FS: NOS German T4 heads

Subject says it all, I need to sell (reluctantly but I need cash) my 
set of NOS German 1700 heads.  These heads are BRAND NEW GERMAN as they 
left the factory in the fatherland.  They are specifically non air 
injected, oval port, 1700 heads, standard.  They have the 1700 8mm/8mm 
exhaust studs.  They will work in ANY VW/Porsche oval port T4 
application from '69-'78 excepting obviously the lack of air injection. 
 They do not have EGR breathers either.  They would obviously need to 
be cut for 1.8 or 2.0 applications (my local guy charges $20 a head.)  
These are NEW volks, and German, German seats, German guides, new 
German springs and retainers.  They will have NOS German 39mm intakes 
(if I can find the 4th) but a set of NEW 33mm Italian exhausts.  They 
are cast with 021 101 371 J but are faintly stamped with an M suffix.  
They currently have long studs on the outer two intake port studs (914, 
carbs?) but I will place regular FI length studs if you like.  They are 
a bit dulled in appearance from sitting on a shelf for 20 years but are 
otherwise as new.  I bought them from a guy who raced a 1600cc T4 based 
Lola chassis Formula Vee in the 70's, these were his unused spare set.

The price is $650 or very near offer for the set.  Yeah that is pricey, 
but these are what they are, should be good for original service life 
in any Type 4 application, these are 200k mile heads not cheesy 50k 
mile rebuilds.  Considering the realistic life expectancy of a set of 
AMC's, AVP rebuilds, whatever these are really two sets of heads.

Make a great Christmas present to yourself.
