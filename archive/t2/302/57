Subject: 76 bus,help!!!

 Hey everyone,

I have a 76 bus with a sliding sunroof and I am trying to install my new felt 
roof seal. My bus came with caulking holding the roof together and my "How 
to" book offers nothing in the means of installing a new one. Can anyone help 
me with an illustrated look at how to install the felt seal for my 76 bus 
sliding sunroof????

Thanks in advance,
