Hiya Richard,

I have had amazingly good luck at my local Ace Hardware Store.  I have found 
everything (and I do mean everything) in terms of automotive hardware.  
However, I do believe that the extent of product carried at any given Ace 
depends on the franchisee/owner.  In any event, since they are local and 
nation-wide, it wouldn't hurt to give your local Ace a look-see.
