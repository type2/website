Subject: Is 20w50 Oil OK in the winter

Is 20w5 Oil OK in Winter? I drive my van almost exclusively 
in the summer and have always used Castrol GTX 20w50 Oil. 
Now it is December, temperature is just below freezing, but 
the roads in Toronto are free of snow and salt. I was 
thinking of using the van to help in my move. I have to 
change the oil nyway so I was wondering what weight I should 
use in the winter months. In my Chevy I always use 10w30 in 
summer and 5w30 in Winter.

Thanks,
Chris
