Subject: 1976 bus wiring questions..what goes where?

hello list!
I just got my rebuild in my 1976 bus, and it runs great!  I did the initial
20 minute break in, and there are some loose ends i need to tie up.  My bus
was built in August 1975, thus it is one of the first 76 busses, and the
wiring diagram in my Bentley does not seem to match up.

On the right (passenger ) side of the firewall, there are 3 wires in a black
conduit.

Blue--to heater relay
white and green....to where?
Blue we black...to oil sender

Off the voltage regulator there is a single connector with a solid blue
wire..(nothing is connected to this)

On the right side of the firewall,
there is a thin black unconnected wire
also what appear to be 1 blue, and 1 gray wire that end in a single female
connector (nothing attached)

When I turn off the key, the car stays running!!Ignition switch?

sorry for the long laundry list, but really want to have it hooked up right
before its virgin run.
