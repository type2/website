Subject: Re: bus crash

The car that hit me was a 90's model Japanese 2-door sedan, Nissan or
something.  It had to be towed away.  The hood had a good v-shape and the
front bumper was on the ground.   My bus was a tank compared to her car.
I'm just glad that nobody got hurt.  I wasn't wearing a seat belt and I
barely felt a jolt behind that giant steering wheel.  No whiplash or
anything. I guess I was going about 15-20 MPH at impact. Looking at her car
and my bus, I was *really* impressed how well mine held up. I wish I had a
camera to photograph the aftermath.  I know we're sitting close to the
front, but that German steel is solid.  Having experienced this, I feel much
safer piloting one of these vehicles. Of course, I still wouldn't recommend
taking an 18-wheeler head-on and at a higher speed this could have been much
worse...

I'm wondering how much this will cost to repair (ballpark) or if I should
start looking for a new body (I've got a lot of good parts on this one).
thanks,
Brian
