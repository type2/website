Why don't you try draining your oil first?  Maybe the spring will wind up in the drain pan.  If that fails, you could attach a magnet to a piece of wire (don't use string, you need more control of the magnet to avoid getting it caught on something) and fish around in the crankcase through one of the openings available to you (breather box, dizzy hole, oil plug, oil screen, or even a pushrod tube hole.  If the spring is resting on something other than the bottom of the sump, a squirt of compressed air into one of the above openings might dislodge it.  With some persistance and creativity, you should be able to avoid tearing down the block.
