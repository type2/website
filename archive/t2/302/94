BTDT twice.

First, measure the depth of the hole in the old case and put a piece of
tape on the drill bit so that you don't drill too deep.

Second measure and locate the hole in exactly the same position as the old
case.  Centerpunch, then measure again.

Third, with a steady hand drill the hole to full size.  After the tip of
the drill enters the metal stop and check the position again.  Do not
pilot-drill the case before drilling the full size hole.

Tap carefully.  Advance in small increments and clean out chips with
blasts of WD-40 or compressed air.

The major problem with this job is the propensity for the drill to stick
in the work if you pilot-drill the case.  I pilot drilled the first time
and itwas a heck of a job to drill the full-size hole.  The second time I
did it, I did not pilot-drill and the full-size hole cut much more
cleanly and easily.

I'd expect that aluminum would drill easier than magnesium, but still I'd
be careful.

Make sure that the aluminum case has the boss cast in for the thermostat
stud!  You never know if they might have left it out!
