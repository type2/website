OMG! my kids were playing around in the bug or bus one day and when i
turned the lights on (later), the dash didnt light up. I FREAKED! i
thought something had blown or something, but i finally figured out that
they had turned the dimmer down all the way... WHEW! i was SO relieved.
sometimes it is the simplest answer we overlook that ends up being the
right answer. i cant tell you how many times in my life i have felt like
a real dork for not seeing the simple solution.

waving madly through the snow cuz these idiots dont know how to drive in

today... WHAT FUN!
