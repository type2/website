I wired my fog lights to the terminal that operates the parking (marker)
lights.  Then I can use the fog lights alone, or with the low/high beams.
It took some experimentation though...the first time I found that I wired
them up to the dashboard lights and when I adjusted the dashboard, the fog
lights would  brighten and dim as well, doh!

Hola,

My new Bosch driving lights came in the mail today, and I was checking out
the wiring setup and ran into a question...

They want you to wire them to the highbeam (+) connection, so they only come
on when your high beams are on. Can I connect this to something other than
my highbeam (+) connection so that the toggle switch will always work? Where
I can just turn them on via the toggle switch whenever I want, headlights on
or not?
