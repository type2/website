Thanks Dave! That just might do the trick. BTW, my German shop manual has
great pictures (seems different from the Bentley as it is an official '74 VW
shop manual covering the 1.6l, 1.7l and 1.8l engines exclusively. No confusion
with FI or other unnecessaries.

I just moved the engine from the floor to a pair of saw horses by myself. We
just might do some shaking!
