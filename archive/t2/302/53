Subject: Compufire dwell?

Got my oil cooler reinstalled, and the bus back together, and got it 
running again. Trying to set the timing, but the dwell is way out of 
wack at 85! I have double checked the compufire, and tried it both with 
and without the shim beneath the compufire rotor, with very little 
change. Is there any way to adjust the dwell on this thing, or should I 
just go back to points? Please help, as we are planning to leave for 
oregon tonight, and I have to get it going right.

Thanks,
-Nick
