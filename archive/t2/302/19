Subject: Reground Camshaft opinions sought?

Hi All:

I ordered a reground camshaft for my type IV 2.0L engine (82 Vanagon) as
no new -4 backlash cams were available. Taking a look at the new cam it
appears that this is it's third life as there is little chamfered metal
left on any of the lobes (see images of the new and old camshafts at
http://www.cs.fiu.edu/~jstric01/images/VW/Cam_Images.html).

Does this mean the new "reground" cam is just about out of hardened
steel and that the cam will wear out prematurely? The cam did come with
a blackened surface on the lobes. Is this a from some sort of surface
hardening treatment?

The point of my questions, is that I have two camshafts with some wear
that have never been reground. Would it be better (read longer rebuild
engine life) to have these ground and to return the new camshaft as
unacceptable?

Thanks in advance for the opinions.

Regards,
