Dear Listees

The tool for the later 12-pointed spline, CV joint
socket screws, is an 8mm XZN socket-screw tool.

This is the same tool, needed to remove the mechanical
fuel pump of 1972~79 VW 17/18/2000 Type 2s, with twin
solex carburettors, and adjust the alternator drive
belt tension.

If anyone is interested, I have several of these
spare, as a half-inch drive socket wrench fitting.

Off-hand, I cannot remember what size Allen key fits
the earlier, hexagon-socket, socket screws, as fitted
to my 1973 VW type 2, CV joints.

Regards.

         Nigel A. Skeet

mine (also 70 bus) was an allen wrench (sorry, i dont
know what size) 
but
i was sold the star shaped bit by a VW supplier to
install the new 
bolts
that came with the new boot kit. i still dont know why
the old bolts
werent stars. i figured that was why he sold me the
bit. i was about to
take it back when i realized the new bolts needed it.

whew!

My experience also except I originally cancelled my
tool order then the 
new boots came and I discovered that only the original
boots had hex 
head bolts.

I posted this back in Nov. regarding the tool needed
for the other type 
of screw used:

It's a triple square or sometimes called a serrated
wrench. Get the 
right 
tool in case this happens again in the future. 

Visit your VWFLAPS. They either have BugPack Tool
#7057 or EMPI #5796.

...or try Pepboys for K-D which for the same price as
the socket you'll 
get 
4 bits (6-8-10-12mm I think) which fit into a 3/8"
socket...

Whatever tool you purchase, be sure to clean all dirt
and grime from 
the bolts otherwise the heads will likely strip trying
to remove them.
