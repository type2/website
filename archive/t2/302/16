Subject: Type IV Case Align Bore Question?

Hi All:

I am in the process of rebuilding my Vanagon type IV 2.0L engine. I
measured the bearing bore of the case and found that the bores at their
worst are 0.003 too large (see below for values). So it looks like it is
time to align bore the case.

My question:

1.) Tom Wilson's book mentions that cases can be align bored oversized
to 0.010 and 0.020. But the shops I have contacted state that they only
align bore cases to 0.020. Is this due to the difficulty in getting
oversized bearings (for now I have only found one supplier and they are
not cheap, 3 times the cost), or that in practice it was found that
0.010 would not solve the problem?

2.) Any suggestions for suppliers that carry standard thrust, standard
crank but 0.020 oversized OD bearings? I have tried my standard sources
of CIP and Bus Depot.
