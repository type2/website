Paul,

Check the archives and search for "thermostat boss." The key points 
are do not drill the pilot hole to deeply and make sure you your 
drill bit is perpendicular to the surface of the boss. The case is 
soft and easy to tap. If you have an old case, remove the stud and 
use it as a guide to determine depth as well as what type of tap to 
use. You can even reuse the old stud.

Good luck
