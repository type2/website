Did that first thing. Pulled all the openings we could find, no avail.

Haven't tried the pushrod tube holes yet.

We'll probably spend alot of time doing that first. We didn't know if there
was room for the spring to work it's way out. I got the engine out this
morning. At least it'll be a little more accessible and I can straighten out a
few other nagging details while I'm at it (leaky transmission seal, exhaust
leak, oil pressure sender leak, etc.).
