Indeed, it surely will. Easy way to know the right. Read the Owner's Manual 
or Bentley, pure Deutches Methode. In there you will find a chart showing 
oil types vs weights. I think you will see that 10/30 is for Arctic 
conditions only. I know some quicky oil places only stock one weight, 
10/30, and put it in every vehicle that comes in, meaning half or more of 
their work serves to reduce the life of the patients. Add the cheapest 
possible non spec oil filter and a dead motor can result.

I use 20/50 summer and 10/40 winter. It fits the spec chart for my 
conditions, NW US coast, temperate.
