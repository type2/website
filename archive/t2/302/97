Hi Chris

in 1986 I fitted a BN-2 from a beetle under the belly of my '72 westy, 
converting it into a defacto BA-2. It made GREAT heat and cleared the 
windshield of ice in almost no time. The belly-pan was made from a 
sheet of 1/8" plywood, enhanced with a nice coat of black tremclad and 
kept in place with self-tapping screws.

HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!!!
