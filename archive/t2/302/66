All the more reason to support whatever is left of your local
marchants... Independant VW-based vendors, hardware stores, lumberyards,
etc. Keep in mind how you feel about the Big Store (VWoA) now...The
mega-stores can only carry what turns a big volume profit, under pricing
the smaller stores "bread and butter" lines as well as their small
volume specialty lines.
