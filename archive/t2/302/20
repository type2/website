Subject: 71 disc brakes on a 69 bus?

Hi.....whats it take to put disc brakes on a 69 bus ?

and does it matter if its a 71 beam or is 72 and up OK

will the complete beam bolt in or do you use just the spindles + discs?

yes I know the 71up has a smaller bolt pattern, 
my friend ois planning on changing the rear over too.....

thanks for your help.....
