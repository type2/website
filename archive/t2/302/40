Subject: '71, No dash lights??? - #12 fuse ok

I have a '71 Westy with no speedometer light or fuel
gauge light. The number 12 fuse seems to be ok. In the
Bentley manual it shows an instrument panel light in
the picture, and a light is indicated as L6 in the
wiring diagram, but I can't see one on the back of the
speedometer when I look under the dash.

What could be the problem??

Thanks, Mike
