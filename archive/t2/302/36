That's bad news.  I had the exact same thing happen several years ago, but I
was lucky enough to be able to see it just inside the hole where it was
sitting on the camshaft gear.  I very carefully fished it out with one of
those long flexible grabber thingies.  

If you can't see it and retrieve it, you're in for a complete engine
tear-down.  Don't even turn your engine over by hand with that in there
because it's going to go throught the cam/crank gears, get torn up, and
distribute metal pieces throughout your engine :(

To prevent this disaster in the future, take a straight length of coat
hanger, thread the spring onto it, hold the spring at the top end while you
poke the bottom end of the hanger into the hole where the spring goes then
let the spring slide down the coat hanger into place.  Use a small
screwdriver or another piece of coat hanger to push the spring securely into
its seat then withdraw the coat hanger.
