Subject: Snow Tires

Hello all!
  It just snowed here in Springfield, MO for the second time this year, and 
after making it home with flying colors through unplowed back roads with 
hills and curves, I feel like I need to give some public praise to my new 
(first winter anyway) BF Goodrich All-Terrain TA LT tires.  They rock on the 
snow!  There is nothing quite so satisfying as passing an SUV being towed 
out of a ditch.  I bought them because I had handling issues with the car 
tires that came with the bus, issues which they did not entirely solve.  My 
bus still feels like it has lots of "yaw" at highway speeds, and I suspect 
that it may be loose wheel bearings in the rear, as when you push and pull 
on the tops of the tires the wheels go "klunk, klunk".  The BF Goodrich 
tires also raise the bus up a bit, and noticeably increase the gearing, 
making long sustained hills a drag to ascend, often requiring a downshift 
the old tires did not require, but in the snow they are a dream.  Also, they 
look really, really cool.

Later!
Brian Zweerink
