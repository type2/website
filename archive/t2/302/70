Paul,

I have done it.  Didn't realize it *wasn't* there while I rebuilt the
engine.

I made a "guide/template" for mine out of 1/4" aluminum flat plate
and then set it up off of an old engine after I checked to make sure that 
the boss was still on the inside of the block half.

My biggest fear was drilling it crooked or drilling too deep since I 
couldn't put it in a drill press....mostly crooked though as it is a 
little hard to get to.

Go slow and careful and keep that drill straight!

Cheers, dave
