Subject: no start after lubing distrib. with WD40

The short version- the Bentley is in daughter's bus-with a no start 
problem, how do you check the distr points when in the car?)
Well, I fixed the major oil leaks an  got the manifold-upipe leak down 
to where it will pass inspection (the metal gasket did not seal well; I 
used the cut your own white stuff). Adjusted the hydraulics (they werte 
loose) and ran the engine- sounded perfect.  The I had to *#&%$%$ it up 
by checking the dwell (50deg) and timing- timing fine, but advance went 
only to about 30- and I know it should go to over 40!  So I remembered 
the time I had sluggish driving that this was the case (poor advance) 
and Jon pulled the distrib., sprayed WF40 in it to free the weights, and 
it ran fine.  I got the distributor out (noting the vac can was opposite 
the bale on the air breather) and checked the movement of the plate with 
a screwdriver-and knoecked out the little ball under the black wide "C"- 
got it back with forceps and needlenose pliers and all seemed freed up 
(the upper plate was sluggish to sucking on the vac outlet, but OK. 
Spray likely got on the points; I put a piece of paper towel between. 
Got it all back in-on starting it caught briefly, then put-put, stumble, 
die.  Figured I had to move the distr a bit- but from then on, Na-Da! 
 From the smell by the exhaust I know it's getting gas. Quit for the 
night as SO was not willing to leave TV to turn it over for me. So what 
likely happened?
