Subject: Re: [T2] Any difference between intake and exhaust pushrods?

Although all pushrods are the same for intake and exhaust *when new*, I
have heard that each has it's own minute "wear and tear" characteristics
over the course of many engine hours and vehicle miles.  When performing a
procedure such as yours, I tend to remove and lay them out in the order they
came out and reinstall them back to their original intake or exhaust
position on the engine.  I know this sounds a bit "fussy", but that's how I
was taught by my late father who serviced aircraft piston engines in the
Navy and built/rebuilt/serviced several VW engines while I was growing up
learning VWs.

Now if you haven't set them out in any particular order (ie: mixed up,) then
just put them back in (clean 'em up first, blow out any garbage through the
middle of the tube), setting the proper valve lash (gap).  It will probably
be OK.
