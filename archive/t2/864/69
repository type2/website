Well, unfortunately I'm not going to be able to make Everybus  afterall.  Dang, I was looking forward to it.  I've done a  lot of work on the Bopmobile to get her ready.  But I've had  trouble finding reliable help for my mother.  And the main  reason....Uncle Sam took a huge, unexpected bite out of my a** this  week!  So I'm going to keep working and try to make another camp  out somewhere this spring.  And I'll definitely plan on seeing you  all there next year.  Maybe I'll have the new paint job by  then.  Ya'll have fun.  Cheers...KR
