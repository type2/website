My purpose in using the WD40 was to loosen the plate (and maybe advance 
mechanism) as it hardly moved with suction.
This morning I checked the archives and found Jim Arnott's 
troubleshooting.  The coil was getting a poor ground and I cleaned that, 
as well as the connectors on it.  The resistance across 1 and 15 was OK.
It checked out (points open, voltage, points closed, no voltage), and I 
then taped the coil center lead close to ground and did the crank rotate 
until you heard the click of the points opening and there was a spark- 
so coil/points checked out!  Static timed it to 0 TDC to open on number 
one, put back cap, and voila- it runs!  Advance goes to 42 at least now.
Now about the non-working flasher......actually it flashes every 2 sec!
