WD-40 and Armor-All...Two things that should be at the bottom of your
toolbox...Yeah, they've got their uses, but despite the ads (and being on
the counter right at the register), they are not cure-alls...Liquid Wrench
and PB-Blaster are much better at freeing up lightly rusted fasteners...
But neither are lubricants...(BTW, hit a paint supply store and buy a quart
of VM&P Naptha...Main ingredient of WD-40... ;-)
