Ok,, since I have been beaten to ALL the punch lines on this thread....:-) 
I'll give you some info you might want to think about

retrofit),

You know,, imho you would be far better off to have a dash light than to 
worry about your main battery charge vs your Aux battery.

If you spin a belt,, that light will come in handy,,, if your charging 
system fails,, that light will come in handy,,, if your main battery 
fails..that light will come in handy,,,


Will said: I like the idea of  waiting until my main battery is full before 
I charge my aux:


Just as a test... You can place a voltmeter on your fuse panel and monitor 
it... everytime you start and drive you will know how low the main battery 
voltage drops.. and how fast the voltage rises to the threshold of that 
relay. I think it is 13.2 volts.
You will find it is pretty darn quick,  unless you have a weak MAIN 
battery,, and in that case you will never charge or seriously delay the 
charge to your Aux battery.  That is always fun to have a Aux battery to 
rely on and find out it is dead, and the beer is warm in the fridge.  ymmv

You will find that the taper charge of a lead acid battery is such that a 
relay like that is only necessary if you have a 5 amp charger... then your 
resources are such that you can NOT charge 2 batteries at once with any 
desirable effects. So it is effective to charge one battery , then the 
other,, to prioritize the resources to the main battery,, then to the aux 
battery
That is mentioned in the url you included.. it says,, if the current 
requirements are greater than the charging source can produce.
Imho, your alternator will supply enought to charge a good condition MAIN 
battery,,, and still have plently for the AUX ,, unless  your trying to pull 
over 500watts continuously


Will said: if the aux is really low it drains the main and/or blows the 
fuse.

 the fuse is not required in the hella relay kit for this circuit.  It will 
blow erroneously

If your Main battery is draining,, then you have forgotten to flip your 
manual switch to isolate, separate the circuits or you are drawing some huge 
amount of power from the batteries when they are connected together and/or 
your alternator is not up to specs

Will said: I installed a manual switch for the relay connecting the 
batteries (kept the long thin wire  for lower current draw).

 if you use the 1315 model, you will need to upgrade to a heavy wire enough 
to carry starter current if you plan to use the Aux start feature.
Imho,, if you carry booster cables,, you can jump start a dead MAIN battery 
from your AUX in the event you left an interior light on ,, or something 
that drained your MAIN battery but left your AUX fully charged...   this 
doesn't happen very often.. usually in this case ALL your batteries are 
dead!


You can still connect your relay to the same point your LIGHT is supposed to 
be connected to... and the relay will work as it should, automatically.

I don't know if this is getting a bit off topic adding an invertor to the 
discussion..
I thought, [think] xantrex has a product that isolates, charges 
inteligently, and adds an invertor to the works...

I had a discussion recently .... this might help

The C relay on my diagram isolates the batteries until after the Alternator 
is putting out
The M relay makes auto charging a nice feature.
Sometimes you need to drive short distances.. then park and visit an 
attraction,, discharging the aux battery
then drive a short distance,, to the next attraction, then hit the camp site 
where you can plug in.. and charge the aux battery.

Here is a diagram,, use at your own risk!
