Should have explained.  I'm getting ready to open a hobby store geared 
toward historical miniature gaming.  I'm not going to be able to continue 
working on the bus for several years, maybe more until the money stabilizes.

I actually had someone seriously offer me $3000.00 for the bus, but I didn't 
know that someone was going to give us a 1995 Chevy Astro the very next day. 
And I didn't get the guy's name... :O(
