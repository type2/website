Yes the spokes of the wheel should point to 9 o'clock and 3 o'clock.
HOWEVER if somebody has screwed around with the steering at some point,
the steering shaft might be twisted this way or that while the wheel is
straight. You've got to pop the horn button off and look for the chisel
mark on the steering shaft. Get that straight. Get the steering box
straight (arm in the middle). Remember that some previous person could
have had the steering column apart at the rubber coupler (look at the
floor level and remove the trim plate. They could have reconnected the
streering column here at the wrong place (180 degs out).

So get the box at the right place, get the column connected so the
chisel mark is at the top (simple reference so it is NOT that
important), remove the steering wheel and straighten it, disconnect the
drag link, get the wheels pointing straight ahead and aligned and then
reconnect the drag link.

Tie rods sort out whether the wheels are pointing at the same angle
(straight), and the drag link is going to ensure that the steering box
is straight when the wheels are straight. You may have to adjust the
steering wheel angle to get it right after everything else is straight.

However all of this is pointless if your ball joints or tie rod ends or
steering box is worn out. Check all as you go along.

As for the tires, Muir wrote that book when? Tires have come a long way.
We've got radial tires, they had bias ply in some cases which we
definitely different animlas requiring different care.

I tried to keep things in easy layman's terms. If the Bentley manual
doesn't make sense, post an exerpt and we'll translate for you. Include
page number and/or picture numbers.

See ya!
