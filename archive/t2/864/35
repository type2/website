 Can you clarify ,, does the dash lamp actually
 control the excitation?

Not sure what you are asking. From the link you
suplied
above:

"The VR operates in 3 stages. The first stage (key on)
initiates when the ignition key is turned to the on
position but before the engine is started (alternator
off). Power from the ignition switch flows through the
warning lamp and through the rotor field winding in
order to excite the alternator."
