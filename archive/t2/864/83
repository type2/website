Take off the dist cap and turn the engine over with a wrench. See if the
points are opening and closing or if they're stuck. Set the points to (is it
.016? I forget...)

WD-40 in a distributor? That will remove whatever lubrication the weights
and the points plate may have had. You might be needing to tear the
distributor down and put some grease on everything that moves.
