Subject: Re: [T2] Body panel adhesive - question

If  the body panel adhesive won't handle the estimated temps you came up
with---spot weld the panels in.

Why take the chance of having them fall off?

You kinda answered your own question.

If you can't afford the welder--take the vehicle to a body shop and have
them spot them in.

It'll be a bunch cheaper than buying the welder anyway.
