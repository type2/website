Subject: [T2] Performance cam and lifters (revisited)

I have been off the list for a bit and wanted to track down somebody that
said they had a new Web Cam that they were willing to part with...
If it was you, will you please contact me?
I took the engine apart and the cam has a little wear, but nothing major..
I still might just replace it....
Thank you..
