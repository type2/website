Hi
Just thought I would let the group know what I did to
replace the seal.
After mucho searching around I was pointed to
a body shop supply place.
$2.20 cents (Canadian $) a foot. It's the same stuff as
CIP and those sell. I didn't need to replace the across piece
so left the original. The seal is great. Probably a little better
than the original. On the front luggage rack (74') I used the
same and trimmed the 'bulb' back a little while keeping
the trim to the end. Water can drain great.
After all was said and done $70.00 which included all
taxes and stuff in that Canadian. Which is like.. $40-50 US?

Time and labor? 30 minutes.
It looks really nice.
It's the same stuff as this (link)
