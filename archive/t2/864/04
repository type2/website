I've got a carburator problem right now.  It got to where it idled  too high.  The spring wasn't pulling the throttle all the way down  at idle.  I put a new spring on it but the tension has to be so  strong that the pedal is hard to hold down.  I have to get that  fixed if I'm going to make Everybus.  I've sprayed the mechanism  with PB Blaster but to no avail.  Thanks for the tip, I'll check  that out.  Cheers...KR

hey kevin  It has been my experience that the dieseling has been cause  by 
the throotle not being all the way closed at the idle postion. Make sure your  
throttle cable isn't too tight and thaT the butterfly is all the way  closed
