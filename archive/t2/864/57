The two metals are engine tin that I am fabricating to seal the VW to
the Corvair implant. I figure they will see engine temps if I turn the
engine off after getting off the highway for example. Also they will be
getting the full engine vibration.

I may have to pop-rivet and weld elsewhere, or try to get my little
welder to go...

Thanks.

Chris
