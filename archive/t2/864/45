Subject: Re: failure notice

Has anyone used any Permatex products? I am a horrible welder and would
really like a solution that works like welding, but is easier. Can this
stuff be painted? Does it rust? Will it seal rusted areas? Is the strength
of the bond as good as a weld? Could you do something similar to a tack weld
with this stuff for use with rocker panels?

Thanks,
Brandon
