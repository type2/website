I've been thinking about making a short fitting that is M10 male on  
one end and M10 female with flats on the other so the oil pressure  
sender can simply stand off rather than require a long hose to  
relocate it elsewhere. The fitting would be the same size of the hole  
in the oil pressure sender grommet to the tin would remain sealed.

Does anyone think vibration will be an issue? I just want to raise  
the sender just enough so it can be tightened easily.
