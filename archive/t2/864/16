Thanks,

I usually do it that way to, but I wasn't thinking.  You're right.  The end
that's in the cam follower would wear to that cam follower.  Same on the
rocker arm end.  I'm sure the rods would be "happier" going back from where
they came.  But if they're all the same it shouldn't make a huge difference.

Thanks again.

  Although all pushrods are the same for intake and exhaust *when new*, I have
heard that each has it's own minute "wear and tear" characteristics over the
course of many engine hours and vehicle miles.  When performing a procedure
such as yours, I tend to remove and lay them out in the order they came out
and reinstall them back to their original intake or exhaust position on the
engine.  I know this sounds a bit "fussy", but that's how I was taught by my
late father who serviced aircraft piston engines in the Navy and
built/rebuilt/serviced several VW engines while I was growing up learning VWs.

  Now if you haven't set them out in any particular order (ie: mixed up,) then
just put them back in (clean 'em up first, blow out any garbage through the
middle of the tube), setting the proper valve lash (gap).  It will probably be
OK.
