Subject: Outside the Bus Table Bracket

Hello again all,

Just wanted to let everyone know, we are now manufacturing these
brackets. 
If you would like to order one, they are $29.95 plus shipping. 
You will get a bracket, a foot piece, and 2 adjusting knobs. 

They are ready to ship, so just let me know if you are interested!

Bracket - note the angle - this part goes into the jack point. There is
also a 'foot' piece for added stability.
