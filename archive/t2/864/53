<#1. Sitting on the front wheel.  That's an odd feeling at first. 
Though it's nice to stop at a stopsign and be able to *see* down the
road without half your hood hanging out.>

Ha! Ha! I love the first time I take people rides in a baywindow. I stop
right close to a car at the stop light and their reflex is to quickly
climb backwards over the back of the front seat... It's like taking the
urge to press the brake pedal from the passenger side and multiplying
it!!! <griN!> The other treat is the excessive body roll . They think
rollover and I'm thinking - bah, it;s got a good extra 10 mph more in
it... Don't test that one too much though....

Welcome to the group! It's a fun group with alot of knowledge.
