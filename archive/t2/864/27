Subject: Body panel adhesive - question

My Corvair transplant project awaits a few more cooling tin pieces. I
have ignored this project for months now for lack of a decent MIG. I
have considered using some of the body panel adhesives but the brands I
have investigated had temp limits of 250F.

I have a MIG picked out but the budget just isn't there yet...

Anyone know of a high temp solution? I figure it's got to standup to
400F reliably.

Since this is not structural panels I would like to try using the
adhesives for the first time.

Thanks!

Chris
