Subject: Re: [T2] no start after lubing distrib. with WD40

<<WD-40 in a distributor? That will remove whatever lubrication the
weights and the points plate may have had.>>

What???

Where did you come up with this off the wall theory Don???

NOPE----

WD-40 sprayed inside the distributor, and on the inside of the bottom of
the cap will do nothing more than displace any moisture that may have
been in that distributor--and keep it water proof.


He's got some other problems besides the WD-40 being on them points.
