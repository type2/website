Subject: Re: [T2] 3rd wire on left goes where?

Thanks Karl- your are right; I rechecked all for inspection and sure 
enough, backups did not work.  It appears I acc yanked the wire out of 
its in holder when the spare battery was pulled.  BTW flasher is very 
slugfgish and checking/cleaning contacts inside did not help. It's 3 
prongs; is this a generic item from VWE/Audi?flaps or must i get a rush 
from Bus Depot (we are leaving for Everybus Wed).
