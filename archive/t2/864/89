Subject: Re: [T2] Temperature in Heater Tube

<<The reason I want to know is that I may use POR-15 to preserve the
inside of the tube before I install it. I have written the POR-15
company to ask about out gassing and the temperature limits of their
product.>>

I'd think od another solution rather than coating the inside of that
tube with POR-15.
The heat off the engine at the back side of the tube amy cause it to be
passing gas up into the interior of the Bus.


You'd more than likely wish you'd coated it in Bean-O 

I don't know at what temp the POR  product goes into nuclear
meltdown--but I'm pretty sure it isn't a heat proof product.

Coat the outside with the POR stuff if ya want--no gassing of you or the
passenger's would be a certainty.
