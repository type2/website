Do not let him "heat" anything up... He's going to ruin something he
apparently doesn't understand.

What you are going to have to do is prob do the alignment and all the
adjustments yourself to get it "close". We typically have to do this on
all our street rods before we get an actual alignment.

You can do most of the alignment stuff with yard sticks and an angle
gauge (Sears or one of the hardware stores).

What you are going to have to do is disconnect the steering box from the
tie rods and find center again.

Typically there is a mark on the top of the steering shaft that
indicates center. Put that mark at 12 o'clock. You should have the same
number of turns to lock to the left and the same number of turns to the
right.

Also I will tkae a leap here and say that the tie rods prob screw into
the drag links approximately the same number of turns.

Find some sort "basic" middleground and then set the caster, camber, and
toe.

When you get it right it should be only slightly off adjustment. We've
done cars this way and got it right causing no long term tire wear using
only measuring tools. Muir had a good explaination for a link pin / king
pin front suspension. Don't know if they updated the procedure any for
the ball joint front suspensions.

You'll need a helper for a few steps but not all.

Stay away from that guy. His ignorance over rides his ability to say "I
screwed up".

The only problem I see is that you need to look careful for bent
suspension parts.
