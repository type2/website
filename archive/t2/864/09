Subject: [T2] Brew Bus website and T shirts..

Get ready for summer and the 2nd Annual Brew Bus - Volkswagen Campout and Brew
Fest....
If you dont know what it is,
here is the website address....

www.brewbus.net

Here are the designs for the T shirt....
We will get better pricing if we order more,
so if you know you want one then please pre-order...
The cost stands at $15 at this size order, could do down with a larger
order...
We can get girls shirts and XXL shirts, but they will be a dollar or 2
more....
