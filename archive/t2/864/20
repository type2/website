 I have a Hella relay kit currently, no pun intended. Since I have no alt 
 idiot light (motorola beetle alternator retrofit), I installed a manual 
 switch for the relay connecting the batteries (kept the long thin wire 
 for lower current draw).  However, if the aux is really low it drains 
 the main and/or blows the fuse.
 
 Comments welcome.

Why do you NOT have an idiot light?

How do you trigger the alternator to put out?

The light circuit energizes the internal regulator......
