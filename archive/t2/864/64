Subject: Oil pressure sender relocation kit

The VDO kit is NLA. I searched forever and found only one (germansupply
still had one on the shlf). However, there is a better alternative:

T-4 Oil Pressure Sending Unit Relocation Kit
Price: $ 24.95
Part #: LGU0018
From aircooled.net.

I have this on my camper and it works fine. Chances are  that it will
outlast the VDO kit since it uses s/s hose instead of rubber. The VDO kit
included a bracket, the aircooled.net one does not. But a hose clamp works
just fine. First, I had mounted the sender on top of my coil. Now that I am
running Vanagon electronic ignition and have relocated the coil to the side
of the spare wheel well, the sender is mounted in place of the coil. Hose is
just long enough for this mounting position.

Years ago on the list, someone said that VDO made a key that fit the shape
of the top of the oil pressure sender. I've been looking for one every since
but each time I ask no one has ever heard it. I've even been through old VDO
catalogs from the 80s. Jim?
