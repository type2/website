Subject: Now VW cult members

Hi All,

Today my wife and I joined the air cooled VW cult.  I currently hold 
membership in both the water cooled ('81 pickup, yay!) and our newest 
addition, a '77 bay bus. 

The bus is in great shape.  Most of the rust was addressed by the 
previous owner, and while the body work and paint job aren't top notch, 
they're still nice.  The interior is nice, seats recovered in the last 
few years.  Yup, it needs body work, and some mechanical, but nothing I 
can't handle.

The bus (as yet un-named) needs CV boots, a thorough engine cleaning, 
valves checked/adjusted, a front end alignment, tires, and some other 
odd and end things done.  I'm sure that list will grow, and I'm glad 
I've budgeted money towards parts and repairs. 

Things to get used to
#1. Sitting on the front wheel.  That's an odd feeling at first.  Though 
it's nice to stop at a stopsign and be able to *see* down the road 
without half your hood hanging out. 
#2. Rear wheel drive.  I've driven front wheel drive for the last 10 
years.  Yup, there's a big difference. 
#3. Size.  The bus is *BIG!*  It's longer than my truck, our '03 Mini 
Cooper would almost fit inside of it.  Sorta nice to sit up so high, 
though. 
#4. Space.  This thing has room to stretch out.  Mostly stretching out 
for the shift lever.  Damn that thing is a long way off. 
#5.  Working on it.  I'm a decent mechanic, but I'm new to air cooled.
#6. The attention. Wondered if my fly was unzipped or something.  
Everybody kept checking out the bus in traffic and at the stop lights.  
And here I am, without a tag on it (but a sales reciept!)

I can see how easy it is to fall in love with these things.  Engine 
waaaay in the back, so not much engine noise.  No obstructions to your 
view, sitting up high, jammin' out to the radio. 

Oh yeah, I think we're hooked.
