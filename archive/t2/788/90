Subject: Changing out the Wiper Motor in a '79 with AC

Hello, Volks:

Thanks for all the knowledge imparted on this list.  Really enjoy
reading it everyday.

I have been all over the archives, looked in the library, checked out
Bartnik and Ratwell.  Can't find any procedure on how to get to the
windshield wiper motor in a '79 Westy with factory air.

I did see one post somewhere where it was advising to sit in the
driver's seat, raise your legs and push out windshield with the
bottoms of your feet.

Anybody ever replace the wiper motor in a '79 with factory air?  Do
you have to remove the blowers?
