Subject: Re: [T2] California/ federal vanagon hybrid??

You have a basket case. It may have started life as a Calif version but it is not now. If you have points, you
no longer have a Cal version..
Do you have a single or dual vacuum unit on the distributor?
Single means it times at 7.5 before.

If it had a dual unit [Cal electronic] then it would time at 5 after AT IDLE with vacuum CONNECTED AND
WORKING. You CANNOT static time a dual vacuum unit dist to 5 after. You would need to subtract the vacuum
retard and time it at 7.5 before.

I cannot believe the guy you went to calls himself a mechanic when he does this:  "(5ATDC, statically timed,
is also
where the mechanic appeared to have left it before I swapped the rings;
I had no need to loosen the distributor for that)".
This yahoo does not understand basic timing and vacuum advance.
Are you sure the sign over his shop does not say "2 weeks ago I could not even spell Mekanic and now I are
one".

NOx is controlled a lttle by EGR, but Cal versions do not have EGR, They have O2 sensor and cat. You need to
replace your catalytic converter.

I am a little puzzled when you say the EGR fittings are capped. " but the filter itself is not there and the
connection points have plates sealing them...)"
You should not have any! Maybe someone put a Fed engine in it?
Does your exhaust look like this Cal pic?:
