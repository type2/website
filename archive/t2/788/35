From the sound of things you are close on the mixture,
as for the head temp I can only tell you what I have
heard and how mine runs. I have heard that over 450F
that damage is being done to the head. Mine runs
between 280-300F coasting down hill to 400-430F
climbing the hills, constant at 60MPH 350-380F, and
that's my two cents worth. So it looks like anything
below 450F is good.. Phil
