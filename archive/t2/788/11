Subject: Transmission - interchangable years?

I just recently purchased a 74' westy and I would like to install a 2.0 from 
a 78 sunroof bus I have.  I was woundering if the transmission are 
interchangable or do I have to change that as well??  I believe the 74 had a 1700cc 
originally and the PO installed a 1600cc that is now out of the bus.....
Please let me know know if the tranny will work..

Thanks in advance,
Mike Q
