Subject: Engine Drops and Dirty Cylinders

<Kosh> So it begins... </Kosh>

Got to Troy's around 2pm. Then we headed out to pick up an ATV jack (shut up
back there! Just because YOU like dropping an engine on your fingers doesn't
mean we want to!)

We both started working on our respective busses, he battling FI (since his
exhaust system was already off) and me going after rusty exhaust nuts.
Obviously, his came down first.

The drop itself was simple. Prolly 20 minutes total of us going around and
double checking everything was disconnected and clearing. (Note to self:
Remove fan screen BEFORE dropping engine.) Once his engine was out I went
back to the GWB so he could work on the intakes and getting the tinwork free
of the head.

Then it happened.

We pulled his right (1&2) head off. Me: "What's all this black gunk? And why
are the cylidners full of oil?" Him: "!!!!!....."

(Note the liquid on the ground is water from me giving the valves a water
test. No Windex was handy... LOL)

My first comment was the rings were shot. The more I look and the more I
think about it, it seems it's pretty obviously rings. The valves are
seating, the intake ports are clean. The heads are new, apparently. New
castings, not rebuilt.

We didn't pull the other head off to see if the same issue was happening
there. Troy said he hadn't noticed any smoking or oil consumption before
parking the bus to redo the exhaust.

What do ya'll think?
