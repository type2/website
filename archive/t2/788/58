Subject: New poptops?

Are there any companies making new fiberglass pop-tops?

I have a '76, with the luggage rack in the front.  The canvas needs 
replacing, the hardware is rusty, and the fiberglass is cracking around 
the luggage rack, so I figured I should look into replacing it outright. 
  Any searches I do turn up links for new canvas, but I can't find links 
to new fiberglass & hardware.  Anyone know?

Thank you,
-Charles
