Subject: front seat discomfort

The time has come for me to finally do something about my front seats.  I
think the springs are pretty shot, so I don't know if replacing the pads
is the way to go or not.  What options are there for replacing them
altogether?  Are the springs likely OK and the pads the issue?  What have
others done in similar situations?
