$170 and it doesn't even work on 6 V?  What kind of deal is that?

I am now pondering making one of these with the finest in 1964
technology.  The display would be a few alphanumeric Nixie tubes at the
license plate.  The ~200 V DC would be generated by a vibrator and a
transformer, like an old tube-type car radio.  Storing the program is
the trick.  Somewhere in the Bus, a stack of poker chips on a common
shaft, with notches cut into the edges to run the microswitches.  A
little motor to turn the shaft.  Programming is done by installing
different poker chips.  If you could get small-signal semiconductor
diodes in '64, another way would be to have just one poker chip with
one notch and several switches around it.  Or, drive the timing poker
chip off of the speedometer cable, so the message scrolls faster as
you go faster.  Each switch would select a row in a matrix of diodes;
the columns would be the outputs to the Nixies.  You would snip or
solder a diode as needed to light up certain segments.  Maybe an
endless loop of Teletype punched paper tape and a reader?
