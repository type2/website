That holds up the bottom part of the bench so you have both hands free
to get to your storage area.

this pic is of under the rear seat on the passenger (right) side of the 
bus. what the heck is that lever/latch that i'm holding used for? It 
clanks around when i take turns or hit bumps. you can see where its worn

the paint. And... what is that little white knob there for?

this is a '74 westfaila with the stove, sink and refrigerator.
