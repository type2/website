Subject: [T2] Towing 69 Bay sans engine

T2 List friends,
                 I have a 69 Bay, original throughout.  Thinking about pulling 
the engine before towing the vehicle 400 miles.  In the splitty Type 2, the 
trans bellhousing end was supported by a cross member.  But in the Bays 
(correct me if I'm wrong) the rear of the ENGINE is supported on a transverse 
hanger.  So Im going to need to fabricate some kind of support to keep the 
trans in a 'normal' position... right?

Next I would change oil in the trans and rig-up lights and towbar... what else 
do I need to think about?  Thanx, Glenn
