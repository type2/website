Subject: Shift rod extension

Volks,

Anyone have an easy fix for a 69 Westy shift rod to make it longer?

I do not have simian arms, and since I drive with the seat pushed all 
the way back, I have to sort of lean forward every time I shift.

There must be something that can be screwed on...where the shift knob 
currently is.

Thoughts?

Thanks!
Anton
