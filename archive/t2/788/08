Subject: rusted pipe .. can i still drive? 

Hey guys
The connection between the muffler and the heater boxes rusted.
(The join) and thus is open to the air and lets a mighty roar
out when driving.
Will the lack of back pressure back into the motor
there hurt the motor?
Just using for short drives at the moment around town.
(Yah it's not entering the muffler at all)

Comments?
James
