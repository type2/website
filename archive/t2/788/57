Subject: Re: [T2] front seat discomfort

Mighty comfy choice and much easier than repairing the old seat (unless
you want to preserve the vintage-ness of your bus).


Only downside is that if you are tall (like me, 6'4") the Vanagon seat will
raise you up an inch or so. I can live with it because of the increase in
comfort.   Jeff
