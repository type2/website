In any case, I noticed that under my
block, there seems to be this huge bolt holding up a round disc object. Is
that where my strainer is, and do I need to clean that out every so often?
(Even if I've got an external filter?)

That sounds like where your strainer is hiding. I clean it at every oil change.

And real dumb question here, is it possible that the Bus
can run TOO cool?

Yes. The stock design has a thermostat that operates a set of flaps to 
restrict air flow when the engine is cold so as to rapidly bring it up to 
operating temperature. You get more wear when the engine is cold and it 
runs less efficiently. That said (donning flame suit) given where you live 
it would be much less of an issue than in colder locations. The only thing 
I'd add is that the extra cooler should have a thermostat so as oil only 
passes through it when the oil is hot.
