Subject: Exhaust System 76 Bus

Most of us will admit the the design on the later bus exhaust systems 
leaves much to be desired.  I think the system on my bus includes four 
180 degree bends and two 90 degree bends.  If it is anything it is an 
example of how to design an exhaust system to rob as much power as 
possible from the engine.

Since I need to repair my system anyway I'm wondering if others members 
have improved the stock system with a custom exhaust system. If you have 
picks I can take to the muffler shop that would be great.  I do not 
use/need heater boxes since I have a flame throwing BN4 installed.

Thanks Everyone
