Why put them in the doors at all? They sound much better if you remove 
your front kick panels and mount them in  either 1. each outboard lower 
corner- beef up the kick panels and put fiberglass behind, or use wood 
paneling as I did.  Easier to do than 2. but easy to block with stuff 
down low.  2. My daughter's 75 uses 6" round triple core speakers 
mounted to the side of each heat vent; best sound, nicely centered and 
easy place to add batting but you must move the washer tank; we heated 
it in an oven and squished it narrower and put it in lower right corner-
