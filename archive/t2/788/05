   There's an aftermarket shift extension that I've had for many years...
chrome and bent to both heighten and bring the shifter further back.
It's tapped to screw onto the shifter rod (with a lock nut) and the other
end is threaded to accept the original shift knob...Or, you could do like
I did and tap a glass and brass door knob (after someone stole my or-
riginal Shlitz bar tap... ;-(
