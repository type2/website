Subject: New Dakota Digital CHT Gauge Installed - Temp & Mixture

Well, I finally installed my new Dakota Digital CHT gauge and boy am I happy
that I now have some ideal how the engine is running  heat wise.   Well,
sort of at least the gauge works great, but Im not sure what readings I
should be expecting at different speeds and what temp reading would I wait
for to consider that the motor is warmed up.   Ive search the archives in
an attempt to get a consensus of what I should expect of the readings I
think I remember a posting this summer with the info I need now, but I just
cant find it.



Two more questions



Is there a rev limiter on 79 FI motors?



Based on my color of my spark plugs (they are somewhere between grey and the
color of Nestlis Quick Chocolate powder the color Ive always gone by for
a good mixture) - I think Im running a little lean.  If my CHT does not get
too high, should I be concerned about running a little lean?



TIA,



Wayne
