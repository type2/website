It's always a shame when I see a rare or classic looking car sitting neglected.

That's why places like eBay are such great places. It provides a means for people to sell these Busses (and other classics) for cheap where it might otherwise just end up in the yard.

I guarantee the owner of that Bus, even if he doesn't have a title, could end up getting $300 at minimum from that Bus. If it's totally complete and he has a title, I don't see why he couldn't get $700.


There should be a Bus resting place in Arizona or one of the dry states where junk busses go until someone has the means to restore them.


There's a place called "Pontiac Heaven" (www.pontiacheaven.com) where the owner buys, or rescues PRE-1981 Pontiacs. This guy owns 50 some odd acres of land of flat desert with something like over 400 pre 1981 RWD Pontiacs.

Everything from GTOs, to Catalinas, to TransAms, to Bonnevilles.
