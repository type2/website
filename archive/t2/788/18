Some of it depends on whether the Vanagon was a California or Federal
model; there were some differences between the two.  California used 
an O2 sensor, electronic ignition and no resistor pack, Federal had no 
O2, and still had points and the resistor pack.  This is just off the top of
my head.

IIRC, the injectors, cold-start valve, double relay, aux air regulator, thermotime
switch and headtemp sensors will probably interchange.  ECU and AFM are 
probably different (definately different if it's a California model).  Fuel pump and
fuel pressure regulator are interchangable, as well as all the "hard parts" like 
the intake runners and plenum.

Don't take this list as "gospel truth" as it's entirely off the top of my head and
my memory could be rusty..
