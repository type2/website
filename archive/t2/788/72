Stock carbs? Make sure you have your brake booster lines sealed very tight
or blocked off at the intakes, make sure the balance tube is sealed tight at
all 3 points, use the dashpot to open the throttle some so you can get to
the back of the bus. ;)

Also, try using a remote starter. That way you can be at the engine while
cranking it over.
