Subject: W7CC plugs vs W8CC in 75 bus?

After 15K of fine driving on a rebuild in her 1800cc FI 75, we pulled 
the plugs to check them and found W7CC plugs installed by the builder. 
  The plugs show unworn side electrodes and slightly rounded center 
electrode which I could have filed flat.  There is a brownish tan 
appearance to the ceramic and a bit of peelable carbon on the plug flat 
facing the piston, but I think it was used for local driving before 
being pulled.   I replaced them with what BusDepot sent, W8CC.  What is 
the diff in the heat ranges?
