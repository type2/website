Subject: 6x9'' speakers in front doors

Did anyone succeed in installing 6x9 inch speakers in the lower part of the
front door without cutting the door ?
I'm asking for a 1971. Don't know if doors change across baywindow time.
More generally, where did you put the speakers in your bus ? I found that
6x9 sound way better than 6.5 inch speakers.
thanks
