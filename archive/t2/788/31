Subject: Re: [T2] finally picking up my engine from Boston Bob

hey Guys    This shows why I only do turn key motors.   It has been proven to 
me that the biggest problem is normally the guys putting the motors the rest 
of the way together and installing them and doing so half ass. . By doing them 
turn key if there is a problem I take care of it then . As for warrenties it 
is a lot like insurance companies  they always find something to blame so that 
they dont pay. Boston Bob usually does a real good job, but he is only human 
so there will be mistakes.   As for the thread on the Samba it is the same 
Bullsh*t talkers  talking out their as*  .  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
