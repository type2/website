Subject: Re: [T2] heater box replacements available?

I'll bet your box is rusted out but the pipes within are not. Just peel that box off and keep going. I'll bet you could melt the aluminum heat sink off too with a torch or a trip to your local tech school which has a foundry. They'd prob love to have the aluminum.
