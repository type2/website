I consider 300F to be warmed up. Simply idling the engine in the driveway it
may never get to that temperature and perhaps top off at 280F.

Once I'm driving around I find the temperature to be 300-310F at stop lights,
300-330F in the city and 340F-400F on the highway. As I attempt to go faster
than 65mph, the temps go over 400F and increase the faster I go. I chose to
set the annuciator on the DD gauge to 410-420F but that's only applicably for
my bus...

One thing I noticed recently is that the nominal idling CHT can vary from bus
to bus. For example the bus I tuned up for smog a week ago ran 30F hotter at
idle so naturally the other temperatures are 30F higher.
