Subject: Engine Drops and Dirty Cylinders | Day 2

In short, Don's bus is pretty much back in order.  Just needs the headers
put back on.  Mine, took the other head off.  Same situation as the others.
Swapping P&C's with those I know the history of.  Need to pick up the tool
to compress the rings when installing the cylinders.

Please comment on the pics of my bottom end if you have a chance.  I'm not
exactly sure how things should look in there :(

Thanks,
