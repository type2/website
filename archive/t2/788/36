Subject: Won't stay started

Hi

I am on the last lap of the major rebuild.  The recon engine with the 
rebuilt carbs started, then stopped before I could walk around the bus.  
It has run once for longer (but not much longer), valve timing, point, 
plugs timing all OK. New fuel pump, fuel, new lines, new wiring to carbs.

I have now replaced the plugs and point - it wont start at all.  I am 
going to gap the points again and check the timing but where should I go 
from  there as I cant keep it going long enough to use a timing light on 
balance the carbs?

Its a 1974 1800 twin Carb model.

thanks
John
