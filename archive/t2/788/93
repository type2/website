Federal Vanagons were also fuel injected, so that doesn't mean anything, in
and of itself.

What makes a California Vanagon different from Federal?  Different ECU,
different AFM, different throttle body, different wiring harness, no
external resistor pack, Hall effect distributor and associated parts (ICU
and idle stabilizer), probably different decel valve (not too important),
different adjustment to EGR - both Federal and California had 'em - (and,
maybe, different EGR valve), different exhaust setup, O2 sensor on Cal, and
probably some differences I've forgotten.  You need to list out part numbers
for everything to see which way the majority of this stuff is going.

The conventional wisdom is that you time to the distributor you have.
Determine that and you'll have your answer.

It had one.

You don't say where you're located, and under what jurisdiction you need to
pass smog.  Most smog guys aren't going to know the differences between
Federal and California, but typically there's a visual inspection involved
(in California) that could trip you up, e.g., O2 sensor installed? (Calif),
EGR in place? (Calif and Fed), catalytic converter installed? (Calif and
Fed), timing to spec? (Calif and Fed), and so forth.  If all you have to do
is pass some hurdles, irrespective of what *should* be there, then I'd say
time it to the distributor, install a new catalytic converter, and forget
about the EGR system which is damned hard to come by.
