Hi Neal,

Do you have a 76 camper, or are you trying to put a swivel seat into  
a bus that doesn't already have one?

I have a swivel section in my parts stash, but it will only fit in a  
bus that already has the swivel base welded in at the Westfalia  
factory. I had to pillage that part from a wrecking yard in order to  
install a swivel seat into the westfakia.
