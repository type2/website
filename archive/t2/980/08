Subject: Re: [T2] RELIABLE kit source for conversion of '71 to LPG?

Hi Tank,

I figure it's your bus, you do what you want with it, as long as it's  
not going to harm anyone else on the road....

I would suggest you talk to Bob at BostonEngine.com. Bob does work on  
VW industrial engines used in Zambonis which are propane powered, and  
will be more likely than most to know where to look. I doubt that  
there's a "kit" readily available, but I'd be plenty happy to be  
proven wrong about that.

 From what Bob has told me in personal conversation, propane runs  
hotter than gasoline; so I expect it may not be a popular conversion  
for air-cooled application.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
