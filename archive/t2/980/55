Right. If you were seeing red in the daylight, then fuel combusting is not contained to the combustion chamber.

From my own measurements, under normal running conditions, the pipes are:

- 700F as where the head meets the exhaust pipe
- 500F on the way to the heaterbox through the afterburner pipe (75-78)
- 300F at the muffler

I'm sure it's making the exhaust hotter at least.

Heater Boxes are 140F at the muffler end and 190F at the exit which shows off the insulating properties of the HE.
