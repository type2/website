Subject: RE: [T2] Blaupunkt radio polarity

Rich,

Your radio is a 12 volt negative ground one.  How can I be so sure?  It
says +12V on the black blob just above the spade lug!

Now how about the ground... that's a little harder, as the wires in the
lower part of the pix are partly hidden.  As it is a monophonic radio, at
least one of those two blurry wires is likely to be a wire for the speaker.
The other could be a ground wire or the wire for the antenna connection,
I'd have to see the ends of the wires to be sure.  Can you take a pix
showing the entire rear side of the radio?  That'd help a lot. Then I can
get a lot more specific. 

Thanks,
