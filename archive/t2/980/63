Subject: four blown valve seats

HELP

Some how my 69 Bus blow all four valve seats.? I understand the intake blowing from excessive heat, but the exhaust valves were the worst.? Any ideas why?? This is the second time I have had to replace a head on that same side.? 

Do you think is just bad luck in parts, or a TIP (technician induced problem), or something else?

PLEASE HELP,

Brian
