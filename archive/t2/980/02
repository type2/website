Info on the 14x 1.5 sensor install.


I recently installed that sender on the taco plate of my 80 westy. I
drilled a hole on the plate center between the divot in the middle and
the side closet to the front of the van. I then welded a gland nut on
the inside of the plate for the sensor to thread into. I then retapped
the nut. I used a new o ring and it went in just fine. Working great and
no leaks
