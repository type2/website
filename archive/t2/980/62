Subject: Steering Pivot Pin Replacement

Duroc and I played with my bus a month or so ago and determined that my
pivot pin is shot. He also suggested that I check out some guys here called
"Trail Blazers" to have the pin replaced. Apparently I am looking at a bitch
of a job.

Where do I get one from and does the Bentley go over how to do it? I don't
think I have the cash to have it done, but when the wind hits my bus right
now, it blows all over the road. Even with the new KYB shocks and the
Hankooks, it's still like driving a parachute across a small hurricane.

I want my bus to be stable from side to side.
