It's fuel or ignition. Using a timing light on each plug wire, do you get
nice, even-spaced flashes that speed up as you rev or does it fire
erratically? I had the same symptoms when I was having ignition problems
(crummy electronic points module) and you could see the missing sparks
because the timing light would randomly not light up.
