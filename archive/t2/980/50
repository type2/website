Subject: torque on oil pressure switch FI

Any numbers suggested for the torque on te oil pressure switch on a FI
2.0engine>??

Bentley doesn't mention, and Richard says "1.11 Removing Oil Pressure
Switch:

You need a 24mm deep socket to remove the oil pressure switch on the Type 4
engine is the tin is in place. There is no torque spec on this part so do
not overtighten it and strip the threads in the case."

Is there s gasket between the oil pressure switch and the case??

Thanks
