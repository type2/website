Bob, I have two experiences with FI that I would like to share:

(1) Andrew Stevens has a '77 or '78 and he got some FIs back from a
rebuilder we all know.

The rebuilder said that one of his FIs had a 'broken pintle' and he returned
all four - three cleaned and matched and the fourth with the broken pintle.
Andrew ordered a replacement FI from BD, and put four in.

Well, with TWO people checking, Andrew went to the extreme of visually
CHECKING the actual flow and output of the FI's and one of the three which
were returned as good was actually NOT SQUIRTING.  We swapped the injector
connections on that side, and it was the FI, not the wiring.

Andrew put the FI with the broken pintle in place of the inoperative but
certified good FI and it worked!!  It worked as well as the other FI on the
rail!!!

I suggested to Andrew that he return the FI to the rebuilder, and we went on
to look at Andrews brakes - - -

(2) Years before Andrew's experience, I was bringing a '76 back to life
after a 8 year stint in a closed, heated garage (PO's)  My first test run
got it going up to 35 mph, and then I started pulling ignition wires.  It
was running on only 2 cylinders.  Fantastic compression, though!!

Quite a while before I determined it was the FIs.  Swapping the FIs with
known good ones, and moving wires around and FINALLY I got a good match on
all four.  Different FIs was not the answer, and the FI connections didn't
seem to be the answer, but finally something matched and I was good to go.
(Of course, all lines were replaced by Dolan, and we put in a proven fuel
pump and new fuel filter.  I put on a Sears H2O gauge on the system just to
prove out the fuel pressure)

Good luck.  You DO need another set of eyes....
