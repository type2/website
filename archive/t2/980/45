Subject: Re: [T2] Heater Box Header Pipes

Hi Jeff,

If the exhaust is leaking at the head, then the O2 being sucked into  
the exhaust might be creating a secondary combustion in the pipe and  
that's where the heat is coming from.

According to this page:
http://www.sizes.com/materls/colors_of_heated_metals.htm

cherry red, visible at night may be as low as 800F. Not impossible  
for header pipes.

Happy Trails,
