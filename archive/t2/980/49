went out and went over every wire with a fine toooth comb, could find
nothing, but still did the "Wiggle tesT"   took the VW Fuel injection
trouble shooting manual and followed it by the numbers. and got down to
"control unit deffective"  OK  in all my years with VW's I have never seen
one go bad, but doesn't mean it can't happen so stick another box I have
on the bus and cranked and started smelling strong odor of gas????

looked out and there is a ft puddle of raw gas under the bus???
where, all the connectors and FI are dry ever connection is dry. WTF?

try again and gas is pouring out of tailpipe???  looked and when cranking
fuel presure goes to 30+ but immediately drops to zero when I stop.  huh?

bad control unit holds injectors open.??  didn't even know it was
possible.  put a 3rd control unit in and this time presure stays up but
gas still comes out of tail pipe, some kind of seriously flooded. so
buttoned up and took a break, check e-mail and go back in an hour or so.

no it is not cold start valve, checked it and pulled the plug anyway.
no it doesn't leak either, that bottom screw is a real dog to get at.
