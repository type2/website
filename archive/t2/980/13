Subject: Re: [T2] Blaupunkt radio polarity

Although I cannot totally answer this question, I can provide some
information that could possibly benefit those owners of 60-74 VW models with
Sapphire (and a few other makes).  A long while back, Scott Fraser hosted a
VW Radios page on dolphinsci.com, but now all that appears is a Network
Solutions page at the old address.  I had the foresight to download the html
and make some corrections, additions and revisions of my own from my
reference files in November 2005.  I then forwarded a copy of the html to
Scott at his email, but never heard back from him.  Because of all this I've
decided to re-host this page (with my revisions) on my site.  If there are
others out there with additional information to "plug-in" (so to speak),
just email me at the link on the bottom of the page.
