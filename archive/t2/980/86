no EGR system at all

plugged, nada

check

yeah I once had one too, but not this time

true but they will flood the engine

yes

good and solid.

no in all the years I had VW FI I've never had a brain go bad,,  but I
swapped in one anyway

still checking but so far all the ones I've done mostly sensor and brain
circuits are fine.

???MAP???

went out this afternoon and it was still showing 10lbs from last night.

when they work they are solid, but when they don't!!!

now one thing I am getting numb about, can't find the static timing
prochedures for setting the timing, always used the light while running
but hard to do when you can't get it running.
