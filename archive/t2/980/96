about 100k on the bottom end but great oil presure and spins free. new AVP
heads (rebuilt) never turned the engine while heads off.  compression is
good on all 4 cyl

and when it runs it sounds fine, just won't do it very often

that's what I thought.

so what is the )#(-at-)&% problem here, I have to be doing something wrong...I
drove this thing on 3 trips just before it got new heads, 300mi, 300mi,
and almost 600 miles and except for some minor leaks and hard starting
(both been around for awhile and the hard starting could be blamed on
sunken valves)  so when engine was out I put in new torque convertor seal
which should take care of the tranny leak and new push tube seals)  but
other than that and the heads the rest is as it was before dieing...

even put fresh fuel in here,  I've put new heads on before and I rebuilt
the engine and it fired right up every time, now it has got me really
bummed, this has been two weeks now since it was put back together and I
can't think of anything I haven't checked or replaced.  I'm missing
something.
