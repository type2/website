and it did, in fact ran a lot longer that it should on just the short shot
of starting fluid I used.

yup, goes to 30+ and holds

try a few more times, with a short 1/4 second puff of starting fluid and
finally she fires and runs.... grab timing light and start trying to get
timing right on, it is.  running smooth..... then stops (after about 5
minutes) and it will not restart even with fluid....

??? intermittent electrical problem????  I wasn't even touching the engine
when it stopped, just listening to it run and trying to determine what was
what.   it never did more than idle, could not get it to rev up at all??/


got it on the charger while I mumble to myself and to the german auto
dieties

thanks for the guide. will print this out, had already did all but one or
two steps.  cold start valve is installed but not plugged in

got a small oil leak, later

now what???? (retorical question)

am on a different checked out AFM
using a diffirent brain box.
using stock points/condenser/rotor etc

really baffled

some history that may or may not even be relavant, when I was coming back
from Everybus the bus started to slowly lose power. by the time I hit the
NC-VA line I couldn't get over 55mph, by Richmond it was down to about
45mph and by the time I got to the MD-VA line it was 20mph  barely got
over the hump on the rt 301 bridge over the potomac river. called it
quits in LaPlata MD, wrote this off as the sunken valve seat but now I
wonder...???
