Subject: Kristen Laurite Killer, trial update

Folks,

Saw this in the newspaper yesterday...finally.

http://www.nwarktimes.com/adg/News/192903

The killer pleaded "no contest" and was supposed to be sentenced 
yesterday.

If you go to http://www.nwarktimes.com/

and search for "laurite" you will get all the stories, including
the one on Thursday mornings sentencing.

Went thu 400+ posts this morning to make sure it wasn't a reposty.



Cheers, dave
