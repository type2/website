Ok, when I'm talking about the wiring harness, I'm referring 
specifically to the ljet harness, not anything else.

This is the strange part.  If fluid didn't get it started, then that 
means there's no spark, or poor spark.  Rationale here being that we

fluid, so that would lead me to believe that the problem is a spark issue.
