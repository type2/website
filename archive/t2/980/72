Subject: Re: [T2] Spraying black oil out the rear -

A couple things. First, when that leaking sender was
in there, oil was getting sprayed all over the place
in the cooling air area. It takes a few thousand miles
for that to "go away". If it is truly worse, then
either you buggered the threads putting it in or the
new one didn't last very long (common to my
experience) or you have another problem that maybe you
made worse when you were poking around. How about the
oil dipstick bellows? That's a common one and if it is
shot, just going up a steep hill will blow a gusher
out of there! My experience with OPS's (lots!) is that
you can look down from above while the engine is
running and see the oil seeping out. To see if the
threads are messed up, pull that rubber shroud out and
run without it while you watch for oil accumulation
and flow. -BaH

 I have been trying to stop my oil leak.  I replaced
 the fan crank seal and
 O-ring, all the push rod tube O-rings, the dip stick
 boot and the oil cooler
 seals.
 
 I still ot oil on the ground.  I saw oil coming
 right off the oil filter,
 and the tracks lead up to the oil cooler area.
 
 I then went to the top of the engine and pulled the
 oil pressure switch.  I
 could blow into the bottom and see the stream of
 oil/air that came out of
 the top.  I did this with a new OPS and no similar
 results.  Also, on a
 vacuum on the new OPS, the suction held but no
 similar results on the old
 OPS.

 So I replaced the OPS with a new one.
 
 The next day (today) and 20 miles later, the WHOLE
 BACK of my camper is
 speckeled with tiny black dropletts of oil, right up
 to the rear of the pop
top.  I NEVER got that much spray in the past; it
 almost NEVER got above the
 rear window.  And I am down a half quart.
 
 
   What gives?!?!?!
