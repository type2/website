Darren,

Dakota uses VDO made senders. Their sender with the 14x1.5mm thread...

SEN-04-7 - 14mm
Range: 0-3000F ( 0-1500C )
Resolution: 10F ( 10C )

must be VDO 323 055 or VDO 323 888 because that's all VDO offers in that
thread size. The single sender photo on their website is misleading.

That sender is also about half price is you buy it from someplace else like
Bus Depot of CIP1.com.
