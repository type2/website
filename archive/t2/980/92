Subject: Re: [T2] failure 

Sorry - I came in late on this. I don't know how much
effort you have put into checking for inadequate
venting of fuel tank or possible intermittent blockage
of fuel tank outlet. It is very unlikely to have an
intermittent blockage in a continuous flow system but
could happen if the fuel line is breaking down
internally. Have you run the outlet from the fuel pump
into a gas can and just let it run for a few gallons
(best to do at return line probably, for easier
access.)

I see you had 10psi residual pressure from overnight.
That's good at least - that there is any! I assume
that you checked it at pressure and it was within
range.

What about the possibility of the resistor pack
overheating or otherwise failing? That could easily be
a several minute delay type item. I was also thinking
of loose connectors at the double relay but that would
be even more intermittent than yours. You have a
pattern.

There was no chugging or black smoke to indicate a too
rich mixture, right? I saw it mentioned a few times
that maybe it was flooding, but if so, you should have
had some black smoke and the engine would have
definitely been chugging.

You have eliminated an exhaust plug also, I assume...

Things most likely to fail when warmed up? Coil,
condensor (and with it, points), any resistors, temp
sensors... BaH
