Subject: Heater Box Header Pipes

I have removed the sheet metal and die cast fins from my heater boxes and now
I'm running the header pipes only.  I have an exhaust leak where the header
pipes connect to the heads.  I'm going to remove the header pipes to
investigate their condition.  Maybe I'll get lucky and only need to replace
the copper header gaskets.  Does anyone know if/where type 4 header pipes can
be purchased?
