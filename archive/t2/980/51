Subject: Spraying black oil out the rear -

1978 FI stick 2.0

I have been trying to stop my oil leak.  I replaced the fan crank seal and
O-ring, all the push rod tube O-rings, the dip stick boot and the oil cooler
seals.

I still ot oil on the ground.  I saw oil coming right off the oil filter,
and the tracks lead up to the oil cooler area.

I then went to the top of the engine and pulled the oil pressure switch.  I
could blow into the bottom and see the stream of oil/air that came out of
the top.  I did this with a new OPS and no similar results.  Also, on a
vacuum on the new OPS, the suction held but no similar results on the old
OPS.

So I replaced the OPS with a new one.

The next day (today) and 20 miles later, the WHOLE BACK of my camper is
speckeled with tiny black dropletts of oil, right up to the rear of the pop
top.  I NEVER got that much spray in the past; it almost NEVER got above the
rear window.  And I am down a half quart.


  What gives?!?!?!
