Subject: FINALLY working on my bus!

It's been forever since I have had any motivation to
work on my poor bus. I've been collecting parts I knew
I would need, but just have not been able to actually
do any of the work. All I need to do is make a few
changes on the replacement engine, button it up to the
tranny and all the accesories and install it. It seems
like every time I have gone outside and looked at it,
I've just suddenly needed a long nap! Not sure if I'm
depressed because of the job ahead or avoiding the job
ahead because I'm depressed! I always figured I'd get
back in the mood one of these days and it seems like
I'm there now. Gotta stick with it and get a little
bit done every day, I guess. (Baby steps?)

I guess part of my problem is that once I get the
engine in, I still need to re-work the cooling system
and I just plain don't want to do that all again! Oh
well... if I don't stick with it, I'll never get it
done. I have had the engine and tranny out, tranny
gone through, and all back and running in two
consecutive nights before, but now it's just a
daunting task. -BaH
