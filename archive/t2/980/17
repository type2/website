2 liter stock 78 bus
finally got her all back together.
all 4 cyl are between 120-125psi

she'll start but she runs very very rough, will not idle, will not
rev.

I suspect air leaks but have gone over every hose several times....

. new dist cap & rotor (tried the old one too)
. fuel presure gauge says it is good (but changed the gas filter)
. points, right on. timing as close as I can get without engine running

engine starts, but runs rough then dies.  maybe minute or two,

tried two known working AFM's

have the fuel injector book but nothing fits.

all 4 cyl are firing  at least occasionally

when it has moments of smoothness it idles nice

I'm stumped and frustrated.

dumb ideas welcome, even good ideas
