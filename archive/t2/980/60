No, it is a blue thing that attaches to the tin at cylinder# 3.

It is bimatalic and actuates when the tin reaches a certain temp.

It either worked or it was out of range.

If I do have an overheating engine, what should I do???

You mean the Berg dipstick?

Is so, you want to determine whether or not the switch flips at 220-225F?
Test it on the stove using an oil with a high smoke point, cooking
thermometer (preferrably one that is digital with a thermocouple probe) and
a continuity tester.
