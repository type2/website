My shot in the dark is that it's #3/4 side.

If you have the stock motor it's a single port where the oil cooler limits the
airflow to that side. The dual ports with the dog house style oil cooler fixed
this and that side got the same air flow as the other side.

I know someone that has a single port that just upgraded the fan shroud and
oil cooler to the "dog house" style - I'm not exactly sure if those are the
only two parts you need.

Let us know what you come up with.
