For what its worth, Advance is VERY good about this.  They bought Parts
America (formly Western Auto) a few years back and made good on a few sets
of brake shoes and pads...they didnt even need the reciept, though that
was only because we'd returned them to the same store location we'd bought
them (and they had the computer records..).  If Trak doesnt/didnt have as
extensive records then a reciept is best.

I've been buying parts from Advance for the last 10 years or so and
they've always held good on their promises.  (and I've never needed a
receipt that I can recall.  Only for non-warranty returns)

They recently purchased Discount Auto, as well...I can't wait till the
Discount stores here in Florida all change over.
