I pmailed you earlier about this. Did you not receive it?
Here is what I sent:

As far as I know, most all after-market electronic ign swap-over kits use the
standard coil. Did you get install directions with your Crane kit?
Here is an ad for Crane Fireball Ignition. Is this what you have?
http://www.maccar.com/craneign.html
At the bottom, it lists Crane coils....
Here is someones write-up about Crane coils:

Here is another Crane ignition:

The next page of this site has the Crane install instructions:

It does not specify replacing the coil.....
