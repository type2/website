Subject: Prepping Westy for paint

I was wondering what people have done in the past when painting a Westy,
mainly when switching colors and getting the metal section of the roof
painted and not the pop top or canvas.  

Did you have the body shop pop the top and mask it all off? Take the top
off prior to arriving? Leave the top down and mask it all or and hand
paint the roof from the gutters to the canvas or simply live with the
roof a different color?

Also, how do you deal with the fair amount of painted metal in the
interior if you are changing colors.  Leave it the original color?  My
friend stripped his (74 Ford) van completly and it was sprayed inside and
out, but this is a lot of work with a Westy! 

This is an 81 Vanagon Westy in something like Awful Assaun (Orange)
Brown.

I'm in digest mode, so I appreciate p-mail
