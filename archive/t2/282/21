Subject: Weird timing light

Hey Y'all,
I bought this old "Dixco" timing light at a yard sale for a couple of bucks
but I dont know how to use it. Apparently it is not an inductive light. On the
end of the wire where an inductive pick up would be, there is this metal
spring-like thing attached. Does anyone know how to use this kind of timing
light?

Peace, John Baker
