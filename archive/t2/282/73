Sharp metal against paper maybe?
Niether recommending nor endorsing.

Gonna try putting computer hard drive (yes VERY strong magnets!) onto the 
sump plate and yes I have an oil filter. See what happens. Maybe there is a 
market for super stong magnets? I got alot of them.

Other note, the coolest thing about really strong small magnets is that when 
you drop them into your pocket you can simply take your tools and hang them 
from your pants. Big wrench? No problem, it just hangs there waiting for 
you. Same with any iron metal tool.
