Subject: Re: [T2] refirbishing EGR filter, One question

Hey David:

I found a good used EGR filter for my "new" Westfalia and I've been
considering how to "refurb" it.  I had considered cutting into the box
portion of the EGR with a Dremel cut-off wheel, filling the box with copper
wool, and then repairing the hole I made with a small section of sheet
metal, muffler putty and muffler bandage.  But your method has the advantage
of not making the EGR look like Frankenstein's monster.  I assume you cut
the scouring pad into long thin strips that could be inserted in the end of
the pipe and then pushed into the box with a pencil, dowel, or the like?
