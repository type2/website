Subject: Bouncing Baby Bus!!!!

Hi all!

Just wanted to thank everyone who helped me with information, tips, e-mails,
phone calls, etc. on buying a bus (especially Barry- you're the best!!!).  I
am now the proud owner of a 1970 bouncing baby bus (Hah- he's older than I
am, and I'm not that young!!).  Will be picking him up on Saturday, and I'm
thinking of naming him HAL ("open the bus bay door HAL"), although in the
end that might be too malevolent for such a sweet little old bus. He's only
got 8,000 miles on a rebuilt engine and drives just as nice as possible.
Everyone was right about the karma thing too, he is the right bus for me-
easy to work on, inexpensive parts- can't believe my luck!

Thanks again everyone!!

Take a look at him here:
