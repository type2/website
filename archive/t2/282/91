Hey, guys and gals, there IS a tooth fairy!!

The company that took over Trak Auto is Advance Auto.  Their rep responded

So for all you local people with the Trak Auto lifetime guarantees, keep 
your receipts and give their return policy a crack.

I am coming back at them with a torn CV boot & receipt, right after I get my 
battery!!  And my brake shoes should still be good for life, I hope.  Good 
for life?? - I just hope they don't send over a hit man to 'terminate' my 
lifetime guarantee!!!

Barry sends
