Subject: Re: [T2] Bus body is rusted badly/considering getting a new

Rust is a never ending battle, I thought about doing the same thing
my westy interior is pretty nice, the bubbles are coming back though
outside, right under my new paint job, sucks, but what are you gonna do.

paying someone to do it is going to be outrageously expensive.

I might just go ahead and try and find a clean 73-79 body that I can use 
instead, just not sure at this point. The only thing that I am sure of is 
that I am disapointed......but not discouraged.
