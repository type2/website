Hello Trey,

It is possible that the seal is good but the metal
under it is bad. I had this problem with my bus. The
seals in my bus were toast and had been for quite some
time. Because they were so dry rotted, water was
allowed to collect under the seals, rusting holes in
the window sill. If I were you, I would remove the
window and seal and inspect the window sill. If there
are holes, fix them. If not, you could always try
reinstalling the seal with windshield urathane (NOT
SILICONE!). That is what I would try. Oh, when
removing the window, make sure you do it correctly so
you don't damage the seal like I did. Good Luck!
