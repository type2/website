    I would bet the farm the chances are about "Slim and None"! Although if
I was going to try, I would start by sending them an E-mail at "Contact VW"
at     www.vw.com
    Make sure you don't have a web site with anything like their name, logo,
or VW on it. You'll have the wrath of the VW lawyers weevils on you!
    Good luck, let us know how this turns out.
