Subject: Re: [T2] Late model VW electronic ignition questions.

I've still got some questions about the coil... everyone is saying that if I 
have the "stock" points ignition on my '78 bus then the blue coil is the 
correct replacement, but what if I've replaced the points with an electronic 
setup (Crane)? Is the blue coil still the correct coil? Thanks for any info,
