Subject: Re: [T2] refirbishing EGR filter, One question

The scouring pads should not self-destruct.
The gasket between the tube and egr valve has a tiny hole.
The tubing for egr in the plenum has 4 tiny holes, one over each runner, that
look like they were put in with a nail! They were poked in from the outside.
This makes the hole look like a funnel. Anything big enough to pass thru the
valve more than likely will not past the 4 holes. Those 2 tubes plug up and
get packed with carbon real easy....
Changing the oil does not do much for chunks of carbon in the exhaust. They
usually appear when you run too rich.
