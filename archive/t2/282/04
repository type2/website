Subject: Converting bus to 72-74 exhaust.

I am not sure, you will need to check, but if you are going to use the 72-74 
heater boxes, make sure that they match the exhaust on the van. Some were 
square port, and some weren't , Check the Bentley. I do rember that some of 
the features of the 72-74 exhaust were changed in 75, and then changed back 
in 79........

Hope this may be of some help.
