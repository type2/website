Dave,

I love it!!!  The most interesting meta-analysis is:

Readers "Always or Sometimes" Perform Maintenance on Own Vehicle.......91.0%

TOOL OWNERSHIP (Purchased or Plan to Purchase in the Next 12 Months.)
Automotive Hand Tools.........................87.8%

which means to me that 3.2% of VWT readers are chewing the nuts off with
their teeth! (that or 3.2% of VWT readers count "filling the gas tank" as
maintainance :-)
