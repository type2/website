Subject: FLAPS - Trak Auto

Is there any Trak Auto in Northern VA or Maryland that is still operating??  
Their web site is NA.

I must replace the battery on my '78 Westy, and it still has a bunch of time 
left on the warrantee.

Off line responses would be appreciated by me and probably the list, too.
