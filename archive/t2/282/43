The bolt pattern on all type 4 engine heads was the same from '72 thru
'78, so you can match the earlier heater boxes to your heads without
changing the studs.  At the same time, if you have any studs that are less
than pristine, now is definitely the time to change them.

The heater boxes will interchange without problems between the '72-74 dual
carb and '75-78 fuel injection engines.
