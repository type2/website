Hey Tom,

I first cleaned out the old filter as best as I could
using a coat hanger, and air gun and some soap and
water. Make sure that you can EASILY blow through it
when you are through. Once it was dry, I cut the
copper mesh from the scour pads in about 2 1/2"
squares. Any thing bigger would eaisly jam in the
tube, even long strips. I used a pencil to get it
started but I had to use a piece of a metal coat
hanger to insert the pieces all the way. I just put a
small kink in the coat hanger so it would not poke
through the mesh as easily. I ended up putting 3 of
those pads in the filter. When you are done, blow in
one end of the filter. You should still be able to
easily blow through it. If you have access to an air
gun, try to blow out the little copper particles left
over that are floating around in the filter. It is
easier than it sounds and it didn't take me 35 minuets
to do it. Just don't use STEEL wool. Good Luck! 

Have a great day!
