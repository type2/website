If your bus has the stock points ignition (all buses 1950-1978, federal
79-83) then the 00 012 (bosch blue coil) is the correct replacement
if your bus has the stock electronic ignition (cal '79-83) then the 00 041
coil is the correct replacement.

If you have a stock point ignition system on a bus made from '50-78 or a
federal model bus made from '79-83 then you ordered the correct coil.
If you have the stock electronic ignition system on a california bus made
from '79-83, then you ordered the wrong coil.  If you use the wrong coil,
you risk damaging your hall-effect sender, which will cost you $100 to
replace.

I just went to Ron's site.  If you search by keyword for "ignition coil"
then the search engine will tell you that he stocks both coils (as well as
a number of others).  You might also search by part number using, as Karl
said, "00012" or "00041". Both coils are clearly labeled as to
application.
