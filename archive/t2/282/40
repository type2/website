Subject: switching to 72-74 exhaust

'sup list

I have a 76 bus , switching exhaust but I want to know a couple of things 
before I order. do I use 76 port studs being they are screwed into 76 engine 
or the other way around? The other thing I wanted to know is.... does ir 
matter which heat exchangers I use F.I. ,carb , 1700, 1800, I have an engine 
from '76 Carb. which is more c.c. than either one of the 72-74.  Please help 
so I can get my bus back on the road where it belongs!!!!

Thanks
