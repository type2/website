Subject: Oil and Oil Temperature

FWIW........
In looking through my Bentley book for the Mercedes, I see ..................
"The OM602 and OM603 engines are equipped with a thermostatically 
controlled air-to-oil intercooler. At 230 F the thermostat opens to route 
oil through the intercooler. The thermostat is fully open at 257 F."

Given that, it would appear that MB feels 230 degrees F is a monitor point 
to start cooling down on engine oil, and at 257 degrees F, it is an oil 
temp value that needs more cooling attention.

Of course, we are talking 8.5 Qts of oil in the gut as opposed to our bus 
capacity of 3 Qts.
