John,

Steve is absolutely correct, with one caveat.... use this light only after
sunset! :-)  These lights do work and reasonably well, but they are
anything but bright.  The reason is that they draw all their power from
the spark wire itself.  They are brighter than the spark you see on a
spark plug, but not a whole lot.  As John said, pull the wire leading to
the #1 plug from the distributor cap, push one end of the spring in to
replace it, then push the lead to #1 onto the other end of the
spring-thing.  If you look at the spring closely, it has a male and female
end to allow this.
