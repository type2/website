Steve,

Could be that 3.2% already own every tool that they could possibly need!

Of course, we know that the 91% or so "male" readers could not 
possibly ever imagine  already owning every tool that they would ever 
need<VBG>!

The ladies say "You can't ever be too rich or too skinny!"
The guys say   "You can never have enough tools!"


ROTFLOL!!!!

Just what I needed on a dreary cold wet Saturday afternoon when I can't go 
finish my headliner....

Cheers, dave
