Subject: Looking for retractable seatbelts for my bug

OK, apparently the later bugs, 73 and up came with 3 point retractable
belts. My daughter just bought a 70 bug and it only has lap belts which are
not good enough for me. Would anyone have any of these later retractable
belts they'd like to sell or give away for my daughter's safety? I'd
appreciate that.
Regards,
Courtney
