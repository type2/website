Collie,

I live in Virginia Beach, about 2 miles from where you say the guy lived. I 
will ask around, but I am pretty sure that I know of most of the split 
windows in the area. The one thing about cars and Navy guys is that sometimes 
they move. I had a friend who worked at a VW shop here in town, he has a sea 
foam green 64 westy with side hatch, but he has had that for some time. I 
will ask him if he knows of your ol van.

In the meantime, try these shops and ask them. They are the local air cooled 
joints.

Whitehead's Auto  757-425-1999
Bughouse               757-497-8080

Hope that helps,

Chris B.
74 Hightop Westy-BreadBox.
