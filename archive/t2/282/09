Subject: 1973 campmobile and parts for sale

Sorry for the cross posting, but it's time to send this bus to a good 
home - to someone with the time to finish it. And I'd like to give 
the VW community first shot, rather than deal with eBay. Also going 
(separately) are some parts I bought for it.  If you're interested in 
the whole package, pmail me; otherwise first come first served. 
Shipping not included.

Parts:

New in the box canvas for 73 and earlier Bay window Westy - $199.95 
new from Bus Depot, selling for $100
New rubber pull downs for 73 and earlier Bay window Westy top set of 
three - $6.95 each from Bus Depot, selling all three for $10
New in the box poptop seals for 73 and earlier Bay window Westy top 
- $81.95 new from Bus Depot, selling for $40
New in the box front seat upholstery (two sets)  for 73 and earlier 
Bay window - $99.95 new from Bus Depot, selling for $50
New in the box nose for 73 and earlier Bay window (everything below 
windshield) - 139.95 new from Bus Depot, selling for $100 (these are 
hard to find - neither WCM, RMMW or BusDepot has them now)

The Bus:

1973 Westy, kinda beat up interior, but complete, incl.child's cot 
and hammock (torn canvas in hammock). Brakes rusty, nose crunched in 
argument with deer, rebuilt 1.8 L engine with less than 500 miles on 
it but which has sat for a couple of years unstarted. Has a flat, but 
I think the spare is good. Would need to be towed (even if you the 
started it, the brakes are shot so stopping would be an adventure). 
Speaking of which, I've a box of brake parts for the bus (two sets of 
pads, two sets of shoes, gaskets for front disc brakes, some hoses, 
all new) which I don't feel like fooling with that I'll trow in. $500 
for the bus.

Or I'll sell the whole shootin' match for $750. I've pictures of the 
bus available.
