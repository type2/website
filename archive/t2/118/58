Subject: Success at last

At long last I finally have a running 1971 Westy.  A few comments, and a =
few requests...
I ordered rebuilt front calipers from my FLAPS.  $65 each + core.  I was =
pleasantly surprised to find that they came (almost) complete with new =
pads, pins and springs.  Very nice.  The only thing missing was the =
plate that sits between the caliper and the pad.  Are these still =
availabe?  If I don't have them will my brakes fail and I die?  The old =
calipers didn't have them but then again I had to replace them.

I used the Ezibleed brake bleeder that uses a tires air pressure to =
force fluid through the lines.  What a dream!  No pumping, worked as =
good as the box promised.=20

I've found a suitable replacement for the rubber bushings that support =
the back side of the luggage rack.  I put a large rubber bushing on each =
end of a 1" long plastic tubular bushing.  If anyone wants them, I'll =
happily send them out for cost.=20

One question.  It looks like there should be some sort of clip that =
attaches to the back of the passenger seat that clamps the seat in an =
upright position.  Does anyone sell this or have a spare?=20

For all those who have recently posted with problems related to the =
inability to run at idle.  I was having similar problems.  Not knowing =
what some PO had done, I started by simply adjusting the idle mixture =
and speed adjustment screws to where the manual said they should be.  =
Presto! Problem solved.  Sometimes (though not often) the simplest =
approach yield the solution.

Thanks to all for their help.=20
