Hi,

Scott from San Antonio, Texas is planning on attending EveryBus in 
April. He is hoping to contact other Texas bus drivers or those 
taking a southern route(I am assuming I-10 thru TX, LA, the heading 
up the MS, AL, GA, SC ) to EB. If you are going to EB and might be on 
his route for TX to NC please contact him at RScott2525(-at-)aol.com.
