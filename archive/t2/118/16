Hey everyone, Bus Gypsy here again. Well I've decided not to build my own 
engine or buy crap from GEX, MOFOCO, ect. I am going to have Bob Donald build 
me something a little special. From what I have seen, and heard, he is a true 
guru in the VW engine buisness. Remember;  Buy from the best, or die like the 
rest!  Since I will be buying it outright,  I have the case from my 69 which 
nds a home. Also have a set of rebuilt dual port heads with lo miles, some 
fancy alloy adjustable pushrod tubes, chrome, and regular valve covers, 
generator stand, 2 flywheels, regular pushrod tubes, and a rear window with 
defrost for a 78 bus. Have more.  I live in Brattleboro Vt. and would also 
consider trading for other parts that will fit a 69.  Looking for spare tire 
mounting hardware for the front, as I am converting it to a Westie. Also 
lookig for no rust drivers door, good rear bumper, and a set of nice hubcaps.
                                            Bus Gypsy
69 Bus "Mandy"
