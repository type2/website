I took off the standard belts and tried to wind out enough of the belt so I 
could fit one but it kept locking so I was forced to re-fit the standard 
belts until I can work out how to put the inertia reels on.

Any clues?
The only trick is to keep the reel as vertical as possible the reel should 
look like a number 6 and when they are mounted in the bus this is the way 
they should be fitted. Maybe you could clamp the belt with a bull dog clip. I 
hope this makes sense.
