a complete stop (under 5 mph).  >>

Worn synchro...Replace or learn the technique all LBC (Little British Car)
owners of a certain age (and you know who you are) have developed...
Practice bringing up the RPM's just slightly in neutral when down shift-
ing from second. Here's the drill: Clutch pedal down, shift to neutral.
Clutch pedal up, blip the throttle slightly. Clutch pedal down, slip into
first. Starting off precedure: Clutch pedal down, pull back slightly to
engage second gear synchro (not fully engaged), then slip into first.
With a tach, or an educated ear, the clutch can be dispensed with 
for all but dead starts (not recommended !!! but it can be done...)
