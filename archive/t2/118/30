Subject: Oil leak

Patient: '77 2.0
Symptom: oil leak
Location: off oil filter after about 5 minutes running
Diagnosis: blown oil cooler seals

Narrative:

Rapid oil leak.  One drop/sec.  Replaced filter in the vain hope that we
had a leaker.  Fire it up and after 5 minutes idling we got a leak. 
Anyone care to venture a second opinion? (Before I pull the effing motor.)

Thanks, 

Jim
