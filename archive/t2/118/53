Subject: Baywindow trucks

I asked last week for any websites with info on bay window trucks.  Several
people had asked when I found anything to let them know. So....  This is all
the info I have received so far..  If you have any technical info you could
pass on to Neale he would be very grateful..

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
