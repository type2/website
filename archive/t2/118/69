Hal,
If I'm not mistaken, those little plates help to "re-position" the pads back to their resting position when brakes are NOT being applied.  I drove my old 75 for about 2 years without these until I finally did a brake job and discovered they were missing.  I doubt you would have catastrophic brake failure without them, but why tempt fate?  i believe I have an old set of these hiding in my garage if you need them, you can have them for the cost of shipping.
