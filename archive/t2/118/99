Matty seems to be having some issues here.

Broadcasted responses might not help much for giving him real support/advice.

I would think support and advice via p-mail might be the better methodology 
here.

Sometimes we go to crowds as a broadcast plea for support.
Responses back by personal mode better serve the person needing advice/help.
