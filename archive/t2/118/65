Subject: synchro 1st?  & defrost Q

Hi folks, a couple questions from a lurker.

First: Does my 68 have a synchro on 1st gear?  I rarely drive my camper in
stop and go traffic but sometimes I can't avoid this.  I find that if I
apply a hard foot on the brake pedal I can get into first without coming to
a complete stop (under 5 mph).  As the bus lunges forward and the nose dives
it slips into 1st really easily.  But only if I apply the brake in this
fashion.  This helps me from lugging in 2nd in the slow and go in the S.F.
Bay Area.  Is this a destructive practice?

Second: I finally have the stock heat working which means I can drive this
girl in conditions where the windshield fogs up.  There is a lever on the
vertical metal air column under the dash whose position is held in place by
friction and a flat rubber o ring.  Amazingly the rubber is still supple
enough to do this job.  I think this diverts the warmish air to the defrost
outlets when pushed down and to the under-dash vents (one on each side) when
pushed up.  But nothing comes out of the under-dash vents right now.  Any
tips or hints?  I did find the lever for the rear floor vent thanks to the
archives.  My canine passenger appreciates this!

Thanks
