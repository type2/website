Volks,=20

I have a weird shifting problem on a 75 type 2 that i cannot seem to get =
right.=20

Fist, It would not go into gear.  Clutch pedal felt fine, so replace =
shift coupler.  It was shot.  So, I put it all back to gether, and I can =
get it into one gear, 1st.  If i loosened the shifter bolts on the cab =
floor, I could get it into reverse.  Did not feel any distinct pattern =
with the shifter, though....kinda sloppy.  So, I pulled off the shifter, =
cleaned the shifter plate on the floor (installed it right..With bigger =
part to right) lubed things up, and same result.  Crawled under the bus =
to look at the front shift bushing...very sloppy.  Would this shift =
bushing being worn cause all that?
