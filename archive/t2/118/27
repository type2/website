Subject: Re: [T2] Need larger mirrors on 74 westy

One thing I have is a special curved lens stuck on my back window. I forget 
what it's called (I could look it up), but basically it's a piece of plastic 
that attaches to the rear window. It's bent so that you get a better view 
around it - you can see almost straight up, down, left, and right. It 
distorts depth, but it's not so large that I can't look around the edges. 
Very handy.

As for side mirrors, I just have stock mid/late 70s mirrors, so I can't help 
with the question asked. Still, the back lens is worth a look at if you want 
better visibility.
