Subject: Living in a Bus

Hi Folks,

I spent last summer living in my Bus here in Aspen.  I found it to be okay, 
as long as the weather stayed warm.  I found plenty of places to park, as 
long as you're willing to stay out of the way and not stay in one place for 
too many days.

If your job is sedentary and it's not too hot, you can shower every other 
day, usually at a friend's house.  Laundry facilities can be had as well, 
especially if you're hanging out with friends where the laundry is free.

Once the cleaning of yourself and your clothes is solved, your Bus has the 
advantage of helping you move your house from place to place.  As long as 
you can deal with a more diffuse idea of home, it can be a creative and fun 
challenge.  Home is where your Bus is, and if you don't like someplace, you 
can always drive elsewhere.

Good luck, and enjoy your new living situation.
