And the sign says long haired freaky people need not apply..........I think 
that sums up the discrimination of homeless I hear this thread becoming. I 
lived in SF for 3 years in a bus 2 in a motor home, and a little while in a 
pickup truck camper. With average price for a studio at about 1000-1200, gas 
at 2 a gallon, natural gas and electricity is outrageous. Median income is 
55,000. Thats 55,000 folks. Unless those of you who speak drive trailer 
queens, where do you get that kind of dough?  The VW bus is more than a 
vehicle. For some, it becomes a lifestyle.  Driven to the street, you do what 
you have to so you can survive. And I definitely will use those industries 
bathrooms. Those industries who drove up the cost of living so high, many 
have been driven to the streets. Nobody owns the street my friends. Asking 
for help is not a sin,and if my brother asks me for a place to stay, or food 
to eat, he will get exactly that. This world is all about helping one 
another.  Sorry no bus content but what had to be said was said,  now you may 
kill the thread.
