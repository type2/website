Yea, that Nason stuff is one step below Dulux---and that is the lowest
of all the  enamel's I can think of---this is Dupont's answer to Farm
and Fleet enamel---cheap farm tractor, johnny one coat, enamel--not a
wise selection of paint------

I would like to see a bus properly refinished in 40 hour's------no way.

A Mack truck, with no body work whatsoever  book time is 48
hour's----and a bus has almost double the surface area----

Later,

Terry

I am in the process of painting my newly aquired 77 Westy in my single
car garage. 
I am using two stage nason brand paint. A cheaper offspring of dupont.
This bus was in very nice shape. 
Only a few dents to fix and the normal stone chips. Original paint so
there is only one coat on it to remove. 
I am goint to have about 350.00 in materials and about 40 hours worth of
work. Maybe a little more. 
If you are using two stage you really dont need a booth. It`s very
fogiving. A little wet sanding and buffing and you would be surprised at
what you can do yourself. 
Thanks,
Dave Parsons
