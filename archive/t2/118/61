Bo,
On my 78 2.0L FI I had the same symptom and found the problem to be weeping
fuel lines in the engine compartment. They develop small cracks/tears over time
and will allow just a little gas out when under pressure. Look very closely as
they may look OK upon a more casual inspection. There are many short pieces of
rubber tubing and they all need to be checked and I would suggest replacement
of all of them. Of course you might as well check all rubber fuel lines back to
the tank while you are at it. I do not know, but I suspect that this is one of
the causes of engine fires, so perhaps this is a ASAP situation.

Good Luck!
Cheers
Chris
