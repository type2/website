Subject: Re: [T2] Living in a Bus

The last guy who wanted to buy one of the buses I have that needs a LOT of
work wanted to know if he could live here in my driveway while he learned
how to work on the bus. Come on!! If you need a place to spend the night
come on down, I'm in Charlotte, but don't ask if you can live here for free!

I know there isn't much bus content here and we should kill this thread, but
I just hate to see the promotion of:
just because I own a bus too I am going to give you something for free,
especially a place to live.

Matty,  I got kicked out of my house when I was 17, but I worked every day
and paid my bills sharing with a roommate. I now own my own house and I am
not rich, but I am responsible.

Touring the country as a reward to yourself is one thing, bumming off your
friends is another.
