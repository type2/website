Subject: Re: [T2] living in my bus

I suppose if you're kicked out, replying to the list might not do you any 
good, but just in case...

My first stop would be a library, in your shoes... or possibly a book store 
or RV shop. I know for a fact that a book exists on living in an RV 
full-time, because a friend's grandfather did just that and had said book. 
It was called something along the lines of "Living in a Mobile Home." If you 
can get your hands on a copy, it'll probably be all the information you 
need.
