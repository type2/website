--I second this strongly, to those of you so comfortable you've lost touch with compassion. The rest of the world is living in your toilet. You must be the ones with the republican party stickers on your buses.

And the sign says long haired freaky people need not apply..........I think that sums up the discrimination of homeless I hear this thread becoming. I lived in SF for 3 years in a bus 2 in a motor home, and a little while in a pickup truck camper. With average price for a studio at about 1000-1200, gas at 2 a gallon, natural gas and electricity is outrageous. Median income is 55,000. Thats 55,000 folks. Unless those of you who speak drive trailer queens, where do you get that kind of dough?  The VW bus is more than a vehicle. For some, it becomes a lifestyle.  Driven to the street, you do what 
you have to so you can survive. And I definitely will use those industries bathrooms. Those industries who drove up the cost of living so high, many have been driven to the streets. Nobody owns the street my friends. Asking for help is not a sin,and if my brother asks me for a place to stay, or food to eat, he will get exactly that. This world is all about helping one another.  Sorry no bus content but what had to be said was said,  now you may kill the thread.
