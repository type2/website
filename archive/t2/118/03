Don't laugh...What you're talking about is a traditional "coach finish" that
was on many cars of the thirties...They may still sell the paint (but I've
only seen it advertised in a few old copies of "Practical Classics" out of
the UK). Same deal, many, many coats of paint, sanding between each 
one...Requires a really clean area to achieve that kind of finish with lots
and lots of time...Saw a Bentley at a car show with a finish that was in-
credible...The guy could take a yardstick and hold it against the car and
you could read the numbers three feet into the paint...He said it took a-
bout six months of off again on again work to get the finish...Oh yeah,
since the car had piping, all the body panels were painted and then as-
sembled...
