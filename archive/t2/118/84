Subject: Re: [T2] Sand Blasting


I have done a lot of sandblasting, it is messy to say the least. No matter
what you do sand will get every where. That being said it is the best way
to remove the nasty scaly stuff. I have used a lot of different mediums for
blasting and have found that for the money you cant beat simple play sand
from Home Depot or whoever. You must make certain the sand is totally dry,
not the least bit damp, and you have to sift it through a fine screen to
get rid of any impurities or big stones. You can use sandbox sand, or
cement mix sand, but you must observe the first 2 rules.

Hello all,

I have recently decided to undertake the painstaking task of de-rusting the
floor pan of my 71' Bay.  Upon removal of the layers of house carpeting and
rubber mats from the floor I discovered a great deal of Rustolium covered
cancer.  I stared out with a stiff wire brush just to ware out my arm.
This
resulted in scratched up Rustolium and little to no rust removed.  Later I
obtained a "Rust & Paint Removing Wheel" from the local OSH.  This worked
ok
for a while, but after about an hour, my poor drill began to overheat.  Now
I'm at the point where it's time to get serious, sandblasting time.
Searching through the T2 Library I have found info on what I need.  I have
ordered the appropriate equipment from Harbor Freight and am awaiting its
arrival.  My question to you (list), where the heck can I find the "#30-#60
copper slag" in the Bay Area (San Jose, CA).  All the places I have called
only carry #30 Silica Sand (really bad on the lungs from what I have read).
Any info you could give me on Abrasive Media retailers in the Bay Area
would
be of great help.

Thanks!

- Ray Ramirez
