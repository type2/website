Subject: painting

I am in the process of painting my newly aquired 77 Westy in my single car
garage.
I am using two stage nason brand paint. A cheaper offspring of dupont. This
bus was in very nice shape.
Only a few dents to fix and the normal stone chips. Original paint so there
is only one coat on it to remove.
I am goint to have about 350.00 in materials and about 40 hours worth of
work. Maybe a little more.
If you are using two stage you really dont need a booth. It`s very fogiving.
A little wet sanding and buffing and you would
be surprised at what you can do yourself.
Thanks,
Dave Parsons
(77 Westy) Gertrude
