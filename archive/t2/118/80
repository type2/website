Subject: Sand Blasting

Hello all,

I have recently decided to undertake the painstaking task of de-rusting the
floor pan of my 71' Bay.  Upon removal of the layers of house carpeting and
rubber mats from the floor I discovered a great deal of Rustolium covered
cancer.  I stared out with a stiff wire brush just to ware out my arm.  This
resulted in scratched up Rustolium and little to no rust removed.  Later I
obtained a "Rust & Paint Removing Wheel" from the local OSH.  This worked ok
for a while, but after about an hour, my poor drill began to overheat.  Now
I'm at the point where it's time to get serious, sandblasting time.
Searching through the T2 Library I have found info on what I need.  I have
ordered the appropriate equipment from Harbor Freight and am awaiting its
arrival.  My question to you (list), where the heck can I find the "#30-#60
copper slag" in the Bay Area (San Jose, CA).  All the places I have called
only carry #30 Silica Sand (really bad on the lungs from what I have read).
Any info you could give me on Abrasive Media retailers in the Bay Area would
be of great help.

Thanks!
