Subject: Alt. & brake idiot  lights and bright headlights

Driving home my '72 Westy last night, the brake
indicator and generator (alternater) lights began to
glow just barely. They would fade in and out, but nevercome on to full brighness. It's possible that it
was doing it on the way home from Paddy's Wagens, but it was too sunny to tell. Anyway, after the idiot
lights went out, the headlights became very bright and
the wipers picked up speed. It did this twice for about
15 seconds each time and then quit. I was a mile from 
the house, but decided to chance it and get her home. 

So, there she sits until I can figure out what's wrong.
Any suggestions? I plan on starting with having the
alt. tested. Hopefully the two are related and I
can kill two birds with one stone. 

John
