Yea, Steve--I was thinking all about the brushless trick 20 some years
ago when I was blowing paint on a 66 Nova----it was an  was important
thing to be thinkig of in my youth----

I'm still here---

Forget about all the rational thought process--it does work----

Brushless or not-----

Later,

Set up a fan in your garage, or shed, in a window, this will clear out

Jus as a warning (and to pass on a good story :-), MAKE SURE THE FAN HAS
A "BRUSHLESS" MOTOR!!!! Many years ago, I saw a show/video on setting up
a spray boot at home. The autors had the following procedure for
obtaining a fan with a brushless motor: 
1) go to hardware store, ask clerk for a fan with a brushless motor. 
2) when he hands you the fan, ask if he is *sure* it has a brushless
motor 
3) get his name! 
4) take fan home, take it out of the box 
5) set up fan 50' from nearest building 
6) get 50' extension cord and run it to the fan 
7) DO NOT PLUG THE EXTENSION CORD INTO A SOCKET!!!!! 
8) plug fan into extension cord, set fan switch on high 
9) pour 1 cup of gasoline into the fan motor 
10) set fan in operating position 
11) return to house and plug extension cord into socket 
12) after 1 hour, collect charred remains of fan, return to original box 
13) return fan to store for exchange, in original box. Mention clerk's
name, mention lawyers. 
The video/show did this in video as they went thru the steps and the
fireball was *most* impressive! The look on the store manager's face was
also impressive (this may have been staged, however) 
These days, most fans use brushless motors, but it is not 100% and there
are no latex car paints, AFAIK.
