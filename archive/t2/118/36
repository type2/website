At least back to 76. If the door does not have a round hole below the handle,
then it will not work. The outer dimensions of all 68 to 79 doors are the same
but the operating mechanisms are different. If the door has a keyhole in the
handle [no hole for a tumbler below the handle] then it is too early.
