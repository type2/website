Keep in mind that a little milk in the filler neck isn't a death notice.
the filler neck is the coldest part of the oil system and is where all the
vapor passes on the way to the air cleaner, so you might get some
condensation there and not in the crankcase.  If your drain oil looks like
chocolate milk, you have a problem, but a little foam in the filler cap
isn't bad.
