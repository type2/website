Subject: Need larger mirrors on 74 westy

Trying my best to get my bus ready for EB.  One
of my wants is larger mirrors.  I may not get to
my want list prior to EB, but here goes...

Any sage advice on the best way to see a little
more of what's going on behind my bus?  I've seen
busses with aftermarket mirrors, including the
cutsie sporty car things the bug types and the
pretent big trucker west coast type.    I lean
towards a generic truck deal from flaps, like
this:

I'd prefer to not have to drill, but I will if
necessary to get a decent mirrors.   I guess the
other option is clamping on those 3-4 inch spot
mirrors, but depth perception is a big problem
with those.  

Surely somebody has added some decent mirrors
without breaking the bank.  (No rear camera
suggestions please.)
