Subject: New Parts just in from Europe!

Just got a new shipment from Europe.  Here are the most noteworthy items
that fit '68 or later busses. A couple of new items, and a couple of last
chances on previous ones that are now almost sold out.  Quantities are
limited, so they're first come first serve.


1600cc Complete Dual-Port Heads:
Assembled in Europe with all European made parts, except for the bare head
which is genuine VW/Brazil.  They were built for a European retailer who cut
back his order.  I have 10, then no more at this price. These are cheaper
AND much better than any South American assembled head; closest available to
all-German and the best you can buy. 	Part #  043 101 355CK	 $99.95

Heat Exchangers, Genuine N.O.S. German VW:
Looks like this will be my last shot of these. Prices are cheaper than the
Danish knock-offs usually sell for, and quality is higher.  Even if you
match one of these with one Danish one, you'll get better heat than with a
pair of Danish ones.
Right Side, '68-71 Bus 	 	043 255 108HG	$99.95
Left Side, 72-74 Bus  		021 256 091M	$139.95

Front Door Seals, Genuine N.O.S. German VW:
These were discontinued some years ago.  Even the Brazilian genuine VW ones
(which we sell) can't compare to the German ones.  Were $240/pair when last
available.  Well worth the money if your bus is a "keeper."   Only 4 pair
avail.   211 898 721D 	$199.95/pair

Fuel System Parts:
Carburetor, 31-PICT-3 (single-port eng), man choke, Genuine VW/Brazil 113
129 029	$99.95
Fuel Pump, mechanical, 72-74 bus (German) - long discontinued	021127 025A
$99.95
ECU, '76-77 bus from 1/76, Calif emmissions				CU56X  		$99.95
ECU, '78 bus w/Calif emissions						CU98X   		$99.95
These ECU's are genuine Bosch rebuilt units and were originally $650 each.

Sheet Metal - Genuine VW (priced cheaper than aftermarket!)
Front Jackpoints, full, PAIR, 				VW 7031PR		$99.95
Front Wheel Arch, left, '73-79				95 56 311VW	$99.95
Front Wheel Arch, right. 73-79 				95 56 312VW  	$99.95
These are the COMPLETE wheel arches, below your front doors, not just the
outer skin.

Trailer Hitches (back in stock!)
These are European made copies of the orginal VW hitch (long discontinued).
They replace the bumper brackets and bolt right to your frame.  2" ball.
Very solid and nice quality.  Part #s  PVW7 ('68-71), PVW9 ('72), and PVW15
('73-79).  $169.95

Bike Racks:
Fiamma Bike Rack, mounts to rear hatch (holds 2 bikes)  		KA0026		$199.95
Bike Rack, mounts to trailer hitch above (holds 2-3 bikes)		85663			$129.95

Retracting Sliding Door Step:
N.O.S. VW.  Automatically retracts when you close the sliding door; a rare
European option.  Found in Germany in a dusty old genuine VW box.  Very
unique.  Open box; everthing seems intact but may be missing minor hardware
etc.     Part # 221 898 062A ,  $199.95

Front Axle Beam - Previously mentioned here; just got the rest of my stock.
No more available when present stock sells out.
Fits 72-79 Bus,  with bearings, NEW genuine VW stock, long discontinued
211 401 061N   $299.95
