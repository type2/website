Subject: VWoA Campertent

Hey folks- I recently scored a like-new side tent ($150!) for my '77 Westy 
and trying to learn more about it. It isn't the square multi-colored I'm 
used to seeing, but rather dome-like (as far as I can tell, it is too large 
to set up in my basement and was seemingly impossible to setup with two of 
us.  The very useful site below has what *may* be my tent- the VWoA 
Campertent.  Mine doesn't have color coded poles and is a yellow/khaki 
canvas rather than the colorful versions shown.

If this is what I have, it looks like I'm missing the "gutter rods"- anybody 
know of their availability?

Does anybody have one of these?  After struggling with it last night 
(admittidly cramped in my basement and w/o instructions) it seems like  a 
lot of work to set up- this more novelty than functional for ~3-5 day 
camping trips?  Don't get me wrong, I was super psyched to get it but not 
sure how practical it is to spend hours setting it up and taking it down- 
that is why I like camping in the westy and not my dome tent!

Anyway, thought I'd share my find and try to find out some info.  Any 
experience in getting it up (the site above provides instructions for that 1 
style), finding gutter rods, or other info on them would be welcomed.

Happy bussing
Patrick
