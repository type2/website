List,
This is a silly, lazy question, but -
Do any of you guys run an old-timey aaooga horn on your bus?

I have one and can't figure the wiring -mainly because i don't understand=
 the
horn circuit. The horn looks like this:
http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/ws/ebayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=3D181362710=
3&r=3D0&t=3D0
 but mine is 12v.
The aooga (actually the 'aooga brand) horn is mounted, uninsulated to the=

front bumper and only has one wire coming out of it.  I figured i needed =
a
ground wire (since the stock horn appears to use one) and i attached a wi=
re to
the body of the horn. When i hook both of the wires up to the leads for t=
he
stock horn and turn the key - the horn is on all the time. This was reall=
y
cool in the inlaw's garage about 2am saturday...

Anyway - just wondering if anybody else has a bus that sounds as silly as=
 it
looks and how they wired their horn...

thanks,
