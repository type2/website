Err.  Baywindows definitely came with the BA6.  My 77 has a BA6.  I'm
not sure when they made the transition from BN4 to BA6. AFAIK, the BA6
has the advantage of higher BTUs combined with being closer to heater
outlets.  It basically replaces the long heater tube that runs down
the middle of the bus.  The BA6 (and BN4, I imagine) both require an
intact heating system.  Although there is an auxiliary fan (in
addition to the blower in the engine compartment) to push air through
the heater when the engine is idling or not running, the engine pushes
much more air through than this fan (or the blower in the engine
compartment) is capable of.  The nice thing with the auxiliary fan on
BA6 is that it sucks air from inside through a vent underneath the
back seat.  If you didn't bother adding that intake, you probably
wouldn't even have to cut any holes in your bus to fit a BA6.
