Subject: [T2] Just like that, BOOM! Another setback..

I also have a post running around about a bad hesitation after partial
rebuild...
I tried an SVDA distributor and got the plug wires wrong and BOOM!!
The mother of backfires.....
Heres what it did...

Hopefully that is all it did...   What else could that have damaged...??
Well time for a new one I guess, wait, that one WAS NEW!!!!  Less than 20
miles on it...
Is it normal for a backfire to do this? Granted it was big, but gosh, it
knocked me back a few feet...
I was sitting right there with my hand on the dizzy when she blew...  Had my
girlfriend turning the key..
Im still limping a bit, it got me pretty good...    Ill live to wrench another
day, hopefully better this time...
