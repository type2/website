Subject: valves

Hi Folks 
I am a moron when it comes to a valve adjustment.  I had the 1600 DP out,
cleaned and painted, so I adjusted the valves.  I have Bentley, Muir,
Clymer, and "How to rebuild a VW engine"...all really great books if you
know how to read.

I install the engine, it fires...idles nice... I lean in, pull on the
throttle and rev her up, and all hell breaks loose... clack clack clack

I have one valve that stays "in"  by this I mean, the adjusting screw shows
allot more thread than any other.  I can not get the feeler gauge between
the rocker arm and the spring...I have rotated the engine many times,
occasionally it will come "loose" but then I get the same symptom on number
4.  

Any ideas based on this pathetic description?
