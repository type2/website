	I have contacted Espar recently regarding their new units as a
heater of some sort is something that I need to get installed.  One thing to
keep in mind, is that they are saying their new units run on diesel or
paraffin only.  You would need to install a small tank to hold either of
these fuels.  I don't consider this to be a deal killer necessarily but it
is an added task to a project that will have a lot of items to take care of
already.  A small tank should do since they rated the usage at about 10 - 15
hours/gallon for the "Airtronic 2."
	With the cost of the new units being what they are, I am looking
hard at the BN4 at this point.

Webasto(sp) and Espar both make excellent units, they are mostly used by
truckers to keep their cabs warm when stopped.  they are in the $800-$1200
range depending on features
