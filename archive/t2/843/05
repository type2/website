Since we are on this topic, I've a question related to this same 
thread:

I've a 1969 which has the original VW Gas Cap. It even has a huge VW 
raised-stamped on the cap. I don't want it stolen, and I don't want my 
gas stolen. Its an easy shot to fill your tank from mine.

So my question is: where can I get a locking replacement?

I've checked my FLAPS and they don't sell them. I went to BAP and same 
story. Grrrr! Any help out there??

I have seen some locking gas caps on "That Auction Site" goin for $52.00 that 
might work. The PO of my bus just drilled a hole in the flap and put a lock 
on that. It just really kept the honest folks honest because if you really 
wanted in, you could take a large screwdriver and do some damage and still get the 
gas. Now I have a used locking cap that I found and got rid of that ugly 
lock.
