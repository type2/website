Subject: Any "heat" source

Any"heat" source you can find, that cooks while you drive, even your wife, is
good, and not novel!  My G parents used to cook food on the manifold of their
Model "A", as well use manifold heat,...for heat!  But if the "parent company"
wanted the motor to run "cool:", they want you to use "restaurants".....no?
