Subject: Re: [T2] Electric Bay Window

When I was in college, I worked for TVA.   (OK, Tennessee Valley Authority)  For a while my job was to drive  electric-powered volkswagon rabbits around a test track until they ran  out of juice and record the mileage.  Now some German firm owns  that facility and Chattanooga is big into electric busses.  But I  remember talking to some of the German engineers about them.  They  were really sharp guys.  Don't think they worked for VW,  however.  They did let me run the radio! That was over 20 years  ago and they ran great then.  But not for long enough to be  practical back then.  Memories, memories...    Cheers....KR
