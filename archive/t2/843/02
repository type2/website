Subject: 1700 parts

Looking through the various catalogs and online vendors I can't seem to locate
1700 pistons and cylinders.  Is there a good source for these or are the
obsolete?  1972 CB code engine.

Is there any good information out there that would explain the fitment of the
larger pistons and cylinder kits to the 1700 block, or is it just a bolt on?
It appears the stroke is the much smaller than the 2000, as well as the bore
of 90, so I would assume that a crank would be in order also.

Any guidence would be appreciated.

Eric
