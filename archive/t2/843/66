Subject: Many Thanks

Thank you for all the technical advice and help that you have given me over  
the past year. 
As a dedicated owner of a '58 delivery van in 1958 (delivered small pianos  
and organs during college) followed by '72, '74 '75 '78 '87 Westies '97 EVC  
(Winnebago should be hung) and now my '82 Westy. I have abandoned the flock  by 
purchasing a Big Block GMC Sportsmobile with a huge bed, running water, flush  
toilet  a giant wine cooler (oh come to think of it I think it is a fridge)  
3 burner stove and sink and furnace... would you believe the pop top is  
sprung with garage door springs.  300 ft pounds of torque.  At age 65  my wife says 
I have to leave the bong at home and no more Funkengruven stickers  but I 
have the boxed set of Doors and The Dead on board.
 
Thanks again and bye,
Chuck
PS  thanks Richard
