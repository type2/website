I'm trying to figure out how an exploded muffler could destroy the AFM.
The only way I can think of is if the pressure fed back through the EGR
pipe and valve (does this year have one?) or if the spark occurred exactly
on the valve overlap.  It must have been a heck of a long cranking to get
the entire muffler stoichometric, or perhaps some ether was involved.
