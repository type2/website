I have been warned to take out the push rod and
inspect it...make sure it is not bent, top prevent 

Hmmm. Are you SURE the rocker-arm support thing is in
place correctly and bolted tight? Do the rocker arms
have any unusual play? It sounds like something is out
of place, and that means either loose or bent. Engine
mechanical parts don't suddenly fix themselves...
