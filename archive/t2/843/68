But, what I should have added was: Back home in Oregon, almost *every* Bus
or Vanagon driver gives the "V" symbol. Heck, it's not uncommon to get
waves from VW car drivers.

But, we do get more waves when we are in our Bay. The Vanagon's are just
"too new". ;-)

> Welcome to the Bay Area! :-)

Gawd, I hate traffic. We generally take the train, or other form of PT
when traveling more than 100 miles from home. Shoulda done that on the way
down.

;-) There is an old guy named Don that pumps gas at that Chevron. He'll
talk your ear off, if permitted. He's a hoot.
