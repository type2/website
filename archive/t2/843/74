The more I hear about FI problems  the  gladder I am that mine was retrofitted to a single weber, 009.  I  hear the complaints but it works great for me.  Can't imagine it  could run any better.  Now if it just wouldn't leak oil!   Cheers....KR

I crimped and soldered all the connections on our OTHER diesel vanagon,
but not this one. Guess what I am doing today?

I'm also going to check the nightmare of wiring on our '77 Bay Westy to
make sure the evil fuel injection system is all tight.
