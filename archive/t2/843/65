Subject: bn4, bn6

Hey guys.  Didn't find an immediate answer in  the archives.  For my 76 Westy, can I use either a bn4 or  bn6?  I've found a bn6 I can buy cheap.  What's the  difference between the two?  And, does my heating system all have  to be in good condition for it to even work?  It's disconnected  right now and I'll need some new parts such as a new blower .  I  know it's a pain to install a gas heater but I'm thinking it might be  worth it for me to spend a couple of weekends on it.   Thanks...KR
