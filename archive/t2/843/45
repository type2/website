Hi Don,

You don't have to worry about a bus handling the corrosiveness of  
ethanol... We're already replacing our fuel lines every couple years,  
right? Brazilian aircooled buses have been available pre-tuned for  
Ethanol for quite a few years now.

The main changes associated with an ethanol conversion are rejetting  
the carbs and advancing the timing. Ethanol has more O2 per volume  
than gasoline does, so it's a leaner running fuel and requires larger  
jets if you don't want to overheat the engine. You also need to  
advance the timing and increase the compression ratio to get the best  
"bang for the buck".

The downside of ethanol is that it contains less energy per gallon  
compared to gasoline, so even when it's running perfectly you won't  
get the same gas milage.

Happy trails,
