Subject: Re: [T2] Late model gas tank retrofit

Check the Samba.  There are LOTS of buses being parted out daily.  These are 
private places, NOT 'wrecking yards'.  If you need a 'sure thing', e-mail me 
- I'm talking to a guy with a '69 who's selling me the tank firewall/cover.  
That's half the battle to get the tank out.

I saw a lot of that at the Pick&Pull in Windsor before I moved and had 
kind-of wondered about it .. though I'd just chalked it up as the P&P guys 
being arseholes. I saw them move a pretty decent Squareback by shoving 
forklift blades through the side of it .. made me sick.
