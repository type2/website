aircooled.net shows 'em for you. $289 a set.

As for adding larger ones, the 1800's used the same crank so all you'd need
to change would be having the heads flycut for the larger openings. Case is
unchanged. You can use 2000 ones as well, but the crank is different so
someone else would have to chime in here.
