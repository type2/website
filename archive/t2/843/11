Subject: Double Dork on Me

Well, finally got a chance to play with the GWB today. Hooked the alt cable
up, double checked the solenoids, and tried again. Big backfire, blew the
vacuum caps off the booster ports on the intakes, but otherwise nada.

Decided to start double-checking things. Hmm... waittaminnit! Doesn't the
rotor turn CLOCKWISE?!?!?! So why did I wire it up 1-2-3-4 instead of
1-4-3-2? D'oh!

Of course by now I've drained the battery and have no charger. Have to wait
for the wife to get home with the Volvo so I can use it as a poorman's
charger (battery attached to running car with jumpers to let it charge). One
of these days I *really* need to get a charger.... Sigh.
