Subject: Re: [T2] bn4, bn6

You will probably want to track down a bn4 if you can. Retrofitting the BA6 
will be a little tricky since the baywindow (AFAIK) never came with the BA6.

I managed to track down ALL of the BA6 parts a while back for my 76 westy, 
including a few misc rare pieces that are hard to find in working condition. 
Then even with everything sitting here I couldn't quite manage. I tried my 
local VW shop who were interested in trying to make it work, but it would 
have been really pricey to have someone pro install it.

Hey guys.  Didn't find an immediate answer in  the archives.  For my 76 
Westy, can I use either a bn4 or  bn6?
