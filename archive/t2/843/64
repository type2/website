Mark,
My vote is for the jalousie windows, especially if you do any camping. They can be left open in the rain, providing much needed ventilation for the exit of moisture. They can also be left slightly open when parked in the sun, keeping the van much cooler, but still providing some degree of security (they don't look open from a distance). I had good sucess tinting mine, and the frames polish up really nicely with (a lot) of that magic wadding stuff in the blue tin. The jalousie windows are going into my current restoration.

By the way, I have two sliding windows from a '79 for sale if anyone is interested.
