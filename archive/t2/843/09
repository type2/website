Subject: locking gas door

Hello Timothy,
You could just drill into your flip gas door and add a lock. Any hardware 
store has them (the type that go into a cabinet).  Then cut a whole in the side 
for the lock wiper to enter.  I've seen it on other busses.

I've a 1969 which has the original VW Gas Cap. It even has a huge VW 
raised-stamped on the cap. I don't want it stolen, and I don't want my 
gas stolen. Its an easy shot to fill your tank from mine.

So my question is: where can I get a locking replacement?
