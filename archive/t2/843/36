Subject: PST Dead of Winter campout this weekend (GA)

It is that time of year again...

Peach State Transporters will be holding it's 10th Annual Dead of
Winter Campout at Cloudland Canyon State Park in the NW Georgia
mountains February 3-5.  The park is off GA 136, 8 miles east of
Trenton and I-59, 18 miles NW of Lafayette.

Campsites have water and electric hookups, so bringing space
heaters is a good idea.

We have a potluck dinner Saturday night, so you can bring
something to contribute if you would like to join in.

There are great hiking trails down to the waterfalls as well as
around the canyon rim.  So bring warm clothes, extra blankets,
musical instruments, firewood, and come join us for a great
winter campout.  Cloudland Canyon also has a nice disc golf 
course on top of the mountain, so bring your discs with you.

It looks like the forcast says it will be mild temperatures this 
weekend with a chance of some wet weather.

"Located on the western edge of Lookout Mountain, Cloudland
Canyon is one of the largest & most scenic state parks in Georgia.
The park provides visitors with beautiful vistas of the rugged
geology of this area and an excellent outdoor setting for the camper
or hiker wanting to experience the beauty of the natural world."

So pack some warm clothes and I hope to see you there.
