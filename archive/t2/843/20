Subject: VW quantum engine into 73 bus?

we are looking at this possibility..

size wise, the engine will fit into the bus engine compartment.

The transmission would work too, but would run in reverse..
anyone know if I can put the transaxle of a quantum back together
backwards, and reverse the output rotation?

we are looking for information about the quantum engine,
HP (-at-) RPM, etc.  to see if we'd want to do the conversion.

We've got a full shop millingmachine/lathe, etc etc.

any thoughts?  it is a 4cylinder, fuel injected.  the pan won't
stick down enough to change ground clearance,
we would cut out the rear cross member and make it
bolt back in.
