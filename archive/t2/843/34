Subject: Re: [T2] Late model gas tank retrofit

Use a 68-71 tank.
When you find one, also get the filler neck rubber hose and about a foot of each strap, from the threaded end.
The sender in it will work on a 6V system.

Good luck finding one in good condition. Here in California, all the yards are puncturing the gas tanks. [I
believe it has to do with EPA, probably to prove it has been emptied and now what vapors are left will
evaporate. I know of one gas tank that exploded when they crushed the car.]

 I am planning to do the late model gas tank retrofit into my 63. I had a tank from a 76 already on hand but
the outlets don't look quite right. On this tank there are two outlets that are positioned tword the bottom
right front as looking at the tank with the filler neck to the right. Is the cutout in my 63 going to line up?
I've been under the bus lately doing some fuel line replacement and for some reason I remember the cutout
being tword the right front of the bus. The "How To" on the VB website doesn't specify what year tanks to use
although the swap was done with a tank from a 68 in the article.
