Surprisingly, these heaters are extremely safe and reliable, as long as the 
fuel system is treated like the one for your engine.  SImply said, that's 
all this is anyway - a self-contained, miniature engine.  Replace the fuel 
lines and pump diaphragm, clean and/or replace the plugs, and they will run 
for years.  Somewhere in the archives is a heater installation writeup on 
the BN4 in a bay.  I know because I printed it out myself about 5 years ago. 
  The BN4 is a relatively simple install, should you possess all of the 
necessary parts.  I see more rebuilt and complete heater packages based on 
the BN4 than I do with the BA6.  I may have gone with the other heater, if 
it were not for the fact that 1) I received my heater from a donor that was 
from the same pedigree that my recipient was(early baywindow w/type1 PP) 
which made the installation into my own vehicle easy to visualize, and 2) 
The underside of my bus has an A/C condenser t  On a late bay, the only 
problem that I could see with the installation of a BN4 would be if the 
vehicle had an A/c compressor(York) on the drivers' side of the engine 
compartment, since this is where the BN4 would mount.

Installing either heater in your bus would be much easier if you were
the one that removed it from the donor bus and/or had a working
installation to compare to.  Putting any basket case back together is
going to take a lot of work and knowledge.  The manuals available for
these heaters are geared more towards maintenance, not
installation/assembly.  Imagine trying to put together an engine from
a box of parts when all you've got is the owner's manual that has some
pictures of the engine and how to do a tune up.

Given the amount of time I've spent acquiring working knowledge of my
BA6 while keeping it running, I would prefer to attempt to install a
BA6 instead of a BN4.  On the other hand, given the amount of time
that's been required to keep it running, I would be tempted to put a
much more expensive, modern unit in instead.  They are more self
contained and reliable.  Most likely safer as well, given the age of
the stock heaters.
