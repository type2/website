Subject: Electric Bay Window

If I convert my bay window to electric can I still be
on the Type 2 list?

This might sound like a funny request but with Peak
Oil imminent I feel the need to ask.  I have owned my
type 2 for now almost 30 years and I don't want to
park it in the front yard and use it as a landscape
planter.

With $4 and $5 gas staring us down the throat, I'm
looking for options.
