They are very hard to find because demand is low. Most people just  
rebuild to the larger 1.8L engine size using the same 66mm stroke crank.

I recently found a set of NOS German Kolbenschmidt 1.7L pistons the  
other day in the back of my friend's shop. Since Brazillian Mahle  
sets are NLA and the Chinese sets seem unavailable this German set  
would sell for $400 or so. PM me if you are interested and I'll see  
if he wants to part with them.

There's also another box of just pistons but one of them is missing  
so only 3 in the box.
