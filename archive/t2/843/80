The BN4 is not difficult to install and does not rely on any of the exhaust
air heating system to work. Installing a BA6 in a bus that did not come with
one would be a big job.

I have installed Bn4's in late baywindows and it takes about 8 hours give or
take to do a good job. Another few hours to test and make sure it is set up
right - bench setup is recommended. Installing the intake air duct takes a
while, running the control cable is a pain, running the wiring harness is a
pain, there is a lot of taking apart and putting back to do it right. But it
is just work, not rocket science. It helps to have a donor bus that the
heater came out of, and the VW fresh air heater manual is a must.
