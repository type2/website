 Due to an engine rebuilder  misplacing most of my
 engine accessories I
 need to come up with some replacement items. I have
 a 80 westy 2 liter
 air-cooled, I have a friend who is parting out a 78
 westy with  the same
 type of motor. Does anyone know whether the
 following parts are
 interchangeable. From the 78 to the 80
 
 -Engine wiring harness (computer to sensors ,
 injectors etc....)

* Depends if the 1980 Vanagon is a Calif version or
Fed version.

 -Clutch, pressure plate

* Same 228mm clutch 

 -Air intake bellows ( goes between air flow sensor
 and throttle valve)

* A big NO on the S hose. You need the NLA bay S hose.
