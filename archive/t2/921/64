Here's my procedure for checking a module.  I hope others will confirm/deny.

The only job of the module is to simulate the action of the points. 
This action can be checked by connecting a voltmeter from the - 
terminal of the coil to ground.

When the points are open, whatever voltage is present at the + 
terminal of the coil should also be present at the - terminal, 
because no current is being drawn, so no voltage drop exists across 
the primary. That voltage should be battery voltage = 12V.

When the points close, the voltage at the - terminal should be zero 
because that terminal is now grounded. In my experience, this value 
is not zero but is a fraction of a volt. Since current is now flowing 
in the primary, perhaps there is a voltage drop somewhere to give 
this non-zero value.
