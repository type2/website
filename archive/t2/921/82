if you replace the westy power converter with an inverter/charger,  
something like this:

it will do exactly what you want. you have to do a bit or rewiring  
and somehow integrate the wall control panel into the circuitry, but  
in terms of automatic charing when connected to shore power, then  
automatic inversion of store power when disconnected, it will do  
this, that is what it is designed to do.

i think jamie rivers designed a relay-based circuit that will also do  
this for a lot less money. but the RV inverter charger setup is  
pretty slick.
