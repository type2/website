And don't forget munchies!  Jumper cables, a tow rope or chain,  good spare tire, good tire wrench and working jack (the stock wrench is  a pain), fuel filters, oil, basic tools, etc. No need to call AAA for  something simple.  You'll probably wait a couple of hours anyway.    And don't forget rain gear!  But you probably won't need  any of it in 320 miles.  Have fun.  Adult beverages may help  or hurt depending on whether or not you read the user's manual.   Cheers...KR

Rule #1 = DON'T PANIC.

Sorry to burst your bubble, but 320 miles is not all that long a  
distance for a VW bus. I usually don't sweat the distance for a trip  
unless I have to start saving up for gas money.

If you're driving long distances at highway speeds, don't try to take  
the hills at 75MPH. if the bus wants to slow down, let it. That's  
what the slow lanes are for. Pushing hard on hills will raise head  
temps and that can cause valve/seat issues. If you can afford the  
extra $100 it might be a good idea to have a CHT gauge installed.
