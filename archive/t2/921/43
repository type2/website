This list is so cool!

I just got back from the barn and sure enough, the filler cap is ripped at
the bottom of the ring.  It has two wierd flaps that I believe are the "bird
beak" flaps.  I checked the archives of the Type list and seems like the
"birds beak" model is for California buses?

I have a '79 Cal model.  Gowesty has a filler neck for $29.95 that fits
'79's.  It says "No Unleaded Fuel Restrictor".  Would this work on my Cal
Bus?

By the way, Thanks again to the great wisdom of the list.  I'm am very
relieved it's only that.  (Hopefully!)
