I'm bringing my 8 year old daugher (at least part of the time).  It's in a
public park, and there's a large playground directly in front of the camping
area. If the weather's good there will certainly be other kids playing
there, whether they're with the BBD crowd or not, so you can always wander
over there if she gets bored.
