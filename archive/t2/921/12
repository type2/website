Subject: Re: [T2] weak spark ??

those who may have been following the trials and tribulations of my 78
auto  2liter may remember that I have been having intermittent loss of
power.

this past week end  I went up too JBB, and again it was happening, on the
way home I felt at times like I almost would make it, engine never stalled
or stoppejd but barely any power at times, today I went at it again.

checked the resistor block with a known good one, finally took the
Pertronix out and put points back in, now it won't start at all (it did
run before working on it, I run the engine, change something run the
engine etc)  there is an occasional weak spark from the coil.  ???? aam on
third coil, an MSD, maybe the pertronix was hitting it enough to run but
the points won't ????
  I've tried different rotors etc. ????

any ideas where my spark has gone??

oh just to verify + is #15 and  negative is #1 ???  the points should be
to negative right???  hey it's been a while since I've messed with points
the pertronix has been there for several years with no problems.  maybe
masked some problems even

thanks
Bob
