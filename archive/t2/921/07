Subject: Re: [T2] heater box question - asbestos

Asbestos in the heat exchangers? Geez! Way back when I
first got my bus, a shop overhauled the engine and
hot-tanked the heat exchangers. For years after that,
little grey fibres would come out of the defroster
vents and collect all over the dashboard. That was
asbestos I was breathing? (from a '79) Does anyone
know for sure? -BaH (with a mess of respiratory probs
recent years!)
