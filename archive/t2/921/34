AH HAH,    this is an MSD coil and they say to put one of their resistors
in series with the coil + so it is 12+ going into the resistor, 10 coming
out and going to the coil.   and it acted the same way before I got this
coil with no resistor.   wonderiing what I might possibly daamage if I
bypassed the coil, maybe that is why the points didn't work????  but why
would it now work with the pertronix...

12+

no difference
