So, you went out and checked and found the distance from Wilmington NC to 
Linville NC is 320 miles ! ! !  Don't forget that he may want to return, 
too...  Or is a round trip not in the expectations of the type 2 community.  
I know it's an 'adventure' and many stops are not preplanned, but hey, I 
need to get back to where my social security check is delivered.

OK, according to Yahoo, the run is 320 miles and 7 hours 10 minutes, but 
Mapquest gives a different route, with more miles (368) but less time (6h 
3m)

There must be a third option that would take the scenic route, something 
avoiding major highways (75 mph!!  Man, I only saw that once, and it was 
down hill with a tail wind and just after my quadrennial tune up.  Just 
before my left rear thread separated from the casing...)
