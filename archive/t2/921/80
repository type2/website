Subject: Wiring in an inverter

I am gettinng my 78 back from the body shop soon and here is what I would
like to do:

I would like to keep the shore power input system from the van and add an
inverter to the system.

Has anybody done this?  Making the internal 120 outlet deliver 120AC
wether it be from shore power or an inverter.  Has anybody figured out
some kind of remote switch, or even something auto sensing/switching to
switch the outlet delivering shore power or inverter power.

Have I made this confusing enough?

Any help would be most appreciated!

Mark
