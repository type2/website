Subject: Re: [T2] heater box question - asbestos

Lots in the archives on this:

http://www.type2.com/archive/type2/078856.html

Replaced were the heat exchangers, the heater control boxes, the bellows
tubes, and the four sleeves on the bellow tubes.

Not replaced were the riser tubes from the heat exchanger to the heater
control boxes, since they were pure metal.

Not replaced was the asbestos lined sleeve for the hot air tube that ran
under my '72, nor the 'jacket' that protects the 'Y' hot air tube that
collected the hot air from the two bellows, and a similar jacket up front.
They are / were outside the stream of air that fed the passenger
compartment.

Not replaced were any hot air tubes that circulated air from the engine
compartment, down through a metal jacket (OK, a 'full' metal jacket) that
surrounded the cross-over pipe alongside the catalytic converter - muffler
and which returned heated air to the intake of the fresh air filter box on
the California FI models.

Please research this FART in the archives.

PS. Tom Tarka and I talked with Steve Dolan on Sunday, and it did not seem
that he was in distress.  He was in the middle of preparing the Sukkot
celebration. Possibly the holidays took his attention away from the list...
