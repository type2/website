Steve -

My experienced advice is to obtain the correct bolts from VW themselves,
they've been the only source I can trust on this style of clutch cover
bolt.  I don't know of any aftermarket vendor that carries the correct bolt
(except maybe Bus Depot).  Order 022 141 197 C - (Bus Depot shows them for
$1.81 each).  Note the photo - these have a special head for the 215mm
flywheel and you should not trust your clutch to inferior grade strength
bolts or improper hex heads.
