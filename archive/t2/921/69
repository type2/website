If the voltage stays at 12V then the module is not "closing" and you 
will not get a spark. Do you have a set of points to drop into the 
distributor to replace the module? If so, I would do so and repeat 
the voltage measurement. If it toggles between 12V and 0V, then the 
rest of the ignition system is good and your module is bad.
