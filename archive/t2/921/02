Subject: No wipers on 77 Westy?? Here is diagnostic breakdown so far.

My wipers have decided to take a vacation, so started to look at them as I was
putting in my new Cd player. Here's what I've discovered so far, and would
really appreciate the help, as wiring and I do NOT get along.

>Harness is UNPLUGGED from wiper motor at the motor end.<

When ignition is off, no power to any of the 5 wires on the harness
terminal.(Center is brown ground anyway)

When ignition in on position, power is at the black/grey terminal.

When ignition is on and wiper lever pushed to first position, power is at the
black/grey and the black terminal.

When ignition is on and wiper lever pushed to second position, power is at the
black/grey and the black/yellow terminal.

The black/green terminal never comes on?

That's what I have so far, so could anyone who KNOWS please help me diagnose
this? I'm thinking motor, but don't want to pull it until I know the wiring
and switch are working properly. Should I plug the harness in and see what
power goes to each of the four wires to the wiper motor in each position of
the wiper lever? There is a green, white, red, and blue wire on the motor that
are fed by the above terminals.

Many thanks!
Courtney
