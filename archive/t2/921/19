Subject: Fuel Vents?

Had Scotty in his Vanagon Carrier behind me on the way home from camping
yesterday.  I was in the '79 Aardvark.  We pulled up to a light in
Cassopolis, Michigan and were stopped on a hill nose up.  The light turned
green and I took off and smelled raw gas.   Scotty dialed me up on the cell
and said he had seen gas dripping out on the right side near the exhaust
pipe. (Yikes!)

As I think back on the times I have smelled the gas, it must have always
been on a hill.  It doesn't happen all the time, either.  The fuel lines are
all new from the injectors back to the fuel pump past the filter to where it
comes out of the tank.

What is leaking?   Is it the vent lines?  Could it be the seal on top the
tank?  Does it mean anything that it came out of the right side?

As always many thanks to the great minds on this list that keep our cool
buses running.
