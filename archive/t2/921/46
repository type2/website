 Jules -

 Actually, the "cuffs" for the heater tubes on the 68-79 Bay Window are 111 819 945.  The "251" are way too
large (NLA anyway as previously noted).  You can get them from Airhead Parts:

Hi,
Trying to patch up the heat system before winter (probably common
right about now) and I'm looking for part # 251-255-393D "silicone
cuffs from an aircooled Vanagon" as detailed by ratwell's excellent
heat writeup http://www.ratwell.com/technical/Heating.html.
Anyone know where to find these things?
Oh yeah, Richard's writeup was for 72-79 heat and I'm running at type
1 1600 in a '71, but these cuffs will probably work on my setup,
right? Need something to fill the gap between the heater boxes and
accordian tubes. Currently I've got nothing.

Well.... the rubber sleeves replace tin w/asbestos sleeves on a bay perfectly.

Here is a picture of a bay flapper valve with the original sleeve:

Here is a bay flapper with the 251 255 393B on it, same 60mm size. B is 1st version black, D is 2nd version
orange:

Here is a type 1 heater box. It has a 60mm end, same as the flapper valves, same as Vanagon ends, same as the
sleeves. [Early type 1 heater boxes were smaller, if I remember right 40mm? Someone used to make oddball
accordian tubes for spilt buses that were large on one end and small on the other for people putting in
mis-match sizes]

And here is all the pieces as a group:
