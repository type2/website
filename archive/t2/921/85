Hey guys and gals,

I posted my problem a few days ago, but didn't get any replies,
son I'm trying again.  I hope there's someone out there who can
shed some light on my problem: 

"Pop" (backfire?) when cranking engine, 78 Westy. 

When cranking the engine, there is often a "pop" (backfire?)
from the right side of the engine just before it starts. This
does not seem to be ambient temperature related, and it can
occur with either a warm or cold engine. It can occur if the
engine is shut off and restarted after a few seconds, or if it
has not been started for several days. 

The same "pop" occurs if the accelerator is depressed when
cranking the engine. 

The "pop" happens about 30 percent of the time, but with no
pattern or regularity. 

My bus is a 78 Westy with the original FI engine, and no
alterations. It has 157,000 miles on it and uses one quart of
oil in 1500 miles. It has air conditioning. About 500 miles ago
the following were replaced: distributor cap, rotor, points,
condensor, fuel filter; checked and replaced some vacuum hoses
and fuel lines; checked electrical connections, checked dwell
and timing, tested fuel pressure and volume, checked fuel
mixture with exhaust analyzer. 

Any help will be appreciated.
