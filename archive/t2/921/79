can't find that anywhere in the specs' was running with a 0.8 resistor in
series but only allowed 10 volts to coil. wired exactly as spec,ed by MSD

got it running now and it sounds real nice and dwell/timing are within
spec's but it still has no power to speak of.   wonder if accel linkage is
moved or stretching ??? just doesn't feel like I'm getting it all... get
my wife later to just sit in the seat and push the pedal while I check.

mystified because it is intermittent
