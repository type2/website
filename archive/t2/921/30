Bob,

Yup, 15 is positive and 1 goes to the points...same on all VW's.

Weak spark measured where?  at the center post of the coil?  Before it 
goes anyplace else?

Resistor block only handles ground to the injectors.

Put the pertronix back in....

Check voltage at the positive side of the coil to the engine case...then 
to the body and let us know.

Check the voltage with just the positive  coil wire not  hooked to 
anything....referenced against the voltage from battery terminal to 
battery terminal...why is it different?

Got anything else wired to the positive side of the coil that might be 
drawing a lot of power?....or something wired in with it up front when you 
turn the key on?  How much voltage from the positive wire at the front
of the bus...once again?  different from battery terminal to battery 
terminal?

Checked trans to body ground strap?  I think you *did* finally go thru 
your electrical and if I remember correctly, put on the really nice battery
straps and connectors?

Run a wire straight from your battery pos side to the coil...with nothing
else hooked to the positive side of the coil and then see what your spark 
looks like...

Cheers, dave
