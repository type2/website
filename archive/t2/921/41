Jules -

Actually, the "cuffs" for the heater tubes on the 68-79 Bay Window are 111
819 945.  The "251" are way too large (NLA anyway as previously noted).  You
can get them from Airhead Parts:

Ignore the $17 price shown on the page - they're actually $7.95 each (Gotta
fix that tonight).  Got 11 in stock.  800-550-5036 & talk to Jason.
