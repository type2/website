Hi Karl -

I've also seen these in Black or Orange, but I have never measured them.
Current production of the "cuffs" out of Europe is Grey, 60mm ID x 66mm OD,
with one end flanged at about 75mm, the flange being 10mm thick - overall
length is 28mm.  Although the fiche and the printed parts book doesn't
show/list these separately in the Bay Window Parts List, they appeared years
ago "magically" in the ETKA, T2, Illustration 24-00, Item 15a and we've used
them on a couple of late Bay Windows here at the shop along with several
Ghias.  Could be the 251-255-393B is about the same size as the 111-819-945
currently available (I just remember it from 10 years ago as being bigger on
my Ex 80 Vanagon, but I could be wrong - memory wasn't first thing to go
when the ticker went bad <grin>).

Fresh Air Heater Boxes (1500/1600) from 68 (Type 1 & Type 2) onwards are
60mm pipes on the HB flappers and after checking the Bay and Vanagon Flapper
Boxes, they are of course 60mm as well.  I also fitted the 111-819-945
"cuff" onto them - nice and snug fit.

The earlier Fresh Air Heater Boxes are 50mm outlets.

Thanks for your input on this.
