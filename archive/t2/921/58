Robert and Dave:

Great question and article! It's one more thing to consider - but quite
important. I've been considering dropping a diesel engine in
(eventually)
and converting to a bio-diesel-plug-in-hybrid. Diesel doesn't present
the
same explosion hazards that regular gasoline does, so it may be 'safer'
for
a hybrid. I'm also thinking of using recycled oils (from restaurants,
etc.).

I contacted the company that VWREL contracted to install the lithium
cells
into the Chameleon. No response yet, but I'll forward on any info I
receive
to this list. Anyway, I'm glad other people are thinking of converting
like
this.
