Bob,

Betting that you have fried the coil.  :-((

Coil will get hot if you just leave the ignition on...and yes, I have 
fried one that way too....walked off and forgot ignition was on for about 
45 minutes.

Ok, down to the real nitty gritty(frothy beverage in hand).

Coil only needs a make and break to ground from the points side to make a 
spark.

unplug pertronix and everything else on the coil.

Run hot wire directly to coil.

run a piece of wire from points side of coil and momentarily touch it to 
ground and then back from ground.

Make spark?  Try it with a different coil.

Cheers, dave
