I doubt you'ld notice much if any difference in fuel mileage with or  without the spare up front.  The box itself is what creates the  drag.  Plus, I think it looks kind of cool, especially if you have  a cover.  I'm going to paint a saxophone on mine.  Have  fun....KR

how bad is that for fuel milage ?
 
it really takes up too much space inside but what else do you do ?
