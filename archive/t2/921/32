engine off,   12 plus a bit
engine on,    10 and a half +-

12+ same all direction

not that I am aware of

same (or very close, have twin batteries one seems a little lower than the
other by a few fractions, shouldn't be enough to matter, also I have
isolated each battery while running and no difference

forgot this check when out there, will try next

that lower voltage to coil from ignition seems to be a hint at something
maybe a relay on the coil wire might help run, but won't solve the
underlying problem, in fact the Pertronix may have kept the engine running
long after it would normally have failed
