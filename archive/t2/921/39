Subject: Heater Box/Accordian Tube cuffs

Hi,

Trying to patch up the heat system before winter (probably common
right about now) and I'm looking for part # 251-255-393D "silicone
cuffs from an aircooled Vanagon" as detailed by ratwell's excellent
heat writeup http://www.ratwell.com/technical/Heating.html.

Anyone know where to find these things?

Oh yeah, Richard's writeup was for 72-79 heat and I'm running at type
1 1600 in a '71, but these cuffs will probably work on my setup,
right? Need something to fill the gap between the heater boxes and
accordian tubes. Currently I've got nothing.

Thanks

peace
jules
