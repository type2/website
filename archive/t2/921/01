folks,
here is the story. I have reached critical mass with
my buses. So what i have is a 1977 orange Riviera. It
has a poptop and zbed but no sink/stove/fridge stuff.
no cabnet whatsoever. 

good tranny, but no engine. I have a 1700 type4 long
block with 25K on it that needs new head (included)
and would be a good contender. It included dual Solex
carbs from a 74 that work good, but there are no fuel
injections parts whatsoever.

There is light surface rust but nothing serious. This
would be a good base for a project. It is almost
totally dent free.

I have a title too.

BUT it has to be gone in the next week or 10 days,
tops. It doesn't drive but needs to be towed. 

This rig is way to good to be crushed and I will not
tolerate that. If you want it to part it out, please
don't bother.

If you are seriously interested, i will spam you with
a dozen or more photos. 

It is located at zip 83843, which is 400east of
seattle in the idaho panhandle.  The tires are good
enough to pull it home.
