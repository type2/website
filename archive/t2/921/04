Normally this is my first question.... lol.. when was the stereo 
installed.... that usually leads to allllll kinds of mix ups that are just 
plain guesses from my end...
If you have buggered the stock config,, then we will really have to start 
guessing...

here is what I think

>Harness is UNPLUGGED from wiper motor at the motor end.<
>

That will cause your switch inside the motor to never send power to the 
black/green.... as you have unplugged the power to that switch. It is the 
parking switch.. it allows the wipers to find the park position before they 
shut off,, no matter what you do with the dash switch...  except the 
ignition switch.. turning it off will stop the wipers before they park

This is correct....

> When ignition in on position, power is at the black/grey terminal.

This is correct....

This is correct....

This is correct....

> The black/green terminal never comes on?

This is correct....  plug the harness back together and test again..... if 
the wiper motor doesn't move,,  and it is in the park position.. then the 
switch will be open and there still will not be any power there
you have to have the wiper motor in mid cycle to have power at this wire.

 Yes, but make sure your voltmeter is using the same ground wire as the 
motor.. measured at the motor.
This will tell you if you have an open ground...

The only thing common to all your problems here is
no ground to motor
brushes have failed

If you have ground to the motor,, and power to terminal 53 or 53 b... which 
you can do with a hot wire.. the motor should operate.
If it doesn't .. it is seized,, or the brushes are open... or something else 
inside the motor

hope that helps
