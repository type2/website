Remove the fuel filler cap and stick your finger in
the hole. Feel all the way around the inside of the
opening. Chances are you'll find a rip in the rubber
filler neck hose. BTW - when you find one - I used to
buy a couple extras cuz they were only $6 each! Get
the non- unleaded ones (prolly all that is available)
for about 1/4 the cost of the sleeved-down unleaded
type. Yes, I'm pretty confident that's the "leak"!
