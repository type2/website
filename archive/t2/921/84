Subject: Re: [T2] Wiring in an inverter

I put a 1200 watt inverter in mine to run the
microwave! Learned not to do so while driving at 60mph
on two lane hiway, but that is indeed a different
story and besides the burns are all healed now!

The switching you seek is common to boat people. I got
a lot of help at West Marine and ended up buying my
cables there (6 foot run with almost no loss = $$$) I
have no need for automatic switching as I only have
one outlet hardwired to the inverter - I never use it
for frivolous stuff - just hungry-time mostly while
en-route to a destination (rest areas, etc.) -BaH
