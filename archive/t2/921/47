Subject: Dual Kadron linkage on type 4 engine

So I have finally found an affordable set of manifolds for my Kadrons and I
received part of the linkage with it. Problem is that I have no idea how to
mount this thing and I am missing the pieces that connect to the carbs (and
I have no idea what they look like ...).

Here is what I have: http://marcusschaper.de/kadronlinkage1.jpg ; different
perspective: http://marcusschaper.de/kadronlinkage2.jpg. (these are
moderately sized, but the server can be slow)

Does anyone have pictures of dual Kadrons installed on a type 4 engine using
this linkage? Any leads on the missing pieces would be appreciated, too. If
you have an extra Kadron carb (or two) sitting around somewhere, please also
let me know as I am not sure whether I can trust both of mine.

Thanks,
Marcus
