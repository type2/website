Subject: Re: [T2] No wipers on 77 Westy?? Here is diagnostic breakdown

Thankyou Jamie, you are a god send! In fact this happened when I WAS 
installing the Cd player, so I have been kicking myself trying to find a 
missing wire, but everything appears fine. I have plugged the harness back 
in and still nothing. I will test for the ground next. There is a big brown 
wire that goes from a grounding spade on the body, directly to the wiper 
motor body via a ring connector on one of the bolts. Is this the direct 
wiper ground I should be testing for? Also, can I just run a direct hot wire 
to terminal 53 or 53b without shorting anything? I would only touch it for a 
second to see if the motor jumped to life? What about the big ground in the 
middle of the 5 wire terminal block? As you can see I know enough about 
wiring to be dangerous. I am assuming because the switch appears to direct 
the electricity to the correct wires in teh 5 wire terminal block, that IT 
is probably working ok? Do wipers just decide to quit without warning when 
the motor fails?
Thanks again,
Courtney
