What happens when a vehicle packed with lithium ion
cells gets in a wreck? Something like a semi truck
rear-ending it at speed?  Or - better yet - a Seattle
Metro bus also running on lithium ion batteries?  I
have heard that some of the RC plane guys have had
lithium ions burn right through their cars and into
the asphalt below when they had a failure while
charging (usually off their car battery / in the car
engine compartment) One story was that it burned right
through the car's engine block. Any truth to those
stories, ya think? -BaH
