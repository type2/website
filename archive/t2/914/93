Great.  VWoA is going nuts.  Just wait.  All these movies we have seen
that have VW's that make cameo appearances will probably be "fixed",
leaving VW Bus, Bug, and Ghia shaped holes where they "removed" the
trademarked item.    

Gee... this email contains the letters VW right next to each other.  Are
we gonna have to start referring to our VW's as "Those that must not be
named?"

Here's one of the images I was using:

Totally created by me, no VW logo or anything. Complete B.S.
