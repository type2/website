Subject: removing windshield scratches

I didn't find a solid answer in the archives, so here goes.............

My windshield is hazed to the point that I avoid driving at night. 
Given the difficulty of finding windshield rubber that works, I would 
like to explore removing the scratches and haze by polishing them out 
without removing the windshiels. Does anyone have success stories to 
share?

I see that Eastwood makes a kit for deep scratches and one for not so 
deep ones.
