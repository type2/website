Subject: Pulled off rear drum, new seal leak all of a sudden?

I pulled the rear drums off my 70 swingaxle bug by loosening the big 217 ft. lb. nut, in order to do a brake job. I assembled the one side WITHOUT torquing the big nut back on and left it to attend to other jobs. After about 5 days, I noticed that the axle seal had weeped out enough tranny fluid to drip once onto the ground. Now this has never leaked before, so I'm assuming that loosening the big nut allowed the seal to "relax" somewhat. When I tighten it back up, I'm hoping this will stop the leak. Am I kidding myself? Seems weird that it would leak when it's never leaked before.
Thanks,
Courtney
