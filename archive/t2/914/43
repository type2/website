Subject: Re: [T2] wondering about a 1776

if you can, stick a nice stock 2 liter type IV engine in there and at
least someone will know how to work on it, if you build the 1776 yourself
and expect to be able to do all the work on it yourself then go for it,
but the more you depend on someone else to work on your ride, the more I
recommend staying as close to stock as possible

well that is my opinion, worth every penny you paid for it
