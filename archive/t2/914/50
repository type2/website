  I'm assuming you have already considered the rear safari kits out there.  I've thought about that, but I'm not the thrilled with the looks of the frame on a bay.
   
  Now a jalousie type window would be cool.  I've even come across some windows for small rear hatch splitties that had a slider window, similar to those used on some of the Rivieras on the cargo doors.

  Has anybody done this? Replace the window in the back
end with one that opens, I mean. Would anybody be
interested in getting one if it became available?
