Subject: Re: [T2] blue smoke

Hi James,

Blue smoke is made by burning oil. Black smoke is over-rich mixture.  
White, sweet smoke is burning coolant. (watercooled).

It's possible that you have oil seeping into the combustion chambers  
when the engine is off, either getting past the rings or through the  
guides. Another source for this oil could be your intake system...  
the case breather vents oil vapor into the intake and it might be  
collecting in the intake when the engine is off, only to burn off all  
at once when the engine is restarted.

A compression test will tell you if your rings are OK. Checking the  
intake for oil isn't difficult. Checking the guides means pulling the  
springs and that would be a PITA.

How old are the heads?  If the heads are known good and compression  
is good then I wouldn't worry about it much.

Happy Trails,
