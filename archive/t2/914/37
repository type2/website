Subject: por-20 vs por-15

both por-20 and por-15 come in high-temp formulas.  if i wanted to paint my
muffler, a chromed four tipper, and exhaust manifolds and exhaust pipes and
possibly heater boxes to both dress them up and prevent further rusting,
road chemical damage, etc. which should i use?  the por-15 comes in color
factory gray and por-20 comes in color satin aluminum.  pros, cons.

Thanks,


jeremiah
