Subject: Fw: [VB] BBB XI Announcement

Hey Sam,

 No need to pre-register we will not run out of goodie bags and stickers
 ever again!  Last BBB we were overwhelmed with 1/3 more Buses then usual.
 We ran out of raffle tickets twice that weekend and that won't happen again
 either!

 The wheels are in motion already to have an even better "BusesBytheBridge"
 and we look forward to seeing you there!

 Lou in Havasu
