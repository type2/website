   Plus there are buses and parts in Eugene, Corvallis, and several 
places in the PDX area (including east and west side locations of 
Discount Import Parts which specializes in bug racing stuff, but carries 
and can get a lot of new parts for buses).

   Oregon is a good place for buses!

Hi Karl,

I live near Ashland, Oregon, about 3 to 4 hours from you. There are
bazillions of busses around here. In Medford (12 miles away) there
is an import parts store that specializes in air-cooled VWs, in
Talent (3 miles away) there is a junk yard with a half dozen bay
window busses and a bunch of bugs and Vanagons. In Weed, California
(about 40 miles south) there is a junk yard with a gaggle of bays,
splitties, and bugs.

It might be a bit of a drive but the country is beautiful and the
area has great live theater (Three theaters), live concerts (Britt
festival) and lots of great restaurants. Go ahead and move...you'll
be glad you did.

Jeff
