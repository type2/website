 I use one of these on our Sailboat that has a gasoline (Atomic 4) engine:


http://www.westmarine.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/producte/10001/-1/10001/12285/0/0/detector/All_2/mode+matchallpartial/0/0

 It has a alarm and a fuel cutoff function. So, I am planning on installing
one of them (with a fuel cutoff solenois) on our '65 Panel as well.

 Has anyone else done this? Comments?

Not a very stunning review...... 1 star out of 5!

      Strengths:  Very sensitive to fumes, easy to install, looks nice.
      Weaknesses: Unit failed after 2 months and was not covered by the manufactures 1 year warranty.
      Review Summary: The circuitry is open in the back, and in my case, the unit failed after two months. The
unit was sent to the manufacture who denied service under the manufacture's one year warranty claiming the
unit failed due to water damage. The unit was professionally installed on a 30+ foot cabin cruiser, and
although it may have come into contact with water from the detailer who washes the boat, electonics used on
boats should be able to withstand some sea spray from the wind or a casual spray by someone cleaning the boat.
If a unit can fail after 2 months, and not be covered by the warranty, I wonder how long the unit's average
lifespan is.
