Subject: Re: [T2] Opening Back WIndow?

From Busahaulic:

Has anybody done this? Replace the window in the back
end with one that opens, I mean. Would anybody be
interested in getting one if it became available?

They would certainly be nice for camping but would
probably draw in exhaust while driving. I'm thinking
of something like a pickup back window that opens in
the center, sliders on both sides, with a removable
screen.
Discussion welcomed. -BaH
