Be careful to not get too much flammable liquids on the engine. Ask me 
how I know. Fiat 131 - - - poof! No damage though as I ws prepared with 
a fire extinguisher. Was back when the car was fairly new. Friend ran 
for the hills having watched too much TV and thinking that any car that 
catches on fire or has a crash immediately bursts into flame! <griN!>

Pressurize the exhaust with a compressor and listen for leaks. Also a 
good way to listen for burnt valves. Beware, setup requires lossening 
the rocker arms enough that all of the exhaust valves close. Not as easy 
as Cliff's solution.
