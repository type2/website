Put it back up.  They have no control over a public domain item.  Then send
a nasty letter to the geniuses at VWoA.  Given their dismal sales and
reputation for poor quality (I know -- I own a 2004 Touareg and I have more
than 30 dealer service invoices, each with several items...), this kind of
pettiness simply alienates their potential -- and existing -- customers even
more.

Heck, if you do it, I'll sign the letter with you.

My cafepress sites got shut down, along with any other ones with an
image of a VW in it.

Here's one of the images I was using:

Totally created by me, no VW logo or anything. Complete B.S.
