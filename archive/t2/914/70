Subject: Oktoberbus stuff update

Talked with my T-shirt guy tonight.  Still need a few more commitments 
before I go ahead and have them printed up.  Let's just say that the 
knight on the bus is back with a twist and we're honoring Oktoberbus's 
10th anniversary.

The decorate the castle thing is a definite go.  All the cool stuff 
y'all have decorated your buses with over the years will go great in there.

Don't forget the decorate your fruit contest, as far as I'm concerned 
Pumpkins are fruits too so don't think you can only paint a grape or 
something, get creative!
