Subject: RE: [T2] Opening Back WIndow?

Isn't this what the hatch does?
Open for camping, stick a screen on the snaps and enjoy the breeze.
I don't think it's recommended to drive with the windows propped
open regardless, much less a hatch ;)

Has anybody done this? Replace the window in the back
end with one that opens, I mean.

They would certainly be nice for camping but would
probably draw in exhaust while driving. I'm thinking
of something like a pickup back window that opens in
the center, sliders on both sides, with a removable
screen.
