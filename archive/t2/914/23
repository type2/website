I use one of these on our Sailboat that has a gasoline (Atomic 4) engine:

http://www.westmarine.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/producte/10001/-1/10001/12285/0/0/detector/All_2/mode+matchallpartial/0/0

It has a alarm and a fuel cutoff function. So, I am planning on installing
one of them (with a fuel cutoff solenois) on our '65 Panel as well.

Has anyone else done this? Comments?

Jon
