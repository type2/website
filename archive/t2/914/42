Subject: wondering about a 1776

Hi gang,

My mechanic has recommended that I consider a larger motor for my 1970 SO 69 
Westy with a full length (hanging over the tailgate) Adventurewagen top.  What 
do you guys think of this deal?

Has anyone on the list done any business with West Coast Core in Lancaster, 
CA?

Thanks,
Jacques
