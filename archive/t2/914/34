Subject: blue smoke

Hi list

Something is up with my bus.
Occasionally when I start my bus up I get a puff
of blue smoke out the exhaust. It isn't all the time
But it happens. The motor can be cold or hot.

It's a FI 1700 , running colder bosch plugs
can't recall the number offhand but the correct ones,
not platinum or anything silly like that.

I do have a slight exhaust leak but if I recall correctly
it was doing this before that started.

The motor was rebuilt 2 summers ago (full rebuild)
Is this a motor problem or richness of fuel?

Ideas to check?
James
