Subject: Cabinet Removal - 79 Westy

It seems that some little critter had made a home in my Westy. I've removed
everything I can see but am not sure if I got everything.  The problem
location on the left side of the bus in the area between the "closet" and
frig, under the shelf in the cabinet that has the frig control and cooling
fins.  I've removed the shelf and cleaned everything up but there may be
some leftover stuff under the board that is on the floor just in front of
the wheel well.

 

The question is - how can move/remove this board?  Do I have to remove all
the cabinets?  What is the least amount of stuff I have to remove to get to
this area?  What is the best plan for attack?  

 

TIA,

 

Wayne
