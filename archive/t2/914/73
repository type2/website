Dean -

First, it helps to know WHAT you have to give a proper answer, but it's
really simple.

Bosch 00012 - For all Points System Ignitions through 1979 (Vanagons 80 thru
83.5)  That's either the $12.95 (Bosch Mexico) or $28.39 (Bosch Brazil).  I
use the Bosch Mexico on my 72 411 Wagon with no problems.

Bosch 00041 (211 905 115 B) - For all with Hall Electronic Ignition
Bus/Vanagon 79-83.5.  This is the $72.08 variety.
