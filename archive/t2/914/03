going to fix yer bus at buddahs this weekend,... should have al the help i ned to take a look over whats happening.....

thanks guys...

now  if i could figure out how to fix the wifes beetle... the master  cylinder wont fill back up and keeps squeeshing sound at me when the  brakes are pushed..?
the back brake lines are full of air bubbles the front brakes are ok..no air bubbles...

the  master cylinder wouldnt have emptied had i known there was aleak in the  brake fluid container and when bleeding brakes it got worse...thats how  i found it..the leak...
