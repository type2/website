Subject: finally, engine is out; studs or bolts?

the engine is finally out and it only took me and a friend about an hour.
neither of us had ever done this before.  tommorrow, perhaps the heads will
come off.  little short on time with the kids in soccer.  two games
tommorrow.  bentely consistently refers to the bolts holding the engine to
the final drive as bolts.  i was a bit surprised when the two bottom bolts
were actually studs and i had to back them out in order to clear the final
drive housing.  should these be studs?  or should i purchase some bolts to
put back?  thanks to everyone who gave me advice and encouragement.  now to
figure out what to do with the heads and then put it all back together
again.  obviously, expect more silly questions from me as i progress.
