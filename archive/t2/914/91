Gee Mike, I'm sorry! As it went, I started to reply to
your posting way back then, but did something wrong
and lost the message after one-finger typing for
several minutes and got a bit PO'd cuz I was preparing
to leave on a trip, was buried under everyone else's
needs and just didn't need the hassle of re-typing a
reply that generally goes thankless anyway!

Besides that, in your posting you mentioned that you
were going to try some things to do with vacuum leaks.
I think my reply was based on the possibility that
some of the larger vacuum hoses that are "formed"
appear to be connected when they are not and that they
appear to be in good shape when they are really
crumbling to dust. You need to take ahold of each hose
and verify that it is intact and connected.

Your particular symptoms seem to point toward possible
fuel delivery problem. It could be a problem with the
pump not running all the time (unlikely) or a blockage
such as an old hose coming apart inside and a "flap"
acting as a valve and blocking it off. It could be a
problem with the pressure regulator and if so, you
could pinch the return line about halfway closed and
see if that helps (closing it completely will cause
pressures over 100psi and will blow apart any weak
part of the fuel rail!)

It could be something like what I suspected in that
other inquiry - bad points causing weak spark that is
enough to start only under perfect conditions. It
could be an intermittant problem with the double
relay. It could be a bad coil or a bad condensor (both
common no-start when hot).

There are a lot of things it could be. You say the
starter works every time - the engine does not fire
when hot. My standard reply to this symptom is to do a
compression check as it is the classic symptom of a
cracked head or dropped valve seat, both are common in
high mileage engines. To do a compression check, read
Richard's excellent tutorial (whether you already KNOW
or not!)
http://www.ratwell.com/technical/FAQ/FAQContent.html
I feel it is better to do the compression check early
on cuz all the diagnoses time is wasted if the
compression check shows there is none in #3 cylinder!

The head temp sensor, when it goes out, usually causes
a very rich condition and seldom a lean condition. To
test, clip an ohm meter to the disconnected lead and
the other meter lead to ground. At somewhere around
room temperature 96 degrees) there should be somewhere
around 2400 ohms resistance. Higher temp / lower
resistance. If your within 500 or so it shouldn't make
a significant difference on starting. You did not
mention any black smoke, so it likely is not rich. You
mentioned starting with ether so it is likely a weak
spark or lack of fuel or lack of compression. If it
keeps running after strting with ether, then I lean
toward weak spark or low compression.

Check the archives - there are over 1800 entries
regarding "...won't start..."

Any other clues you can give, after checking all the
hoses and wiring connections will be helpful. Keep in
mind that this is all volunteer, too, please! Hope
this helps. -BaH
