Subject: dropped valve seat

pulled the 1/2 head yesterday.  exhaust manifold was tough to remove.  even
if i had never heard of a dropped valve seat i could have guessed that is
what happened by looking at the head after i removed it.  the #1 intake
valve was sitting cocked on the seat which was jammed about half in half out
of the port.  the piston was slightly marred about 3/4 of an inch off center
on the bottom side.  all the pushrod tubes were bent or dented though the
pusrods all seemed straight. the insert that fits into the dished part of
the #2 exhaust cam follower/ solid lifter was also sitting slightly cocked.
pulled it out and could not reset it.  guess i'll take it down to archway
imports and see if they can fix it or if i need a new one.  all seemed very
overwhelming yesterday.  doesn't seem so bad today.  still not sure if i'll
have time to get it all reassembled before winter.  on the up side i've to
this point saved myself lots of money by doing all this myself with help of
course from this knowledgeable and uber helpful list.  on a completely
different note,  looked for POR-20 here in stl and could find any.  noone
had even heard of it.  figure if i can find it i'll paint my "quality" empi
muffler with it before it completely rusts out.  if it rusted as much as it
did in 6 months i'd hate to see it in 6 more.
