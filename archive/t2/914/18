Hmmm... That looks ripe for a Type 4 conversion!

No, the type 4 is too heavy. You have to add too much ballast in the tail to balance the plane. 
Then you are over the weight limit...... 

Most people build a Soneri airplane. http://www.greatplainsas.com/sonerai.html
Weight limit is 750 lbs. A complete 2180 type 1 weighs 170 lbs.
