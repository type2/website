I've found this to be quite useful on the bus
though I got started using it some time ago on
galvanized plumbing at our farm:

brand: Calfonex
product name: Pipe Break

As far as I can tell, it is the best penetrating
lubricant there is.  I've freed up stuff that 
had no business coming apart without explosives.

Googling for brand & product name I find 5 (only)
references, one of which is Watertown Supply
which is where I buy it (that is a real plumbing
supply house, none of that big-box home center
crap).  Going for brand only, Thomas Register,
Kaufman, and other industrial supply houses
have the brand.
