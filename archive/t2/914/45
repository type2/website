Hiya Jacques,

I'd be wary of installing a a 2 liter Type IV engine.  I looked into this 
possibility and discussed it with Jake Raby when I first got my 1970 Bus.  There 
are a bunch of problems to overcome in this conversion.  It can be done - but 
then anything can be done if you throw enough time and money at it.

But I definitely do hear you when you say that the bus needs more power.  I 
would take my time and do a bunch of research if the objective is to find a 
reliable engine builder.  There are too many places out there willing to do a 
slipshod job for a fast buck.
