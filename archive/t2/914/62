Subject: Intermittant loss of power solved- double relay

For about a year my daughter complained of her 75 randomly losing power, 
or cutting out- not due to fuel starvation (not related to more demand 
or going uphill) or AFM track separtion, or noticable air leaks-the 
porsche guys in Savannah by her college could not figure it out. Finally 
the night before our 800 mile drive to her college it did it while I was 
with her, and it felt like electrical cut out to me (loss of power, 
stumbling not related to throttle position) and so I left it idling as I 
laid back over the engine access hatch and wiggled every connector I 
could get my fingers on- lo and behold I wiggled the double relay 
connectors and it stumbled and died!
    Pulled the relay and swapped it for another, including dremyling the 
male brass connectors.  Drove fine the whole way.  Does anyone provide 
new/cleaned female connectors just for the double relay/resistor pack, 
or should I find  a "new" harmess?  It's the rare 1975 6 pin AFM 
connector one.
