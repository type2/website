I'm going to make a bunch of assumptions.  Robert can tell me where I go wrong.

From "a while back", it sounds like Robert's mechanic already
installed this rebuilt engine in the 78, and now Robert is looking at
the possibility of transplanting it into a 69-72 bus.

I assume he means 69-71 (the ones with the T1 upright engine).

Since Robert is reading a T4 engine code off a T4 fan shroud, I'm
going to assume he's got a T4 engine in the 78.  I'm not an expert on
the matter, but I assume putting together a 1600cc T4 engine would
take a lot of creativity and be much more difficult than one of the
stock sizes (1.7L, 1.8L or 2.0L).  I'm going to assume that despite
what Robert's mechanic said, the displacement of his engine is not
1600cc.

I'm going to assume that when Robert is wondering if his engine is "a
1600", he's really wondering if it is a T1.  Regardless of
displacement, swapping the T4 engine from his 78 into a 69-71 bus that
came with a T1 engine isn't going to be straightforward.

Mark has reminded me in the past what happens when you make assumptions.  ;-).
