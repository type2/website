Subject: RE: [T2] High Head Temp (Long)

 My standard 78 bus with A/C on at 99 F degrees reads
 325 to 375
 on the 3/4 head at 75 mph up or down hill.

Sorry... I guess I just don't comprehend the problem.
Is it not running correctly? What are the indications
that it's too hot? Is there a standard temperature
that you are trying to match? If you are trying to
match something that somebody else is getting you need
to both have the same setup on your gauges. Maybe
yours is correct. Maybe theirs isn't. Maybe yours is
correct at 275 but not at 375. If there is no problem
in the performance - no detonation on hard pull at
high temp reading, then what's the problem?
Quoting a posting I made in 1999 while using a single
VDO gauge: On my '79 bus, with somewhat stock exhaust
it cruised at 350,hit 450 on hard pulls. With better
exhaust sys, it cruised at about 250-300.
Quoting a post I made later while using a Westach quad
aircraft gauge: The cyl head temps vary a great deal
all the time. My #3 cylinder typically
runs at about 350 degrees. On long hard pulls, it will
climb to 425.
Typical freeway use sees it go from 350 to 425 and
back to 350 in less than a mile! It's amazing that
these engines can hold together heating and cooling
that significantly ALL THE TIME!   I can use a squirt
of my 5th injector to cool things off if they get out
of hand, or just do a quick adjust of the mixture
control and then kick it back again when I get over
the hill.
This was with a T4 2L motor running 86mm pistons and
stock heads that were tweaked by Mark Stephens with a
compression ratio of 10.92:1. I got about 100k miles
out of that engine. Had I not made the mixture
adjustable I probably would not have gotten nearly
that much as temps did sometimes get over 500 before I
made the mixture mods.
It is good to get all your seals right, though. I had
an engine that originally had AC and the tinwork was a
mess. There were massive holes when the AC was still
there. I removed the compressor and switched to
"normal" tin. Of course I don't really need AC as I
stay pretty much in coastal areas. - BaH
