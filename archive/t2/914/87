Subject: Best fuel injection  hose for todays gas ?

whats the best fuel hose for todays gas with the ethonol in it ?
 
My friends 77 Westy  has a small gas leak so its time to change all  the 
hoses , 
 
I am sure it is not going to be a fun job , 
 
is it easier to pull the motor   ( I could replace the clutch  then anyway )
 
Ohh and how many feet will I  need ?
 
thanks for your help.....
