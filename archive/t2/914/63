well one thing for sure. it would have had a t4 engine originally (2L)
and if he says he is putting in a 1600 which would be an engine from a
t1(upright) or a t3(square, notch etc) unless he explains what and why and
is prepared to do it right you probably dont want to give him your money.
he will be creating a bastard for no good reason, except maybe he doesnt
know much about t4 engines.

also, if the body is in bad shape you might not want to put a lot of money
into it mechanically.
