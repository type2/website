Subject: [T2] Another Starting Problem (cranksd, no start when hot)

I just dealt with this problem a few weeks ago. In my case, it was the
cylinder head temp sensor, which threads in near the firewall on the
driver's side head. It's an $18 part, and kind of a pain to get to
with a 13mm wrench, but I'd try that first. I figure at that price,
don't jack with testing etc, just replace it and see what happens. I
have two other friends locally with late FI bays, and both have had
the same problem and solution in the last year. HTH-
