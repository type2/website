Subject: FS: 78 Transporter Parts

As i get ready for the winter project, i want to offer up the 78
parts bus for anyone who needs some parts.

Front and Rear Seats (No Middle Seat), complete dash, and more.  Auto
Tranny and it's shifter and linkage are going to AccessBob (when ever
your ready Bob).

also in there is the complete H style celing AC unit and compressor,
all cables, hoses and wires too.

Make offers, it all must go.  All im keeping is the shell and pan.

Thanks,

David.
