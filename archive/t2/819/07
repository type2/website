Sounds like a solution we need to homebrew!!! More
power, better emissions, better fuel efficiency...
Think we could do it for less than $14K?

I am having trouble with basic math in this
equation...

They are spending $14K for a unit that saves $700 a
month on fuel that costs $5 a gallon to make from
natural gas that is going to double and triple in
price this winter??

Right now in Fresno, Calif diesel is $2.55 a gallon

Is the FederaL government subsidizing this??
