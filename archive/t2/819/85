LUK from Bus Depot- Pressure disk and friction disck combo.  Got this 
after the Sachs Canadian friction disk self-delaminated off the rivets 
70K after I got it as a replacement(the ORIGINAL lasted 150K and was 
still good in 1995 but as we were leaving on a 10 wk trip, I decided to 
pull it and replace it.
Amazing on the difference in feel of the LUK as you push the pedal down- 
like butter!

there
  an excellent clutch available that will not cause me any problems?
