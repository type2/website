Is the unit for the SVDA distributor the same as the unit for the 009?  I
Googled up the install instructions and it mentions VW 009, magnetic, and
hall effect distributors, but no other VW point distributors.

The price, at ~$135 for both breakerless ignition and CDI module seems
pretty reasonable.
