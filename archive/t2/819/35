First of all, my eyes aren't good enough to use my slide rule anymore.
Second thought is that the truckers and most everyone else will probably use
the extra power to go faster instead of getting better mileage.  Just what I
need, a train of trucks passing my bus at 100 miles an hour instead of the
70 or 80 that they already do.  Gives a whole new meaning to the term
"windblown"
I guess I'm feeling a little cynical tonight, sorry.

 bah humbug
