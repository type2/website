   My long-term plan is to have a bus that runs on bio-diesel. If I have to 
get a Vanagon (almost bought one in Denver that was running on bio-diesel), 
so be it, but I'd really like to look into eventually converting my '69 
westy (got to get it running and to the east coast from Denver, first, 
though).

   My understanding, and I've looked into it a bit, is that there is no 
conversion required to run off bio-diesel. Supposedly that's what the 
original diesel engine was built for. Many US cities have bio-diesel 
available at the pump (you can find those here: 
http://biodiesel.org/buyingbiodiesel/retailfuelingsites/default.shtm ). You 
can also make it yourself pretty cheap (though the equipment will take a 
while to pay for itself, but the price to the enviroment makes it worth it, 
IMHO : http://www.freedomfuelamerica.com/ ).

   There's also some great info about bio-diesel and other Earth friendly 
ideas on Woody and Laura Louie's website: http://www.voiceyourself.com/.
