Subject: Need dimensions for heating components.

Greetings fellow Pilots,

 

Heading to rescue a 78 2.0L bus this weekend that is missing everything
between the heat exchangers and and the "Y" junction tube.  No elbows, no
flapper boxes, accordion heater tubes, nothing.  I will be heading through
some rather cold country and naturally, heat sounds like something I think I
would enjoy very much.  

 

My question is, can anyone provide me with the diameter of the heat exhaust
port on the heater box, and the diameter of the tubes at the end of the "Y"
junction tube.  My intention is to fashion an "always on" system to get me
home out of heater or dryer tubing and naturally something in the ballpark
of the correct diameter or diameters required would make life a bit easier.


If you can provide me some specs on said diameters I would appreciate it.


Cheers,

 

Duke
