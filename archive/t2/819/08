An interesting idea, but I have my doubts that the cost will remain low if
this comes into general use.  There is a limited amount of agricultural
capacity available and this capacity depends in part on petroleum
resources.  If the demand for veggie oil remains low, prices might stay
low, but as demand increases the price will go way up.  Same thing with
french fry oil.  If you're the only person using it, the stuff is free,
but if demand increases McDonalds will be selling it to the highest
bidder!

I am also leery of the "climate neutrality" of this practice.  On the
surface it might be, but Mother Nature doesn't subject veggie oil to the
conditions inside a Diesel engine!
