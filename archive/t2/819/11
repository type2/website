Subject: RE: fuel sender/gauge testing

Well you have one of two things happening I suspect. The first is that when being installed, someone bent the wire that holds the float so it is mis-reading the actual levels of the tank. You will have to re-bend the wire/float until it reads correctly. I do this with an empty tank and make sure the float reaches the bottom. In fact I do this with one gallon left in the tank so that I know when I reach empty on the faguge I really have a gallon left.
The second option is either the fuel gauge is broken (not very frequent) or the sender resistance windings are broken. You can check the gauge by pulling the connector off the sender, then have someone turn the key on so your idiot lights just come on, but not the engine. Touch the wire to a good ground somewhere and the gauge should go right up to the full right (over the full mark even). If it does, the gauge is good. That just leaves the sender, take it out and look at the little windings on it to see if they're broken anywhere. If they are then replace it as it's junk.

I hope that gives you some start on what to do to test it. Let me know how it works out.
