Subject: RE: [T2] Can any psychics out there identify my carb?

I have a '76 that has had the FI replaced with a carb.

What you are describing sounds like what I have.  It is probably a Weber
progressive DFAV/DGAV or DFEV/DGEV.

If it is electric choke, it is the "EV".

Also, where is the fuel line and the air adjustment screw?  If it to the
front of the bus (a real pain to get and *$%& to adjust) it is like mine
and the "DF" series.

I am a newbie to all of this but I think what I mention here is correct.

Hope this helps,

Michael Martin

I know, a dumb question, but ...

This morning  I decided I'd had enough of stalling, hesitation, etc
and it was time to get rid of the mechanical distributor and replace
it with an SVDA.

I get to the order screen at aircooled.net, and I need to know my
Carb to order the right one.

I know its a Webber, center mount, fitted by the PO. (The engine is
a 74, originally california).

Its got a big rectangular air cleaner on top, a vacuum line on the
back (of the bus), and the linkage on the right (of the bus).

I cant find any other identification on it.

Is this enough information to identify it without a picture?
If not, where do I look for identifying marks?

kevin.
