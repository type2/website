Subject: Origin of new flywheel, good clutches...

I bought a new 200mm flywheel for my upright engined 70 bus on the dreaded 
auction site. It is NOS from about 15 years ago. I haven't got it yet.
Can anyone tell me how I can tell if it is German, Brazilian or what have 
you?
Also, Ronnie at type2 parts  found issues with Sach's Brazilian pressure 
plates, they don't fit right and will cause mayhem and destruction. Is there 
an excellent clutch available that will not cause me any problems?
