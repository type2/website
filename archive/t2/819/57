Generally on 3 notch pulleys, the notch on the left is 0 (zero) TDC, the
first notch to the right of it is usually 7.5 degrees BTDC and the one right
next to it is 10 degrees BTDC.
 Rule of thumb is every 8 millimeters on the pulley edge is 5 degrees.
7.5would be around 12mm to the right of the 0 (zero) TDC mark.
