Subject: [T2] Re:Convert Gasoline to Natural Gas?

Since this thread started out as an idea to make our buses more
climate-friendly and has evolved into a major modification thread, let me
throw out this idea:
Get a Diesel Vanagon or find a used TDI engine and swap it into your bus.
Once you are running on Diesel, conversions to vegetable oil are very
simple. AFAIK you only need different injectors, a pump heater, and a
modified injection pump to run VW Diesels on vegetable oil year-round. Even
simpler if you are in a warm climate where you don't have to worry about
viscosity in winter.
Two major advantages: climate neutral (no fossil fuels) and fuel price is
independent of oil price. Running on old fryer fat would be even cheaper in
the long run, but you would need the equipment to filter and clean out burnt
fries and dirt before use ...
This is pretty much all I know at this point, but I am considering and
researching a modification of one of my Opels. Price of gas is about double
the price of veggie oil in Germany and gas stations are starting to offer it
in addition to Diesel and Biodiesel. There are even complete conversion kits
available now.
