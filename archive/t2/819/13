Subject: [T2] Re:Convert Gasoline to Natural Gas?

>This is pretty much all I know at this point, but I am considering and
researching a modification of one of my Opels. Price of gas is about double
the price of veggie oil in Germany and gas stations are starting to offer it
in addition to Diesel and Biodiesel. There are even complete conversion kits
available now.<

The debate about this is pretty hot in the UK .. for "Standard" (Ie non TI)
engines allegedly all you have to do is fit an inline fuel heater to drop
the viscosity a little bit ..

Problem of course is the price .. Veg Oil for Road use is about 85p a litre
compared to about 96p for regular Diesel Very few people think it's worth
risking their engines for a comparitivly small gain .. Plus you have to have
a tank at home to keep it in, PLUS you get alot of hassle from C+E (Sunday
Morning visits Etc etc)

by comparison an LPG conversion is (even with the aux heater circuit, which
is worth it on it's own) really quite simple ..
