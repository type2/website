From Don:

Tiger Model 581 CDI

 "Not for use with factory or replacement electronic ignitions."
  Does that mean no Pertronix?

You would have to definitely assume that since the sentence before it says:
"For all vehicles with 12-volt negative ground systems and point-type ignition."

Key words are "point-type ignition".
