I have held off on purchasing this unit because of the same thing. I
could never find anything that would confirm or deny that it would or
would not fit in a vacuum distributor. I read a few posts that seemed
to indicate the theory that the vacuum can arm would get in the way,
but like I said could find nobody that had actually given it a try.
