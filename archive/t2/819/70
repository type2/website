Subject: Re: [T2] Crane XR700 ignition

Originally known as the Allison XR700 before Crane Cams bought them, I have
used these on numerous VWs (and a few T*y*t*s as well,) over the past 30
years or so. Like Eron says, a true CDI with an optical trigger, rather than
a magnetic hall, and in my opinion it's the best "pointless" system ever
produced. Optical triggers aren't affected by dirt, dust and moisture like
hall units can be. Why do most other manufacturers and the OEMs use Halls?
They're cheep, need I say more?
 Allison was originally located in Duarte, CA near the City of Hope, close
to where I grew up in Glendora (man was that a long time ago). Allison
originally offered a lifetime warranty on their XR700's (never did have to
take them up on it though). After Crane bought them they changed the
warranty to something like 5 years or so (aw, boo). I don't know if Crane
ever had to "lifetime warranty" any defectives after the buy-out.
 When I get them outa the "restoration barn", both my Ghia and 411 Wagen
will each receive a XR700 unit.
