How do you determine 7.5 degrees BTDC on a 1600 AD engine. There are 3
notches
> on the pulley one at TDC and two others to the right of it, I don't know

aprox. every 1/16 (.9768 of 1/16") of an inch is a degree, providing your
pulley is 7" in diameter which it should be. So if you know where Top Dead
Center (TDC) is, you're good to go.

diameterof pulley (7") x 3.14 (pi) x 16 (1/16") divided by 360 (degrees) =
0.9768 of 1/16"
