Hard to say.  A certain amount of heat will be needed to evaporate the
LPG, but that heat is normally thrown overboard via the oil cooler or
simply through the shallow finning underneath the engine.  Under normal
conditions I would expect the normal oil cooling system of pressure and
relief valves to adjust the oil cooler flow to accommodate the added
cooling of the LPG.

The latent heat of vaporization of LPG is about 426kJ/kg

The heat value of the LPG is 50,000 kJ/kg

So, the vaporization takes roughly 1% of the heat produced by burning the
fuel.  It seems that this could be provided by the waste heat in the oil.

How about electric?  Assuming a fuel flow of 5kg/h (which is about 10
liters/hour) you would need 2130000J of heat per hour.  Dividing by 3600
to get J/s we get 592W.  At 12V, this is 50 amps.  Better forget that one!
