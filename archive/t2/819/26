Be careful with Biodiesel! I am not sure whether there are different ways of
making it. However, I do know that most vehicles require all new fuel hoses
and seals to run on the Biodiesel that is commonly sold in Germany (unless
your happen to have a late model car that was constructed with Biodiesel in
mind). Reason is that the methyl-ester (I think this is the chemical name
for the veggie-oil turned diesel) is more agressive than regular Diesel. It
will degrade regular diesel-grade rubber after a while.

Veggie oil is more benign, but it is thicker than diesel. Therefore
modifications are needed to the fuel delivery system to get it into the
motor.

Another concern is that the more processing is required, the less
earth-friendly a fuel becomes. Even veggie oil is not completely
climate-neutral since fossil fuels are used for fertilizer, farm equipement,
and procesing. But is probably as climate-friendly a fuel you can burn in an
internal combustion engine.

   My understanding, and I've looked into it a bit, is that there is no
conversion required to run off bio-diesel.
