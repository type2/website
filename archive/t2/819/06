Subject: fuel sender \ gauge testing

Folks,

I have a wonky gas gauge and I want to fix it. It currently pegs all the way to 
the right when full and reads half full when dead empty...

I tried to wire the spare cluster I have to my van and got nothing.

I have a spare cluster and a spare sender.

Can someone tell me how to wire it so that I can test the gauge(s) for 
accuracy?
