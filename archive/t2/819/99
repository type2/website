I had a lovely private reply to this ..

>LOOPS:
Open Loop: there is no oxygen sensor.

Absolutely .. and both of these are legal in europe ..

What isn't legal (For road use) are open vapoursiation units .. Basically
those that operate like a gas ring .. IE the tank gets cold .. as they are
running ...

However I still have to giggle every time I think of frozen propane bottles,
there was Laurel and Hardy type scene in Aldwich a few years ago involving a
gas bottle a gass ring and a couple guy on a tea break ..
