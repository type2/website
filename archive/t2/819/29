I went through this process back in 2002.

If you are talking about bring a baywindow bus down there is a lot of documentation and red tape to read but much of it doesn't apply. In a nutshell, you fill in form HS-7 at the border crossing (take it along with you) and check off box 1.

This allows you to legally import your vehicle with minimal hassle. You can also drive your vehicle into the country and process the form at a regional customs office (airport, etc) but I recommend doing it at the border where they are accustomed  to the procedure.

Afterwards you have to deal with registration at the state level and it's usually just a matter of showing your title and the customs declaration form. When I lived in TX, for example, I also had to get the police to inspect the bus for stolen VIN/vehicle.

If the vehicle is less than 25 years old, it's more complicated: you require a compliance letter from VW and you might have to modify the vehicle to comply (speedometer in km is the common problem) with US regs.
