Subject: 1600cc flywheel bolt sizes.

Hello List,

I thought that all 1600cc motors used a 36mm bolt for the flywheel. The 
type 3 motor that I'm working on right now doesn't. Neither my 36mm or 
1-7/16 sockets fit on the sucker. Had to use a 1-1/2...it was all that I 
had that was close...it felt a little loose so I'm assuming its a 38mm 
socket, which I don't have. The motor is a dual port 1600cc type 3 motor 
(TO). I was intending on replacing the bolt, pilot bearing and flywheel 
after putting in a new main seal. What part number am I looking for? 
Should the 36mm version work? I don't have any extras laying around to test.

Anyone have any experience with this?

thanks
Eddie Goodwin
