A slight missunderstanding on my part and slightly funny language ...

What they call a basic open Loop is the same as I described for the
Landrover..

They are describing the way the vapourised fuel is fed into the engine  (of
which there are two systems open and closed) ...
I was describing how the systems vapourise the fuel .. (Of which there are
two systems .. called .. Open and Closed ) ....

On the other hand I might be totally wrong ..


Did you expect this to be easy ?

As I understand it there are two systems "OPEN" and "Closed".   In the UK
(And I'm pretty sure Australia) and the Netherlands and Germany .. Only
closed systems are allowed ..

Don't tell these guys about open loop systems being banned! (Could be an
out of date site, though)
