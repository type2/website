Durn. I was under the impression that the metals were different. I'm sure it
help when I put the new ones in. My biggest problem was that I don't have any
actual drifts and had to improvise. Sockect extesions work - but the edges on
my are all tapered slightly!

I used the old race this way without grinding it - at least it provided a good
surface to pound on to get the race most of the way in. Then I had to use
something else for the last fraction of an inch.

About the time I got the races done, a friend showed up and "supervised" (he
brought the beer). He helped me bleed my brakes after everything was
reassembled. Then we took her for a test drive only to find I had done the
wrong side! From the drivers seat, it sure sounded like it was coming from my
side but he got out and walked along side the bus and said it was definitely
on the other side! Grrrr... I pulled the other wheel and repacked the outer
bearing. It looked OK. This didn't help. So, I guess Monday after the FL-VW-PS
reopens, I'll buy another set of bearings and do the other side. At least this
one will go alot faster!
