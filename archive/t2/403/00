This bolt can only be removed after you reach around & undo the nut on
the engine side of the tranny. The "d" bolt is designed so that
hopefully it will stay in place for you to put the darn nut back on
upon reinstall.

Me & Troy Wicals meant to test this theory one weekend when we were
both pulling our engines in my driveway one Memorial Day weekend.
Basically I was gonna pull both & we were gonna time it. I got lazy &
never found out :( but You can do it either way. both have pros/cons.
