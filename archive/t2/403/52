I'm confused.  It looks like a great life extension for a vehicle that 
would have been otherwise relegated to the scrap heap where it would have 
been crushed or stripped of its handful of usable parts.

"It did run, although it had a cobbled-up toggle switch and push button 
starter to fire it up. The frame was rusted and it would not pass 
inspection without a serious investment. This was perfect for me, because I 
had no intention of putting it on the road anyway. "


While it is not being used in the glorious service of transporting human 
cargo, it seems to be quite proud in it's current life on the farm.

"The bus very quickly became a useful work-horse.  ...  The follwoing 
spring when a tree came down in my back yard, the vehicle was indispensible 
in removing all the debris. ...  Although I've done zero maintenance on the 
vehicle it continues to run and serve a critical role in the upkeep of my 
property. "

Even the "paint my bus" party provides an outlet of "artistic" expression 
for all involved and to be honest, who hasn't wanted to take spray gun in 
hand and "make their mark" on a vehicle at some time or another?

Oh well.  I guess I'll go back to the site and see what I missed that is sad.
