Here's two:  I used a fine file (gently!) to get the little round puck
seated on the distributor shaft.  It would not have gone w/o the (minor)
filing.  Also, don't reinstall the condensor attachment screw into the body
of the distributor in an attempt to plug the hole, as I did, or it will
interfere with the internals of the distributor, and cause you to think that
there is something very wrong with your new 009.  AMHIK.  Yes, I know that
the 009 is frowned-upon, but on my 1600DP it works well and is okay so far
until I get a proper vac-advance unit.  Flame if you must.
