Kevin,

Sounds like you need to run some serious injector cleaner through
there...maybe even replace the injectors.  The only way I can think of 
that it ran with all 4 injectors unplugged was that they are leaking 
terribly....from garbage holding them open when they are supposed to be 
closed.

Think about it!

Cheers, dave
