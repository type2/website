Natural gas consists of 87-96% methane.  Not pure, but close enough that
the flammability of pure methane and natural gas are the same, and that
is the property that we are considering.  As I said, the liklihood that
this product having methane as a major constituant is very low, since the
boiling point of methane is much too low for an F-12 system

It's yet another "drop in replacement".  If it has methane in it it won't
get approved by the powers that be for mobile uses.  The only approved
"drop in replacement" for mobile users of F-12 that I am aware of is
GHG-12 (or whatever they are calling it these days)

I didn't lay any scare tactics on this list.  I pointed out the
incongruity of the assertion that propane/butane mixes were bad and that
methane was better.  They're all flammable, but the quantity of
refrigerant is very small so the danger is minor.  As I said, I'd worry
more about the 100 pounds of gasoline in the tank than I would about the
pound of flammable hydrocarbon in the AC system

Heck, the stuff will probably work great, but don't forget basic chemistry
and physics when considering the manufacturer's claims.
