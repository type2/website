Subject: Re: [T2] another trouble first engine pull

Is this your first engine pull? If so, call a buddy and have him 'supervise'.
You don't want to get pinned under the engine with no way to get help. The
engine itself isn't heavy enough to pin you (assuming you have some muscle
tone) but if it comes loose while you are under the bus pulling the starter
and lands on your arm(s), you might not be able to push it because the bus is
in the way.

The way I've done it (alone and assisted) is to use two stacks of 2x4 chuncks
on each side of a floor jack (with another 2x4 chunk on between the floorjack
and the engine. Make sure the engine is supported on the 2x4s and the
floorjack as you detach the 'mustache bar' from the frame (last step). Then
lift the engine slightly with the jack, remove the top 2 2x4s (one on each
side) and lower. Repeat this until the jack is almost pinned. slide it out and
use it on one end of the 'mustache bar' and a stack of 2x4s on the other (you
should have some on hand now). List the jack to lift one side of the engine
and remove two more 2x4s underneath. Lower and remove a 2x4 from the opposite
side of the mustache bar. Repeat until you are one the ground. I usually need
about 12 18" 2x4s to do the job comfortably.

Another hint - put a skateboard or a cheap metal mechanics creeper under the
engine to act as a dolly.

Oh, don't bother trying to put the engine back in by yourself with the
transmission still in there. Theoretically it's possible, but it's kind of
like trying to put an open can of soda back in a vending machine through the
slot while the can is open and you can't spill any.

What year is your bus?

-Eric
