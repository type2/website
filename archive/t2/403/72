Dennis--
Actualy the sealer is a lubricant prior to anything leaking--
It is not Bars leak---Or Seal a Meal.

Fact--

My AC is blowing colder than it did last year with a full load of R-12.

Fact--

Methane is not propane

Fact--

Methane is not Butane

Fact--

My AC after a trip of 12 miles (-at-) 65 mph is putting out 36 to 38
degree's, on the way to work today, at 80 degree's outside temperature,
via both my digital, and manual AC temperature vent gauges

Fact--

In 4 weeks time, my system has leaked NOTHING, and still maintains the
pressure's I had at the time of installation.

And for the record--I'm an R-12 kinda guy---I like the real
thing--regardless.
I like the stuff my AC system was designed for--

Remember this---134 has an A behind it--
It is an alternative and requires bigger head temps to operate
efficiantly.
This would be a good time for all the soothsayer's of doom and gloom to
charge their old Ac systems up with 134--to find all the weak spots in
their AC components and seals--

The reason I went with this stuff--it's compatable with all--and runs
with 35% less product--less head pressures on the compressor--easier on
everything in the system.

For now it's running at least 8 to 9 degree's colder than the
R-12--after 4 weeks.

The back of my neck is freezing--
Yeowza--!!

I'll keep everyone abreast of the long term results--stay tuned--

Later,

Terry

Methane Based! Sounds Flammable to me. Sealers in the AC system, wait a
year. Clogs just like the radiators and heater cores. I'll check it
though. Thanks for passing this on.

Hey All--
  I have been fighting off the known dismal change to the R 134-A
for years, in my vehicles, as well as at work in customer's trucks.
The simplest reason is that it just is not an efficient
refrigerant--period.
And I personally don't care for the higher head pressures it requires to
half assed function ---it will never replace R-12--in the cooling
department.
And Propane, or Butane products are totally out of the question--no way
Jose--bad stuff--
However, I have found this off the wall product--and being the
adventurous type---I order two 6 oz. cans of this refrigerant, and a 6
oz. can of their sealer-- I was reading about in an automotive
publication I get---
It's called Red Tech--and it is a methane derivative--with some other
who know's what ingredients--
I drop a a can of the sealer into the 87--( it has an ever so slow
leak--once a year --you'd play hell finding it type ) and then drop a
can of the refrigerant into it--that's all--( the stuff at 6 oz. does
the same thing as 18 oz. of R-12, and 16 oz. of R-134a )
The temp at the vents is now 39 degree's--at 50 mph--or with a fan in
front of the condenser, while testing--
The sealer allegedly plugs nothing until a leak appears--and then it
seeks moisture--at that area.
Until then it just lubricates the system--
It is totally compatible with 12--and mineral oil-- It is totally
compatible with 134 and ester oil.
I've had the stuff in my Van now for 4 weeks and it has never blown this
cold out of the AC vents--even with the 12---I am impressed.
The craziest thing is they don't want you to pull a full vacuum on the
system--the stuff is supposed to be dropped into the low pressure side
at zero--not 28 or 30.
The instructions say that the refrigerant works best this way--because
it expands--
and it also disperses moisture in the system-- and if it released into
the atmosphere-it turns into carbon dioxide-- go figure--it's a friendly
item for the greenpeace folks--
Anyway--I know the summer months are are around the corner--and I can
see the influx of AC questions and comments coming--
Here is an excellent, reasonable R-12 alternative that I have found--and
tried-
Works good. ( and very cold )
Later,
