Subject: I am Bussless now...

Well, I sold my 73 Bus Friday and it was a sad day. 

It is gone, gone, gone... Into the hands of a couple that will give it the 
attention that I could not give due to another vehicle that came between us.  It 
was a good faithful Bus and should give them years of smiles...
