Subject: double cab gate question

I just got a 70 double cab. I got an extra set of gates with it. A very knowledgeable vw guru told me that they are for pre 67 double cabs. They look exactly like what`s on my truck. Will early ones fit later models? I find it hard to beleive.
Thanks,
Dave Parsons
