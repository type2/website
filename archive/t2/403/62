Subject: Rear shift coupler

Greetings List!!
       Hope all are well this weekend. Happy Fathers day to you Dads out
there. Now I'll cut straight to the quest at hand.
        I have a 1968 Westy all original. In the rear shift coupler I have
lost the rubber bushings that fit up in the cage part. I have the ordered the
new H.D. urethane bushing and coupler set and it should be here anyday now.
This is my daily driver so I need her back ASAP!!! Every thing I have read
about the job says you gotta pull the engine and tranny. No time for an engine
and tranny pull right now. So,What I am wanting to do is use the new bushings
from the kit I got and install them in the old cage. Has anyone ever tried
this will the new bushings fit the old cage?  By the way my cage looks good. I
will have to compare the new and old one side by side when it gets here. OR
can the old cage be removed and the new one installed without the ENG/Trans
being pulled? Anyway any info would be much appreciated because I would like
to have everything ready when the part gets here. Which means pulling the
ENG/Trans if need be.

Chad
