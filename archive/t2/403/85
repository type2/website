Hello,

Having the belt too tight can shorten the life of your
alternator bearings. It puts unneeded stress on the
alternator shaft. I am not sure if the same applies to
type 1 engines but I usually keep closer to 1/2" of
deflection on my type IV engine. Of course, I guess it
depends on how hard you want to press on the belt...

I will quit my rambling.
