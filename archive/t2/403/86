Since we're discussing facts:

Fact--

Methane is a flammable gas just like propane and butane.  When I camp, I
cook with propane and butane.  When I'm at home I cook with methane (which
is also called "Natural Gas."

Fact--

Methane boils at -164C. Freon 12 boils at -30C.  There's no
way that a methane refrigerant can replace Freon 12.  The reason that F-12
replaced a propane/butane mixure in the first place is that propane boils
at -42C and butane boils at 0C.  A mixture of the two therefore boils at
about the same temperature as the F-12 that replaced the mixtire.

This isn't to say that a propane/butane mixure isn't a dandy refrigerant.
It worked very well before freon came along and continues to work well
even though DuPont would rather you use their stuff.

If someone is telling you that they have a methane refrigerant that can
replace F-12 I would be suspicious of their claims.  They have either
figured out a way to magically alter the physical properties of methane
or they simply don't know the difference between the various
hydrocarbons.
