Subject: fan belt too tight??

I replaced my crankshaft pulley tonight with a fancy dancy SCAT degree pulley
on my 1970 Westy. When I tightened up my Gen pulley I had the 1/4" deflection,
but I was thinking... I didn't measure before, but I'm sure it was tighter
before. The question I have is, can the belt be too tight and will this cause
a break sooner or something?
