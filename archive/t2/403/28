Subject: Leaking around the dipstick

And I don't mean the dipstick behind the wheel...

I've had a steady leak from my dipstick on the 'front' side of the engine.
This oil seemed innocuous - just kept the fan and heads getting corroding as
it was sucked into the cooling fan. But I think my recent alternator failure
could be partially attributed to this leak. The alternator cooling duct was
dripping with oil when I changed it.

Is there something I'm missing on my dipstick?

-Eric
