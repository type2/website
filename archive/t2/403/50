Subject: Tools, Books & Stuff

A fellow model building club member, who's been out of the VW thing for more
than a decade, just gave me the tools, books and other things in this list
in exchange for some model-related casting.

If someone could help me to identify the "Whatzit" tools in the list below,
and/or help me to judge the usefulness/values of the publications also
listed, I would be very grateful.

And I am so glad to finally have my own copy of the Muir book!!!
