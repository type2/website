Subject: oil temp

I just took my 72 (1700) on a long trip (over 1k miles) with outdoor temps ranging from the 50's to the upper 70's and it just had a tune up. My question is regarding the oil temp's I had along the way.  According to my oil temp gauge, it was consistently into the 265 range but every time I pulled over to look at the engine and see any problems I would feel the engine with my hand and grab the dipstick, and NEVER did the engine "feel" hot to the touch. I assumed my gauge was fouled up but when I put it to boiling water it was dead on. Anybody got a clue? Is this normal??
