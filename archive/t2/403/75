Neither here nor there, but:  I was the victim of a road-trip thermostat
failure, and as a result replaced my thermostat with a piece of bailing wire
which now serves to activate (or de-activate) the cooling/warmup flaps.

Having recently installed an oil drain plug sender and gauge, I have watched
my temps and also correlated them with the tried-and-true "dipstick-finger
application test".  Result-  at 75 degree ambient temps, 10-30 Castrol dino
oil, 1600 DP quality stock rebuild with 30,000 miles (no oil leaks!) running
in a porky and loaded '71 ersatz highroof at 7000 ft elevation, it takes
about 45 minutes of driving to reach 220 degrees.  I then release the flaps,
and I have only seen 230 once.  When I stop, even at 230, the dipstick is
cool enough to touch for several seconds.

Hearing from others, it seems like I have an unusually cool-running bus, for
which I am thankful.  But as most of my trips in the bus are pretty short, I
leave the flaps in "warmup" position even in the summer, as otherwise it
takes like 20 minutes of idling to be warm enough to maintain a steady idle
speed and not want to stall every time I shift or disengage the clutch at a
light.  When I see ~220 on the gauge, I release the flaps and continue.
Just more data for the mill...
