Subject: New found AC Refrigerant

Hey All--

 I have been fighting off the known dismal change to the R 134-A for
years, in my vehicles, as well as at work in customer's trucks.

The simplest reason is that it just is not an efficient
refrigerant--period.

And I personally don't care for the higher head pressures it requires to
half assed function ---it will never replace R-12--in the cooling
department.

And Propane, or Butane products are totally out of the question--no way
Jose--bad stuff--

However, I have found this off the wall product--and being the
adventurous type---I order two 6 oz. cans of this refrigerant, and a 6
oz. can of their sealer-- I was reading about in an automotive
publication I get---

It's called Red Tech--and it is a methane derivative--with some other
who know's what ingredients--

I drop a a can of the sealer into the 87--( it has an ever so slow
leak--once a year --you'd play hell finding it type ) and then drop a
can of the refrigerant into it--that's all--( the stuff at 6 oz. does
the same thing as 18 oz. of R-12, and 16 oz. of R-134a )

The temp at the vents is now 39 degree's--at 50 mph--or with a fan in
front of the condenser, while testing--

The sealer allegedly plugs nothing until a leak appears--and then it
seeks moisture--at that area.
Until then it just lubricates the system--

It is totally compatible with 12--and mineral oil--
It is totally compatible with 134 and ester oil.

I've had the stuff in my Van now for 4 weeks and it has never blown this
cold out of the AC vents--even with the 12---I am impressed.

The craziest thing is they don't want you to pull a full vacuum on the
system--the stuff is supposed to be dropped into the low pressure side
at zero--not 28 or 30.

The instructions say that the refrigerant works best this way--because
it expands--
and it also disperses moisture in the system-- and if it released into
the atmosphere-it turns into carbon dioxide-- go figure--it's a friendly
item for the greenpeace folks--

Anyway--I know the summer months are are around the corner--and I can
see the influx of AC questions and comments coming--

Here is an excellent, reasonable R-12 alternative that I have found--and
tried-

Works good. ( and  very cold )

Later,
