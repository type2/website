Subject: Re: [T2] trouble first engine pull: done!

Haha! Finally! I've gotten it!

After hours of scratching my head over this, I found that (amongst other 
small wires - starter, bn4 heater) what was really holding me back was this 
stupid metal bar.  I can inferr from an earlier post that this must the the 
"mustache" bar.  Am I right?  I didn't read anything in the Muir book about 
that! But it makes sense.

The engine is out and on the ground next to the van right now... By the way 
the model info is: '72 transporter, 1700 type IV pancake, dual carb, manual 
trans... that whole bit.

Heh heh... so now I guess I'll have some rebuild questions coming up soon 
here.  I think I'm going to price an engine stand tomorrow.  Any ideas?

Thanks so much to everyone for all the help, I am sure you realise how much 
I appreciate it.

Peace,
- Ian
