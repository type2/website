not a dummy at all just never changed the starter ...
its on the right hand side of the top of the engine behind the middle of where a carb would sit...
its like 15 mm or 17mm i think ,...
if you can find the accelerator cable comeing through the back of the engine skirt its down and to the right a bit...
big nub sticking out there!
happy fathewrs day back to you..
