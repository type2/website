Subject: another trouble first engine pull

Thanks for the great responses!

Since i'd started taking the engine out alone yesterday (w.out trans.) I 
decided to continue on that route today.  However, after receiving guidance 
from the list and getting all four (!) bolts out, I'm having trouble 
disconnecting the engine from the trans.  You know, the ol' jiggle and push. 
  Are there any tips or tricks out there?

I'm just gonna eat some lunch and then try again.  Right now I figure I've 
been too gentle.  I've got two scissors jacks under a piece of wood under 
the engine jacked up a little bit to put slight pressure on the engine.  
Then I pushed the van forward and moved the wheel blocks up.  I've wriggled 
and pulled with all my might, but it still won't come.

So far I've disconnected the 4 bolts, electrical, the two hoses from the 
heat boxes, the accel. cable, and taken everything unnecessary off inside 
the engine bay.  Am I missing anything big?

Whew.  Off to some soup.
