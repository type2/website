My wife and I where watching Grand Canyon, and I noticed a blue early 
bay in the movie. The shot is fairly early in the movie when Steve 
Martin's character is screening some mindless action flick. There is a 
city bus being driven by some kind of hijackers, and martin is standing 
up yelling at the editors for taking out the "money shot" when the city 
bus slams into the VW and knocks the sliding door off.
