now of course this is for a manual tranny, the auto tranny has a very
different removal prochedure,  I highly discourge taking both off together
for a couple reasons
.  the auto tranny is VERY heavy and combined with the engine you are
pushing a few hundred Lbs.
.  the auto tranny does not have the tranny shaft that the flywheel has to
clear so it doesn't need to be pulled back as far, and it doesn't have
quite as much alignment problems as the manual
.  the auto shift linkage is a real PITA to adjust

now I pull and replace the engine in my 78 solo when it needs to come out,
but I don't take it out unless it really needs to come out.  I bought a
transmission jack and made a cradle for the engine so this really makes
engine pulls fairly easy.
