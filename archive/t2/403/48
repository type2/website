Hi Ian,

Before putting the jack under the engine I like to check around the 
perimeter of the engine tin and make sure that everything that crosses 
from the body to the motor is ID'd and disconnected. If you do it this 
way you will also catch stuff that isn't in the manual, like wiring for 
CHT gauges and other aftermarked modifications.

There may be a few things you have missed that aren't mentioned in your 
message:

- Fuel line (one line on a carb'd bus, 2 on an FI bus.
- Brake Vacuum Hose (Drivers side front tin, 71-79 only)

As Bob said, removing the coil, the oil filler tube and the rear tin is 
also recommended.

Happy trails,
