Subject: Re: [T2] better seat belts?

I've got a pair of retractable shoulder belts from a '74 Porsche 914 in my
bus. I had to make extensions for the connector (I cut the old connector off
and put some heavy bolts through them and the new connector). And they still
don't work if you are 'generously portioned'. But for my and my daughter, they
are great. I got them on eB$y for $65. (and by 'connector', I mean the part
that the belt snaps into - the part that bolts to the body near the floor -
with my extension, the connector is now right at my hip, not way between the
seats).

I've heard that mid-80s Jetta's had similar systems.
