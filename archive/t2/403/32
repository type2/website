Good deal.

Early 90's Jettas also. The mounting bolt is compatible but you'll need to
fashion brackets to mount them in the bus. You may need a spacer to mount
the D-ring on the bus. On the Jetta's and Golfs, the front belt reel is
hidden behind a plastic panel. The rear belts as well.

Repa was the manufacturer of the original belts and is now TRW/Repa. If you
find this brand in a European car it's very likely it will work in your bus.

Now a plug for new belts:

There are German OEM bus retractable belts at OEVeedub. Unfortunately the
price went up with the Euro but those are the breaks. You better ask them
what mounting kit is provided because the retractable belts that came in the
European busses in the late seventies were mounted on the bulkhead behind
the drivers seat. I'm not sure where the left belt mounted in the Westy on
the passenger seat side at 76. I guess there was no choice!

GoWesty! has some nice belts that bolts right in. I recommend them for
anyone wanting new belts. PE Parts is GoWesty! but charges more for the same
belt.

With any of these belts if you mount the reel on the bus wheel well, there
is only one orientation otherwise the door will not close. This is because
they seal a L (or R) belt instead of a L/R pair. The belt will still retract
nicely but I suspect it will wear a little on the edge over time without
modification.
