Subject: Re: [T2] trouble first engine pull

i have done both pulled tranny and engine together the way the bus was designed and then again i have pulled just the engine...

the way i pulled the engine easist was that i put a cement block under the tranny to catch it when i gently let the enigne down and pulled back to slide it off the tranny...

the tranny and engne together was a pain in the butt for one thing only for me and that was the rusted cv joint bolts...
i cant stand haveing to take those dad blame cv joints and axles off./...
i repalced all the cv bolts this last time though so there wont be that problem again.....or at least for a long while i hope,,

make sure you have a heavy duty jack to hold that engine and put something between the engine and jack a piece of flat wood or rubber mat or something...

the cv joint bolts i had to cut off useing a dremel whihc was a pain in the arse but did end up and work in the end.. just watch out for gas line s this willcause an awful spark when cutting the bolts...

the big bolts i used something called a gator grip which you can find at your local wal-mart or hardware store .,...
wasbt the best but did grip down on those stubburn big bolts likt the tranny motor bolts that are 17mm.....

i have owned a bus for a little over a couple of months now and so far have dropped my engine once and my engine and tranny together twice...

cant say it was fun but sure was a learning experience...
peace
