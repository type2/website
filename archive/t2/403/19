I took the (bottom) bolt off to remove the starter, so it's hanging on top 
of the tranny now.  But the engine still feels connected to something on the 
top.  I can wiggle the bottom, but when I wiggle and pull, the top stays 
connected ... it just feels like theres something up there keeping it in.

I also tried engaging the clutch and pulling on the engine, but that didn't 
work. What is holding it up right now?  The weight of the engine is 
obviously being supported by something near the top, but those bolts are in 
(labled!) baggies right now.

Maybe I dont know what to expect.  Right now, I expect to pull and for the 
engine to go "kerplunk" right onto the board supported by the jacks.  
Aaaargh!
