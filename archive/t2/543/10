Yes, the distributor does dictate how much timing you get, but it does 
not dictate how much timing the *engine can handle*.  Therefore, you 
would want to have the correct amount of timing for a particular 
type/year of engine otherwise you're going to fry thing.

Engines aren't timed to meet the specs of distributors otherwise we'd 
all be running insane amounts of advance, hot-rodding our buses up and 
down the streets without a worry in the world.  But that can't happen 
because the engine has heat limitations.  Instead, it would make sense 
that distributors are timed to the specs of an engine so you get the 
amount of advance needed without burning the thing up.
