Subject: fly wheel starter question...

I just got a new fly wheel for my type 4 2 liter engine, the old one has had
a lot of the teeth "chewed" off. I 'v been told this is because I had a
"starter gear" on my my starter, ( starter has sence been replaced) I'm
thinking that the "gear" on the new (1 year old) starter should be replaced
when I install the new flywheel. Thoughts???

 

Any one have a lead on where I can get JUST the gear on the starter that
contacts the flywheel????

 

Thanks.
