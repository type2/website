From what I recall, the '71 has:

- disk brakes in the front
- vacuum assist on the front brakes
- a dual port engine (stock)
- doghouse-type fan shroud for oil cooler (more efficient cooling)

The major difference with the '69 was that it came with a single-port 
engine (although who knows what it has now) and drum brakes all around 
(and no vacuum assist).  

I also can't remember, the '69 might not have reverse lights?
