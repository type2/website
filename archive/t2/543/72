While I had my engine out, I had the guy weld a bolt head (with the 
threads sticking out) onto the #3 exhaust pipe (above the heater box).  
That way it is easily accessible with the engine in.  It seems to run a 
little hotter than the other place (under the stud nut nearest the #3 
spark plug), but it's consistent.
