Subject: steering column & ignition parts

hello. it was good to put faces to some of the names i know on here at 
EveryBus 2004.

what i need to know:  will these same parts from a 72 also work in my 
69?

-ignition switch housing:  211 905 887C
-ignition switch:  211 905 855D

does anyone have a 69 they are parting out?

thanks,
