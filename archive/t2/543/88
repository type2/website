Subject: Bus stays running with key off

A couple of days ago, I turned off the ignition of my bus and the 
engine continued to run.  There does not seem to be power to the 
ignition from the standard source because when I stop the engine 
(with the clutch), the (electric) fuel pump stops and there is no 
power to the coil at that point.  The gauges also go off when I 
turn off the ignition.  

My first thought was that the alternator was somehow supplying 
power back to the coil.  I replaced the regulator but that didn't 
help.  The alternator appears to still be charging the battery.

Also of note is the fact that the alternator light does not come 
on any more with the ignition on and engine off.

Any ideas?  I sure hope the alternator is not bad because the 1-
year Bosch warranty expired long ago.

Thanks,
        -David
