Subject: ?? 1969 SunDial Camper Bus ??

I ran across an advert of a 1969 SunDial camper bus. This puzzled me,
since I thought Sundial only did Splitty's. Tell me if I am wrong, since
there is more experience on this list, than I certainly have. According
to the seller, there is a camper plate on the body from Sundial. I think
I will have to check it out, since I am still in the market for a bay.
