Subject: Re: [T2] 1971 bay vs 1969 bay

Having owned a '69 for the past 8 years, I can safely attest that the only
real differences between the '69 and the '71 are as follows (although I am
probably forgetting something big):

'69-
-manual drum brakes all the way 'round
-small circular side reflectors
-4-prong turn signal flasher
-singleport 1600
-spring-actuated clutch

'71-
-power disc/drum
-rectangular lighted side markers
-3-prong flasher
-dual-port 1600 (doghouse)
-diaphragm clutch
-Also I think the ring gear is different in the '71 trans, but I've never
looked into it.

All this being said, I have installed the complete drivetrain from a '71 in
my '69: tranny, clutch, dual port with doghouse.  AND original doghouse '71
bus tin piece!  With hoover bit.  Everything else is as it came in '69, and
I have no complaints about the manual drum brakes, I just keep 'em adjusted,
no worries so far.

Cheers,

Blake
