Funny how I have radar detectors to find road signs and go 64mph. Even
in the 99EV, everyone blows by me at 90mph.

<< On a simialr note, is there a similar converter to allow the standard
lighter socket in my 70 to run items like radar detectors and battery
chargers? Seems it only likes the lighter...  >>

Radar detector...?-)
