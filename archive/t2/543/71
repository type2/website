Are the double relay and vacuum canister there? Those are usually 
attached to the firewall, and might not have been removed.

You will need to swap the flywheel over from the 73 engine if you plan 
to use the same tranny.

The throttle cable for the 75-79 bay is shorter than the 73 cable.
You will have to cobble up a support for the airbox.

Why not just dremel a hole for it in the stock location?

Let me know how you make out with this, my next project is to put FI on 
the Westfakia. It has to be completed before June 10th so I can go to 
BusFusion.

Happy trails,
