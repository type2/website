Subject: arizona camp out?

Looking for some friends to join a 70 Campmobile and a 60 Single Cab on a 
camping excursion to the Payson, AZ area sometime within the next month or 
so. Probably first weekend in May...My friend has a great spot. Meet in 
Payson and caravan up the mountain to the spot. Let me know if anyone is 
interested....Good times had by all
