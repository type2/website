Subject: SVDA question

In reading the recent SVDA thread, I noted that one of the posts mentioned
that the full advance timing with vacuum connected should be around 45
degrees. This kind of surprised me because I was under the impression that
with an SVDA, the vacuum advance was only active at lower RPM and that once
past a certain RPM the unit reverted to the 009 advance curve which has a full
advance of around 30 degrees.This might be a misconception on my part but
could someone explain whether the vacuum advance really is active at full RPM
for a total advance of 45 degrees? If so, then where does the 009 curve come
in?

Sincere thanks,
