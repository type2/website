Subject: Adventures with fuel lines

If you were around two years ago I had to pull my gas tank because it
completely clogged. At the time I POR15'd the fuel tank but in hindsight it
seems I forgot to deal with the fuel filler pipe:

T doesn't seem to be much mention of it in the archives so be sure to check
the pipe when you remove your tanks.

* Hard lines

Back when I pulled the tank, I had to remove the clogged hard fuel lines
below the tank and replace them with rubber hose. I found the lines the
other day (somewhat lost since my last move) and at the bottom of the
container was this glass like bead:

I figure after two years of hanging and "dripping" if that's all that came
out I'll probably never get it clean. So, I set about trying to make some
new hard lines and I found that 5/16" brake line is darn close (0.01mm) to
the original 8mm copper tubing that VW used (I found some fuel line repair
kits but they were $20, the wrong size and there wasn't enough pipe). Using
a brake bending tool I duplicated the weird angles:

It fits the 7mm fuel hose great but I'd like to flare the ends anyway like
the FI lines on the high pressure side:

My questions is, WHAT is this type of flare called and what other
automobiles would I likely find it on so I can hunt down a shop that has
this tool?
