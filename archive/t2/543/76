Subject: Re: [T2] Rust Under the Windshield

My bus had very bad rust under the windshield when I got it, and there was
little to no rust inside the nose.  I think the water can drain out the
bottom, so it does not pool up inside.

Fixing the rust properly can be rather expensive, so keep that in mind.

Here are some pics of my bus undergoing 'rustoration':
