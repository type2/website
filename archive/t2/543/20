Subject: who wants two cheap bumpers? $40!

Hello there,
I recently rebuilt my '68 bus I find myself with a front and rear bumper
coming from a '71 bus on my balcony. I originally intended to get them to fit
on my bus but my mechanic gave me a front and rear ones in much better
conditions for free. As you can understand, I accepted... ;)
Now I want to get rid of them quickly, possibly within a week certainly within
ten days as I had complaints from the management. They need work before
fitting and I intended to do it myself with a hammer or getting someone else
to do it for me. You can see pictures on thesamba at

I will sell them for $40 obo, shipping will be around $75 with UPS ground for
both including handling.
I can sell them separately- they are both complete except for a guard missing
in the front one which I might have.
As I said they need to be straightened and painted but that's why they are so
cheap!!
let me know if you are interested,
Thanks,
Jacopo
