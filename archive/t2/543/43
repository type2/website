got a mailer/daemon on this yesterday so if you got it already, sorry- hit delete.
 
For a Type 4, Progressive carb- and having both crankcase breather AND charcoal canister hooked up to intake.....
Can I get input on how others have these hooked up and/or the best/safest way?
i.e. 2 inputs into air cleaner?, flame arrestors, etc??
all responses/photos appreciated!  thanks, Chris
