Subject: ? About Hightops

Ok,
	I have more questions for those with more experience. I am
seeing a lot of hightops in ads right now, and am wondering what people
think of them? I kinda like the idea of being able to stand up in my
bus, being 6' in height.
How many does a hightop seat(Which may depend on a lot)? Any things one
should watch out for?
Better/Worse gas mileage? Better/Worse handling?

Any info would be appreciated.

Thanks,
