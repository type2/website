Subject: Thanx 4 the help

Got my electrical problem solved...I did have a wire hooked up wrong to the 
coil, and i needed a new voltage regulator. Next time i look at the wiring 
diagram rather than trust my memory. I guess i got in a hurry when i was 
putting everything back together. Thanks again to all that responded
