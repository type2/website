Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Rebuilder Recommendations

  There are many ways to go on an engine, which in my opinion boils down to dollars. You need to set a budget of 
what you are willing to spend and go from there. Any reputable VW engine person should be able to recomend what is 
best for the money you are willing to spend.
    I have many customers with BRAND NEW 1600's in their buses and they are very happy. The highest mileage one I 
know of has close to 70,000 trouble free miles on a NEW MEXI VW engine. He also installed 1.25 ratio rockers and 
duel Solex carbs. This really helped in the drineability aspect on the So Cal freeways. He seems to average 20+ mpg 
and even more on extended driving trips. He drives a 64 21 window deluxe with a Rancho 3.88 r/p trans with an 82 
4th gear.
   I also have 5 1800 cc engines out there in buses (74 stroke by 88 cut ins), so far no problems with any of them ,with 
the one in my bus clocking over 65,000 miles on it now.
