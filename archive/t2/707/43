Subject: Re: [T2]  Pierburg carb defects?

  None of my importers will take a defective carb and/or electrical item back, ie Borosol, Bocar, Pierberg, Bosch (new 
or rebuilt), compufire (they go directly to Compufire if defective).  So far I feel lucky as I have not had a Pierberg 
returned yet or have found any problems that easily couldn't be easily fixed.  On the Pierbergs the only thing I have 
had to do was rejet them with real SOLEX jets (I change these on all that I sell) and have had to reset the accelerator 
pump on 2. I have found different jet sizes and the Pierberg jets are not marked so I need to use a jet gauge to see 
what they are. Otherwise out of 47 sold I have had 2 with an easily fixed problems. I still feel they are much better 
and seem to transition better then a Bocar (Brazil).  
  I am running these on 2 of my VW's and have one on for 1 1/2 years (got it from one of my suppliers to test),
no leaks and or seepage, haven't had to touch it since installed.
  The other has come off an engine and is going on a 1776 single port for further testing.

No new carb I have ever recieved smelled like gas and no part ever returned to me has been resold unless I offered it 
to a customer at a discounted price and they are aware that it was a returned item, used or not.
