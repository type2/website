Subject: Cylinder Hone

I am interested in buying a cylinder wall hone for a 2 liter engine.

This hone on the auction site says it runs from 3.5 - 3.75 "  I figure the 
94 mm cylinders to be about 3.7"

Is this the right size cylinder wall hone to get, and any suggestions as to 
the quality of this hone.

A different (smaller sized) hone mentions things like " This is a silicone 
carbide flex ball hone."

Thanks
