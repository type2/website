Subject: Auto body/rust Q

Almost the entire roof of my bus is rusty. Some PO took it down to bare 
metal, covered it in gray primer, and then let it sit out a block from 
the ocean for an indeterminate period of time. I've had it for seven 
years since then, but it has never been driven in the rain and has been 
garaged the whole time. (As I endlessly remind my wife, Peregrine isn't 
waterproof.)

All of this -- the scale and the primer -- has to come off. When it's 
done, I will double-coat the entire roof in POR-15 before priming and 
painting.

The strange thing is that the primer seems to have been well prepared, 
or is a good self-etching primer, so that it's been difficult to make 
progress with a sanding wheel.

This morning I tried a 3M 9099 "large area paint and rust stripper" 
(drill-mounted). This seems to be the right tool for the job, much 
better and faster than anything else I've tried. Doesn't get the metal 
too hot, leaves only scratches and the pinholes that the POR-15 will 
have to contend with.

The reason I'm putting this question out is that I don't see it 
recommended for auto body work much -- even in a google search. Is 
there any reason I should not be using this wheel?

Thanks,

Mark
