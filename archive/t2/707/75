Subject: Re: [T2] Battery testers

I have had customers say the FLAPS say that their battery was bad, when 
in fact it was just low on charge like yours.  At my shop, we use a 
VAT45 Snap-on tester ($3000) and it applies 2 consecutive loads at 
different durations.  It has never give me false reading.  I think the 
load test is important because batteries can hold a "surface charge" 
for a short amount of time which can lead you to a false reading.  A 
heavy  load is the only way to tell if the battery is good or not.  If 
the applied load drops the battery voltage down pass 10 volts, and does 
not recover quickly to pass 12v, it is most likely on its way out.

I don't know much about those electronic testers the FLAPS use.  But I 
can't see how not applying a load can give you an accurate diagnostics.
