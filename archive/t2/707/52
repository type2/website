Subject: Re: [T2] Heat riser

The monza exhaust is connected to the heat riser. However I suspect
that the monza's heat riser connector is sealed to facilitate the life
of dual carb people. And maybe the guy who installed the monza did not
know that the heat riser should be opened.

So I'm going to make sure that the monza's heat riser connection is
open by removing it. At the same time i'll clean the heat riser tube.

Has anyone seen a Monza GT recently ? I'm just wondering wether the
heat riser tube is open when they come out of the factory.
