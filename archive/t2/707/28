Scott,

Have you considered rebuilding the engine yourself? I just rebuilt the 
larger 2.0 L engine with considerable help from the list, and while I 
can't yet know how it will do over the long term, the first run was 
smooth as silk.

There are advantages and disadvantages to all of your options (get a 
turnkey, work with a local rebuilder, do it yourself). I'm sure that 
listees will be more than happy to list the pros and cons of each 
option.

Mark
