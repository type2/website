Subject: Heat riser plugged

My daily a Hoover sermon taught me about the heat riser tube. I was
able to touch both sides of the heat riser tube after a 15 minute
drive in 55 degree weather. (i.e. the riser wasn't hot)

Is it plugged then ?

I kind of experience the "plugged heat riser symptom" as described by
Muir, but also I still have a 009, so not sure who's at fault.

I hope that my heat riser is not plugged as it seems to be hell to unplug.
thanks
