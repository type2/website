Hello Steve   In doing Gord Potts tranny last week I found that 80-83 was all 
by their selfs. You might be able to install an 83-85 waterboxer tranny but 
the shift rods are different as the linkage on the early trannys is in the 
nosecone and later ones are in the gearbox.  I also checked on using a late bay 
but the nosecones wont interchange and theres no place for the shift rod. Now I 
might be able to fix your old tranny if need be and there are reman trannys 
out there,  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
