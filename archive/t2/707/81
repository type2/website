Subject: Door panel clips

Hi Volks,

Last weekend I installed a pair of 1988 Vanagon captain's chairs into 
the westfakia... this is an excellent upgrade to the bus; but may not 
be perfect for everyone as they do add an extra inch of seat height 
compared to the stock seats. It's not a problem for me.  The other 
complication is that the arm rests on the seats interfere with the 
armrests on the door panels. That was an easy fix; I temporarily 
swapped over the door panels over from the sunroof bus. But they're 
green, so they've can't stay, even if I didn't need them for the 
sunroof.

I was wondering if anyone has a source for the clips used to hold the 
plywood rear hatch panel in place? I was thinking about refitting the 
interior with plywood interior panels, but to do that properly I'd need 
to use those nice chrome buttons that are on the rear hatch. To do both 
front doors and the slider would probably take about 50 or so; 
hopefully they're not too pricey.

Happy trails,
