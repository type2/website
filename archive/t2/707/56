Subject: Re: plugged heat riser

Thanks Gary for the detailed answer. I'm scared by the idea that my
rebuilt engine with 25K miles might be almost shot because of that...
I saw the dark smoke, poor mileage (18mpg)  and other horrible things
you describe.

My plan was to remove the muffler only and try the drill-steel-wire
trick with the manifold in the bus. Is that doable ? Seems that the
other option is to remove the manifold for better access but involves
more work.

It's not that I like my Monza muffler, it's just that I cannot buy a
new one right now.

 <horrible things description>
 If you drive around with a plugged up heat riser you will get terrible
 gasoline mileage. You will also prematurely wear out the rings. The
 carburetor and plenum are not getting hot enough to completely vaporize the
 liquid gasoline into a gas vapor air fuel mixture. So you are squirting raw
 liquid gasoline into the combustion chamber. This liquid gasoline cannot
 burn up so you have poor gasoline mileage and less power. But the worst
 effect is that the liquid gasoline dissolves and washes the oil off the
 cylinder walls and thus the rings scrape against the cylinder walls without
 lubrication. The rings wear out, the cylinder walls wear out the pistons
 wear out; and liquid gasoline actually flows into the oil sump. Your engine
 will start burning oil with a visible smoke trail. Your engine will wear out
 sooner because the gasoline oil mix in the sump does not lubricate the
 crankshaft and rod bearings and camshaft as good as pure oil does.
