Well, "tested" is a relative term!  I have a feeling that a lot of vendors
"test" carbs by selling them to customers who return the defectives.  The
ones the can be fixed easily are resold, the others go back to the
distributors.  Less scrupulous vendors just keep selling the defectives
until they find someone who will either fix it themselves or take the
loss.

Bad function (sticky throttle plates) or clogged jets are no trick to
diagnose, though you shouldn't have to do this on a new carb.  I had heard
that Pierberg quality control was good, despite being made in China.

Of course, I've had a brand new and defective Brosol carb, so
perhaps the Pierbergs aren't any worse

The aftermarket FI systems are looking better and better.  Pity they
still run over a grand!
