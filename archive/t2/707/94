Subject: Re: [T2] Heat riser

Andy, I think you have the point !
I looked at the Monza and the by design (lack of design) there will
never be any flow in the heat riser tube. Because both pipes to the
heat riser are placed exactly at the same location on the left and
right part of the muffler.
http://www2.cip1.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=ACC%2DD%2D2070 (it
is hard to see, but both heat riser connectors are symetric)

Therefore, like you say, no pressure differential and no air flow in
the heat riser tube.

I Iooked at pictures of stock mufflers 
http://www2.cip1.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=VWC%2D211%2D251%2D053%2DA
(easy to see the little funny pipe on the left)
On the left side, the heat riser connects directly into the resonator,
where I guess the pressure is lower than at the head exhaust port. On
the right hand side the heat riser gets gases right out of the exhaust
port. Therefore the pressure on the left side is less than on the
right side and there is a hot air flow in the heat riser tube.

I'm going to attempt a quick hack with my
non-engineered-monza-piece-of-junk : cut the heat riser connector at
its base on on the left part of the muffler. Seal the left exhaust
(where the heat riser tube was) and leave the output of the heat riser
tube wide open (it will get it's gases from the right port) . If my
heat riser tube is not clogged I should get a serious stream into the
tube since the output will be straight out.

I'm expecting lousy engine sound and other potentially fun things

Temporary conclusion : a monza or anyting similar with symetric heat
riser connectors is a BIG NO for any single carb engine.

  there may be other issues with a non stock exhaust.
 not only does the path through the heat riser need to be clear but it
 needs a pressure differential or nothing will flow.
 if the exhaust is not designed to make that happen, it wont.
