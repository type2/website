Jeff- Yes, Paul's VW WAS known for crappy work.  Paul's is now under
new ownership (paul sold the business).  The owner is Don and I have
known him for 15 years.  A very honest guy and he does A+ work AND IS
NOT A CROOK!

Since I made my comment about Paul's public, I will do the same with my
apology. I did not know Paul had sold the business and I apologize to the new
owner. the reason for my comment: I took my first Westy to Paul's in 1998. He
told me I had two problems-I needed a new carb and I had an exhaust leak due a
stud that was snapped off in the head. He wanted $450.00 (part only, not
including labor) for the carb, and $180.00 to drill out and replace the stud.
I picked up the Westy without him doing any work. I bought and replaced the
carb myself for $150.00 and found the stud was simply missing, nothing was
broken off in the head. I put in a new stud for 80 cents. When I picked up my
Westy from Paul's, he tried to sell me a used engine for $1,100.00, plus
another $900.00 to install the used engine. The used engine had a bad head,
for which he wanted another $400.00 to replace that! I also have some friends
that took their Vanagon to Paul, and after he soaked them for around
$4,000.00, he told them "what you really need is new engine"! He was in
business for quite a long time, how I don't know. The new owner may want to
consider changing the name!   Jeff
