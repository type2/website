Subject: FI Idle air valve

I'm looking for a new deceleration valve for a stock '79 with Cali 
emissions.  This is the big diaphragm thingy that bolts onto the 
firewall/gas tank cover and is controlled by vacuum.  Does anyone know 
whether VW still carries this part?  What is the part number?  Karl?

Thanks,

Tim
'79 Westy
