The pin that I am referring to is actually called a relay lever shaft.  It
seats in a bushing which is mounted into the lower front axle.  Bentley has
information on its removal.  I have not done this work myself, but I am
about to since I am kind of picky about how things get done (when I have
enough sense to do so).

The Bentley description of this job is a rather short one.  My experience
with manuals is that the work increases exponentially, the smaller the
process description.

Bentley recommends the usage of a C clamp and a slide hammer.  It is very
easy to slide under the bus and see what I am referrencing.  Put the front
end up on stands and shuffle under the front end.  A link to your steering
will come out from under the guard plate and connect to the relay lever on
the axle.  The relay lever is held in place by the relay lever shaft which
"should be" held snug in a bushing that seats inside of the lower front
axle.

Any further description would be best answered by the voice of experience
and I am a neophyte at the time that I am writing this.

I got under there the other day and found that I need to replace my bushing
now that everything is moving correctly.  This is probably all related to
the miles and miles of driving that the PO put on my bus with bad ball
joints and poorly adjusted steering linkage.  Now that things are working as
they should, newer parts are putting more wear and tear on the older/abused
parts that are still there.

How does one pull this pin?
