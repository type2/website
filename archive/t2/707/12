Subject: did you buy a 65(or so)  in springfield, or in the last year or

Sold my 65(i think) splitty to someone(steve?) on the type 2 list when the
city was coming down on me a while back, today i got the some old owner info
and the package tray(can't remember if i stuck one in there or not?) that goes
under the dash from the guy who sold it to me, e-mail me directly if you want
it.
