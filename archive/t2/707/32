Subject: [T2]  Pierburg carb defects?

  Logging on thesamba the other day, i see a CIP ad for these carbs. And in 
the ad it says, 'search to see what the forum users are saying about these 
carbs!', and knowing whats going on here, i fugure that might be 
interesting. So i look. Heres another venfors approach -

--------------
It is a very good sign that it smells like gas, I'm sure they tested it. We 
bought 40 of those carbs at a time, and 20 needed something done to them and 
2 had to be sent back. So, they are good and bad. Like I said, since it 
smells like gas, you are probably ok. As for the jets, I don't know what 
size they are, but we haven't had to change any to run perfect on a stock 
1600. Just my .02
-------------
We had one throttle plate that wouldn't close. That one went back. We had a 
couple that had "crud" stuck in the idle jet that had to be cleaned out. On 
some, the needle and seat stick and drip. The one's that are good just run. 
But you are right, all of the squirters are way off.

Those are from roy(-at-)mofoco.  They are in reponse to someone buying one from 
CIP and not having run it yet, but encountering 'chatter' on these carbs 
possible use as doorstrops and trying to decide whether to return it.  They 
bought it from CIP, who told them they test it, its either tested or a 
return as the guy says it smelled like gas when recieved. Maybe other 
vendors test them too.  Roy also shows some of the things that hes seen 
wrong with them, note that over 20 of the 40 he recieved were needing work. 
It doesnt seem to be 'a flaw', they just all need something, general lack of 
quality control. IF they were all unfixable, noone would buy them, they are 
obviously workable, you just need to go through them, or find someone that 
does.
