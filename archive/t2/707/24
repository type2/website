Scott,

GEX...absolutely *NOT*   
AVP...lots of good things about them on the list...minimal bad things


I'm not familiar with the other one you listed.

You need to tell us where you live asthere may be a local rebuilder 
with a good reputation know to the list.

Replace everything that you can afford to on the engine at the same 
time...carb, generator, etc.

Occasional useage = stock engine with maybe a very mild camshaft
that develops lots of low end torque.  If this is occasional(not in hurry) 
type of deal, then stock is fine as you can afford to put along to get to 
your camping spots.

Motor should be balanced for longetivity.

Cheers, dave
