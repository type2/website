It probably took a strange combination of circumstances to cause this. 
After all, buses continue to run in the rain, even in heavy rain. So 
some adjustment of one of the jets probably flooded the engine 
compartment. The same thing might not have happened at the car wash 
down the street.

Even so, using the do-it-yourself bays at car washes is probably 
well-advised.
