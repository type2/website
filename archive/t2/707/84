Subject: Re: [T2] Part Number List?

Tim asked:

Can someone direct me to a list where I can identify a VW part number?  
I am trying to find the VW part number for a deceleration valve.  I've 
found it on microfiche on Richard's site, (subgroup 33, illustration 
18-10, item #5) however I can't figure out how to correlate that with 
an actual part number.
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

The part number for #5 is 071 161 551. BUT that is only if your engine number is
GE 039332 or higher. Below that engine number, the part number is NLA from VW.

Using this link: http://www.partsvoice.com/  the part does not appear to be in stock or available 
at the dealer anymore.....
Even bus depot does not show the part number.......
