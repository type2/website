What needs to be done first is to get a coordinator for each state, maybe
3 for cali and one person could do a few smaller states but essentially
spread the job around.
and the job would be to verify and update the contacts for your area.

then we would have a working, up to date list. any improvements in the
mechanics of it would be secondary.

I told wade this a long time back. I contacted the entire florida list
myself. wade dropped the ball, period. nothing ever came of it and of
course I couldnt update the site myself.


i still volunteer to re-redo the florida list if someone will actually
take the info and use it.
