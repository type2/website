Subject: Idiot T2 owner, Car Wash Death

I guess I am an idiot T2 owner.  Monday, I ran my bus
through a car wash.  Engine running, smile on my face
as my baby was getting bathed.  First clue I was in
deep ca-ca occurred when the idiot lights on the
speedo which came on.  Uh-oh.  Engine had died. 
Key-off, on, start, crank crank crank blahhhh. 
Nothing.  Sweat.  Shut-off tunes.  Talked to the big
"G" in the sky.  Ok.  Calm down.  Waited for the wash
to be finished.  When done, crank crank crank zoom! 
It started.  But it ran poorly.  I drove it home with
it caughing and choking.  At home, I found water in
the dizzy, and a soaked air filter.  Move forward in
time.  Yesterday, I put a new air filter in, and put
the distributor cap back onto what appeared to be
electronic ignition that had dried-off.  Well, it
started, but just barely.  Am running on only 2 or 3
cylinders, depending upon revs.
   
Either something is still wet, or something really hot
did not appreciate getting a cold wet bath a couple of
days ago.
   
Grrr.  Have made arrangement to tow M.P. across town
to a mechanic on Saturday.  T2 list, I have inspected
and tinkered, and can't find any obvious reason for
this new problem.  Everything appears to be dry. 
Excessive gas smell after engine shut-down confirms
fuel system is operational.  When running, niether
black or blue smoke.  Running on less than 4 cylinders
would tend to indicate water soaked and intermitten
shorting of ignition system.  M.P. just got a tune-up.
 Hope it was not for naught.
   
What does the T2 list have to say about car washes? 
And idiot T2 owners?   Last week, I was a T2 Car Wash
virgin.  This week, I wish I were still a T2 Car Wash
virgin!
