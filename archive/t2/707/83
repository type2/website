Subject: Re: [T2] - AIRS List Project - Please Input

Hi Josh,

Back in October I was talking to Steve Dolan at John Brown's Buses when 
the topic came around to the AIRS list. I mentioned how it had been 
discussed around the campfire at Dixie Bus Gathering. Thhe main thrust 
of the discussion was that no-one had *ever* bothered to remove 
themselves from the list and as a result it was chock full of bouncing 
email addresses and not-in-service telephone numbers. Emails sent to 
the AIRS webmaster either went unanswered or bounced.

Steve recommended that I bring this up with the list, and suddenly I 
found myself in charge of a remake of the AIRS project.

After much discussion, there was a pretty good idea of what needed to 
be done. We need a database put in place that can create custom pages 
on-the-fly organized by region and services required. We need the data 
to be time-stamped when it is input and to be purged when it goes 
stale. It needs to be as accessible as possible under extreme 
low-bandwidth conditions. No Flash, no Java, no animated GIFs.

Unfortunately, knowing what needs to be done and being able to make it 
happen are two different things. Recent changes with my 
responsibilities at work have cut down on the amount of time I can 
dedicate to the AIRS project, and the more I dig into what needs to be 
done the more I realize that I don't have the skills that are needed. 
Nor do I have the time to learn them. When I look at database code my 
eyes just glaze... I can't do it. At first I thought things might get 
better if I put some time into it after Christmas but in fact the 
opposite seems to be what is actually happening.

Not too long after discussion on the list subsided the AIRS Webmaster 
Wade reappeared and wondered what all the fuss was about. The original 
site has been cleaned up and is operating normally, though there is 
still a fair bit of of stale data on there.

Do I need help? Hell YES.  I need a staff of programmers, preferably 
with experience in PHP and MySQL. Graphic expertise is not necessary; 
experience in interface design would be highly valued. Previous 
experience preferred but not mandatory.

Interested parties please apply via email.


Happy trails,
