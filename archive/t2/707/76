Cliff,

You more than likely have water in and around the spark plugs also.

And maybe in the wire contact points in the dizy and coil.

When I wash my engine I try and cover those things with a towell or 
plastic bag.  Sounds like the wash where you were dumped a ton of water down the 
air inlet areas and then you blew it all over with your fan since the 
engine was still running.

Drive the daylights out of it first and get it nice and hot...so it can 
dry out...my bet it that it will do so....and you will feel the plugs 
start kicking back in after a mile or two.

I always use the wand so I can try *not* to get water all down the air 
intakes on the outside.

Cheers, dave
