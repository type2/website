Hi,

while traveling to Washington DC about two weeks ago my 82 westfalia broke 
down in woodbridge, VA.  I did some basic troubleshooting and traced it to a 
fuel supply/fuel injection problem.  Due to time constraints I had it towed 
to Laslos foriegn car service in woodbridge for repair in hopes that they 
could get me back on the road.  They have been unable to solve the problem 
and I really really really need to get my bus back on the road.  Can anyone 
here reccomend a good repair shop in the DC area?  Thanks in advance.

Chris
