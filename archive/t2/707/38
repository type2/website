Take Karls advice. Also keep in mind that the rebuilders will always want to
sell you the biggest engine possible because they make more money.

You will find AVP feedback in the archives. GEX engines don't last. There
are listmembers with JCS Volks Machine engines that might want to speak up
on their behalf. There's is also Fast German Auto.

Buy locally if you can. You can't imagine the hassles involved in shipping
your engine back to the rebuilder when there is a problem with it. Let's say
the head is bad, you'll have to send the whole engine back to the rebuilder
for analysis under the warranty schemes.

For those who don't have a local engine builder, there is no option
obviously.
