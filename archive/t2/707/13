Subject: [T2] - AIRS List Project - Please Input

Hello everyone!!!   Has anyone here ever broken down??????

Anyone ever had to use the AIRS list???  Anyone ever print it???
I am trying to go through the AIRS list right now to condense in down... =
 Right now it is at 56 pages, 28 if you print both sides...  I think I =
can get it down to under 10 pages....  This is for NC only, but if it =
works out, I will do the whole thing..

It would be really great and helpful if everyone would look at the site =
and add or update the info for them there... It will take a lot of work =
to do what I want to do, so if there is good info in there the first =
time, that would be SUPER....=20
 PLEASE PLEASE HELP KEEP THIS A GREAT RESOURCE AND UPDATE THE LIST OR =
EMAIL ME WITH THE INFO!!!!           78vwbus(-at-)bellsouth.net

That is a link to the NC page of AIRS...

mo_airs&op=modload&name=gallery&file=index&include=view_photo.php

 This is what is will look like when I format the whole thing......(without
the squiggly line under =
misspelled words, Ill fix that)


Each symbol represents a service that can be provided... There will be a =
legend on there as well...

I also have a .PDF file that is completely standalone for anyone who =
wants a copy of that for a disc..  You can use it JUST like the site =
with no internet connection and it even has the other countries...

Once again PLEASE update the AIRS list or email me  =
78vwbus(-at-)bellsouth.net  and help make this resource more accessible to =
everyone that needs it...  Also please give me feedback on what you =
think of the format here so I can make changes before I get into it way =
too far...

THANK YOU!!!!!=20
