The correct colour is grey for 1971-1979 models. I
believe officially it is called 'chrome'. The VW
colourcode is L91. With this 'L91' code you should be
able to get it from a paintshop if they have a list of
VW colours.

The exception to the 'wheels are grey' rule are the
Champagne Edition models from 1977 and 1978.
