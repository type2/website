Most of the clips on the fuse panel are bent so I can't be absolutely sure
the fuses are always making good contact because the PO had glass fuses
stuffed in there, including several "shorties" that s/he bent the clips
down to make fit. 

I have a couple of known good fuse panels but I went ahead and ordered some
DC breakers and I'm just gonna make a panel. I'm going to spread the
breakers out a bit to help clean up the tangle and make the panel from 1/4"
plexiglass so I can see where the wires are going even with it mounted.

I ordered 10x8amp and 2x15amp NTE breakers from http://www.mouser.com. $38+
shipping but no more loose or blown fuses. I understand why VW didn't use
them -- the cheapest I could find them even 3 or 4 years ago was about $10
each. the price has dropped considerably.

This will be a good "trail run" for doing a complete custom harness for
the '74 in the future.
