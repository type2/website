  Designed to create crosshatched surface patterns for oil retention.

This statement came from the site that Barry references in his note. 
For me, it brings up an issue that I've never gotten a good handle on.

The explanation I once heard for creating a cross hatch pattern on 
the inside wall of a cylinder went like this.  To prevent oil from 
flowing out of the cylinders along their inside walls, a good seal 
must be made between ring and cylinder.  Rings and cylinder walls are 
not necessarily perfectly round and will never quite match each 
other,  so the seal will not be perfect.  A microscopic view of a 
cross hatch surface would show that it was not smooth; it is a ridge 
pattern. These ridges are thin and are easily worn away by the piston 
rings as they scrape the inside wall of the cylinder. The ridges can 
therefore carve out a pattern in the cylinder wall to match the shape 
of the ring, thereby insuring that a good seal is made.

Can anyone either confirm this or set me straight?

Jack
