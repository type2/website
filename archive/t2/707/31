 So far, I think, I would order a 1641cc with
 external oil filter setup, alternator, dual port, deep oil sump, new clutch,
 electronic ignition and header as additional accessories.

I would stay away from using a 1641 in a bus. The thin walled 87mm cylinders
will cause excessive overheating. They are more suited for a bug.

Either keep the original 1600 size or go 1776 which involves machining the case spigots.

Keep in mind that the 68 to 71 bus engine requires a rear hanger bar that gets in the way of the oil pump and
new fittings.....   also MAKE sure you get an engine case that has the hanger bosses machined and threaded for
the hanger bar. It sucks when you try to install a bug engine and you can't support it!

I believe AVP mainly does typeIV engines?
