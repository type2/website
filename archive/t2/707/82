Subject: Part Number List?

Can someone direct me to a list where I can identify a VW part number?  
I am trying to find the VW part number for a deceleration valve.  I've 
found it on microfiche on Richard's site, (subgroup 33, illustration 
18-10, item #5) however I can't figure out how to correlate that with 
an actual part number.

Any help is greatly appreciated.
