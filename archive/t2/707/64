Subject: Re: [T2] Head temp sensor

Richard rplied to Greg's post:
 
 When I tried to remove
the sensor I discovered that the tin work on this engine makes the
sensor rather difficult to remove. With the old motor you can remove
the sensor with an open ended wrench, but on this engine you need a
deep 13mm socket, and it's hhard to get at with the intake runners in
the way.
 
 Use one of those new low profile 13mm racheting box wrenches.
  
----------------------------------------------------------------------

That box wrench will never work on a 75 1800 temp sensor. It is UNDER the cylinder 
head tin, under #3 intake runner, at a 45 degree angle. Ever notice 76-78 left upper
engine tin having a 3/4" hole with a rubber plug in it? This is for the 75 temp sensor.
Bentley shows that sensor in a drawing, section 10, page 15, top left. Look at the drawing 
and you will see the head fins. Below it is directions on replacing it: remove rubber seal and 
use a deep socket etc.
Horrible horrible design.
