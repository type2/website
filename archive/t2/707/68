Subject: Re: [T2] Head temp sensor

While we are on the subject, I have never, ever successfully removed a
temp sensor from the head. The head always breaks off and leaves the
body in the head. What is the secret?

  When I tried to remove
 the sensor I discovered that the tin work on this engine makes the
 sensor rather difficult to remove. With the old motor you can remove
 the sensor with an open ended wrench, but on this engine you need a
 deep 13mm socket, and it's hhard to get at with the intake runners in
 the way.
 
  Use one of those new low profile 13mm racheting box wrenches.
