Subject: Head temp sensor

Hi Volks,

The 2L Fi engine in the westfakia is a recent transplant on "loan" from 
my wife's sunroof bus until I get the time to fix a rather severe oil 
leak. Since the transplant the engine has started and run well, but it 
does have a habit of dying out after about 30-45 seconds. Restart it 
and it will repeat this behaviour for about two minutes until the 
engine is warmed up. As soon as it warms up the problem is gone.

I had originally suspected the Auxiliary air valve, but the problem 
persisted even after it was swapped out. I figured that made my engine 
a candidate for the temp sensor stand-off, but Scott Lyons suggested 
that I should replace the sensor before trying the standoff.

So this past weekend I went out to the driveway to swap over the "known 
good" head temp sensor from the other engine. When I tried to remove 
the sensor I discovered that the tin work on this engine makes the 
sensor rather difficult to remove. With the old motor you can remove 
the sensor with an open ended wrench, but on this engine you need a 
deep 13mm socket, and it's hhard to get at with the intake runners in 
the way. It's even harder to remove when there is a stray spark plug 
under the tin.

I removed my #3 plug, removed the stray plug with a handy pair of 
forceps that were gifted to me by my paramedic brother, and replaced 
the #3 plug. Since then the engine runs perfectly with its original 
sensor.

My guess is that the stray plug was blocking the airflow to the area 
near the head temp sensor; causing it to give false readings of an 
engine that seemed warmer than it really was. CHT readings are also a 
bit lower now that the blockage has been removed.


Happy trails,
