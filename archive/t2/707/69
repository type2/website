After seeing Gerald's at BBB, I'm installing a pair of two barrel
Dellorto's on mine. I'm only going with 36's instead of 40's though.
But other's have told me a 36 Dellorto is equivalent to a Weber 40.
Anything to that?

After fighting with another FI bus last weekend, I've had it. Tried 4
AFM's, 2 ECU's, 2 harnesses, two dual relays, hot wired the fuel pump,
still nothing. Could only get it to fire if I primed it.

I think you can build your own CIS system from a donor Rabbit for very
little, George.
