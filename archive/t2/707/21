Hello Greg  This is a common thing  I have opened a type 4 motor only to find 
6 pliugs and 3 sockets under the tin,  All the sockets were china made LOL   
I use a magnetic socket from Snap-on tools which works great, just have to 
remember not to use an air gun with it cause it will break the magnet in the 
socket.  Glad to see your dad made it home OK  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
