Has anyone tried those new style electronic battery testers? They have the
digital displays and test the conductance of the battery instead of the
applying a real load and dissipating the heat.

The other day, I broke down right in front of NAPA in my wife's car and
borrowed one of these digital units from the counterman. It was made by
Midtronics and I entered the CCA rating of the battery with the keypad.
After testing was complete, it said our battery was bad but it wasn't
forthcoming with details.

 We were jumped by AAA and when we got home, I filled up the battery, charged
it overnight and it's been good to go since.

 I'm wondering if the full time mechanics have an opinion on either style of tester?

Mercedes uses the new style Absorption Glass Mat (AGM) battery. You cannot load test
this style battery the conventional way. You WILL destroy it! We have to use the Midtronics
tester on them. This site talks about AGM. http://www.batterystuff.com/tutorial_battery.html#3

The Midtronics tester is not recommended for non-Gel and non-AGM batteries. For old style wet cell batteries,
you need to use the standard load tester. [3x the AH rating and the voltage should not go below 9.5v]
I would not believe the results you got.......http://www.batteryweb.com/battery_tester.cfm

But, if you water level was below the plates, i.e. the plates were exposed, and the battery went dead.....
your battery is on its last legs. Pick out a new one very soon :)
