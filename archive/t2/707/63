Subject: Vanagon for sale

From a friend of mine.

$6000.00. This is the much sought after VW Vanagon GL Wolfsburg 3Weekender2
edition complete with rear facing removable jump seats and fold down Z-bed
in the rear. The perfect weekend camping vehicle. You can fit more stuff in
it than you can a Westy, and the bed is an ample queen size too! This car is
currently my daily driver, so it runs great! Farvernugen...take it to the
beach, the mountains, the desert!

Contact her for more info at anon-63112828(-at-)craigslist.org.  It's white, it's
clean, and it's in California.
