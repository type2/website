Stick a section of broken clutch cable on your drill and spin it the opposite direction to the twist of the threads. Will unravel and breakup the junk inside. Easy. 

I never bought a muffler that would not bolt up to my manifold for the reasons you mentioned. First I had a clogged manifold, manifold ice, and once I figured out what was wrong I made the decision to keep that functional. Took a long time to figure out what was wrong.
