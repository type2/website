How much money do you have in that baby?  I know where
there's a late sixties model that has been sitting in
a garage for over 10 years.  Hasn't been started all
that time.  It ran when the owner died.  I've thought
about it, but it's quite a ways from me.  Several
hundred miles.  A friend inherited the house.  

Thanks...KR
