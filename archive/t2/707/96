Subject: Re: [T2] 30/31Pict on a 1600DP?

Max,
You are right, 34 PICT is the correct carb for 1600 DP.
I am at my fifth month of ownership with a 1600DP with brosol 30/31
and 009. The 009 is going away but for now I'll keep the 30/31. A few
guys on the list told me that it was easier to get a stable idle with
30/31 and they used it on 1600 DP. For now this carb is not giving me
any trouble so I leave it in peace.

There has to be some top end power loss but because you are not
dumping as much mixture with a 30/31 than with a 34. If i remember
well the 1600 SP with 30pict has 50hp and 1600 DP with 34 has 56 hp.
1600DP with 30/31 is likely close to 50hp.

Conversely, it might improve the gas mileage to be 'undercarbed' with
a 30/31 on a DP. Not sure though. FYI : I'm getting 18-19 mpg with
1600dp, 30/31, 009, non working heat riser tube. I was getting
22-23mpg on my other bus 1600dp, 34, stock dizzy, stock exhaust with
heat riser working.

I thought you could use the same SVDA with a 30/31 and a 34 ? If not
how big is the difference ?
