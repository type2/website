Hi Mark,

IIRC I already fished out a couple of plugs from the top of this motor
already... but those were on the 1-2 side. I gotta say that I was quite
surprised at the effect that single plug had on the warmup with the FI
system.... I wasn't expecting the problem to go away like it did and
although it was a pleasant surprise it took some thinking to sort out
WHY.

Happy trails,
