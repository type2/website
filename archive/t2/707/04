I disagree. Telling them they have a problem is helping, even if I'm not
listing the exact details. See my "house on fire" analogy.

For those that missed it, many here feel that telling someone their house is
on fire is not helping if you do not divulge exactly where it's burning. I
disagree with this logic.

You can think of me what you want.
