Subject: 30/31Pict on a 1600DP?

Hi guys and gals,



I have been looking at replacing my 009 dizzy since I am now into my 6th
month of bus ownership :) and was reading Aircooled.nets' article about
carburetors and found out a 34Pict is the correct carb for my engine. I
currently have a 30/31Pict with the adaptor plate, I assume, on the
engine. Besides the wrong dizzy how much does the smaller carb affect
performance (in a bus, yeah right) and gas mileage? I will be rebuilding
a 34Pict to replace the 30/31 with so that I can use the SVDA
distributor.



Thanks for the info and advice,
