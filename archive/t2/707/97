Are you taking it to bare metal before POR-15?  I thought that wasn't
the ideal situation (ref. Rebuttals to Terry's POR-15 experiment)

2 coats of POR-15?
Now I'm really confused.

It's Friday, and to add some coherence and quote-ratio-filler, have
you enjoyed the book on Peregrine falcon tracking "On The Wing"?

through and enjoying it. My wife likes it but notes it gets a big
gushy at times.
