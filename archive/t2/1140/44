Subject: ethanol

I don't think it would be appropriate to get into the politics of this
issue but I'm starting to worry about all of the cheap gas I've burned
in the Bopmobile over the last few years.  From a scientific and
technical standpoint does anybody have any input on whether this is
really something to worry about?  A lot of my friends won't use it.
I read an article by a guy who asserts that when they up the content to
15%, which the EPA just approved, mileage will drop by 40%.  That's a big difference.   Anybody know
if that is true?  I'm more worried about the damage and shorter engine
life that it might cause.  I do know that air-cooled VW's weren't
designed for it.  Thanks....KR
