New engine. I bought an engine yesterday. Had been sitting in an old
ladies basement for at least 10 years. Filthy. DP dog house. No spark
plugs. Do I have to get it running to do a compression check (dizzy is
history), of can I just get it turning over with a starter. Also what
is the scrap value for the Mg case?
