I wonder if it would be easier to glue a nut to the inside of the body 
and then you could just use a machine screw from the outside.  Gluing 
the nut in there would be easy with the light removed and then you could 
install/remove the light easily without having to worry about spacers or 
drilling out rivets.  That said, I used a rivet to reinstall the lights 
when I took them out a month or so ago... but that was before I saw this 
thread :)
