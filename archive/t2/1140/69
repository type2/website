Subject: Battery Drain WOES

Hey guys, I have a battery drain when my regulator is hooked up on my 1974
Westy.  When I disconnect the regulator, from the alternator, there is no
drain.  What is the deal?  I just replaced the alternator and regulator.  Had
the alternator checked at a local shop.  I thought maybe I fried the diodes. 
It charges when hooked up, but it will drain the battery if hooked up and not
running.  Any help would be good. THANKS
