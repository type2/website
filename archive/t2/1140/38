Subject: Re: [T2] transmission jack

Hi Bob,
       I need to take the head of one side so I am worried about unbalancing
the plot.  I dont want the engine-jack combo to tip over.  I can sit down and
work on the motor no problem there.  Just dont want it to fall on my legs. 
There is a lug on the crank case at the clutch end (just above the case
joining bolt) and another one at the fan end just next to the fan plenum that
"look" like a place to lift from.  Both are on the case split line so things
should balance.  Dont want to get in the air and find the lug(s) aren't strong
enough tho.  Steel is always stronger than I think.  Alloy seems to break with
no warning.

I bought the hydraulic version.  I like the bigger ground footprint and the
hydraulics made the operation really easy.  I did need to fiddle it out even
with the van up on ramps.  I used a 2x8 on top of the jack as "cushioning". 
The extra thickness over 1/2 plywood, which I had to hand, was too much.  When
I get it on the hoist I will bolt a plywood flat to the top plate on the
jack.  Should work much better.  Thanks for your suggestions.

Thanks also to John Kolak, Greg Potts and Jonathan Stiles.

Time to get back to it.

which one did you get, the hydralic or cranked one.
