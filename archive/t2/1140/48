I should add that cheap gas is another issue of its own aside from

Additives in cheap gas cause engine and carb deposits that are harmful.

I buy Chevron/Texaco whenever possible because of Techron. You used to

the gas.

When not available, Shell's formula has a good reputation, and from
there, any of the "Top Tier" brands:
