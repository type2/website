Subject: headlight chrome rings & weep holes

Hi Guys,

 

I have been trying to deal with the front chrome rings on my '69. They are
not original, and do not have the weep holes that they should at the bottom.
I have thought of drilling a small hole, but thought that might cause the
chrome to get totally screwed up. Without this weep hole, the headlight
buckets fill with water-which causes rust.I just saw some on sale. The
seller says they have the weep hole, but he also thinks they have come from
a '69 bug. I thought the bug ones were the ones without the holes. I am
thinking that maybe they were from a bus or for a bus originally.

 

Any ideas on this one?

 

Thanks.
