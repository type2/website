 Alcohol in the bus has three primary effects.

 First is destruction of rubber components in the fuel system that are
 not alcohol resistant. Rumor has it that recently manufactured
 carburetor rebuild kits are made with alcohol-resistant materials, but
 if you don't know what you have, and don't want to rebuild your carbs
 soon, avoid using alcohol.

 Second is changing the stoichiometric point. So if you have dialed in
 your carbs for a certain fuel mixture, it is no longer valid for
 gasohol.

 The third is changing the spark propagation properties, which has
 consequences for the ideal timing setting. I read an article in a
 muscle car magazine that is not immediately at my fingertips which
 discussed the specific recommended changes to factory timing spec.
