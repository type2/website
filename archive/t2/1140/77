Thanks to everyone who helped me out on this one. I was working on  
drilling the stock plate, but had a "date" to meet some students at  
the boneyards in Chula Vista.

It has been at least three weeks since I was down there. There was a  
914 in the yard at the time, and I thought I'd see (a)  whether it was  
still there, (b) if the engine was still in it, and (c) whether it had  
a taco plate. My expectations could not have been lower.

I strolled over to the car and looked down the center. Yes, the engine  
was there. I made small talk with the students, putting off the moment  
when I crouched down and ...

... yes! A taco plate! A complete one with the cover! And it had all  
been sitting there undisturbed for three weeks.

Wow.  Don't bother to go looking for the taco plate. I got it. In 2011.
