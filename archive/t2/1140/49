Subject: Graphite

For some reason my local auto parts stores do not stock graphite powder.  I can 
order some online or go to the next town over to get some.  However will a 
number 2 pencil be just as effective or will the binders in the pencil lead gum 
up the works over time?  Other than locks, are there any other applications on a 
bus where graphite is useful or better?

Thanks.
