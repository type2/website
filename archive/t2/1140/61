Subject: RE: graphite

Don't use graphite in your locks!  It combines with the grease VW used and, in
conjunction with road grime, turns into a muck that really messes with the
locks and can lead to them jamming up.  I've worked on thousands of VW locks
and the graphite just causes problems.  Use Tri-Flow on them and the locks
will be in much better shape.  After we clean and service locks here in the
shop, we use a synthetic lock lube made by a division of Briggs and Stratton.
The original VW grease was very similar to wheel bearing grease, but the lock
industry has now gone to the synthetics with great results.  Keep the graphite
in pencils and out of your car.
