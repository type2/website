Well, let me tell you; the Brazilians give you a choice when you buy your 
Bus or bug, (at least used to when they made bugs), you could have a gas 
powered engine, or a sugar-cane ethanol powered engine. :-) I'm pretty darn 
sure it was an aircooled engine in either case. Now it's this watercooled 
1.4 but it's still available as either setup.

 I read an article by a guy who asserts that when they up the content to
15%, which the EPA just approved, mileage will drop by 40%.  That's a big 
difference.   Anybody know
 if that is true?  I'm more worried about the damage and shorter engine
 life that it might cause.  I do know that air-cooled VW's weren't
 designed for it.  Thanks....KR
