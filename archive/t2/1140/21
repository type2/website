Subject: RE: [T2] New engine

 New as in 'brand-spanking', or new as in 'new for you'?  Have the plug holes
been exposed for all these years?  If so, I'd recommend removing the heads and
clearing all of the gunk out of the chambers that I'm sure has deposited
inside there over the years.  After that - turn it over and look at each
cylinder to make sure they're gouge-free and clear of any debris.  Then- put
the heads back on and do your compression test.  Dry first -  then add a
little oil and do it wet.  Look on the Samba for people buying cases.  There
are quite a few that will pay you for it.  I just sold a used longblock
locally for $250.  YRMV.
