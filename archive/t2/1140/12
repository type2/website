I put marker lights inside my front door reflectors a few years ago.
The lens is amber.  The base and light bulb are the same as found
in the rear side markers.  The down side to this is to change a bulb,
I have to take the interior door panel off.  It wasn't that bad
cutting the holes in the doors.  Measure it twice before cutting.

There are alot of Mr.Magoo type drivers in SoCal, so more lights
seem better than less.  In the daylight, my bus doors still looks
stock.  I'm too lazy to wire these into the turn indicator circuits.
