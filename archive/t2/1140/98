You can purchase a rubber expansion nut. It's a rubber piece with a small lip
that has a metal insert. When you tighten a stainless bolt up in it,it will
expand locking it into place. That way only rubber touches the paint work and
using a stainless bolt keeps things nice. A Molly might be great in theory in
application a bad idea. They are usually made of a metal that would rust
quickly and metal to metal contact would not be a good idea for your German
steel. They rubber expansion fasteners come in all sizes and can be bought at
most hardware stores. I just used some to hold on my front spoiler on my
vanagon.
