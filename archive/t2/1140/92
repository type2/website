Hi Paul,

What weight oil are you running? If it's 10W30 then switch up to 20W50 
and the problem should go away.

Also, check your oil for consistency... if it's diluted by fuel it will 
lower the pressure and your engine will wear at a much accelerated rate. 
If in doubt, do an oil and filter change and see if it gets better.

Failing that, it's possible that it's the switch; they certainly aren't 
expensive or hard to swap. But if we're talking about an older, 
high-milage engine, it could be the first indicator that a rebuild is in 
your future.

Happy Trails,
