Subject: 71 dash removal.

If your bus dash air levers have never been out, there is a small plastic
clip(round) type thing that holds the lever in and keeps it from sliding out.
You'll have to get a small thin blade screwdriver under the dash and pop them
out. They will break.   Then the lever will pull out towards you.  There is
also a aluminum piece in there that will fall out when you pull them out.
That's the friction spring part.  Confusing?   Just pop out the clip first,
easy from there.
