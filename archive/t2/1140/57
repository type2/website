Subject: re:graphite

I do not think pencil graphite will work like you want it to, additionally-I
have had a few different locksmiths vehemently oppose using graphite in a
lock. I know that it has been considered the thing to use for a long time,
but they say that it will gum up the locks over time.

 

Anyone else.?
