Subject: FS: BOSCH Single Vacuum  Distributor - OEM

I've got an unused BOSCH single vacuum distributer that I purchased a few
years ago from CB Performance, but never got around to installing.

I'm heading in a different direction with my engine, so it seems pretty
pointless to keep this in the garage.

$100 shipped.

See description (-at-):

http://www.cbperformance.com/catalog.asp?ProductID=1348

It comes with cap, rotor, points, condenser, and is ready to install.
