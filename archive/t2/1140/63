Subject: Re: [T2] 71 TYPE 2  dashboard removal  ->  lights and levers

- thanks listees  for many replies. But the levers are still in,  
There must be a way!

I wish I had the later dash but the 71 (and I dont know up to which  
year) - well the levers just do not pull out and the small plastic  
plugs which seem to be the problem are virtually unreachable.  Altho  
they do seem to be guides - the levers come out about 1/2 inch.

Cutting the plastic plugs?

there is NO room back there!  I am considering either taking out the  
radio and the glove compartment to get access to the levers- crazy.
or
  probably a better option is to remove that black steering column  
support so I can see and  get up among all those hundreds of wires  
back there!

used many unknown muscles yesterday squirming around.  But this is  
one of those B*&*&Y  things that now really bugs me, I will not fram  
out!

someone has the soluntion. Please???

John
