Subject: transmission jack

Ok, so I bought one of those nifty transmission jacks from HF. Worked geat to
get the engine out of the vanagon. It's sitting on the jack next to the van.  
Now what do y'all do from here? I cant get the engine stand under the engine
because the jack is in the way and it only goes up 24". Cant see humping it up
onto a work table by sheer muscle power from there,  I have an engine hoist
but there doesnt seem to be any really sturdy places on the case to attach a
lifting strap too. Where do folks hook to, to lift a type IV?   I can put it
on some cribbing and do what I need to. I was hoping the tranny jack was going
to move me further ahead that that. j
