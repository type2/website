Here it is:

When you tighten the bolt, the wings you see along the sides collapse,
trapping them behind the item where you are installing it.

This is generally for sheet rock applications, so it may be difficult
to find one with a shank short enough for sheet metal use, so a spacer
may be necessary to take up the slack.
