Subject: Re: battery question

My apologies, I didn't explain myself clearly. The battery I took out, and the
Optima batteries in question have the terminals on the front of the battery
(the front of the top). So if you are looking at the front of the battery, the
negative terminal is on the left, positive on the right. If I turned it around
180 degrees as several people have suggested, the terminals would be in the
back of the battery compartment, and  inaccessible.

MY question was if I purchase a battery with the terminals on the top in the
middle of the battery, will it work (is there enough clearance on the top)?
