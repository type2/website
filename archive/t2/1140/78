Keep that tool handy.  You'll need it if you ever bust a pipe or 
something and have to turn your water off.  I finally got tired of 
struggling with it with a big pair of pliers and went to the hardware 
store and bought one.  Worth every penny of the six or eight bucks it cost!

For bus content, I have Jim Arnott's set of baby Del's on the way and 
there's a new guy in town who moved into a pretty new but 
out-of-business muffler shop or something.  He's got six bays with lifts 
and has several air-cooled VW's.  He said he could help me tune them or 
whatever I needed.  More on that when the weather warms up a bit.  He 
also said that he had two complete FI setups for sale.  I wish I'd known 
that as that's what I'd prefer but I probably wouldn't like the price.  
So I didn't even ask.  I think the Del's will be a good compromise 
between that and the single Weber I've been using.  I also have a new 
Petronix SVDA with the electronic ignition module.  So I'm about ready 
to rock.

By the way, I've retired from the cruise ship business and I'm back at 
home and ready to work on the Bopmobile.  When the weather is ready!  
And after tax season is over as I'm working as an accountant.  If 
anybody needs it, I'll give a list discount for advice.  Like a 100% 
discount!   I've got the software and on-line access to all 8,300,000 
words of the tax code at my fingertips.  Well, it's not as easy as it 
sounds but if I don't know the answer, I know how to find it.  Ciao...
