Subject: Fwd: battery question

>> After much research I've decided to go with an Optima red top for the
primary battery in my '79 Type 2 Westy. The battery that was in there is a
reverse post, and obviously if I was able to I'd purchase a reverse post
Optima (34R Model). The dealer that sells them doesn't have one in stock, and
it is 6 hours from my home so I won't get there again before camping season
arrives, and for some unknown reason they do not sell Optimas in Canada or
ship them here.
>>
>> Sooo...... my question is this - will a regular post Optima battery (with
the terminals on the top of the battery in the middle) fit into my Westy, or
do I specifically need a reverse post battery? In which case I will most
likely have to go with another brand.

>> Thanks for your time, enjoy reading the digest.
