You must be looking at batteries with terminals on the side, which is
not what was available when VWs were made.

I don't see why the question about top clearance since there is
nothing but air above the battery in the battery tray, but all OEM VW
batteries would have been top terminal batteries.

The issue being discussed so far on this thread is that switching the
terminals left to right means choosing whether to stretch your cables
across each other, if they will even reach, or stretching them back to
the back of the battery.

If you are looking at a battery with terminals in the middle, it
should be close enough for universal fit in both right hand and left
hand configurations.
