Subject: front-end side markers/ reflectors into blinkers?

Hi All,

As tho I need more projects for my 79 Riviera, what with the interior not
completed, and the crappy #3 compression, and the oil leaks...

Has anyone turned their front door reflectors into working blinkers/ side
markers (or felt the need)?

I realize that, on 73-79's, the upper orange lights have 2 bulbs in them -
the large double filament for parking/ signals, and the small bulb on the
outer edge for the side marker light... but those markers seem sub-par, and
the door reflectors are sitting right there... just lookin' at me...

I enjoy trying to keep the look of the Bus as stock as possible, and the
thought of drilling into the door freaks me out a bit - but this seems like
such a simple mod, and one worth the additional lighting.

Opinions appreciated.

Mike
