Run some straps around the heads to your hoist or run a chain with some
padding so you don't break off the cooling fins. If you strip your motor
down to the long block, it will be much easier to handle.

I use a lifting table instead of the transmission jack. A little harder to
get things lined up, but easier to use when the motor is out. They also lift
higher, around 48 inches.

Lift with your knees! :)
