Subject: RE: [T2] front-end side markers/ reflectors into blinkers?

Awesome!  I would worry about heat though.  Have you looked at led lighting as
an alternative?
On that note - I just bought some led 1157-sized socket tails for my '70(they
just arrived this morning), only to discover that they only have ONE light
intensity.  They don't have a 'dual-filament', so-to-speak.  Has anybody tried
set that worked correctly(and well) in a tail light application yet?  I bought
mine on Amazon.
