Hi SQUID,

There's some variables that could influence this situation.

Do the barges carry all the same fuel, or are individual containers
earmarked for their respective brands?

The source is probably the same refinery which probably belongs to
someone who owns all the brands in your area.

Some brands will be related, like Chevron/Texaco or Mobile/Esso and
will use the same stock between sister brands.

A big brand cannot compromise their name and reputation by accepting
fuel from an inferior supplier, but a cheap brand can get good gas at
a wholesale discount.

Another issue is where the additive packages are added in the
production and distribution process, but that is not as big of a
question as it used to be because if you go to the Top Tier website,
you will see that now their are also specifications for the
composition of the base stock as well.

 barges, then trucks take it to specific brand stations, and it all comes
 from Cherry Point over there in Anacortes Washington, so that got me to
 pondering...if the fuel barges unload same product to trucks that take it to
 dealers...when are the additives..like Techron..put in, since those trucks
 go to Esso, Chevron, Co op, etc??
