Greg
	Please encourage the new owner to try on this simple 
(-seeming? :-|) 1-tube vac connection a simple water-injection needle 
as described at my 
http://www.kuratrading.com/HTMLArticles/writings.htm
	Meanwhile I stumble on with too many mysterious vac tubes 
connecting my Brazilian Weber to my '61 beetle dizzie.  Getting a 
good vac regime suitable to suck in water when needed is difficult in 
this maze which I don't understand.
	Watch this space; meanwhile, if you have only ONE vac 
connection, that is likely to be wotth trying for water-injection 
with no moving (but some blockable) parts.  It's at worst harmless; 
at best, boosts economy & power, lowers engine temp, lowers 
emissions, and gentles yr combusion, even if you raise compression in 
a very big way.  This recommendation has been brought to you by a 
non-commercial peddler of an idea that seems too good to be true and 
for which he has no business plan.
