Your heater levers are plastic rods that slide into metal holders
behind the dash. Simply pull them straight out from the dash.

I'm not sure what flood lights are. The dash illuminating lights on
the circuit board are in plastic holders that twist out of the board.
Then you pull the lights out of their sockets.
