Subject: 71 TYPE 2  dashboard removal  ->  lights and levers

71  type 2 Dash

Does anyone have an EASY way of getting the dash FORWARD for  
replacing gauges and such - ie putting in a clock?

Those 4 heater/cool-air levers - what's the secret to removing them  
from the front - the brittle plastic plugs that hold them in place -  
cut and replace or what?  - are there replacement plugs. ?

At the back, how do the 2  dash 'flood'  lights pull out - twist or  
what?  And is there a brighter bulb I can replace them with while  
doing the other stuff?
