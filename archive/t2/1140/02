Is the alternator connected, or just sitting there with empty terminal 
as in the photo? Since you should see at least the battery voltage if 
it's hooked up, I suspect it isn't. In order to see any voltage, you 
must connect the regulator input terminal (D+) to +12V. This is usually 
done through an indicator light on the dashboard. You should also have 
the output connected to the battery, which acts as a buffer.
