 have had a few different locksmiths vehemently oppose using graphite in a
 lock. I know that it has been considered the thing to use for a long time,
 but they say that it will gum up the locks over time.

Well, that has traditionally been the argument against using oil in
locks, which is why graphite is used instead.

That having been said, I don't have time to mess with it and use
whatever spray lube I have handy. The locks aren't that hard to take
apart if you need to clean it up.

A modern alternative that is preferred is the teflon spray stuff. I
once had a can, but can't remember what it's called now.
