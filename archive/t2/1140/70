Subject: odd tool, help id?

Hey guys, I have this tool that came with my truck. I was just cleaning out
my garage, and was trying to figure out what it was? I don't even know if it
is VW related, or is just some random tool the PO left with the truck.

 

I posted a pic on thesamba:

thanks for your help
