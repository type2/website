I've done this; it isn't too hard.

I back off the bolts that hold the FI plenum onto the motor, and put a 
short length of chain through them. One at the front left, one at the 
back right side. Or maybe it's front right and left rear; it's been a 
while. Then you just figure out where the balance point on the chain is, 
and lift from there.

I used this technique with a "come-along" winch to get a fully dressed 
type4 onto the bench in my garage a few years ago, and I used it a few 
weeks ago to get an inline 4 onto the bench which will replace the Type4.

Happy Trails,
