Squid,

"Here" is sunny England  I think I'll try the de-icer as I've heard that 
recommended serveral times.

Josh, just buy some lock deicer, spray it in liberally, work the mechanism with 
key or hand, wipe off excess quickly, wait about 1/2 hour, and repeat,..then get 
something like WD-40, or equivalent lubricant, with the long 'proboscis', and 
spray it in there, wait,..wipe off all excess, and see if that doesn't do the 
trick!  Over here, I don't know what 'items' you have over there, but I think, 
any 'lubricant', in an aerosol base tin, with a 'long straw', on the nipple will 
do!  Over 'here' I use a product you prolly can't get, it is wax based, and 
..good!
Cheers
