I thought I would let you all know that I have sent a reply to the first list
member who replied about my parts. Please hold all other requests until I get
the details ironed out with him. If there is anything he doesn't want, I'll
let you all know.

  It's been quite some time since I've posted something to the type II list.
  Seems I've slowly drifted away from the bus scene and moved on to other
  transportation, the two wheeled air cooled variety.
