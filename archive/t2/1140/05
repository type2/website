Subject: Re: [T2] front-end side markers/ reflectors into blinkers?

I'm about half done with the ones for my '70. I started months ago and
got sidetracked. I'm doing them in a way that avoids cutting a bigger
hole in the door skin (which would be required if you used a stock REAR
marker light assembly with an amber, rather than red, lens).

Everything has to fit inside/under the original lens. I have one kinda
done and I need to do a "melt test" on it (eg.  how long can the light
stay lit without melting the lens).
