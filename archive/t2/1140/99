Subject: Paint Westy Top or Not

Hi Volks,

My 71 Westy is in the body shop being painted right now.  The shop has offered to paint the pop top for an additional $150 and the question is, should I paint it.  It is fiberglass after all, is it a bad idea to put paint on it instead of a gel coat?

Thanks,

- Douglas
