Subject: Sump plate temp sender install

In the distant past  I installed a VDO temperature in the sump  
inspection ("taco") plate of a 2.0 engine. Then I got a 914 plate and  
even had a spare. Now I'm redoing the whole process a decade later.

Last time, the sender came with a full sized drawing of exactly where  
to drill the hole in the plate. This time, nada. It seems like this  
little bit of info should be on the web by now as a PDF, but it  
doesn't seem to be.

Does anyone have a copy of that drawing, maybe? Would you be willing  
to scan it?

Please don't start a discussion about how the sump plate location  
doesn't give accurate information, or a CHT reading is better, or you  
don't use any gauges. There's plenty of that in the archives, on the  
Samba, etc. What there isn't anywhere is a picture of where to drill  
the hole.

Also, I forgot how I sealed this.
