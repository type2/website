Subject: new engine continued

New to me. It prolly came out of a dune buggy used as a street car.
The guy just wanted rid of it as he was cleaning up the woman's
basement, and knew I had busses. I bought it as it is a universal
case. I was thinking I might get lucky for a change, and have a runner
with a little work. Why would anyone take the plugs out and leave it
that way? Looks like I will have to at least tear it down that far.
Thanks.

I have at least 4 longblocks sitting around. I figured they had no value.

Thanks also for the many the off list comments. Do not be shy to
respond to the list! It is way too quiet here these days!
