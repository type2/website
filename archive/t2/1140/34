Subject: Fuel tank needed (and other)

I need a fuel tank for a 1971 Westfalia (with gas heater) OR... a person that
can give me a good sketch of the interior so a custom tank can be build (and
put some extra fuel in there if possible). If this goes through I will post
all data on RATWELL. I am looking at metal fabricators, and plastic
fabricators, with options for reserve tank (with switch) and designed to
accommodate a LP tank in the same area as well. So anyone that can assist with
an accurate inside sketch of that cove area, with pictures and dimensions will
be greatly appreciated, and noted in the article.
