Subject: Re: [T2] headlight chrome rings & weep holes

Kevin,

Go ahead and drill the chrome for a new weep hole. Use a new sharp bit
and put masking tape over the area so the chrome won't chip or flake.

Be sure to use a punch to mark the drill area to keep the bit from
skipping. I have used the automatic punch tools for years and they are
worth every penny.

After you drill, paint a small amount of clear enamel in the new hole
and on the back and you should be good to go.

You are correct about the bus needing weep holes. Since buses are
nearly vertical, water collects in the ring and corrodes. If they are
metal chrome they should have holes. I'm not sure about the later
plastic chrome ones though.
