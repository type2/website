Subject: No more bus, so free stuff for you

It's been quite some time since I've posted something to the type II list.
Seems I've slowly drifted away from the bus scene and moved on to other
transportation, the two wheeled air cooled variety. I thought I would send one
last post, mainly to thank those of you who kept me well advised as I was
rebuilding my 75 bus and 80 Vanagon Campmobile. I don't think I could have
done it without the help of this list.

The bus and camper have found new homes and I hope they are bringing their new
owners as much joy as they brought me. So, in an effort to make room for my
motorcycle hobby I've been cleaning out my shed and gathering all my old bus
spares together. I listed them for sale today on craigslist, but this
afternoon I had a thought. Maybe there is someone on the type II list who
could use this stuff. I'd like to see it all go to someone who really
appreciates what the Bus is all about. All you have to do is come pick the
stuff up. There is no charge, that's right it's free parts for whoever wants
to come to Flagstaff Arizona to get it within the next week or two. I need
this stuff gone and need the room. I don't care if you want the stuff for
yourself or to sell or give away to others, just as long as it doesn't wind up
in the dump. I'd like to think I'm doing my part to keep someone's bus on the
road.

All you have to do is send me an email and let me know when you can come get
the stuff, and I'll take it off craigslist Make sure you mention that you are
from the type II list so I know you get the free deal.
Here is a list of what I've found so far:
