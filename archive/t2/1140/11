John,

Alternators are funny beasts.   You can't just spin them and get voltage. 
You have to spin them, -apply voltage-, then get voltage.

When you realize that they use an electromagnet, instead of fixed magnets 
like generators, this starts to make some sense. ;)

Add a 12v power source into your test circuit (which can be removed after 
the alt starts producing, it will self-maintain after that).

Unless you're testing this in the bus, in which case I assume you've 
already got power.

...david
