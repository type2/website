I am almost certain that these are not truck tires at all, but rather
standard passenger-car-rated tires that WalMart is marketing as fitting
light trucks. They do not have the C or D load range rating that is
recommended by VW for a bus.  I say this based on their low maximum psi
rating (below VW spec for a bus), and the fact that the WalMart site lists
them as a P series tire, not an LT series tire, despite their inclusion on
the light truck tire page.  You can confirm this by looking for a "standard
load" designation on the sidewall.
