well I would rate CO Route 550 between Durango and
Oray, 15mph speed limit strictly enforced by the side
of the road!!!  coming out of Silverton headed East
passed a sign saying Summit 9miles, height this point
10,000ft!!   my poor 65Westy just about got to the top
in 2nd gear
**********************************************

We went over the same pass about two years ago in our
67 Sundial Camper with a snowstorm raging and about
six inches of snow on the road!!! What a thrill, one
of the only times I felt we might not make it through
to the end of a road - and we do some serious off
roading in our VW busses. 
One of the all time great drives, and to top it off we
stopped in Oray and went swimming in the huge pool in
town fed by natural spring waters. What a great way to
unwind after a drive like that.
