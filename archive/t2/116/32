Subject: Re: [T2] Pop out rear window and heater

This heater discussion came up a few months ago, probably last year.

Anyway I sent them an email and they said after shipping, etc. to NC the
heater was about $600!!

Too rich for my blood. I picked up my working BN4 for $300. You can do
better too!!
