Hey Volks,

I have been running those Liberator LT tires on 14"
Puegot rims on my 85 BRAT for two years now.  While I
know the BRAT is not as heavy as our busses, I still
wear tires out pretty quick, and I have a 2"
australian lift on The BRAT too.  I have been very
pleased with these tires.  I have the 225/70r14 that
Ray has been talking about.  They ride pretty good and
handle the forests roads out here with ease.

Kindest Regards,

Mark Dominesey
