don't think it is very messy, pull the dip stick tube off the side and let
it drain. then take pan off and clean,  CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN conditions are

there is still the final drive oil change, same as manual but you can use
GL-4/5
   personally I use all synthetics and not worry about the problem, one
little "nit" about synthetic AT fluid is that it smells burned right out
of the bottle so you can't use the "burned" smell to diagnois
