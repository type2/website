Rob,

I am a  bit mystified by your broblem, but I have a theory...

I have a memory of having a problem like this with my '78.  I got tore
up the bushing in the  bell housing  and got lazy, went out and bought the
self-supporting starter for the automatic  bug... put it in.... lots of
whirrrrrr!!!  but  no start.

The differences between the early and late starters are twofold.  First,
the later bell housing is 1/2" deeper than the early one, so the starter
shaft has to be longer to reach the flywheel (that was my problem).
Second, the flywheel is bigger, so the gear on the starter is smaller to
mesh (the shaft bushing is in the same place on both).  I think
this may be your problem.  The teeth of the larger gear have hung in the
teeth of the larger flywheel and they will neither of them turn.

Pull the starter out.  See if you can crank the engine by had w/o the
starter in.  If so, then that was the problem.  the  solution may, however
be painful to  contemplate... you may have to (a) go back to the 210
flywheel or (b) go to the later bell housing.  As I see it, you have
developed an incompatibility between your flywheel, starter, and bell
housing. Experiment may get you out of it, but I am not sure how.
