When Adrian and I threw the engine back in my bus we left the heat ducts
off completely. I have no 'built-in' heat in the bus (other than the warmth
from the engine rising through the back seat). I drove the bus the other
night from Atlanta to Chattanooga in 30 degree weather - about three hours
at bus speeds. The PowerCat did a great job of keeping me warm. Do make
sure you use the fan or the heat just goes straight up. I've used the
PowerCat camping too. It works great. I also use it in the house to heat
the bring the temp up in the room while I do yoga. It doesn't put out
enough heat to warm a large room. I've tried it in a 13x15 room but could
only raise the temp a few degrees.

I am going to invest in a CO detector though because I want to make sure I
wake up every morning when I camp - but the same concern is valid for any
combustible heat source (like the BN4). I'm also a little concerned about
my daughter sleeping in the back on long drives. I'm scared of developing
an exhaust leaks and my not noticing because I'm in the well-venthilated
front of the bus while she snoozes in the back.
