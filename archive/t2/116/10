I am assuming you mean the starter spins but does not engage the flywheel?
If yes, are you still using the 72 starter?
If yes, it will not work. You 1st need to try a 76 and up starter. The drive
is longer. Up to the 2.0L, the teeth on the drive are at the sprague
[over-running clutch]. On the 2.0L there is a 1/2" blank space between the
teeth and the sprague. The teeth stick out further. This is also why you
cannot use the SR17X self supporting starter on a 2.0L manual trans, but you
can on the auto trans.
I would try the starter and if it did not fix it, then the other fix would be
a 210 or 215 flywheel.
