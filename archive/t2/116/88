I was driving home in my 77 Riveria today and noticed that I was =
smelling gas, lots of gas.  I lost half a tank in just under 10 miles.  =
I traced the leak to the small 12" hose that comes off the fuel pump.  =
It has two tears in the cloth covering the hose, and in both places =
where the rubber is exposed it is cracked and leaking.  I still have the =
headache from the fumes.
Is there a replacement for this that does not involve cloth covered =
rubber.  Do they make steel covered fuel lines?  I'd like to replace it =
with something a bit more rugged since it sits near hot heat exchangers =
and the engine.
On the good side, once I got everything cleaned up and the gas odor out, =
I parked the bus in the garage.  The kittens are having a great time and =
have claimed it as their new playhouse.
