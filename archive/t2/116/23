I bought a Coleman PowerCat for $65. It uses those 16oz propane canisters
and has a DC fan. It puts out about 3000btu/hr for 8 hours on one $1.80 can
of propane. The fan uses two D size batteries or can be plugged into an
adapter and run off the 12v DC in the bus.

What is most impressive about the PowerCat is the base is large enough to
use while driving. I've never had it tip over. It also fits nicely between
the front seats in my '74 Campmobile.
