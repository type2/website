Troy,

I have now looked at all your pictures and agree with Karl.  your idle
adjustment screw is backed out atypically far.  I think the reason is that
your throttle body is typically filthy.  Go, thou... Hie thee to a FLAPS
and pick up a can of carb cleaner!  spray the living (-at-)$%& outof that
throttle body and make it all shiny bright.

On the gasket, as I said in p-mail it is there.  Look at:

for the throttle body without the gasket.
