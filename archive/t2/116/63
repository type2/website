Subject: Lowering a bus [was '78 Westy Suspension]

I have been 'annoying' Bus Boys for years on this topic. The answer is
simply , no, nobody maufacturers or sells dropped spindles for 68+ vans to
the best of my knowledge. I heard of a guy in SO-CAL that hand-made a pair,
but could never find any info.

Now, I have been looking into air-ride suspension for 68+ vans. Thus
eliminating the torsion bars altogehter and allowing the bus to ride at a
normal height, drop it when parked and if you need the clearance, just hit
the switch and up it goes!

Costly? Yes...prob over a grand (USD), and then you will need to find
someone to fabricate and weld the supports for the 4 'bags'.

This is think would be a great alternative to the current lowering
technique.

This is a UK site. I have found that by browsing through various UK VW
publications, that if you dont slam your bus, its just not right..so that is
where I am at with the lowering issue.
