Subject: Re: [T2] Big clutch nightmare!!

You have to replace the flywheel and clutch assembly.
A 210 is very common. The 215 is scarce and the bolts suck! Bothe the 210 and
228 use 13mm headed 8mm bolts. The 215 uses 8mm triple-square headed 7mm
bolts.
If you change to the later bellhousing, you will have that 1/2" problem that
you need on the starter except it adds it also to the back end of the engine
at the support bar mounts.....
