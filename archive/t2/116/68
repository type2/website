Subject: Re: [T2] tires again

for two years now I have been running the BFG All-Terrain size 
27x8.50R14LT/C on my 77 camper.  The Load capacity on the tire is 
1510lbs(-at-)50psi.  I run the tire (-at-)45psi and have zero sidewall sag.  At a 
total capacity of 6,400 lbs I can't imagine our busses coming close to that 
vehicle wait since my 1969 chevy blazer with 1 ton truck axles, a wench, 
extra batteries heavy duty bumpers, bla, bla, bla weighs 5,500 lbs.  I have 
been very happy with this tire even with the buss loaded to the gill with 
camping equipment.
