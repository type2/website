Subject: Walmart Liberator tires

>>I am almost certain that these are not truck 
tires at all, but rather standard
passenger-car-rated tires that WalMart 
is marketing as fitting light trucks. 
They do not have the C or D load 
range rating that is recommended by VW for a bus.
 I say this based on  their low maximum psi
rating (below VW spec for a bus), 

Ron,
Well the load range "C" or "D" is for LT tires
only, I agree.  And I'm away from both Bently and
bus, so I cannot recall the specifics, but I
believe that reinforced passenger tires were the
standard on the bus, that is a 185/14 reinforced
not a LT185/14.  Our loaf busses were made long
before the current load/speed rating system, for
example the "98S" found on the sidewall of the
Liberators.   Anyway, I feel real comfortable
with the 1625 max load on these tires as it is
more than some 14" load range C LT tires at which
I have looked.     

Just mentioning these as decent tire for the
money, especially for you folks who balk at
paying $80-120 per tire for the other options
with an appropriate load rating.   These were
only $3 per tire more expensive than Wally's
cheapest passenger tire in P195/75/14 which only
has a load rating of 1300 lbs.
