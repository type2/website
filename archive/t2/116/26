Hi all,

I've sent some pics off to Rob Henley at http://www.72camper.com so
hopefully we'll see them there in the future. I'm certainly willing to take
more if there is interest (and somewhere to place them on the net for the
benefit of other listees.)

Rick, if you want the ones I just took p-mailed, I've got two .zip files at
approx 5 Meg each. Let me know if your mail system can handle them and I'll
send them over...

Regards,

John B.

photographer, so what you see is what you get and the best I can do.  :-)

I know that I'd love to see some pictures of this. I'm installing a BN4 in 
my '72 this summer.
