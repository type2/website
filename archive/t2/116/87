Don't forget the SouthWind heaters.  They put out more BTU's and CFM of hot
air than the BN4's.  These heaters are also easier to get parts for, cheaper
to buy and are more plentiful.  They were installed and serviced by the VW
dealers here state side.  They are MUCH simpler than the BA6 and are much
smaller too.  SouthWind has been putting gas heaters in everything from
tanks to airplanes for over 70 years.
