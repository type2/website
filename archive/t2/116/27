Subject: RE: [T2] Is there an alternative to a BN4?

You can check out the propex heat source from
http://www.bluebird-type2.co.uk/. It is in the parts section on page 2.

It is very expensive, plus you have to have the shipping added. But.... it
is an alternative to the BN4 gas heaters. It does not have the problems of
some propane heaters creating condensation in the inside of the bus. I do
not know anybody who has it, but it looks decent.
