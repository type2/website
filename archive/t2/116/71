On the Type2 web site there's a great write-up called "Tires for our
Buses (T2 or T3)".  One of the things mentioned in there is that the
original Bus tires are a 185R 14 which
has an 82% aspect ratio.  This works out to a 207cm circumference.  In
looking for tires I found that many tires have the aspect ratio listed
on the tire -- 185/75R 14 or
whatever.  Don't make the mistake of getting a 185 tire with the wrong
aspect ratio because it will throw your speedometer off and, worse, your
engine will need to race to keep
up with traffic.  I ended up getting 195/75R 14 tires because it was
basically the only thing I could find at the time.  When I go shopping
again I'm going to keep at it until I
find that true 185R 14 or a 205/75R 14 (which has an equivalent
circumference).
