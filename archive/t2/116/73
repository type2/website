Subject: Re: [T2] hydraulic lifter question

I just finished rebuilding a 2000 for my 75 bus. I installed the hydraulic lifters and am sure I will be quite happy with my decision. I have built type 1 engines and various American made engines, some using solid and some using hydraulic lifters. As long as either one is riding on the correct cam for your
application, you won't find any difference in how the engine runs. The only difference you will notice is you don't have to adjust them every 3000 miles for the life of the engine! The adjustment is not difficult, but why spend the time when you don't have to if you go with the hydraulic lifters? I also recommend
going with a 2000 instead of the 1800. Same money, less miles on the case, and a little more power.

I have a Weber progressive carb which my engine installer is going to rejet for the new engine and a Mallory distributor. Everything else (trans, clutch) is stock and in good working order.
