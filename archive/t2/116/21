Rob,

Well, I think that your best option (after a beer, which I think is
*very* wise :-) is to pull the engine, see if it spins.  If it does,
reinstall the 210 flywheel and reinstall.  There is not that much
difference in performance, unless you are drag racing your bus... honest!

Trying to match the flywheel, starter and bell housing is going to be a
nightmare, I am sorry to say.
