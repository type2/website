There is a gentleman on this list who replaced the roof on his bus. The
roof he installed came from a donor bus which had the correct cutout for
the pop top. He calls his bus Bob the Tomato I think... and has a web page
all about the job. I bet he'll chime in here sooner or later. As far as
values go it's hard to say. I would look around at classifieds and see what
people are asking. Most folks on the list cringe at the thought of parting
with their creations.

Here is an odd question that I have not found a good answer to.

What is a good value for a nice Westfakia?  And is there a way to take a
regular transporter and cut the hole properly in the top for a pop top?

Here is the situation:  Parts '73 Westi with perfect interior, more rust on
the bottom that you can possible imagine.  '71 Transporter, busted engine
but good body.  Total outlay for both about $1000.

Figure in parts for restoration to be about $500.  My time is essentially
free.

If I can get a hole in the roof it would be really nice and a darn nice
camper that really you could not tell the difference...  Not that I would
defraud a buyer like that, but at the same time it does not scream Fakia!
Fakia! :)

Anyway lets say the hole in the roof is impossible, what would a perfect
condition westi interior in a good body go for?  I like to put them back on
the road but need some beer money at the same time!  I figure if it is
worth
a solid 2000-2500 it would be worth the effort involved.

Thanks and any insights are greatly appreciated.
