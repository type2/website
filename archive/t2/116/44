Looking at the site, the prices include VAT (Value Added Tax), a type of
European sales tax, which can run as high as 30% of the listed price. This
tax is credited for export. I would suggest e-mailing any european supplier
for an exact export quote before rejecting items on price alone. Ordering
items from europe is not that big a deal, I've ordered everything from
little gadgets by mail to $8k 500 pound machinery. If they want your
business, they will help you with the process.
