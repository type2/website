Subject: Tires thanks & report

Hi guys,
Thanks to everyone who weighed in and offered opinions and advice when I was
looking for new tires for my '79 Westy.  As you may recall, someone slashed
one of my rear tires which was a Michelin MX reinforced tire in 185R14.
That tire is out of production so I was weighing my options and got a lot of
good input from the list.

I decided to buy two tires so I wouldn't be mixing tire types/tread
patterns/manufacturers on the same axle.

After much consideration I decided on the Michelin Agilis61 tire in 185R14.
It has a load rating of over 1700 lbs. at 54 psi.  (I forget the exact load
spec).  I bought them from Tire Rack for $99 each plus shipping.

After I had already submitted the order I heard from a gentleman at
etires.com who also happens to be a Bus driver and is on the list (I'm
sorry, I forgot the name and I don't have his e-mail handy, I'm on a
different computer).  Etires has the same Michelins for the same price but
their shipping costs are much lower.

They also have some interesting Nokian tires for the Bus in a 195R14 size.
I was tempted but those have to be mounted in sets of 4 which I was not
doing.  But I think next time I need tires I will definitely check out
E-tires.

I decided in the end to go with the Michelins because of the quality,
listmember recommendations, and because I already had similar Michelins on
the Bus and I thought, whether justified or not, that there would be good
continuity as far as handling, wear characteristics, tire size, etc. between
the MX and the Agilis.

So the tires came UPS, I had them mounted and balanced locally and so far so
good.  They look great on the Bus and seem to work just fine in the dry.
Haven't had a chance to try them out yet in rain or snow.  Hopefully I will
get to break them in a bit more on the trip to EveryBus.

Thanks again
