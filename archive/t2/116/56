Subject: Re: [T2] '73 fuel tank exhaust


I have a '78 and replaced all of these fittings by simply going to Home
Depot and buying the right size plastic T's. I think they were 1/4 " or
maybe 5/15" look where they sell tubing. I also replaced all the little
rubber hose sections with 8mm vacuum line from FLAPS. I added hose clamps
to all of the fittings to be sure nothing would leak. No worries. Problem
solved. Now the T's are not metric and I don't know if they are rated for
gasoline service but none have shown any signs of deterioration in 3
years...
