I looked at your pics but none show the throttle housing removed from the
plenum. If #158 is correct and you have the idle adjustment out that
far....you have a problem. Normally the head of the screw is flush with the
body.
You need to remove the 2 phillips head screws and remove the housing. The
black rubber seal is under it. It is tapered.


Thanks.
