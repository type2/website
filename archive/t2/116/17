Subject: Re: [T2] Big clutch nightmare!!

Well I removed the starter and the engine won't budge at all!!! I can't turn
it, even on the fan hub bolt. I didn't think to turn the engine at all,
before I installed it.

We had to wrestle it a little bit at first, thinking that the splines
weren't lined up. It wouldn't go the last inch or so, but after jacking the
engine up a bit it slid in.

Would the larger flywheel keep the engine from moving at all? Buying another
starter isn't going to fix this is it? Because the engine should turn freely
with the starter removed right?

I guess I have no choice but to drop the new engine. Shouldn't the guy who
recommended the 228 mm have told me I would have issues here? I actually
asked for the 215mm and he told me I should use the 228.

Thanks for all the help so far.

I am gonna have a beer and cry now.
