Subject: '73 fuel tank exhaust

Hello everyone,

In my '73, the fuel tank exhaust lines reconnect at the top of the engine
compartment just inside the rear hatch.  They reconnect in a rubber
T-section piece that then connects to an air filter.  Does anyone know where
I can find a replacement T-section?  Mine has rotted away and I can't seem
to find another anywhere.  I've tried catalogs and websites with no luck.
I'm also interested in the other connectors that are a part of the fuel tank
exhaust system, but the T-section is what I need the most.

Thanks,
Brian
