He ignored you because that's pretty much normal for a 68-69 bus at least.
If I recall they redesigned the front hinges a bit, though I don't recall
when...post 69 I know.  They included a bit of a latch that helped to hold
the front of the top down.  The latch engaged automaticly as the poptop
was pulled down.

Prior to that it's normal for the top to ride 1-2 inches up at highway
speed, sometimes more depending on how worn the slots in the hinges are...
