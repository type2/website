Subject: WEBER CARB

Howdy Volks,

I have a 72 van , 1800 engine that I just bought.
My other 72 van , 1700 engine got siezed.
The thing is: this van i just bought has a single weber carb.
I have an advance distrubutor and the vacuum lines are blocked off
and are not connected to the carb?does anyone out there have one of these
single
weber carbs? if so whats the deal with the vacuum lines?aren't they supposed
to
attach to the carb?
Please tell me anything you might know about this mystery.

Thanks alot,
Darren
