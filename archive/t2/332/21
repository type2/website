Subject: Re: [T2] WEBER CARB

I have a '72 with a single weber carb....it's starts right away and 
runs great at all RPMs (although it requires a warmup in cold 
weather).

I think my distributor is just a 009 mech. advance unit because there 
are no places to hook a vacuum hose to it.  The vacuum port on the 
carb is also plugged.  I don't know the official "best" setup or what 
the PO did, but my setup sure works great.

If you look closely at the photo below, the carb has a rubber hose 
with a bolt plugging the vacuum line.

I previously had a different 72 bus with dual carbs and they were 
nothing but trouble$.
