Just a small addendum to that excellent overview:

If the Optimas seem a bit pricey, you can get a Size U1,  30 AH, deep cycle
12 Volt gell battery that will fit in most places an Optima battery will.

The "Exide Prevailer" U1 size battery is one brand. These are designed for
use in electric wheel chairs and have given me good service in my Vanagon
for auxillary power. The VW's charging system seldom, if ever, exceeds the
spec for these true gell cell batteries (not to exceed 14.4 volts) at their
terminals. I have rewired the auxillary system via the relay (you can get a
kit from Bus Depot too) ..the relay is controlled by a wire(blue)  that is
only energized when the vehicle is running....not when it is starting and
not when it is stopped. So the Aux battery is usually detached from the rest
of the electrical system. In my case, I have the battery feeding all the
circuitry in the Westy portion of the vehicle's electrical system  (sink,
lights, monitoring circuit, fridge, and a 4-place cigarette lighter socket
added in)
