Subject: TR: [T2] Optima Batteries

ho thanks for the info!!!

Im in the process of choosing between wiring a deep cylce batterie like the
Optima one, or buy a portable power pack with an inverter ... so whats best
between those two for electric appliance in a westy ??

Pro and Con ?:
-Power pack is portable, relatively small and hook electric in a second, no
wiring needed;
-isnt battery technology the same ? ie both are Gel Cell battery
-easier to recharge power pack at home, the optima battery you need to hook it
to alternator for charging;

What is best for Amp-hour... ?

some power pack and inverter can be seen there:
