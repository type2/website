True, but you only have to do the wiring once.  O(1) tasks are not
significant.  :)

Neither type will be a Gel Cell.  The Optima is a spiral-wound AGM (Absorbed
Glass Mat) battery and most of the Power Pack devices have SLA (Sealed Lead
Acid) batteries, which are very similar if not the same basic technology, just
not spiral wound.

You could just as easily charge the Optima at home with an automotive battery
charger.

>What is best for Amp-hour... ?

The Optima will better.  I think they are around 55 amp-hours, probably more
for the Yellow or Blue-top versions.  The biggest portable unit I have seen
has a 40 amp-hour battery, and most range from 17-25 amp-hours.
