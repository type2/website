Subject: Which Distributor?

Aloha List,

I have a '74 1800cc engine, in a '79 bus.  It has been fitted with a 
Webber carburetor by the P.O.

I have two new heads from AVP, working great.  Everything else is stock, 
at least it appears that way.

The bus is beginning to run a little rough and I have tracked it to a 
need for new point and condenser.  The bus and I live in a year round 
warm climate at sea level.  I do warm up the bus, per Muir's suggestion 
- but without the smoke.

At the risk of opening a can of worms, and a big debate, I'd like to 
know the if it is best to stay with my stock distributor and points or 
should I invest in a "Bosh 009" and the Pertronix Ignitor, as offered by 
Ron and the gang at BD?  Or switch to electronic ignitor and keep the 
old distributor?

I have checked out the Library, but no strong comparisons in there.

I read the link recently posted, written by Boston Bob, but it dealt 
with mostly timing issues and not witch is a better distributor and why.

Mahalo for your help,

Bradley
