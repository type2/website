Remove CVs from the axles, clean, regrease and reinstall with new boots.

I found mine to make a vibration at high speeds with low loads on them 
(steady state).

Yours will be fine I'm sure. I drove mine for about 14K miles with no boots 
on them at all on a couple joints.

I replaced mine with Auto Zone axles. No miles on them yet so I cannot 
comment.

I won't discourage you on Bus Depot or any other online seller. It was 
simply a question of time (I thought) and prices.

Good luck.
