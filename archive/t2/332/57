LEGISLATIVE ALERT
Emissions Inspection Exemption for Older Cars: Arizona
A bill (H.B. 2387) has been introduced in the Arizona House of
Representatives to exempt motor vehicles that bear a model year date of
original manufacture that is 25 years old or older from the state's
mandatory emissions inspection and maintenance program.
We Urge You to Contact Your State Legislators in Support of this Bill
Existing law in Arizona only exempts vehicles manufactured in or before the
1966 model year from emissions inspection.
H.B. 2387 provides for a rolling 25-year exemption that would exempt
pre-1979 vehicles upon enactment and would pick up an additional model year
for each year the law is in effect.
H.B. 2387 acknowledges the relatively minimal environmental impact of older
vehicles, such as the 25-year old and older vehicles targeted for this
exemption.
Many states have already enacted similar exemptions, the most recent being
Missouri in 2001, Virginia in 2000, Washington State in 1998 and California
in 1997. The reason for this trend is clear; such vehicles constitute a
small portion of the vehicle fleet and are generally well-maintained and
infrequently operated.
The idea behind exempting any class of vehicles is to reduce costs while
not losing appreciable emissions reductions. This strategy not only builds
public support for emissions-inspection programs, but also directs the
program to where it will be most valuable in cleaning the air. A 25-year
rolling exemption certainly achieves these ends.
Please contact members of the Arizona Legislature in support of this bill.
