Darren:

Take a look in the archives for info on the weber (sometimes in the archives
it's "webber").  a/k/a a "progressive" carb.

There should be a small port (6-7 mm) on the weber for a vacuum line to go
to the vacuum advance on the distributor.  About half way up from the base
if I remember... This should be connected or blocked off;  otherwise it's a
GREAT BIG vacuum leak.

p-mail me if you have any other questions.
