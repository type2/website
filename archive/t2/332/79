The dwell will increase some, but it's something you can't change so
where it is, is a good place :) Timing will change just like you
changed points with points. I have a spare distributor in the parts
box with points already installed, the only thing I need to add to it
is the retaining ring so that I can just swap the entire thing out if
need be & the timing should be set :)

Unless it's changed the II version is somehow variable, but only
available for the 009 (non vacuum advance) model.

My bosch blue coil fit the bill, so you may not have to purchase
anything else.

I really like my Pertronix unit.
