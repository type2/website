My procedure is a bit different but that is exactly what I'm doing to the 
horizontal wood panels in the back of our bus and the wood headliner over 
the front seats.

My difference is that we are using a thin layer of foam rubber (like found 
under vinyl tops on American cars). $4 a yard.

Bit more sound insulation, bit more soundproofing, bit more "luxury".
