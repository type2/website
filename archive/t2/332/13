If you are talking about a chest style freezer, the best thing is to put all
your food in frozen and top it off with a chunk of dry ice. That dry ice
should last about four to five days in a cold environment. Putting an
insulative sheet on top of everything in the built in chest freezer will
help keep the dry ice. As long as there is any dry ice in there, the rest
should stay frozen hard. You will have no melt and no mess as long as the
dry ice lasts (it goes directly from solid to gas state, no liquid). Then,
you carry a small camp cooler to thaw your steaks, etc in.
By taking out frozen items to use ahead of time, and putting them in the
portable cooler, you minimize heat transfer into the frozen food area
(through more frequent entry). You can also use the frozen goods to absorb
heat from non-frozen as they thaw. Using the already frozen goods to help
chill down the portable cooler, you can carry milk, eggs, lettuce, etc. very
nicely, w/o using so much ice, and that leaves more room for goodies. The
beauty of using two coolers and dry ice to create two systems (freezer and
refrigerator, non-portable and portable) will be apparent when you begin to
use it. Your food will stay in much better condition, longer, and with less
hassle and effort, than you would imagine. The fresh food that you want to
be convenient can be brought right out to the camping table or picnic site,
while the frozen foods stay conveniently stowed away.
Take resealable food storage bags to keep everything separate and sanitary.
When foods mix, especially in contaminated ice water, it is NOT good and
your trip could be ruined by food poisoning!
I also have a '79 Westy camping refrigerator that doesn't work.. After
reading about all the hassles and limitations, this is my more practical
answer.
