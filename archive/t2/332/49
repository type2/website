Subject: 78 Champagne Westy FS

I tried posting this last week but got an error and don't remember seeing
it show up.  If this turns out to be a repost, sorry...

<sigh>  Ever since I bought a house my Westy has been languishing in the
driveway with the camping trips becoming fewer and fewer.  With that in
mind I've decided to put her up for sale.  The gory details can be viewed
at The Samba.com.  Here's the URL --->

Thanks for looking!

p.s. The bus is in Springfield, VA if you want to come by and take a look
at it.
