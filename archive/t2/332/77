Stock dist and Pertronix is a good solution. Keep points and condensor and 
screwdriver in van for replacement in case the Pertronix dies. The 
Pertronix will change the dwell and timing a little so perhaps a lister can 
tell us what to set it at.

There are Pertronix versions I and II. The second version is better I've 
heard.

They require specific installation with a reduced voltage I think and a 
coil with a specific resistance. The archives has alot about it. I'll be 
the library does too. Versions I and versions II have different requirements.

I posted a message at one point that had some of the requirements about 6 
months ago.
