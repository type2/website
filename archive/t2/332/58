Sounds like a fuel starvation problem to me.  Start with the fuel tank 
(remove, clean & line
with POR-15 fuel tank kit), replace sleeve filter in fuel tank (& new 
gasket seal), replace
rubber fuel lines (clean out metal ones) and filter, rebuild fuel pump 
(CHECK LENGTH
OF OPERATING ROD!!!!! as well as pressure and delivery volume), rebuild 
carburetor(s).
You will now have a "new" fuel system.  If this doesn't do it, you will 
KNOW the
problem lies elsewhere.

Why is this?  Are all tinware and engine seals in place, and in working order?
Are there blockages in the cooling air circulation system?  What is the 
compression ratio
of your engine?  What octane level is the gas you run?  Deal with this 
first.  Carbs. aren't
designed to run when the gas is boiling.
