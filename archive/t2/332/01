Subject: Vehicle wrapping

Listees,
    has anyone had any experience with these vehicle wrapping companies that
pay you to drive around with an ad plastered over your vehicle.
    I am considering this for my bus. After all, she gets plenty of looks
w/o any flashy vinyl ad on it and I wouldn't mind an extra $400 a month.
Later,
Jim
