Subject: ' 78 Westy Propane Tank, Free!

Hey All, just finished converting my stove from the standard Westy under-body 
propane tank to the 1lb. "throw away" spin on type. Thus, if you're in the 
Raleigh, NC/Triangle area, and want a perfectly good, FULL stock Westy tank, 
with regulator and quick disconnect fitting, drop me a line, it's yours for 
the taking.
