Subject: RE: [T2] [BP] What is this-Is it a compressor??

The cylinder shape with the really narrow bottom where the "rod" would be
makes me wonder if it isn't some type of external combustion engine.  The
electrical wires with fins indicate high current.  Maybe it is a
electrically heated sterling engine. Obviously it has no heads, so timing is
not an issue.  The wiring coming out of the "distributor" could be a magneto
used to recharge the circuits used to heat the hot side of the cylinders.
Strange though.  Wonder how much horses it is.
