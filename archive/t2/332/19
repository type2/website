I am still having problems starting my engine.  When I pulled the engine
to replace the clutch, I didn't take the distributor out or the coil.
The engine started fine before I pulled it.  It has new plugs, cords,
distributor, and coil.  The coil is sending spark to the distributor.
Any clues why it isn't starting?
