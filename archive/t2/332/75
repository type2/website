Subject: Help needed in LA> by New Orleans

  Ricki Fu, bus traveler, is having starting problems near New Orleans. We
think it is either the starter or the starter bushing. He is looking for a
place to repair it and/or get the part in that area. Any help appreciated.
  Please contact me so I can pass the information on to Ricki. He is
traveling with his wife, 1 year old baby and 3 dogs in a Westy.
