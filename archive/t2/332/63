Wow thank you for the great article !!!


Electrical use in my westy is mostly my electric cooler, then by fall the use
of the BN4 by evening who drain some amount of electrical juice (sometimes it
happens my main battery was dead because too much use of the BN4 when night
are cold)

Also when we go to bed, we get out our Laptop computer and watch a movie, DVD
or DIVX, so nice before bed!!  Some light needed too (but neon light dont suck
that much)

Thank you now i know more what to buy !!
