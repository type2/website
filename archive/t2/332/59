Great article Captain!  I just have a couple of comments/additions:

I thought you said it was a sailboat! (j/k)

Significantly less, I would add.

That is exactly what I did.  Two Trojan T-105's, which cost me about $110 back in 1997 are still in service today.  I couldn't ask for more durability than that.  When they go, I am eying Costco's golf cart battery, which is manufactured by Johnson Controls (best battery company out there, IMO) and are only $48/each.  I would buy either the Trojan or the Costco brand before I would use what they sell at Sams Club, which is made by a less-reputable company (Exide, last time I checked).

Weight again - the pair of Golf Cart batteries weighs about 120lbs and holds 220 amp-hours.  A blue-top Optima (Deep-cycle RV/Marine) weighs about 50lbs and holds 55 amp-hours.  That is a little more than half the capacity per lb., not to mention the fact that the Optima is $140 while the PAIR of golf cart batteries is $100.

My "ideal solution" is as follows:  Get a sealed starting battery, something like a surplus Hawker AGM:

This is an incredible bargain, folks.  Even with shipping added in.  I own three of these batteries (so far) and they are nothing short of awesome.  Trust me when I say they will start your car with absolutely no problem.

Next, buy a pair of golf cart batteries and stick one on each side of the engine compartment.  You will need a big cable to run between them, but that is only a minor problem.  Just make sure it is at least 4 gauge and is well routed, insulated and protected.

Wire everything up.  Voila, all the power you can use, very little interior space wasted, no dangerous fumes emitted within the bus.  The only drawback to this setup is that the golf cart batteries will require a little distilled water every few months.  A turkey baster, a mirror and a bit of patience will take care of that.  If you want to get really creative, mount the starting battery under the bus, flat between the frame rails.  Now you give up NO interior space at all, and your friends will be amazed at how clever you are.

Or, if you value low-maintenance above all else, just buy three of the Hawkers, use one for the starting battery and the other two in parallel for your stuff.  Mount them wherever you want.  I'm still tempted to do this, even though I will take a) a weight hit or b) an amp-hour hit.  The Hawker SBS-60's weigh 38lbs each, btw.
