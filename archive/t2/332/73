Pretty much everybody on this list agrees that the 009 is a POS. It does 
not have a good advance curve for a bus. They are okay in a bug, but 
still not as good as stock.

If you want to upgrade something get a Petronix or Compufire to replace 
the points. No more points or condensor to replace. Keep a spare set of 
points and a condensor in case the Petronix or Compufire fail.
