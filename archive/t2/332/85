Since it's Friday, and I'd love to have a non-gasoline engine in my
mandatory bus content, let me say that I agree with the above comments, and
I would REALLY like to know what this thing is all about!
  It's definitely not a 2-stroke engine.  It's not a Stirling external
combustion, as far as I can tell, although I could be wrong on that if
there's plumbing underneath I can't see.  It appears to filter the air into
that big manifold, but then what happens?  There's no exhaust I can see.
And what's up with the non-distributor in the distributor hole?  It would
presumably spin internally, but to what effect?  Is this an elaborate
practical joke, or did a stranded alien object to the price and pollution of
gasoline and fab him/her/itself a more civilized motor??
  If anyone has any info on this thing, or any serious theory about what it
might be, I would much appreciate hearing about it!
