Subject: Bay window cut up

  I am getting ready to cut up 3 bay window buses for parts. Have taken to
many to the dump, so I am going to start stock pileing original bay sheet
metal. I will have doglegs, front floors, slider channels, rear deck lid
rails, nose clips and/or window sections, cargo floors and tons of other
parts.. All sheet metal is perfect rust free AZ stuff. I have lost one of my
storage lots so it's time to cut. Please remember that labor to do this is
not free, as is my storage warehouse. Parts will be charged for accordingly.
In the next month or so I will inventory all my existing bay parts for sale
(this is over 20 buses worth in the last few years). Here's what I know I
have. Turn signal switchs, steering boxes, brake boosters, trailing arms,
tons of brake stuff, all electrical from harnesses to FI brains, interior
pieces, steering wheels, handles, doors (no more to overseas), lots of
glass, from sliding windows to louvered windows. A few camper pieces left. A
few pop tops early and late, etc. etc. .
