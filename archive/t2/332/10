Not trying to "beat you up" or anything but dual carbs - especially dual 
carbs like Dells and Webers - are as complicated (if not more) and more 
expensive (if not more) than the factory EFI. Aftermarket EFI is more 
expensive granted.

The factory EFI is not a scarey beast once you take a few days to learn it.

It took me two weeks to learn to successfully rebuild, balance, and then 
rejet my 36mm Dell DRLA carbs. Took over a month just to gather the parts.

Nothing simple about those fancy carbs.

FWIW I will use the DRLA carbs on my Type IV powered Beetle and EFI on my 
Corvair powered Westy (when I can get around to switching to EFI from stock 
Corvair carbs).

Oh - and I just noticed the OEM Solex part. Okay - I'd go with stock carbs 
no problem. Never mind! <grin>

Whatever you do - good luck to ya.
