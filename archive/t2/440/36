$250 sounds awefull high unless he is doing a lot of high end tests that
the VW really doesn't need just to get running stock....I would take the
$250 get the Bentley (if you don't have iit) and some tools like a timing
light and do it yourself and have a large pizza and 6 pack on the left
over money
