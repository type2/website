Ive recently had the same problem, chased my tail for
days.. Until... I removed the fitting from the booster
and blocked it off.  I then disconnected the line from
the manifold and blew into it.  (Iwas not going to
suck on it Im not that kind of guy.. )

It would not hold pressure in the line.  5 mtrs of
heavy duty hydraulic hose later.... fixed!  No more
vacuum leaks.

Good karma to you

oh, and good karma to Ron the much bashed.
