Subject: Fuel neck

On my 77 Riveria, I noticed that the fuel neck was just slightly
attached to the rubber where it attaches to the body.  I removed the
"pie pan" in the engine compartment and when I reached up the hole I
could feel the hose clamp loose as a goose.

So how do you tighten that damn clamp when you can't see in the
hole...can only get one arm up there...and are not a contortionist!

I'm betting I have to pull off the wall, and get to it via the gas tank
but I just wanted to check before I start ripping it apart.
