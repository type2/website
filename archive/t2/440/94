David,

Here's the problem with that theory--

Your asking a shock absorber to do the work of the suspension unit,
which is not only unsafe, it's not the long term solution.

When the shock or the load leveller spring starts fagging out---your
right back a square one.

A load leveller devise was intended to supplement the factory suspension
unit--not be the main carrier of the load.

The correct way to do this would be to first adjust the suspension unit
back to it's stock ride height, and then add the shock of your choice.

A shock absorber was designed to control the rebounding of the vehicle
after it wallows into a dip or hole--not be the vehicles main suspension
unit, or spring.

Not 100% correct----
 
Later,

Terry

Can't agree with you 100% Joel. When I swapped out my dead rear shocks
for KYB Gas-Adjusts a few years ago, the rear of the bus did come up a
little. I think it was 1/2", or about half the amount that the Monroe
coilover shocks raised it. Oil filled shocks will not affect ride height
but gas charged shocks do have a bit of lift associated with them. And
1/2" is more than you think.
