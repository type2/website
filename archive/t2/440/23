Subject: the mechanic's full notes on Alice

For those of you -- and thank goodness for you, for you are keeping me sane
right this very moment -- who have pressed me for more technical details,
here are the tech's complete notes on her. May you all collectively find
something that they did not.

+++

The Complaint:
Generator light won't go off, sometimes won't crank. Diagnose and advise.

The Notes:
Needs ignition switch [replaced], generator may need repolarizing. [Not
done.]

_____________

The Complaint:
Stalls at coming to a stop when warm (idle is cranked up right now). Stalls
when stepping on brakes warmed up, backfires badly, hestitates in 3rd gear
~30-35 MPH. Diagnose and advise. Check vacuum brake booster.

The Notes:
Tried starting vehicle, found it would start but idle very high. Found choke
was misadjusted, checked distributor for correct firing order, found firing
order out of sequence, distributor cap 180 degrees out of position, wiring
to mixture control solenoid was wrong. Corrected firing order, repositioned
distributor cap.

[My personal note here, not the tech's: I dispute his claim on that cap.
What's more, once he rotated it, I was told it took him another four hours
to get it to start again. Four hours later, apparently, the notes start
again...]

Vehicle would start but not idle for very long. Checked manifold vacuum, it
was 7-8lbs. Tried adjusting timing to bring idle up to normal, but it had no
significant effect on vacuum. Removed valve covers to check valve
adjustment, valves on #3&4 were very loose, 1&2 near specs but still needed
adjustment (a little tight).

[Another personal note, info unknown to the tech. 1&2 were adjusted by my
housemate; 3&4 were left the way they were on the professionally rebuilt
portion of the engine, as received from the Bug Doctor in Walnut Creek, with
whom I may need to have several conversations... Read on.]

Adjusted all valves, (to where it ran best, don't know wether this engine
has short studs or long studs), reinstalled valve covers.

Compression test cold showed 120/130/125/120.
[Personal note: I'm told this is not bad for a brand new engine that hasn't
been broken in yet.]

Checked for vacuum leaks -- no leaks found.

Restarted vehicle. Dwell was at 56 degrees and timing off. Reset dwell and
timing, vehicle ran better but still had low manifold vacuum. (13#). At
proper timing has 3# of manifold vacuum.

Played with timing to get best running. With distributor set to end of its
movement, we got 15# of vacuum with the needle bouncing between 13-15lbs.
[Personal note: Bouncing needles are not good. Usually means, I have been
told, either a vacuum leak or an electrical problem, and they had already
checked for leaks.]

Checked emissions, found CO wandered from .04% to .56%. HC, depending upon
carb adjustment, would wander from 400PPM to 3200PPM, but would also hunt.

With timing mis-set, vehicle will now drive but not go over 30MPH.
[In other words, after all that, it runs no better than when I brought to
them. They lost money on the job,  lost money, I'm frustrated and depressed,
and at least one of their techs was so frustrated that he refuses to ever
work on it again.]
____________

The Complaint:
Client complaint high-pitched whine. Does it intermittently, will do it even
idling. Not speed sensitive. If it is present, disgnose and advise.

The Notes:
Never heard whine.

[Personal note: Housemate believes this to be belt adjustment. I dunno.]
____________

The tech did not write it in his notes, but he expressed to his boss (in
between his constant kvetching about having to work on this vehicle) that he
believed something to be wrong with her internally. Improperly ground cam
and incorrect cam timing are two of the ideas that were kicked around before
Alice's keys were handed back to me. For what it's worth, she never stalled
on the way home.

As an aside, some of you may remember that Alice (Remember Alice? This is a
song about Alice.) hasn't been horny at all since I got her. You've advised
me, I know I have at least one dangling end to get in there and attach.
Well, it must have made contact with something on the way home a few times,
because she was horny as all hell without my having laid a hand on her magic
button. Go figure.
