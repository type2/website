Subject: FS: '79 2.0 Liter Engine W Weber Carb and Good Exhaust System 

Hi All,

   I have an ok running 2.0 ltr motor that was in my '75 camper.
I salvaged it from a running bus that had 50K miles on it.

  The compression is better than 100 lbs all the way around.

  I put the flywheel from the '75 on it and it worked out fine.

  The manifolds are tight but the are not functional as heat exchangers.

   The muffler is about 8 months old.

   I ditched the FI and and went with a progressive Weber. I believe it
should be rejetted as it seems to be dumping a lot of fuel. But it is in
very good condition.

   The only oil leaks are the from the pushrod tubes. Front & rear seals are
good.

    I believe however the lifters need to be replaced with solids or they
should be rebuilt as the motor runs erraticly until the lifters pump up.

 Comes with alternator, sheet metal, flywheel, disc and pressure plate.

 I would like to get $300 for all the above.  Email me with questions

  Pickup in Cleveland Heights, OH 44118
