If the shop charges $250 /hour, including a "partial hour" the price is fair
:)
There is a current debacle over on the vintagebus(-at-)type2.com list
regarding bogus shops in your area.
The specific shop listed is Import Engines, Winter Park FL.
You may want to discuss your problem with Diane, a lister
who has been receiving extremely poor service there.
Diane djaeby(-at-)hotmail.com has a 67 bus.
