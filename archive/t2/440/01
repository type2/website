Subject: the bad news on Alice

Well, Alice isn't going to Burning Man. Even worse, there is something
deeply wrong with her, something that, as yet, remains undiagnosed, though
we now know the symptom: extremely low vacuum in the exhaust manifold, on
the order of only 7-8 lbs.

I'm exhausted. I'm crushed. I'm teary-eyed. All this, and I may not even be
able to drive her around town any time soon, let alone to the playa.

Ideas on what could be wrong? Once I'm back, I'll be starting a new job, and
I won't have the kinds of time I used to have to put into her, day after
day. She'll probably wind up back in the shop, with someone else's greasy
hands all up inside of her instead of mine. But, if any of you have ideas on
things I should check or might possibly fix on my own without dropping her
whole bloody engine again, I am all ears.

Mopingly,
