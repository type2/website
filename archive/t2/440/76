Subject: Vent rubber

Here's another question:

Is it possible the revitalize the rubber? get its smoothness back?
I got a sliding door vent window off a junked bus in CA couple of months 
ago and
it finally came the time to install it. The problem is that half the rubber 
looks kind
of dry. I've looked into replacing it and the price is outrageous! about 4 
times what
I paid for the left rear and sliding door vents together in the first place...

Thanks,

Rogelio
