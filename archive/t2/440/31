Subject: Re: [T2] Tune-up price

in my opinion i say that is pretty dang high just to adjust the valves and set the timing ...?

you cant set the valves yourself?
isnt that hard really once you have done it by your self once or twice..?
i recently learned myself how to do it...
with you haveing a 72 you also will have solid lifters...

what is this guy chargeing you an hour for labor?
sounds like alot...
but there again this is just my opinion...
i myself have been fortunate enough to run  across some really good volks that have done me right..
had my timing adjusted once by the local mechanic and he charged me 40 bucks to set timing and adjust valves,...
got another mechanic that drove an hours drive to help me out and wouldnt even take what i offered him...
have been blessed... 
250 just sounds awful high ...?
peace and good luck
