Subject: waxing  pop-top hinges

I could be mistaken - but I thought that the Westy Camper Manual that came
with my 78 spoke of waxing the pop-top hinge - I guess it could have been
something else but I'm quite sure it said 'waxing.'  My question is - with
what do I wax it?  Automotive wax?  Cross-country Ski wax?  What?  It moves ok
- but I suspect that it could slide easier.

TIA

new wash and wax.)
