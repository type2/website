Subject: Tune-up price

Hello Everyone,

I have a quick question. My 72 bus needs a valve adjustment and the timing
corrected. My local VW guy quoted me $250 for a tune-up and complete
check-up. Does this seem reasonable? I have not dealt much with the mechanic
scene because I usually do the work myself. So, I really don9t have much to
compare it to except you guys.

Thanks in advance for the help... It is always appreciated!
