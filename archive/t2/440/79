Subject: torque converter

I don't know what the technical terms are for the parts involved but on 
the end of the crank there is a plate about 2" in diameter attached 
with 5 torx "like" bolts (some of which are stripped) in the center. 
Around the outside edge there are holes through which the flex plate(?) 
was attached with pins or rivets. The flex plate is then attached to 
the torque converter with 3 13mm bolts.

The pins/rivets sheered off, does anyone have any parts or do you think 
it would be safe to weld the flex plate to end of the crank?
