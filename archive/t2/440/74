Subject: my adventurewagen lives again

well, i got the engine in my 73 adventure started
today and drove her down the block and back.  i was
going pretty slow and never got out of 1st gear as i
didn't put my tags on it yet and didn't want to get
busted but she went forward and backward so that is
something i reckon.  i then put on the proper tires
and took off the nearly new yet completely wrong tires
that were on it.  next up is some new shocks and a
some of the body work that i can handle with por15 and
then she is off to the paint and body guy.  after that
is complete then i'll be overhauling the interior and
bringing it into the 2000's vs the 70's look she has
now.  i already have a new floor cut that was for my
old westy and i'm thinking of putting some nice wood
over that or maybe a nice vinyl floor if the wood will
be too thick.  it was just nice to put her in R and D
and have her act like she was supposed to.  she seems
to run nice and strong.
