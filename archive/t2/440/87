We want to tow a small trailer with our bus, power is not the problem. Im 
wondering if anyone has used air adjust shocks to get the butt off the ground or 
should the tortion bars be adjusted to get back end up a little more. Without 
a trailer and with a bunch of stuff in the back our bus tends to sag a bit and 
the rear wheels toe in a bit, we do have new shocks but what else can be 
done. Thanks Dylan, Stephanie and Collin
