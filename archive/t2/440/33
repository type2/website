Subject: T2] Oil pump for type IV Whose to Use

I like the numbers that Bob was quoting there from the melling pump. Are
they not both 30mm pumps? The Schadek and the Melling that is? This motor
has about 12k on it. I did not replace the pump when I rebuilt it. Should
have, but I have never had oil pump problems in the past. I think it is
just worn out. I do get good numbers at start up 60lbs or better, but when
it gets hot it drops to around 25 while running. I would have replaced it
sooner but I just got the gauges a little while ago and now know how low it
is.

So what I am gathering here is that the Schadek is thought to be a nice
pump, Bob is getting great pressure from his Melling, the Schadek is $30
and aluminum and requires some mods to install along with a type 1 cover
plate and longer studs, the Melling is $70 and bolts right up but is cast
iron and theoretically could expand at a different rate than the case...

So what would you do?
