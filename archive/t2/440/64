Jim,

From personal experience I'd say that your clutch cable is going/gone. ( As
I remember, 2nd/Reverse were all Tigger was happy with when her clutch cable
went, too. )

They seem to "slip" when a number of the strands go, but pretty much give a
"limp home" made if you put a few turns on the adjuster.

As she's home, I'd say get a new clutch cable and that should be all you
need.
