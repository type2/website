Subject: CHT Not Working???

Hey guys,

    I finally hooked up my CHT gauge properly (at least I think so) this
weekend. The gauge doesn't read ANYTHING. Very strange. 

The CHT gauge is an original brand new VDO CHT Gauge.

This is how I have it wired:

The illumination light is wired to the dash light circut. This works
perfectly. The only two remaining plugs is a GROUND and a POSITIVE. I have
the RED wire from the CHT sender plugged in here, and the BLACK wire from
the CHT sender plugged in the other one. What am I doing wrong?

By the way, I just had a few Gin & Tonics, so I'm a little smashed.. and it
just hit me... on the instructions, it says POSITIVE and GROUND. However, in
the diagram, it shows the black wire as the ground (going to the sender) and
the red wire as positive (also going to the sender) but since both wires are
attached to the sender (which as you know is that little loop thingy) then
why isn't it working? Am I supposed to attach 12 volts of power to there or
something? I put it on the spark plug like I was supposed to.

I think what I may do when I sober up, or tomorrow morning, is disconnecting
the sender and the gauge and testing the wire. Maybe the wire somehow became
cut somewhere along the lines.

If it's not that.. any idea what I'm doing wrong?


Thanks!

Todd
