Subject: Re: [T2] CHT Not Working???

The top two connections are for the 12V source, the bottom two are for the
sender. If you apply 12 Volts to the bottom terminals, you have fried the
gauge, no questions asked.

The gauge functions normally without 12V as the gauge reads extremely low
voltage from the sender for its readings (thermo-couple).

Try using the gauge with ONLY the bottom wires connected (ground is black and
the red wire is the PLUS symbol....

Also, make sure the connections are tight. Good luck!

  the diagram, it shows the black wire as the ground (going to the sender)
and
  the red wire as positive (also going to the sender) but since both wires
are
  attached to the sender (which as you know is that little loop thingy) then
  why isn't it working? Am I supposed to attach 12 volts of power to there or
  something? I put it on the spark plug like I was supposed to.
