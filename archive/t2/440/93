Can't agree with you 100% Joel.  When I swapped out my dead rear shocks for KYB Gas-Adjusts a few years ago, the rear of the bus did come up a little.  I think it was 1/2", or about half the amount that the Monroe coilover shocks raised it.  Oil filled shocks will not affect ride height but gas charged shocks do have a bit of lift associated with them.  And 1/2" is more than you think.
