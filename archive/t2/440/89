Subject: Oil pump for type IV Whose to Use

"The melling will not bolt right up any easier than the schadek. Being both
type 1 30mm pumps, they are dimensionally similar and will require similar
mods to work. The mods required depend on the cam and gear combo."

So the Melling that Bus Depot is selling that they list as for a type IV is
really a Type 1 poump? I am hoping Bob is right and they have either
already done the mods or it is a Type IV pump from the start.

"What kind of cam and cam gear is in the motor right now? Is the gear
bolted
to the cam or riveted?"

I am running a Web-Cam grind #75 with the stock gear bolted to the cam. I
am prety sure its the stock gear anyway its the one that came with the cam.

Bob did you get the pump from Bus Depot? If so did you need any other
parts, like a new gasket, or longer studs, or a new cover plate? Sorry to
go on about this but one pump is half the price of the other and the
cheaper one is aluminum which I would think would be better?
