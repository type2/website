As I said, the cap was not on incorrectly, of that I am sure. But I give
people the benefit of the doubt when I am hearing them second-hand, through
another body, as I did in this case. I also cut folks some slack on their
communication skills; not everyone's are the best. I have an ex-husband who
is living proof of this fact -- brilliant, but entirely inept with effective
communication. Never quite said what he meant to, even when you would have
thought it would have been simple to have done so.

Yep. And the owner of the shop worked on them for years and years and
years -- used to be exclusive to German motors -- though, he admits, it's
been a while since he last had his hands in one of this type.

Yes, but this wasn't an issue of competency. It was a question of time and
money. He was working within my time and budgetary constraints for the time
being.

I doubt it will be brought back to them, but not for all the reasons you
suggest.

Burning Man on Monday (time constraint), job starts on the 8th (after six
months plus of being unemployed, that's the budgetary part of the equation).

Thanks. Further work on her will have to wait until after Burning Man,
however. My time is now being poured into how to get all our gear into my
Honda, and our entire camping style is being rethought. She's on the back
burner for the next couple weeks, unfortunately.
