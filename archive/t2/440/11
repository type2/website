I was at Malahat Auto Parts http://www.malahatautoparts.com/  232
Trans-Canada Hwy 1-800-663-8820 last weekend and found them reasonably
priced and with a good stock of busses :)

I was given a skoocum new pair of NOS Ford belts new in the box...they will
go in after my engine rebuild is completed.  I scavenged a bunch of metric
hardware and OEM covers from a Saab and a Toyota but I will have to machine
up little buttons so I have a good bolt to hardware fit.  I already made up
an adapter bushing for my 65 amp Delco alternator conversion.
