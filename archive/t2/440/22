Subject: Re: [T2] Oil pump for type IV Whose to Use

I think I understand that TypeI pumps can be used in TypeIV engines (don't
hold me to this) and it sounds like perhaps that's what Aircooled.net is
offering.  But the most common cause of low oil pressure is plain wear and
tear on the engine's bearings.  The oil pump lives in a pretty benign
environment and, absent abuse, generally lasts longer than the rest of the
engine.  It's not clear from your post whether you're thinking a new oil
pump alone will solve your problems or if this search is associated with a
planned rebuild.

I've rebuilt 2 TypeIV engines and in both cases the oil pumps were fine and
performed satisfactorily in the rebuilt motors.
