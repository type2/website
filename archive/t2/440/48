I truly believe this is possible, even likely. My plan, when I get back from
the Burn, is to take Matthew's advice and just replace the whole bloody set
of vacuum lines. As I told him, even if it ends up not fixing this
particular problem, it is not likely to be time wasted. If she doesn't have
a vacuum leak now, she will soon enough. It is simply the nature of hoses,
and of vacuum systems especially (kinda like fuel lines).

I remember the problems my first car, a 68 Ford Galaxie 500, used to get,
and 95% of the time it was something to do with the vacuum system. So, at
the very least, it will be preventative. (Besides, it's cheap and not very
difficult to do.) I can either spend my time trying to track it down or just
replacing it outright, and probably preventing something if not fixing the
problem in the process.

In his case, he had something very similar, with all the symptoms pointing
to vacuum, but he also could not find leaks. This fixed his problem. I hope
it fixes mine. New vacuum hoses, here I come.

Thanks,
