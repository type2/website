Subject: Speedometer question...

Hi,

My speedometer stopped working today. I suspect the cable since
the odometer isn't moving either, but before I change it I was wondering
if there is some test I should do. I checked the cable at the wheel hub
and although is seems ok, it turns freely at the by hand at the cap...
Thanks in advance,
