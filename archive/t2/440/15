Subject: WTB: Sunshine Family Bus  (friday)

Hi all,

     I am a serious VW toy collector.  I am not a dealer.   I am looking for 
a bus for my toy collection.    
    It is a red and white bay window plastic bus, rather large (some people 
mistake it for a Barbie Bus) and belonged to a doll(s) called the "sunshine 
family" .

    I have one now, but it is horrible shape.  If anyone wants to part with 
one, or, can steer me in the right direction, I would be very grateful.

   Thanks
   Brian
