The melling will not bolt right up any easier than the schadek. Being both
type 1 30mm pumps, they are dimensionally similar and will require similar
mods to work. The mods required depend on the cam and gear combo.

What kind of cam and cam gear is in the motor right now? Is the gear bolted
to the cam or riveted?
