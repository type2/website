Subject: Re: [T2] waxing  pop-top hinges

I would try using basic paraffin wax. You can most likely find it at any
craft store or stores that cary canning supplies. I think they sell it in
small blocks. Automotive wax would not leave a thick enough layer. Cross
country ski wax might work but I think that the paraffin would work better,
its basicaly just candle wax.
