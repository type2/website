 Control Process

Operation Paint-a-Bus(es), along with tools and equipment extra hands
should be included. Anybody that can bring some should. More horses =
more Horsepower for this machine. Feasability should be a key factor
here like Terry said. If it is not posssible for it to happen on your
bus in a few days then it probably will not. Close and ready seems to be
the name of the game, in order to get painted and finished before the
event is over. Is this to be the objective "painted Buses"? These all
seem to be issues that should be included in that website on the
discussion page. What about a page for pic uploads to illustrate the
condition/phase of the willing. I know that I have some issues to sort
out on "el Verde" if this were to happen. But this maybe a chance for
the body work critics to throw suggestions toward the preparation prior
to the event.
Let's keep pushing this ball, it is however rolling, bring on the
horses.
TravelOn,
Michael Knight
'77 Westy Deluxe AT, "el Verde"
