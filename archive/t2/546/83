Subject: Re: [T2] diesel conversion

I am thinking of doing this also. I found a place called
http://www.vwwerke.com/ that will do this.  They recommend a VW Dasher
Diesel engine as the best car to get the motor from because the motor,
mounts, exhaust, and oil pan are better suited for the longitudally mounted
engine.  They also say the radiator mounts in the back and is out of an audi
4000.

What kind of horsepower does this engine have? Best I can tell from Bus
Depot's website is the diesel was only available around 78-81? Is this
correct?  I have read diesels are notoriously slow.  Would this really be
that much different than a bus engine?  Any other concerns?

If anyone is interested I could forward pics on that the company sent me of
a bus they sent out to California with this conversion. Please Pmail...

This is very bus related, as the gas prices keep going up, more and more of
us might be doing this conversion..
