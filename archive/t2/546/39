68 doors are one-year-only. The lock knob is on top of the sill like 75? and up. But the doors do not have

 69 deluxes had door vents. and I think the old 68 deluxe i scrapped had them too.

Sorry, I lied. It was not 70 or 71, it was 72.
Part number 211 837 892 [left] and part number 211 837 892 [right] started with chassis number 212 2000 001.
That would be 1972 YEAR model.  Number 63 in this pic:

I like to back up with facts, not memories.

I was going to write up a long message about distributors and how they work. I was even going to give the
application and specs for the 022E dist someone asked about, but I am tired of the back stabbing and snipping
attitude lately. Life is too short for this crap. I don't need this. I may come back but not for a while.
