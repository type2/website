Subject: engines used on automatic transmissions

Most ,, if not all engines I have pulled from automatic transmission Vw's have had the cam plug
put in the case reverse to the manual trans engines.

I pulled one engine from an auto and it had a smile cut into the cam plug as the engine had been
transplanted from a standard trans vw

I assumed...

Does anyone know for sure what the deal is with the engines with the cam plug put in the case so
that the cavity of the plug faces out? Reverse as such..

I have always assumed there must be a clearance issue....

This has bearing on installing a good used engine from a standard into an automatic.

I don't really understand the flex plate idea,, and again, I assumed that at some point in the
torque of the fluid drive, the plate must flex,,,,, ??

I dunno.. but if you can shed some light on the cam plug orientation,, please do!
