greg,

i am not going to answer the question exactly. there are some good web pages
on how to remove the cylinder from the housing, but i don't know where they
are. i do suggest removing the steering column from the bus entirely, it
make the job much easier, as you can then work on a bench.

as for the same key issue - i will tell you that you can re-key the ignition
yourself with no problem at all - that is if you have a good original spare
cylinder. i don't know if this works with the replacement cylinder/keys.

i just did this very job on my thing. it had the exact same problem as you
describe, where the key portion of the ignition would not rotate the
electrical part quite far enough - the car did not start! i had a good bus
cylinder which is nearly identical to the thing one, and i was able fairly
easily to swap parts and pieces so i had a working ignition switch, AND
retained the original key. i think a locksmith will charge a fair bit for
this, but it is quite easy once the key ignition cylinder is removed.
basically there is a tiny roll pin that attaches the key cylinder to the
actuating finger on the switch, and once that is removed, the cylinder
itself comes out of the switch with the key inserted. then you move the
wafers one at a time from the old cylinder to the new, put it back together,
done.

it may sound a bit complex, but it isn't really.
