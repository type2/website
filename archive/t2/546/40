This will be an all or none caper Bob--

Cave and pave--fluff and buff-- load and squirt party --and back home
you go--

One rule--

Nobody leaves until every Bus Van or whatever is done---

Captivity till everyones smiling--

Start moving your hand's like their pushing sandpaper-- :>)

 

You can count me in, too! Espesially if I only have to get to Tennessee. 
resonable distance from Maryland, I just want to do an overall rust
stopping session, I'll paint later.....
