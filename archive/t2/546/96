Hello Guys  Why not use the best  Porsche 356C or 912 Gland nut  Torques at 
320 -360 ft lbs. These things will stay in place . standard 36 mm head  Some of 
the aftermarket ones are bigger than 36mm  which I dont like . The only 
problems with the Porsche nut is that it is a little taller so if you dress the 
flywheel then be careful that it doesnt hit the disc. Also these arent really 
suppose to be used more than once , but they can be on a Vw motor as there 's not 
as high RPMs involved   later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import
