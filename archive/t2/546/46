Yep-you can use the air DA no problem--but it won't get everywhere, and
it isn't used for finish sanding prior to painting---
So practise waving your palm--and bring some band aides for the tips of
your finger's--they'll get raw--
I hate masking--I'll teach you guys how to do it right--:>)

No Rattle cans permited--

I'm gonna shake evryone down upon arrival--

LOL---


See ya--

TK



well better get a couple more cases of rattle cans ;8*}

One rule--
Nobody leaves until every Bus Van or whatever is done---
sounds good to me, will probably be last bus out ;8*(-at-)
Captivity till everyones smiling--
Start moving your hand's like their pushing sandpaper-- :>)
