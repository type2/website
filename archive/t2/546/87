I just thought of a coule other item's--that may change the outcome of
this event.

I will be painting with whatI am familular with--and know what the end
result will be.
I'll shoot anything PPG has to offer--be it Concet single stage or base
clearcoat urethane.

If any you guys want a two tone job--the only way it's gonna get done is
with base clear--

The base coat sets up in 20 minutes, mask off for the second
color--shoot it--remove the masking and clear it all--done.

Delstar acrylic enamel will be good too--but only one color--it takes
too long to set up for a two tone job--

Dupont's Centari will be Ok too--I shot a bunch of trucks with it--prior
to me using the superior color retension Delstar enamel.

No Barn Paint--no Ace is the Place, or Farm and fleet garbge paint.

I won't even waste any time in blowing this garbage on anything--

And I am not gong to be doing any Imron--

I won't have enough room to be dragging all the protective gear along
besides the rest of the stuff I'll be bringing--

Think on this too---


C-Ya--
