Hi Jamie,

That was an excellent write-up... I haven't been able to find time to 
get my trip report finished (I'm up to Friday so far) but your message 
nicely caught the spirit of the event... Learning what can go wrong and 
what you need to deal with it.

I had originally planned the contest to feature only "a couple" of 
problems and offer a different set to each team but Mark Dearing had 
set it up for a suite of 10 already when I got there, so the suite of 
10 is what we went with. It was more fair that way, but took longer to 
unfix and that limited the time available for teams to compete. Having 
a more repairable bus would certainly have helped with team 
morale....Assuming they fixed it.

The seized engine was not supposed to happen. That messed up everyone, 
but it was worst for the Ohio Valley Tribe, as they wasted more than 
half their time on the problem. Later teams were asked to work around 
it. The FMBC Tennesee team also gets an honorable mention for style 
points, they came dressed in monogrammed surgical scrubs with 
VW-inspired background tunes to work to.

FWIW, I am grateful that we were able to spot the seized engine THEN 
AND THERE and not on a long hill in West Virginia. If we hadn't used 
Dopey for the troubleshooting time trials The Canadians probably would 
have had a much less cheery strory to tell about their trip home.

You guys were good fun to watch, and you did win the three minute 
"least tools" bonus.

Next year I think we should try something different... Perhaps a 
reprise of the "Bus Camping Competition" that was held at BOTC 2002.

Happy trails,
