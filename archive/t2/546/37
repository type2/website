Subject: 71 bus colour

 First should introduce myself.  Have been lurking & learning for awhile.
 
 Zander, my 71 bus is now almost ready for painting.  Currently dove blue,
although can't find the code for it. Niagara blue seems to be the nearest.
 
 Think I want to change the colour.  Maybe white top to the windows, rest
 blue.  What colours have others painted their older buses?
