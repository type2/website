Subject: putting an end on rust; my type 2 can last 4 ever

Anyone thought of having the whole type 2 body sandblasted and
galvanized?

I know it must be expensive but it is surely a good investment: how much
will a perfect type 2 be worth in 30 years time?

p.s. I learned that Type 2 buses are a lot less expensive and easier to
find in the US so most of you guys are not as scared of corrosion as I
am, that will surely change in 20 years time
