Subject: INSPECTING USED ENGINE

Howdy,

I am currently looking at buying a used 1800 engine
for my van. I am looking for help in inspecting a used engine.
Looked at one last night and it started up on the test stand.
Besides a compression check are there any other tests
that I can do?

Thanks as always,
Darren
