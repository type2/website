Perfect location---Pretty part of the country--

And it's right fine, down home, type folk--

Then when I'm all pooped out--and done--I'll just jump over yonder to
Danville Ky. and take a break over by my buddies farm--on Knob Lick Rd.
--:>)

No breaks for me there either--he wants me to put a new cab on one of
his Macks--Do What?

Forget that---

This could be a doable thing---but there has to be more than enough
participants, and no junk yard dogs--this is supposed to be a paint fest
right?

All we need is some electricity--a decent compressor that can keep up
with stereo or quadraphnic DA sander's and my paint guns-- a off the
beaten path place to do this--and bodies.
