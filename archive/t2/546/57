Subject: RE: [T2] Re: POR 15 Corrosion Control Process

I'm telling you guys this caper would make Bus history---
Hands down---

But think about how we could centrally loctate this event---

I'm Able if you guys are Mable---

No slacker's or yacker's--

( after the days work is done who care's about rhe yaking--)

Make it a week event long event--and ya gotta be resonable--if the Bus
is a rat--ya know darn well it ain't gonna get done in a week--by a
hundred guys working on it--

First man in--is the last man out---no getting the job done and blowing
outa there.

I'd be willing to paint my ass off--but it's the prep work that'll take
the time, and man power--

Think about it---

Bob---and I thought I was the only wacko here--

Hah !!--:>)


C-yo guys--
