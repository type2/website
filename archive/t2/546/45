Sandblasting abd spraying a couple of coats of the Vari Prime acid etch
zinc chromate primer would give you the same basic results as
galvanizing--

Just no electrostatic application of the zinc--that's all--


 
Anyone thought of having the whole type 2 body sandblasted and
galvanized? 
I know it must be expensive but it is surely a good investment: how much
will a perfect type 2 be worth in 30 years time? 
p.s. I learned that Type 2 buses are a lot less expensive and easier to
find in the US so most of you guys are not as scared of corrosion as I
am, that will surely change in 20 years time
