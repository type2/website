probably, we will need some basic site stuff, maybe a porta pot. etc
should probably plan on a $100??? site fee, just for the basics, help with
the electric bill, etc

yup need a tool list.

wonder what the local power company would charge to drop a "service line"
like they do for carnivals or fairs...have a post with several outlet
boxes on it.  would save our ears from having couple generators going full
blast for a week.  might be worth a few hundred dollars just for the peace
and not having neighbors complaining about the noise.  Are there
neighbors?

well.  need to have a site with

BUSES, each person coming lists thier bus and priority of the work they
want done,,,Terry figures out a list of what is possible.

FACILITIES, what were gonna need and who is bringing it, and if important
item who is backup.

$$$$, a site cost, what it is gonna cost as "admission" to this party.
  then maybe a bus cost, how much the individual will need for that bus,
ie, paint costs etc.

TIMETABLE,  rough timetable of what and who is doing what on any given
day.
eg:Monday
 bus 1 getting painted,
 bus 2 getting masked,
 bus 3 getting sanded
 bus 4 getting welded
 bus 5 & 6 waiting and drying....

 human 1  painting bus 1
 human 2 & 3 masking bus 2
 human 4 & 5 sanding bus 3
 human 6 welding bus 4
 human 7 runing to McDonalds for lunch...

etc

  having extra humans would only help...

more ideas welcome
