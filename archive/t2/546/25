Subject: rim color code

greetings folks, does anyone know the paint code for silver rims for 74-79 
buses?  My camper is in the body shop now and we're having a problem 
finding the correct paint code for silver rims.  I think it's L90 but that 
seems too close to L90D (pastel white).  Any help from anyone would be 
appreciated. tx, greg
