Subject: replacing doglegs on on a 76 

i have owned my bus for about 5 years now. And again this is the second time i have to replace my dog legs so i ordered a pair from cip1.When i got them in the mail they were from 2 different manufactors the frist was named art who is in brazil and the second is klokkerholm which i figure is in germany. Does anybody know anthing about theses comapnies is one better than the other metal wise. Also the guy who is going to do my body work quoted me 500.00 to do the work is that a fair price
