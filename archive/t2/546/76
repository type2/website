Subject: diesel conversion

I am looking to do a diesel conversion in our 72 bus. Does anyone have any 
suggestions or have they done this. What engines convert over reasonably well, 
after I know this then I can look for that engine in diesel version. I have 
seen conversion kits and they seem like they are plates for between the tranny 
and engine but what about the crank end and tranny splines are these the same on 
many different engines or is there something for this also in the kits, 
thanks for the help.

PS I am also thinking of running the diesel engine with the conversion to 
vegetable oil. Has anyone seen this up close and what do we think,,, thanks Dylan
