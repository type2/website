Chris--
Here's another use for the stuff---

I painted 5 machines this winter--end loader's and Cat D-8's.

the wheeled end loader's have cabs and the floor mats are expensive--

What did the mad Man do--??

I brushed Herculiner bed liner on the floor's of the cabs--

It's a non-slip coating--looks just like a mat.
And it'll never come off.

Two years ago the 580 Case end loader-every year I had to paint the
hood--

The bucket is short on the back of it--and all the stuff being loaded
into whatever rolled oua the back of the bucket and laded on the top of
the hood screwing up the paint--and it would always show rust at the end
of a season--

Ah--Ha--!!

I masked off the top of the hood--brushed on a coat if Herculiner bed
liner--no more chips off of it--and no more rust--

Talk about adverse testing conditions--I can't think of any worse--and
it holds up well--

I think you'd be happy using the bed liner on your Bus--the bottom of
the battery tray is a perfect spot for it---


See Ya--
