Vincent,

It would be to a future buyer of your vehicle.

In the marine salvage business, it's kinda like salvaging a ship
*complete* with the anchors....in the salvage business, this is apparently 
like rescuing the eagle lander from the moon.

Maybe not *literally* worth something, but sure adds a lot of class
and "percieved" value to the deal TO THE "RIGHT" PERSON.

Cheers, dave
