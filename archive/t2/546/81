Yup,

Firstly, the required torque at the gland nut is 215, not 315, and that's
important. Same for the rear axles too. Here's how I get exactly 215 ftlbs
at the gland nut, without a torque wrench:

Assemble the engine completely - exhaust and heater boxes. No muffler.

Your engine weighs about 250 now. The radial distance from the center of
the gland nut to the corner of the left heater box is about 1 foot. When I
need to torque up the gland nut to exactly 215 ftlbs, I put my 36mm 3/4
drive socket on the matching breaker bar (I've also done this with my
36mm 1/2" drive socket and bar), and get the gland nut fairly tight. To
finish the torquing, I place my three foot steel pipe over the bar, put my
foot on the left heater box body to steady the engine, and carefully push
down on the pipe/bar, until the engine just starts to lift up and pivot on
the left heater box. I DON'T bounce the engine at all on this. Just start
it lifting up and pivoting on the heater box. That's exactly 215 ftlbs (or
more likely about 250 ftlbs because you're applying the torquing force one
foot away from the pivot point, and lifting the 250 pound engine via the
turning moment. Gently let it down, and you're done - been doing this for
30 years, never had a problem with over torquing, or under torquing. No
flywheels spinning off, etc.

To torque the axle nuts, I stand exactly 1.72 feet away from the nut, on
the pipe, on one foot, lifting myself onto the pipe carefully, clinging to
the roof gutter, then when I'm balanced, I let go of the gutter. That's
exactly 215 ftlbs of torque - my weight is 125. No bouncing here either,
just let your weight turn the nut til it stops, then get off the pipe.
