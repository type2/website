that's the clincher, I know my bus needs a couple body panels replaced, I
have em, but that is a major project.  I'll be satisfied if I get
everything up to the top of the rocker panels done...it is the underside
I'm concerned most about.  has new front beam (ok good from Busted Bus)
but the center part between the axles needs the work.

well there would have to be a deadline, gotta go back to work, but if it
is Sun to Sat, I'll be there Sun morning and would stay til the end of
Sat..., but the boss would expect to see my shining face Mon morning or
whatever is planned.

you got that right, and heck if I got a decent primer coat on it I'd be
happy and finish at home...it's the bloody prep that will be time
consuming.  as I said, I have a small (3000watt) generator and a small
welder (Lincoln 100) and mid sized air compressor that I could bring if I
can fit em in the van.  plus mucho tools. but I suspect I would have to
live in a tent (can't live in the van and work on it) and don't expect you
to put us up, or maybe a nearby motel even...have to take a shower at
least once or twice in the week.

I've thought about it and if I can schedule it I'm there, you know the
weather, shouldn't be too hot but needs to be dry if possible...etc
