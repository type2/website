The problem is that a galvanized bus would not be considered "perfect" by
the concours restoration types, as it was not original.

In the concours Ford Model T competitions, the winner is often determined
by who has the correct plating on certain bolts on the transmission!
Galvanizing the whole car would drop it right out of the running!
