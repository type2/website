Here's what I have on my Mind---

The guys that can get their vehicle's almost ready to paint--

Like at least last coat primed , can get cleaned up, scuffed down and
shot on Monday.

I'll be there to help out in setting the guys up with the sheet metal
work, BUT--there is only so many places and things I  can do at one
time.

I have a  generator--and I'll bring my metal working tools--hoses, a
couple of extension cords, paint guns, etc.

My compressor is a permanent mount 80 gallon 220 volt single phase unit
vertical tank unit--so there is no way I'm going to drag that along.

Here's the basic nightmare--

4 guys show up--with Buses / Vans that need to be cosmetically
resurrected from the dead.

There is no way in on this earth this is all gonna get all done in a
weeks time.

Not unless we all plan on working 24 / 7.

 I plan on having some fun in doing this project-- and helping you guys
getting your vehicles panted-- not pushing my body to it's limits.

If the vehicles that show up are close to getting painted--that'll work.

We all can figure on getting at least two painted per day--

This would be a realistic figure--

But on the other hand--if a Bus shows up that needs rocker's , a nose
section, and quarter panels done--
and then, sealed primed,and painted--I don't honestly think that this is
all gonna get done in a week.

Lets see how thing's develop---

Get busy---!!!


Take Care---
