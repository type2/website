Subject: Re: [T2] .. A holley carb question

Dean,

Never used a Holley on a t4 engine, but used the old "bug" spray on lots 
of T1 engines.

The bug spray was designed for vw's, not sure that yours was.

You *need* the number off of the carb and you need to take a look at this 
book...

HOLLEY Carburetors by H.P. books
by Mike Urich and Bill Fisher
ASIN: 0912656077

When searched by the asin number above, amazon.com had 7 new and used.
In my opinion, the book is invaluable if your really read and study it as 
it covers theory of operation for carbs....


If you pmail me the carb number I will see if this book covers it.

You then need to pull and rebuild it, or have a shop do it, or buy a 
rebuilt from your local flaps.  If it is truely a Pinto carb, then they 
will probably have it.

Do take it with you to the flaps, do *not* let them have the core until
you get the new one installed and running.

Make sure all ignition, ignition advance, vacuum advance and timing are 
*perfect* before doing carb work.

Cheers, dave
