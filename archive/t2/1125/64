Bob  , I have seen this happen ,, 2 reasons,, mechanic error,, didn't push 
it on tight enough in the first place.. lol 

and a tricky one,, but there is a ring on the dist shaft that keeps the 
shaft located .... if that ring is gone,, the shaft can float up and down.. 
and if you hit a bump,, it will,
sometimes it busts the cap coil terminal on the inside,,
sometimes it makes the rotor loose. 

maybe neither one is what is happening to yours 

look it over closely,,, good luck
Jamie
