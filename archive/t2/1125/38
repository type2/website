You know, I was going to mention that I tried the conversion from the other end 
(teaching my wife to drive a manual).  It's been done.  However that conversion
isn't as reliable as a transmission swap in the bus would be.  Anyways the 
conversion was more of a whim, and I'm not sure if I'm actually going to go 
through with it.
Just seeing if anyone else had any experience doing the swap.

Seems like it would be a lot easier to just teach the wife how to drive a 
stick!
