Subject: Re: stranded in Wichita Falls, TX

Quick update while my buddy, colleague, and copilot Barry is at the
helm. Popped off both valve covers and looked at the valves doing
their thing. Did not notice anything unusual. Idle a bit rough for a
while, but now quite steady. Went to Ray's foreign auto and found Ray.
He is no longer in business, having turned to local politics, but he
stopped by to pick up something. He listened to the engine and decided
that all is well except for an exhaust leak. And so we hit the road.
Ray remembered me from last time I broke down in Wichita Falls. At the
time, I was taking my 79 convertible bug from California to Alabama,
Must have been in 1999.

Back to the bus: it's running fine as we are only 150 miles from
Amarillo. Going a steady 50 mph, oil temp is under 250F. No funny
noises thus far. Will we make it to Santa Fe by tonight? I'll keep you
posted :)

Thanks for all the feedback. Chances are that will indeed need to pull
the exhaust system and maybe even the heads. But I'm really hoping
this can wait until we arrive at destination: L.A.
