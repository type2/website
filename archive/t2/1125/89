Subject: Does any UK listee want a towbar ?

Clearing out the garage, I found my old tow bar underneath my Beetle. It was 
fitted to my 1971 van when I bought it. Since fitting the bus with the 
correct rounded bumpers, the thing is no use to me.

So, if you are in the UK and have a van with Europa bumpers that would be 
enhanced by a tow bar, drop me a line at phil(-at-)pagenumberone.co.uk.  You'll 
have to come and collect it from CV31 2NA and I'll want 15 pounds cash. And 
no I won't ship it - far too heavy !

If no one is interested by the end of the week, look out for it on e**y but 
listees get first go.

Thanks

Phil
