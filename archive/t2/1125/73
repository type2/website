Sami.. I would guess your problem isn't an exhaust leak... I would guess 
that there is a dropped valve seat. 

Take off your rocker covers.. and check the valve clearance... I bet you 
find one with a lot of clearance.. 

I have pushed on with engine[s] with dropped seats... from NC to ont.. and 
also as far as 5000kms... that engine didn't fair too well.. but it only 
ruined the head. 

I would adjust the valve clearance every morning.. and drive it at the speed 
limit.. and it worked out that I didn't have a huge towing bill to pay.. and 
was able to drive home.. 

Good Luck!
