You can't wire it backwards - a light bulb can flow DC current in either 
direction, or even alternate +/-12v (AC current).

Yeah, you'll need +12v from somewhere and then you just need to ground 
it somewhere to the body.  Looking at the Bentley, it pulls +12v from 
the right tail light, terminal 58, which is also the same terminal from 
which the side-marker light gets its power.  As for ground, it looks 
like there should be a ground lug somewhere near the right taillight 
where the taillight grounds are - that's where the license plate light 
should ground (if you want to be Bentley-correct).  But you can really 
ground it most anywhere you'd like if you don't have the stock wiring.
