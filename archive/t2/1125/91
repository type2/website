Subject: leak between inner cv and transaxle

I flipped thru the idiot book and could find no mention of this area.

My
bentley manual has been ordered but I haven't received it yet, so I'm asking
all you VW folks.

I've had oil seeping off my inner cv boot on the passenger
side.  I removed and 
serviced the cv joints, but before I reinstall them, I
want to replace the 
seal/plug/whatever it is between the cv joint and the
transaxle.  What is this 
seal called and is it a booger to replace?



Thanks
