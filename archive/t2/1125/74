Subject: Re: [T2] what year is that? - friday topic

My favorite comment I get on my '77 bus is "man, that thing really
takes me back to the 60's" and because I can be a bit of a jerk I
always say "really? why?"

Usually the person isn't old enough to have "remembered" or forgotten
the 60's, maybe the part where they were potty-trained.
