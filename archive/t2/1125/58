You should keep the dog house oil cooler setup. Be sure to get the
right oil seals when you change it over.

Any extra holes are a compromise in your cooling system.

It will not last. Two metal sheets sandwiching your tin and secured by
a nut and bolt is more permanent if you don't want to alter the tin.

Depends how much. Even a little disturbance can cause an oil leak
though. Too much can disrupt oil return and rub the push rods. Mine
were pretty bad, so I drove a socket on an extension down the tube
with a hammer and got them looking passable, but on a Type 4 engine, I
only have to remove the rocker arms to remove the tubes.

Struggling with mufflers as been part of my VW experience. Didn't pay
attention to the sources though, just dealt with it.

Have fun,
