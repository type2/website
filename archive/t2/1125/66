Swap those around; if you're going to mix-and-match tires (which you  
probably shouldn't do...) put the higher-load-rated tires on the rear  
axle.  Partly because there's more weight in the back than the front,  
mostly because having "softer" tires in the back .. tends to make the  
rear want to swap ends with the front when braking hard.  Been there  
done that, and thankfully the only skidmarks were ones that washed  
out of my BVDs.
