I couldn't imagine the plastic cover causing any power loss. maybe some
racket...

if it spins the belt off.. and the belt jams on something, it might zipoff
the flywheel... Highly unlikely,, but it has happened..

Even with hydralic valves... if there is a seat that is making a racket...
you will notice how looose the rocker is.  So.. point the ign rotor at the
#1 plug wire,, with the pulley timing mark near zero... and try to rock the
rockers for #1... then repeat for #2.. then 3, then 4... turn the engine ccw
...

if the seat is a slight problem , you may not notice any extra lash ......
but dropped seat is one reason for sudden loss of power with a distinct
racket associated...
