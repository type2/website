hate dogs, scared to death of them
don't go to many of the bus meets because so many off leash can never 
enjoy myself.

some meets enforce leash rules better than others.

maybe I should bring my snake collection and let them have the run of the 
campsites off leash.


not everyone likes everything.

and dogs off leash and under no absolute control are a hazzard.

(guide dogs and police dogs excepted, they are "really" trained 
completely)

YMMV
