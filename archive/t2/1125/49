when my '74 single cab did this, it was the fault of the rear torsion bar
bushings.  there was fore and aft movement in the trailing arms.  It was
frightening how the rear end would sway even when unloaded.  Simple
replacement of the bushings tightened it right up and it now drives like a
dream.

 then it felt
like the rear end was swaying all over the place, and I had to keep
correcting the steering.
