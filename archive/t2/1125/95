Subject: High CHTs - resolved

Hello all,
some of you might recall that my bus was running way too hot
(DakotaDigital CHT gauge with sender placed under spark plug no. 3).
I've been trying to resolve this issue by rebuilding and rejetting the
carbs, installing a collector style exhaust along with a wideband
lambda sensor, checking fuel pressure and amount and so on.
Long story short: last week I drove all the way to the engine
rebuilder (Kummetat) who has rebuilt my cylinder heads (AMC with
slightly larger valves, intake is 42mm and exhaust is 34mm). After two
hours tuning and testing on the dyno, it is certain that my 2.0 liter
only has 57hp. Taking into account that I'm using already larger
valves which should get me to around 80-85hp this is quite a desaster
and the only thing left to do is split the case and check the cam
(something I don't want to do myself). We measured the valve action,
opening too late and closing too early indicates that this is the
problem. The bottom end of the engine was rebuilt 6 years ago by a
company that turns more and more into a German subsidiary of GEX so
I'm really curious what we'll find in there. Engine is already out of
the bus, disassembled and on its way to the rebuilder. We're going to
discuss what to do next once he's done with checking everything. I'll
keep you updated...
