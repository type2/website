Subject: Bus Door Panel Geometry

I want to cut out new door panels for my bus on the CNC routers at work but
have had trouble getting the shape right.  Does anybody have a good CAD file
of the bay window bus door panels or a dimensioned drawing that they know is
good?

I have really been chasing my tail on this one.

Thanks,
James
