Subject: Conversion from Manual to Automatic

I saw an ad on a popular auction site where the seller is breaking his '72 bay 
window camper for parts.

He's selling the automatic transmission with all the trimmings for a conversion.

I was considering converting my bus from the four speed to automatic so my wife 
could more easily drive the bus.

Has anyone done this?
Is it fairly straight forward or will it require any fabrication and fueling 
system work?
I searched through the archives, but only found one instance a list member, 
Matthew Cuddy, who converted from manual to automatic.

For reference, I have a '76 bay window 1800cc, left-hand drive model.
The seller's bus is a 1700cc right-hand drive model.

Thanks,

Josh
