when you look inside the rotor, is that protrusion that interfaces with 
the rotor shaft still there, or did that shear off?

Does the crane optical trigger make the rotor ride high on the shaft?  I 
know that I had to take my rotor to the sander because the compufire 
disk causes the rotor not to seat fully.

If the inside protrusion isn't worn off, I'd measure how much shaft you 
have showing and then measure the depth of the rotor and see how they 
match up.
