 My '78 Westy has a sway bar in both the front and back. I read that adding
a sway bar to the rear helps but stiffens up the way the bus rides.

I probably just put the heaviest load into my single cab since I have owned
it.


It felt like it was driving ok, until I got on the highway, then it felt
like the rear end was swaying all over the place, and I had to keep
correcting the steering. I was trying to figure out what was causing this.
Then I thought, maybe it is actually the front end that is swaying around.my
thought is that there was so much load in the back, that the front tires
were not making enough contact to the road surface....
