We had concerns about reliability as well when we bought our '74 auto Westy.
Quite a few people, several from this list, mentioned that these transmissions
can really take a beating. After owning our Westy for several years now, I
believe that. Other than a cracked drive plate, which was my fault due to not
torquing the bolts properly, ours has been free of any issues.

The steep climbs around the Rockies here do give it a run for it's money, but
we've not had to back down a hill yet. Of course, YMMV based on how it has
been taken care of, who rebuilt it, etc. In addition, I believe there were two
models of automatic transmissions, of which I think we have the later model.

Good luck,
