Subject: License Plate Lamp Wiring

Hi everyone,

I am just about ready to put KK back into use as my daily driver, '71,
but I found my license plate lamp not working. I disconnected
everything and cleaned up all the connections. I will get a new bulb
in the morning but after cleaning the connections I realized it may be
wired backwards. A previous owner did something back there so now a
purple/red wire and a brown wire exists. I have the purple/red wire
connected to the top terminal and the brown wire going to the bottom
brass connector.

The purple wire is soldered to the driver side tail light red wire and
with the lights on has about .5 volts.  The brown wire is actually
disconnected inside the engine compartment. My guess is that it needs
to be grounded somewhere. My lamp worked before I parked her last year
for other maintenance.

How does this lamp get wired?

Thank you for all of the ideas and help.
