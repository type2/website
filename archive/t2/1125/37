Seems like it would be a lot easier to just teach the wife how to drive a stick!  Last year I taught my then "lady-friend" who is now my wife how to drive a stick in her new 70 Westy (she had NEVER driven any maual transmission car before then)... There were a few harrowing moments, and I'll probably have to install a new clutch in her bus sooner than normal, but she drives it like a champ now!!!

PEACE!
