Subject: Replacing selector link shaft bracket

Brought home a bus that had been sitting since '89.
1978 Westfalia Deluxe.  It was stuck in gear and I wasn't able to get it out,
after trying all the tricks.
I put the trans problem on hold until I could see if the engine was OK, or
needed to come out.  I'm happy to say that a new (actually saved from when I
converted my other Westy to carb) fuel pump and some new fuel line was all
that was needed and it fired up and ran great, although it has some exhaust
leaks that will need to be repaired, as well as all vacuum lines, etc.
Thanks to some info from the list (thanks Mark!)  I pulled the nosecone from
the trans (trans still in the bus) and found the broken selector link shaft
bracket (the wide U shaped bracket that has 2 bolt holes).  It was broken in
two at the top bolt hole.
I am going to order a new one rather than weld it up, and although the
selector ball looks OK, I am going to replace it, too.
Does anyone have any tips and/or suggestions on reassembling the selector
shaft and nosecone?  I was told by someone to make sure that it is in neutral
when you reassemble it.  Any other tips?
I know that I should replace the shift bushing in the nosecone, too, but I
can't get it out from the torsion hsg. now, and I am not going to put this bus
down the road for a while (years, probably), and before I do I will probably
pull everything and go through it, and replace the bushing then.  I just need
this bus mobile for right now.
Any tips/info appreciated.
Thanks,
Greg

PS --  Went camping last two nights in my Sage Green '78, and when I went to
leave--nothing.
Turns out that the cable from the battery to the starter terminal had actually
broken off at the starter terminal between when I parked it and when we went
to leave.
