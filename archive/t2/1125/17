Subject: Trailer Tires

So this may be a dumb question, But I was looking at the Northern Tool
catalog while in Fonzies Office, and I did notice they carry quite a line of
c and d rated tires in the 185/70/14 range. all around $100 per tire. these
are radials.
so why not?
anyone?
this is a D rated tire here
