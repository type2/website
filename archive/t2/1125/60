Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch cable replacement

Usually quite easily. Unclip the lower section of the clevis pin from
the cable (it kind of "swings" out of the away) and remove the entire
clevis pin. Cable should then disconnect from the pedal lever. No
tools needed.

Not a bad idea to install a new clevis pin, or at least inspect the
old one, I have seem them wear through.

Might want to drag a piece of string through the cable tube as you
remove the old one, to assist with the install of the new.

good luck

is a pin that holds the cable to the pedal assembly but how is that removed?
