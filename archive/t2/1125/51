Hey Kevin,

I vote for checking out the rear torsion bar bushings. The outer bushings 
are a very easy part to replace. Remove the cover with just a few bolts then 
R&R the bushings. Use some dry lube on the new bushings. I used graphite 
since that was what I had the garage.

New outer bushings made a very noticeable difference in the stability of my 
bus.
