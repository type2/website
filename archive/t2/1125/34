Hello Josh,    Pretend you did the swap, and it developed problems, and now 
you have to find a solution. It will probably be "replace it with a good 
used one (also over 30 years old)."  What do they cost and where are they 
located? I checked a parts locator and found three for sale, around $350 
each...Texas, Nevada, and PA. With shipping, that's....?... around $500? 
And, how reliable were these automatics when they were new?
