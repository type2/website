Volks,
I'm happy to report that we made it to Santa Fe last night! No issues,
smooth running, but we kept a diligent eye on the oil temp gauge. In
the 105F degree weather, we had to drive 50 mph, sometimes even 45 mph
to keep it under 250F. It certainly paid off in gas mileage: 22.5 mpg!
Compare this to 18 mpg between Dallas and Wichita Falls, going 60 to
65 mph at 270F oil temp. And compare with 15.5 mpg average between
Hattiesburg, MS and Dallas, i.e., before we rebuilt the front brake
calipers at David's house, which were gummed up and sticky after
sitting for so many years.

We're going to rest today and see some sights, museums, etc and will
be back on the road tomorrow, probably to Flagstaff or Sedona. I
appreciate all your comments and suggestions for troubleshooting the
valve train. The hypothesis that we dropped a valve seat that somehow
returned to its proper place as the engine cooled off strikes me as
the most plausible at this point. And the great mileage might suggest
that the engine is running too lean. Note that I'm running a 2.0 liter
engine with the '75 fuel injection designed for a 1.8 liter engine. I
looked for vacuum leaks but found none. Maybe I can adjust the screw
in the AFC unit?

Best,
Sami
