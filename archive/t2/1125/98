Hi,
I sent a longish message last night, but don't see it posted on type2.
So here is the short version.

1. I did a compression test last night and got an even 100 psi on all
four cylinders. In all cases, the pressure built up steadily with each
engine stroke (60-80-90-100), suggesting that the valves are doing
their work.

2. The bus actually broke down on the way back from the auto supply
store, leaving me stuck at an intersection (of course!). Right before,
oil temp went from a stable 210 to a sudden 240. Hesitation, poor
idle, loss of power, then stalled engine. Check the few immediate
things I can check in these situations (wires, hoses, connectors), but
found nothing. Try to crank again and it starts, with barely enough
power to get me back to my gracious host.

I would thus conclude that the engine block and valve train are just
fine and that I should look at the fuel injection. I have a box full
of spare FI parts, which might come in handy. I'll follow the fuel
injection troubleshooter posted on my own page at type2.com/dakhlia :)

I guess I should also check the ignition: can somebody remind me how
to check an ignition coil? I do have an Ohm meter.

Cheers,
Sami
