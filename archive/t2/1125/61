Subject: dizzy problems

was cruising along Wed near the end of a several hundred mile trip when my 
78 auto tranny bus just stops....engine stops that is.  drift to safe spot 
and won't start.
packed to the gills and tools are under all the stuff. is 98F and I'm not 
in the shade so pull out the AAA and get a ride home.

turns out the rotor spun on the distributor shaft...???? never had this 
happen before....   got it reseated and it fired right up..  can see no 
indications of problems.....  do have crane optical trigger but has been 
there for years with no problems???

was a fairly new rotor, maybe too long or something.

ordered a new rotor and cap from the depot and am considering sanding a 
smidge off the bottom so it will seat deeper into the slot...

anyone else have any similar experiences?????  seems to be running fine 
now but I'm driving constantly looking for where I will drift to when it 
stops again.  not fun...

thanks

Bob
