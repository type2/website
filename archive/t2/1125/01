Our 76 Poptop has no horsehair (different seats fitted) has been  
totally stripped out and refitted but still
has that unmistakable VW smell,  The 58 and 60 beetles I owned as a  
teenager also had the same
smell.

The only "original" materials left in the bus are the hood lining and  
the canvas for the poptop.  I assume
that the smell is trapped in there.  If it is and that is the only  
source left, I think I will leave off replacing the
hood lining for a long time as that smell is what "makes" an old VW a  
VW. IMHO.
