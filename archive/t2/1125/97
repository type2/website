Envy the tall garage- note how high the westy is jacked!  BTW, Timo, 
wher in Deutchland are you?  I wonder what happened to Martin Peitz, who 
was on this list here in the states and then moved (near Tubingen?) and 
does his bus and vw restorations in an old winery?  I met him there 
around 6 yrs ago.
