Subject: rear sway or front sway...

I probably just put the heaviest load into my single cab since I have owned
it.

 

It felt like it was driving ok, until I got on the highway, then it felt
like the rear end was swaying all over the place, and I had to keep
correcting the steering. I was trying to figure out what was causing this.
Then I thought, maybe it is actually the front end that is swaying around.my
thought is that there was so much load in the back, that the front tires
were not making enough contact to the road surface.

 

Then again it wasn't loaded so heavily that you could see an obvious
lowering of the rear.

 

Any ideas why this happened, and if it is something I should be worrying
about.ie I need to fix something? 

 

Thanks.
