I have installed two aftermarket steering couplers in my bus and  
neither of them were satisfactory.  They are so limber, that when you  
apply enough torque to the steering shaft (easy to do with a large  
diameter steering wheel), the coupler will actually buckle, forcing  
the steering shaft up.  This can potentially pull your horn wire loose  
- a difficult proposition to repair.

I just ordered one - the price has gone up a dime in the last month -  
but I refuse to compromise safety any longer.
