Thanks for keeping us posted.

That is very interesting about the valve action being a cause of
overheating. I never would have thought something like that would
affect temperature. But I can see now - sucking for fuel when the
valve is closed and trying to push exhaust out while the valve is
closed can be an issue, but it's still not clear in my mind as to the
exact influence on the head temp. Maybe more time for hot exhaust to
pass heat rather than getting on it's way down the tube.

Thanks for the link to your pictures. Nice to see your bus and put a
face on another name! I do envy your large floor jack!

John
