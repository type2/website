Subject: Re: Conversion from Manual to Automatic

OK, after thinking about it, I guess my real concern about having an 
automatic transmissions (in my bus) is that it makes my bus a vehicle that 
requires a specialist to fix if the unit goes bad. My image of any 
automatic transmission is that it is a pretty complicated device that I 
should probably never even think about opening up or trying to overhaul 
myself. The other units that make up my bus are things I can probably 
remove and take apart and fix and put back together if I do a little 
research and post some questions on the list.

I see all those little valves and springs and channels and gaskets and 
needle bearings.....hundreds of moving components inside of it, such as 
pressure pumps, clutch packs, servo pistons and seals....spread out around 
me on a big white sheet, and me looking at them for the first time, knowing 
that I have to get them all back where they came from.  And I don't think I 
want to be there. Too much information?
