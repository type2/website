i might have a cad file for the rear hatch. none for the door panels.

one thing i know from making the hatch drawing, the only way i was  
able to get it correct was to plot the file multiple times on paper,  
offer up the paper pattern to the door, make corrections, and repeat  
several times. this yielded a good accurate pattern. i did the same  
process for the kick panels and this took several rounds of  
corrections to get a perfect result. the alternatove is a large  
format scanner and draw your cad file on top of the scan, but this  
isn't practical for something as large as a door panel.
