Us too Eron.  And the cat loves the Kombi.  Will climb all through it  
if I am
  working on it and curl up on the cushion over the engine bay in the  
sun
(where else do cats curl up??).

Once locked him in the van because I didn't know he had got in.   
Wondered
why he didn't come in to eat for 24 hours.  Fortunately, no mess to  
clean up
but he was really keen to get out for some reason!!
