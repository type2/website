If you lost the cover to the alternator belt tightener and have no 
replacement, find a way to cover it as it affects cooling if not 
covered.  I have used aluminum duct tape - clean off all oil film first.

Re valve seat- a loose valve seat pounding in deeper should give you 
less lash clearance as the stem will go in further towards the rockers. 
This is hard to tell with hydraulics if the lifter is pumped up- you 
would need to back off the adjustor and count the turns to when it just 
touches the valve end.  If the seat comes out and the valve sits on it, 
then indeed the lash will be very loose, but compression will be poor.
