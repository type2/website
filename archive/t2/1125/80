Hi, again,
Thanks for the kind replies. I checked the bus this morning with fresh
energy and cooler weather. Took off the left hand side valve cover and
everything looks firm. I have hydraulic lifters, so this may not be a
surprise. David just suggested a way to check the valves by looking at
them operate while the engine is cranking (ignition wire disconnected
and grounded), so I may go back and try that.

BUT, here's what I found: the plastic cover to the alternator belt
adjusting bolt had come off and got lodged under the fan belt. Got
chewed up rather badly. I'm not sure I trust Occam or his razor, but
that plastic part coming off and getting lodged under the fan might
have caused the sudden racket and power loss, as well as subsequent
smoothing out of rpm as the part got reduced to half its size and
interfering much less.

The idle is still not super smooth, but the engine seems fine at
higher rpm. Will go on a test drive after breakfast and a shower...
