Subject: Adding switch to transformer-rectifier in Campmobile

Getting kinda tired of the constant hum of the transformer-rectifier in my 79
Westy when plugged into shore power. Thought about putting a standard 110 v
switch from Home Depot between the Power-On CB and the transformer so that I
can turn off the transformer when I don't need it to power the fridge or
charge the battery.

Has anybody else had this same idea and did it work out OK? Probably I'll
install the switch right next to the Power-On CB.

Thanks,

Bob
