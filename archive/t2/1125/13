Subject: Engine, splitty, into a 71 bay

I guess at this point I need to put together as complete a list of the
differences as I can.

1. Rear skirt removes like my split. That will help.
2. I can maybe use my 6V starter. Anyone know for sure I can do this?
3. If I use the existing 12V starter, I need a 12V bushing and flywheel.
4. The firewall sheet metal is maybe different? I have a doghouse cooler on my
engine, is that what is needed?
5. Universal case. I have that.
6. Is the clutch somehow different? Do I need to change that to mate up with
the throw out bearing?

Can the Universal Computer out there think of anything else?

Thanks,
Chris
