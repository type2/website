have to  use much tin from my old engine:
- the front shroud in front of the fan was  for a bug so it did not have the
additional riveted height. However my  older engine had the oil cooler
mounted outside the fan.  This rebuilt  engine has oil cooler inside fan
housing.  So my tin has a rectangular  hole.  I should cover this whole, 
yes?

- the breast plate did not  come with the engine so Im using mine which does
not match the existing and  tin under the crank pulley.  After placing my 
old
crank pulley piece  and breast plate I notice discrepancy with preheater
tube.  I used 2  canning jar lids and a bolt to block off the extra 
preheater
tube on the  breast plate.  But I see an oval hole on either side of the  
head
pieces of tin.  I should block these too?

What should I do  to block these holes.  Can duct tape  suffice?




hello david    the factory oil coolers changed in 1971 to  what is called 
the doghouse system, this puts the oil cooler offset from the fan  housing 
and had its hot air exhusted out the firewall tin.  This oil cooler  is much 
better than the early system which had the cooler inside the fan but in  line 
with the air flow thur clys 3 &4.  some after market systems had  the oil 
cooler mounted remote or on the fan housing over the intake for the cool  
air. This wasn't a very good system either.  do not use duct tape in the  
engine compartment or leave rags in there as they can get sucked into the  
cooling fan. later  mark dearing
