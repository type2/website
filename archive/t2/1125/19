"I'd rather not get a trailer tire for the bus as there may be a difference
in the way they wear/drive."

I'm no tire expert, but... trailer tires have tread patterns that are quite
different from those on car and truck tires because they are made to be
pulled; different design, different function. Where car tires are constantly
turning and maneuvering, trailer tires are (mostly) rolling. Because of
this, car tires are highly technical, made with tread compounds that are
developed for optimum cornering, handling and wet/dry braking. Trailer tires
are designed for heavy-duty, free-rolling applications with emphasis on
tread wear, low rolling resistance and stability. Seems like you might
introduce safety issues swapping one for the other.
