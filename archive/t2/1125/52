Also check your wheel bearings. I had a CR-X one time that wandered all 
over and I discovered the rear wheel bearings were worn allow the wheels 
to wander in and out on the axle a little. Tightened them up and all was 
well.

My '78 Westy also has worn wheel bearings on the driver's side. Perhaps 
I could just tighten the axle nut but at 198K miles I'm going to replace 
the bearings on both sides as part of the restoration. Am still not 
driving it so sitting in the garage on jackstand this bus can't hurt 
anyone... GRIN!
