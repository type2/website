the truck came with gas shocks when I bought it.  It already has a MUCH
stiffer suspension than a bus and those gas shocks made it ride like a tank.
so i changed those shocks to regular oil shocks and the ride improved
somewhat.  greg

Also, what kind of tires and shocks do you have?  I noticed a marked
improvement when I switched to the Koni shocks with the Hankook properly rated
tires.
