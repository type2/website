Subject: Engine from split to bay

Hi,

Been considering purchase of a 71 bay. found one with no engine. Can I take
the engine directly from my splitty and bolt it into the bay? I have a new
case so it has the mustache bar bolt pattern. Is there any difference with the
tin? I have stock dual port tin.
Thanks,
