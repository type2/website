Subject: Broken sway bar

For some time, I had been hearing noises from the front end almost  
every time I hit a bump or rough road.  I suspected a broken shock  
mount.  Instead, I found that the sway bar had broken on one end just  
forward of the left mount.

The ride is a little different whilst cornering.

What can I do?  Get a used one?  The mounts look OK.  I guess I'll cut  
the other end and remove the part that knocks the torsion tube.

I haven't looked at Bentley yet to see what the procedure is.
