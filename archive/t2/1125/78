Beware of those police dogs. I used to train with them. I was the guy 
they chased down. Wore the big padded suit. Those dogs are trained but 
if they ever lost control you'd be in trouble. Local police officer was 
walking his patrol dog last year at about 2-3 AM. Restaurant/bar worker 
walked out of a doo rnearby to empty the trash adn the dog attacked him 
and ignored his handler. Was not good. Lawsuit and settlement.
