Subject: RE: [T2] Re: Conversion from Manual to Automatic

I'm more familiar with the 010 trans, 76-79, but I think the earlier 003 72-75
has a vaccum shift, but grab every single thing associated with the trans,
touching the trans, mounting, ect. including the floor section around the
shifter.  I would guess it would be a lot easier to go auto from stick than
the other way.
