Subject: Re: [T2] rear sway or front sway...

I've read a bit of discussion on this a while back (on TheSamba I think) -
one of the guru's mentioned adding a rear sway would increase the chances of
tipping due to the new stiffness of having a sway added to suspension never
designed for it... I'm guessing if you are driving in a manner that your bus
might tip to it's side, it'll happen sooner or later - rear sway bar or not!


Regardless, it seemed pretty well agreed that while a new rear could be
helpful, the better mod is just swapping in a new, heavy-duty front sway,
which would offer a great deal of improvement over a 30/40+ year old one
front sway bar...  it's on my list of summer projects. I picked one up from
Cip1.

Ratwell suggests it as one of his Essential Upgrades:
