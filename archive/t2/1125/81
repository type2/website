What about the right side?  And even though you have hydraulic lifters, 
if you drop a valve seat, you can still end up with way too much clearance.

Ehh... I don't know if that would do much other than make the engine 
compartment smelly.

If you're in a city, I'd stop at a FLAPS and get yourself a compression 
tester.  That will quickly identify which, if any, of your cylinders are 
bad.  From there you can focus around that cylinder instead of trying to 
guess which one is funky.
