Subject: Re: rear sway or front sway...

Thanks for the responses. I will check my front sway bar and rear torsion
bar bushings. 

 

As for tires & shocks.

Front tires: Hankook 195/R14C (Just put on within the last year)

Rear Tires: Federal 195/70R14 (these were on the truck when I got it, and
they look to be good, so I have not replaced them)

 

I'm not sure about shocks.

 

The rear torsion bar bushings sounds like a reasonable assessment, and given
it's moniker - it sounds like it suits my issue. My question-how do I check
if the bushings are worn? Is this just a visual check? Is this in the
Bentley?

 

Hopefully I'll have time next weekend to lift it up and take a look. 

 

Thanks again.
