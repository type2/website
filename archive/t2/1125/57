the early 003 auto trannys were vacuum shifted and had a vacuum line to 
the manifold.  the shifter I believe was on the left side.

the later 010 auto tranny is governor shifted and has no vacuum line and 
the shifter is on the right side (looking back to front)

the 010 is a much more relaible unit
