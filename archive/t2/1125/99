Subject: 34pict3 Carburetor issue

Hey Y'all,
Was driving home yesterday in my 71 (1600 DP with Solex 34pict3 carb) and when I let off the gas, the engine died.  It re-started easily and would run fine as long as I kept the gas pedal pushed.... So fo course I assume it the idle cut-off solenoid either unplugged or rattled loose..  Check and replace with a know good one, same thing happens.  Check points, timing, distributor, fuel pump, vacuum advance, intake leaks, all good.
Leaves me with the carburetor.  The carb in question is relatively new, 2 years old or so.  So, I switched it our with a carb from a spare engine I have, and everything worked fine.
So, I'd really like NOT to just trash that fairly new carb.  So aside from the idle cut-off solenoid, where\what do I need to look for on this carb.
I have had carbs go bad before, but never this suddenly, everything was perfect for 2 years, then it just quit????
Advise please...

PEACE! 
John Baker
