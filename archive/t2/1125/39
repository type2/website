Yep, should be pretty simple. Just wanted to check in to see anyone tried this
before and had problems using a standard switch. The T-R is in the box beneath
the rear seat next to the circuit breaker-110 VAC outlet panel. the timer
you're thinking of is downstream of that (on the 12 VDC side) up on the
battery changing-fridge control panel.

Thanks,
