good suggestion.. I have seen ok compression on a bad seat tho.....  sort of
a set of circumstances....
the seat drops... noise, loss of power...  driver pulls over,, maybe leaves
it over night,, engine cools , seat sits back in place nice and neat.. but
with a lot less "press fit" tolerance...  altho a compression test won't
dislodge the seat,, and therefore confooooses the issue .. as the
compression readings 'seem fine'

once the engine gets hot again.. the clearances open up, and the seat causes
issues.....    so this can appear like it is intermittant.
