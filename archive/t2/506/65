Don't they do that in Japan already hence the availability of "cheap" 
replacement engines from there?

Pretty sure I agree with you about the "retirement policy" in Japan,
but the availability of the engines is questionable...I remember a few
sites that advertised "those" engines some years ago for a buddy with
a Japanese pickup but they seem to have disappeared (or I can't find
'em)...
Switzerland is another country with a strict "inspection" system that
effectively limits the age (and appearance !) of locally registered cars...
