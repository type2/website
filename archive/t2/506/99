Tony,

I haven't done it in years.  I generally install the mc leave the
plugs in it for the brake lines and then fill the resevoir.

By the time I get back underneath it and pull the first brake line
cap off, I have brake fluid seeping out from the connection...I hook up 
that line and go on to the next one...if it isn't seeping out, I leave the 
cap off for a few seconds and wait for it to start.

On the last bus one I did(my 78), I could see the bubbles going back up
the line to the resevoir...about the time they stopped, fluid was ready
to come out of the brake line connections.

The 78 will absolutely throw you thru the front windshield if you get 
serious on the brakes.

Cheers, dave
