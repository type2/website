Chris,

You need a bentley manual. It has a very good troubleshooting procedure for
the FI system, including yours with the o2 sensor.

The engine needs the o2 sensor to run properly. First make sure you have the
CA FI components still installed. There a few ways to tell. Look on the main
engine wire harness and see if you have a large green wire with a white
plastic plug terminal on the end. This wire emerges from the large main loom
about 18" from the ecu plug (going from memory here). This wire is for the
o2 sensor. The bentley also has the part numbers for all the ECU's
(computer) and AFM's (air flow meter). You may also want to make sure you
have a place to install the 2o sensor, as many of the CA busses have had the
exhaust changed for a different system.

Also look in the type2.com library under fuel injection, there are some good
documents in there. One of the best ones is:
