Subject: Re: Used Japanese engine (fire talk)

In Japan, there are quite a few taxes on automobiles,
including a "maintenance check" on every car over
three years old.  Cars also depreciate much faster in
Japan than in the U.S. (as mentioned previously as the
Japanese obsession with biggerbetterfastermore), so
this leads to lots & lots of used cars on the Japanese
market.  The "Import Tuner" trend has been a boon for
importers who chop up the cars and sell the Honda
V-TEC and 2.0 Mitsu engines for more than they could
get for the whole car in Japan, and part out the rest.
 (I learned a lot about this last spring while
searching for parts to rebuild a slightly-tweaked
Honda CRX I bought for a song to use as my daily
driver - luckily it is the car of choice among the
"rice-rocket" crowd, so parts are plentiful  ;)
