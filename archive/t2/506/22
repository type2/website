Subject: RE: [T2] fire talk

Thanks to George and Chris for their thoughts on the cause of fires - both
very astute.  So to summarize:  The gas line ruptures (often where it goes
through the firewall) and drips/sprays/pours gasoline onto the exhaust
manifold/heat exchangers right at the hottest part.  I haven't tested temps
on this, but since the auto-ignite temp for gasoline seems to be anywhere
from about 500 F on up I must assume that the temps on the exhaust can and
do exceed this.  And to worsen the problem, the fuel tank continues to
gravity-feed the fire (on both sides of the firewall) making it virtually
impossible to put out.  

Now I know :)
