Subject: bus fund and apology

Hi
This has been bugging me all week - I feel bad for the tear I went on 
Monday. I made a lot of rash judgements about people I've never met. I 
wanted to apologize for creating a bunch of anger and dischord.

If you need a pair of jalousie windows you're welcome to them. They're in 
good shape and should work fine. You can p-mail me if you want them.

Mat
