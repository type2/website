Subject: [for sale] typeIV parts in Portlan, OR

Hi All,    Located in Portland, Oregon.    I posted these for sale last 
year, and long story short, the person never showed back up to get the 
parts.  Since they are not in the way, I tend to procrastinate.  Its all 
still here, and from my previous post.....

..........................
I've got a small storage area filled with a few years of collecting bus 
parts, mostly typeIV / bay window stuff.  Some of the highlights (from 
memory) are a typeIV case all sparkling clean, gas-adjust shocks, 
headlight upgrades, couple fridge/camping units, a few alternators, lots 
of tin (at least one complete set), a running 1800 engine, two or three 
set of the orig dual solex carbs, some heat exchangers, child cot, some 
padding to restuff two front   seats, and several boxes of misc stuff.

The engine came from a bus I bought, and was running fine when I pulled 
it.  I bought the bus for the body, and I already had a nice engine I 
had done a top end rebuild on.  I swapped them, and put the other engine 
in my basement with the plans of doing a full rebuild.  I never got 
around to the rebuild:)
..........................

$400 takes it all.  I am sure no one remembers me, but I spent many a 
year on this list, reading about buses instead of working (love Internet 
access at work:).  I'd like to see this stuff go to a listee, before I 
throw an add up somewhere else.

take care,
    brandon
