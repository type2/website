Hello Guys     The white rubbing blocks had a problem of breaking   both come 
with the same part number 01 011     the best points to use are the 01 130  
these all have the brown rubbing block and a black/ white wire   There was a 
bad batch of the 01 011 going around  last year that would drive you crazy work 
for about 3 miles then quit , let set a while would work for another 3 miles . 
these all had the white rubbing blocks.  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
