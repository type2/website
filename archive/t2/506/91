One of the first things you might do is check and see what elements of a
"California" engine you have; things tend to wander off over time.

From the TypeII Library article "1979 Bus "California" and "Federal"
Identification by Karl von Salzen":

"Look at the left end of your gas tank panel. How many relays do you have?
1 = California
2 = Federal
You can also pull out your FI ECU and look at the # on it:
039 906 021D Cal Standard trans
039 906 021E Cal Auto trans
039 906 021B Fed Standard trans
039 906 021C Fed Auto trans
You can look at the # on the cover of the AFM:
0280 200 022 Cal
0280 200 020 Fed"

This, of course, only covers *some* of the elements of an engine that make
it a "California" engine.  Based on my '81 California Vanagon there's also a
different throttle body (ports both in front of and behind the butterfly),
different distributor (no points, vacuum disk that accommodates both ports
on the throttle body), the addition of the ICU and Idle stabilizer, a
different left-side header setup, exhaust crossover pipe and catalytic
converter than the Federal model, the addition of an O2 sensor and, of
course, a different wiring harness.

If all you're missing is the O2 sensor, but everything else is there, then
install the O2 sensor and plug it into the harness.  However, more
importantly than that, you need to see that your basic mixture is adjusted
correctly.  This can be done - roughly - by reading the O2 sensor's output
with a voltmeter but it's best done with an exhaust gas analyzer inserted
before the catalytic converter.   The O2 sensor is there just to provide
correction and requires that the basic mixture be properly adjusted in the
first place.
