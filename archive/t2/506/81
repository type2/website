Subject: 79 Transporter FI having trouble starting and idling - need

Dear Type2,
 
I recently rebuilt the top end of my 79 2000cc FI (California) engine.
I have been driving her for three months since the rebuild.  She has
been running well with the exception of cold start and idle.
 
When we had our first cold spell she would not start for me cold.  I
would have to turn her over and then let her sit for 10 minutes and then
she would start right up.  This has been going on for almost a month.  I
am still having trouble getting her started and now she is having
trouble idling.  Once she gets hot she runs well.  I had the battery
tested and it came out with flying colors.  The dwell is set at 42
degrees and the timing is at 7.5 BTDC.  I have hydraulic lifters and
have them adjusted at zero clearance.  The idle screw is so far out that
it does not affect the idle speed.  I have to have the accelerator
floored to get her to start and I have to hold the accelerator down to
keep it idling.  There is no O2 sensor and I put in a new Temp Sensor
II.  The coil is old.  The points and condensor are brand new.
 
I think that my problem is just a matter of tuning the engine.  The only
thing I know to adjust is the valves, timing and dwell.  Do you know of
any other adjustments to improve the idle?
 
Would a new coil make a difference?
 
Shouldn't the cold start valve kick in when it is cold?
 
Why does the engine start after it sits for 10 minutes after an intial
turnover with no firing?
 
Thank you for your time,
