Hello list,
 With all the talk about engine fires I thought this story might prevent
a fire. Two years ago I bought a 1967 westy about 90 miles from where I
live. I checked everything and all looked good so 2 days later I went to
drive the bus home. It was a cool, rainy day and I started the engine,
looked over everything again and started home. I had no problems on the
trip, bus ran excellent. After I pulled in my driveway I left it running
and was checking the engine and when I opened the compartment door
everything was wet--- with gas. I left the bus sitting for 2 days and
then started the engine and checked for fuel leaks. No leaks. The next
day I started it again and looked for leaks. After about 10 minutes all
of  the braided gas hose began to look wet and eventually started to drip
gas. The hoses looked new but evidently were dry rotted so be sure to
check, change the rubber gas lines. 
 I was lucky that no sparks were present and someone was looking out for
me.

        Thanks
