This sounds like a good method. The only comment I'd like to add is it is
good to pull the steel line out and have a good look at it. I had read all
about the steel being hacksawed by the tin, and was well aware of it. Last
summer I finally pulled it out and got a big shock, when I saw it was almost
sawed through on both sides. This is a scary weak point of our beloved VW's.
Have a good look at that steel line.
