After making this Hoover modification (which is very difficult with the 
engine in the bus -- at least, it is for the later bays, because it's 
hard to get a wrench on both of the nuts) I decided that the right way 
to go is to weld a piece of steel line into the tin, then clamp hose on 
either side. That way, nothing is moving and abrading.

I haven't done this yet. Has anyone? Is there something I'm not taking 
into consideration?
