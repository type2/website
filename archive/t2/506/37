Hi Scott,

The prototype exhaust system your working on sounds interesting. 
Keep us updated I'd like to learn more about the project when it
completed.

You mentioned you converted your 79 California spec westy to use
72-74 exhaust. I'm not sure if I'm understanding you right. Your
using the 72-74 muffler but what year heat exchanger are you using?
In the photo of your O2 sensor it looks like the exhaust tubes 
leading from the heads are oval.
