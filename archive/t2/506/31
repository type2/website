I wonder if insulating header wrap on the exhaust extractors/J-tubes 
and around the heat exchangers would help mitigate the risk somewhat.  
I've heard that header wrap can be cool enough to touch on the outside 
even when the engine is at full operating temperature.  I think some of 
these wraps are resistant to liquid absorption once cured.

Does anyone out there have experience with this stuff?
