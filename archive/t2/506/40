Unless it's been "reforumlated" recently, it could mitigate the risk
of fire somewhat but introduce a new problem: rust.  The stuff I'm
familiar with tends to hold water.  Back when I used to mess with
F*rds I lost a set of good Hooker Super Comps to rust in just a
couple of years because of the wrap.  Haven't touched it since.
