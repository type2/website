Subject: slider lube'n

hey ho friday yo. on the bottom front of the slider door there is an
adjustable bracket with two rollers. mine was so, so abused. dirty grease
containing at least one pepple, ugh. question is: do one or both of those
roller separate off the bracket? did so separate on the upper roller... use
force?   - steve
