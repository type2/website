Kinda a chicken or egg thing here with cars in Japan...I tried a little 
background
research on the subject and found that the inspections in Japan are twice a
year and the owner pays for the inspection with very, very stringent rules
for passing...Expensive repairs needed on an older car to keep it inspection-
worthy (and depress used car sales) make buying new a better financial de-
cision...Yes, the Japanese are firstest with the newest, but is that a result
of the individual Japanese decision or a very paternalistic attitude of 
govern-
ment with industry? After all, if you've got a consumer-driven economy like
Japan's, you've got to figure out a way to make everyone a repeat customer...
(Remember the movie, "The Man in the White Suit" with Alec Guinness... ?-)
Bus content: watch your lawmakers when they're talkin' about "old cars";
"old" is a very relative term...
