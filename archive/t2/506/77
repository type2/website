Subject: Used Japanese engine (fire talk)

I head the surplus Japanese engines and cars sold around the world were a
result of the Japanese attitude toward anything used rather than a mandatory
retirement policy. I bought several of those engines in the 80's (2 Hondas,
1 Mazda rotary) and they all a were great value at a few hundred dollars
each.
