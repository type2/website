There are better ways to put the T4 into an early Bay than cutting the engine
compartment.  If you don't mind doing it yourself, check out the Joe Cali
NextGen conversion at http://home.att.net/~NEXTGEN/.  For an off-the-shelf
system, check out http://www.sharpbuilt.com.au/Sharpbuilt.htm for 911-style
systems, or the DTM at http://www.massivetype4.com/main.shtml.

But there are other things that need to be addressed as well.  The first
thing that comes to mind is the flywheel .. you'll need to remove the pilot
bearing from the end of the crank, then ream out the flywheel's centerbore
and put the bearing there (in the flywheel).  You also *might* need a
210mm or 215mm flywheel if you've got a 228mm, because the latter may have
clearance issues in your bellhousing.

Then there's the "moustache bar".  You need the rear engine bar, so you'll
have to figure something out there.  I don't *think* it's a direct fit but
I honestly don't know.

If you're at all serious about wanting to do this, head over to
http://www.shoptalkforums.com and check out the Type 4um.  Lot of good people
there, lots of information, and probably someone lurking around who's done
what you're thinking about.
