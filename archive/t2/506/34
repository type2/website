Hi Ron,
I'm glad you saw my message. I was hoping you'd have something to say
on the subject.

My engine is a 79 block, 79 heads and 79 CAL exhaust setup but instead
of having the California fuel injection with standard O2 sensor my
bus is sporting a '77 federal fuel injection system. So I have no
provision in the ECU for the O2 sensor. I just use the oxygen sensor
to check my fuel mixture by using a digital Multimeter to read the 
sensor output. So while I like the O2 sensor I'm not needing to
keep it.

Yes I agree, because my crossover pipe, and header are rusted right
now. I think i'll have another year maybe two before the rust makes
these pieces unusable. Then I'll be back in the same situation again
looking for hard to find parts...

No you explained the aviable options very well. It looks like I need
to find a left '79 heat exchanger, either federal or california.
I'm leaning towards the '79 federal unit now in combination of
using a 72-74 muffler.  I'd like to get rid of the crossover pipes
and have a better flowing exhaust. 

Thanks for the help.
Alex
