George,
Your fix sounds good--
But just one quick question--

Trucks don't use inner tubes anymore--
99.9/10ths of them all all 11 x 22.5 tubeless--
10 x 20's tube type tires went out 15 years ago--

Why not simply use rubber electrical hole type grommets ??

Pop them into the hole--they fit snug, and won't pop out--and will
support the fuel line just ducky--

Works OK for me anyway.

Later,

TK

An easier and (IMO) better solution is to get a rubber strip about 2"
wide (inner tube rubber works well) and wrap it around and around the
fuel line until its OD is a bit larger than the hole in the tin. Then
squeeze it in and slide the whole works along the line and through the
hole, leaving about an inch on both sides. There's no way that this will
come out (rubber has to compress no matter which way it moves) and it
provides a large bearing surface and vibration isolation for the line.
If the tin starts to cut through it, the cut ends will hold it in place,
though I have two of these that are approaching 10 years old that show
no signs of deterioration. 
Inner tube rubber is available along the shoulders of your favorite
highway. Trucks occasionally blow their tires and the truckers generally
leave the tubes where they died. 
The nice thing about my method is that it can be applied without
removing any fuel lines or hoses.
