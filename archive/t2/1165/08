The 1968 bus costs ~$2500.

"Two passenger models were offered. The Kombi was now the base model
and started at $2,211. The base Station Wagon cost $2,495 with seven
seats, and $2,517 for the nine-seater.

The basic 1968 Campmobile listed for just $2,110, but for an
additional $655, buyers could purchase purpose-designed camping
equipment that included bedding and curtains, plus an icebox, stove,
and sink with a 4.5-gallon water supply. Adding a pop-up roof cost
another $280. The pop-up roof section was much larger than before and
was hinged at the front. For $1,075, buyers could get the camping
gear, the pop-top, and a custom tent that mated to the sliding-door
opening.

Commercial models included panel vans and pick-up trucks with base
prices ranging from $2,295 to $2,455."
