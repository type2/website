My wife surprised me with replacing my 76 front window when I was gone.
Unfortunately they reused the rubber seal--it drips. I would have purchased a
new one at the same time.  Also, it's tinted. I'd prefer the non-tint, all
clear. When I drive I'm constantly bending forward and down to get a clear
view of the skyline beneath the shading. Drives me crazy.  Just a thought.
