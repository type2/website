Subject: Re: [T2] Seat compatbility

'84 will fit a '78 just fine.  In fact all year Vanagon will fit late bay.  A
nice upgrade in fact then is the later Vanagon (post '86?) with the adjustable
armrests, but you may run into not being able to use (fold down) the outboard
armrest while driving anyway because of the door armrest, but as I recall it
will function when swiveled for the swivel seat(s).    Even the '84 armrests
are nice for when swiveled if the Riv came with swivels?  If not BTW, you can
weld a set out of an bay/vanagon in if you have someone handy to weld, and a
way to cut a set out in a junkyard.  Anyway in the day this was a great
upgrade because your horsehair is certainly shot, whereas foam in Vanagon
seats was pretty much going to be better, but today that isn't always the
case, particularly the earlier the Vanagon seat, or if some fat ass like me
was sitting on em.  The best thing to do in fact is find a set with nice
covers in good shape you like (the
 craigslist) and then ideally find a spare passenger side seat in a pick and
pull with a trashed cover, if you pay little for it, strip it for the bottom
cushion foam to have a spare to put into your driver seat if it eventually
fails.  It fits and chances most time are that the passenger side saw half the
use.  Course if the passenger was fat and the driver thin....  BTW to match
other interior, you might well find a couple of matching rear Vanagon bed
cushions (or just the covers) and have someone handy cover your rears to
match.  They sort of float around, I have several for instance from many
Vanagons that left without them over the years.  Redoing the horsehair is fine
if you like, but you'll likely need covers of course, and will end up much
pricier than a nice set of clean Vanagon seats.
 
In point of face even '93
Eurovan seats will fit onto bay rails I think as I've used them on Vanagon
rails/swivels, but not the other way as EV rails are taller, but same width
and center spacing and the same groove lock pattern.  I've never tried later
years '99-? whenever they quit importing so who knows.  '93 EV seats as a rule
didn't wear very well anyway (covers often with big wear spots by 100k) so
doesn't matter, but the later ones do, so a '00 set in a pick and pull again
might be a great score, but like I said, I've never tried that combo.  They
are all gray I think as well, maybe a few beige out there.  Neat thing about
them in a bay potentially which again I haven't tried is that the armrests are
narrower and the outboard one might not interfere.
 
The seats will slide on
out with persuasion, even if the rails aren't great.  Clean em and lube em on
reinstall with moly grease, but be careful to use a moderately thin coat just
on the rails, as it doesn't come out of the seat covers, or your pants.

Here are my questions: what year seats are compatible with mine? How can I
find that out? How hard is it to replace the seats (I am thinking here will be
rust and grit and corrosion but I am up for it). Will that set of 84 vanagon
seats on craigslist fit? Should I just redo my current seats?

Any and all
advice warmly appreciated!

Laurie
