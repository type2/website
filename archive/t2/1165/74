Subject: Automatic Vw Westfalia type 4  2000cc overheating problem

Hi, i from Chile and looking for real empirical experience, need help for oil
temp problem with my automatic Westfalia 1978 (stock 2000cc, type 4 - dual
carbs solex 32-34 pdsit-3), my interest is only summer use with long travels
with my family (need fiability) ....temp range in my country in summer is
75-95 F?. Rebuilt 20 or 30 type 1 engines without problems, but first
experience with a type 4. Is second time rebuilt my engine in 2
month.....first time (without fuel pump push rod install) overheating and
melted after only 40 miles run......possible causes: plugs white lean, timing
incorrect 10-12? btdc, 7,8 CR, possible low oil pressure, etc....Now i rebuilt
again (very expensive) crank completly machined 0,25 and check, new bearings,
new piston and barrels kit, heads ok, and install aftermarket Schadeck oil
pump (1829 CB performance for type4/914) fit ok , holes alignment, but
difference size holes oil pump, 7,3 CR , 3? btdc to 850 rpms with 28 max
(without vacuum hose connected), and increase 125 fuel jets to 140
size....This time installed oil pressure and temp gauge for better control.

First check:
Runs very well but 20 minutes or 3 miles 195 F? oil temp...with 10-40 psi oil
pressure range.....

Second check:
With 88 F? exterior temp........20-50 psi cold engine oil pressure.......and
hot:
70 km/h
2500 rpm
7 idle - 25 psi max oil pressure
230 F? oil temp
20W/50 oil
After highway road to my house oil temp 240 F? and oil pressure max 20 psi.

Check again timing and without vacuum hose 28? max....with vacuum hose 35?
aprox.....and 3? btdc idle.....idle is fine???
Now i run with oil cooler flaps 100% better cooler position .... need jets
recommend for dual solex 32-34 pdsit-3, now installed 140 mains, idle 52,5,
airs 160, stock rest.
My fear is overheating again.

Appreciate your advice
Best regards and thanks.
Pablo V.
