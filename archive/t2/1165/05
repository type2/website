If you have a significant current draw, you might have already blown the
fuse in the MM.  200mA is not very much, and if you have anything above
that, you'll pop a fuse.  Which model MM do you have?  Does it have a
10A unfused range?

Here's a nice vid on how to check current and it also explains the
different ranges:

Lemme know if you have any questions.
