Subject: Re: [T2] Heat wrappings

Don't do it, unless you need it because there is stuff so close to the
exhaust that it might melt, like add on wiring etc. I used header wrap on a
high performance 2275cc type 1 motor, and the $$$ large diameter custom
header and muffler system rotted out within 2 yrs. Replaced it without
wrapping the second one, and it lasted and lasted. The wrap is great at
keeping the heat in, but somehow it seems to also create a greatly increased
amount of rusting. Just my experience,
Courtney
