Hi Mark -

Well, at least you got the correct Idle Stabilizer now.  That "171" is
totally wrong for the Vanagon, a PO must have put it in at some time
in it's life.

As per Bentley, pages 24.13, 24.14

1.  Disconnect the Idle Stabilizer, reconnect the plugs together for the test.
2.  Fully warm up the engine (idling)
3.  While idling, depress by hand the switch and it should increase by 100+-rpm
4.  If NO increase, check the adjustment position of the switch.  If
adjustment and switch are OK, Bentley says check wiring and/or the
ECU.
5. Shut engine OFF.  Disconnect the two wires going to the WOT Switch.
Using Ohmmeter, with switch OFF the ohmmeter should read infinite
ohms.  With switch ON the ohmmeter should read zero (0) ohms.  If you
have squirrely values when checking, replace the switch (new is no
longer available, boo)
6.  Stop engine and reconnect Idle Stabilizer.

Something else that Bentley notes:
"Full throttle enrichment will (or should) take place when engine runs
above 3000rpm in which the O2 sensor switches off and disconnects from
the ECU."  My further notes - Under 3000rpm, the O2 sensor reconnects
as a "closed loop" system - the ECU does this switching based on the
rpm pulses from the Hall Unit in the distributor.

So it could be a bad WOT Switch, but the OXS (071 906 069) relay may
not be functioning properly as it has a hand (or finger depending on
your view) in working in concert with the ECU at the time as well.
Disconnect and gently shake it - if there's rattles on the inside,
it's probably shot.  I try to score them from the boneyards here in
Calif, but lately it's been rather thread-bare on availability of
these as VW obsoleted the out almost 15 years ago.  Not many AC
Vanagons left around these days.
