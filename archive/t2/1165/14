When we had the old 64 Ghia with a weak battery in cold Syracuse, it was 
easy to push start it with a generator- my then girlfriend (now spouse) 
  alone could put it in neutral, pushed it on the flat, hopped in, 
pushed in clutch to shift to 1st, and then jumped it.

I think the Little Miss Sunshine pushing bit was more for show because
you'd need to have the car running in neutral and get the car going fast
enough such that the engine idle is slow enough for the gear inside the
tranny to be able to match up with second.  I'm not sure how fast that
is, but I'm guessing it's at least 10-15 mph, and that's probably a
challenge if you're pushing the car.
