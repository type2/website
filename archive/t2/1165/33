Yes, I have them all snugged down when I realized that No. 3 was loose.

I've
read that as long as you install plugs when the engine is cold, then you
shouldn't have to use anti-seize.
It's even warned against as the anti-seize
compounds can cook due to the VW's higher-that-average head temps.
Reference
here http://www.vw-resource.com/tune-up.html

Any thoughts on to the merits of
those warnings?

No, you shouldn't be able to loosen by hand.  I heard from an old VW repair
guy (those are the best) that getting the 10lbs of torque required for the oil
plate acorn nuts was to hold the socket & wrench with one hand, placing the
hand over the socket and twist.  Basically minimizing leverage thus minimizing
torque and that would be roughly 10lbs of torque.  I mention this because
those nuts were not able to be removed by hand after tightening using the
above method.  25lbs of torque should require some effort even if they were
put in using anti-seize.  I'd tighten them all before one flies out while
driving.
