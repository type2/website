Subject: Rear Window Defroster Grid

Hi all,

The chilly weather has caused me to use my rear defroster more often
than in the past and the performance is lackluster. I get a nice 2-3"
hole in the middle of the window but nothing else defrosts. I saw in
the archives mention of frostfighter.com. They sell repair kits. Has
anyone tried this before? $20.00 for the repair paint seems
reasonable.

In other cold weather news, my blower that I installed to force air to
the passenger/living compartment has been working great.

Thanks for any insight,

Max
