Subject: Re: Finding True TDC

Thanks for all the info.


Really what I was going after was a parking lot
tune-up using the VW Resource guide.
I verified that the dimple on the rear
edge of the pulley corresponds with TDC.  I used the pencil method as this was
just a sanity check.
Then I measured the pulley diameter to 170mm and used a
bit of math to verify the notch on the front edge was at 7.5 BTDC.
Then I
measured out 30 BTDC and used a dab of white-out to mark that one.

I already
had dwell set to 50 deg.
I plugged the SVDA vacuum hose plugged at the
distributor.
I set the idle to 850-900 RPM.
Set idle timing to 7.5 BTDC.
Checked and adjusted timing at 3500 RPM to 30 BTDC.
Reset the idle to
850-900RPM.
Put everything back together.

A parking lot test drive shows a
remarkable difference!

Now, when I'm building an engine or if my next vehicle
has an unmarked pulley, I'll try the piston stop method, with a nice 170mm
paper protractor I can print off to make my marks.
