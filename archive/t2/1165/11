My wife and I were looking at RVs and I was very sensitive to this
issue.  RVs are made to be run with the A/C on at campsites, and with
all the stuff they are crammed with there is very little window space
(at least as proportionate to the size of the vehicle.

We plan on taking a cross country trip with the kids, and I would like
for them to have a great view while driving.  Nothing beats the view
from the front seat of a bay, and I'm sure a Vanagon is in the same
league.  I don't expect to take the bay, so our RV needs to have good
views from the back.
