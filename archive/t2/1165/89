Subject: Re: [T2] What do you say to the customs guys when heading

I wouldn't think it would be an issue if you told them you're playing it by
ear.  Perhaps you could make a rough itinerary for them to see.  Once you're
in the US it's not like you can't change your mind.  I've never had issues
going into Canada with plans similar to yours but the US customs people always
seem to act like I should not be coming back lol.
