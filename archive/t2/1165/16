I refuse to own an automatic transmission.  My list as it stands:

   feedback from engine and road to hand and brain
   can be push started
   get to neutral from any gear directly
   coast hills at no shifting risk (overrunning N -> R)
   downshift braking including when brakes have faded
   simplicity, per se, including less required repair skill
   focus: one hand on wheel, one on stick, none on {burger,phone,dick}
   still operable if only clutch works but shifting is lost
   still operable if only shift works but clutch is lost
   manual transmissions weigh less
   know what gear you are in, including not having to look to see
   learn neutral thrust by learning to shift clutchless
   ignorami can't steal your wheels
