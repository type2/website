Subject: Re: [T2] Seat compatbility

I'd note as I mentioned those are '93 seats pictured.  And it was once rumored
on Vanagon that the late ones are different, although I can't see it being
true, I sure don't know.  Always meant to try a set out of dad's '99 while I
was still down there.   As I mentioned those fabric pattern seats in any
color, are almost always significantly wearing by 100k, and usually have spots
worn through on the bottom then side bolsters by 150k or so, no where near as
good wearing as Vanagon or the later EV seats.  But like I said, they do have
adjustable, and narrower armrests, in fact maybe the whole seat slightly
narrower, so might be just the ticket.  Could always be recovered anyway.   I
have no idea what the OP in that thread was trying to show BTW with the red
lines, they slide right onto Vanagon slides with no modification I recall, as
a later poster mentions.
 
So buyer beware.
 
John

right in to 77 and up Type 2's. No other seats I know of that just slide right
onto the rails like that; you'd have to build some type of adapters or
something.

Eurovan seats can be easily modified to slide into the Vanagon,
anyone tried one in a Bay?

With the ability to lay all the way back it's a real nice seat.
