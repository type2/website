Subject: Re: [T2] Should Say 1.5 Millionth Bay Window Made in Brazil!

My father and I paid $3360 plus tax and license (I still have the
window sticker here somewhere) at Woolverton VW in El Monte, CA for a
67 Deluxe 21 Wdw Sunroof model in July 1967, so I find it interesting
that VW would offer the Bay Window for between $2200 & $2500 for the
non Camper Model.  Probably lowered the price to generate sales for
the 2nd Generation Bus for it's first year.
