Subject: dial indicator TDC was Re: [T2] Finding True TDC

Hi Josh/Jack,
             I have one of those dial indicator set ups.  Mine came with a
2-cycle Yamaha YDS-3 many years ago, that I still own. Those are timed at a
distance before TDC.  The one I have is a plug with the porcelain removed and
replaced by some clear plastic tubing.  The Dial Test Indicator is a push fit
into the tubing.  Works great. However, if you think about it, the piston
travel is at it's minimum vs crank rotation at TDC and BDC.  The least
accurate point for this method. I had not thought of using a piston stop
method until the topic was mentioned.  Splitting a distance either side of TDC
is easy and accurate. Additionally, the travel vs rotation is much more
readable a bit further down the stroke.  I  too plan to make one up.  Less
delicate, more compact, than the dial indicator  The nice brass one from S&S
looks like a good idea, or perhaps a delrin/nylon/UHMW rod epoxied into a plug
body.  I'm going to make sure my stop
 is not easily broken off.  Be a drag to have to pull a head to get bits of
plastic or wood out of the cylinder. 

On the other hand, I have used the factory molded-plastic, ignition timing
scale for years and called it good. YMMV.

Josh: If you go to that trouble, why not drill the hole to accept a
dial indicator. Then you can watch the piston approach and recede
I've actually cobbled together such a thing. It was,not built into a
spark plug, but clamped to the head. Very satisfying to watch the
action.
