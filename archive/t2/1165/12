Jim, I think it may be some of what I mentioned.  In '67 VW was still very
much the all powerful importation king.  People lined up still (even at dinky
little WV dealers) to buy them.  Costs may have been a bit regional as well
perhaps?  I'll have to ask dad what he paid for that '69, I'm sure he
remembers.  Your figure seems more in line to me, though you might be right
that they needed to reduce cost to get the old fold to buy that ugly new thing
8-)

My father and I paid $3360 plus tax and license (I
still have the
window sticker here somewhere) at Woolverton VW in El Monte, CA
for a
67 Deluxe 21 Wdw Sunroof model in July 1967, so I find it interesting
that VW would offer the Bay Window for between $2200 & $2500 for the
non
Camper Model.  Probably lowered the price to generate sales for
the 2nd
Generation Bus for it's first year.
