While I don't think it's necessarily a bad suggestion, it doesn't do
anything to help towards maintaining an already proven-reliable system -
it's just adding another wire to the confusion - has anyone ever tried
checking the resistance between the starter ground and then negative
terminal?  My guess is that you're splitting peas and really just
complicating things, especially during engine removal.

I think that a better suggestion would be to replace any old ground
straps with new ones, replace the starter cable (which can get horribly
corroded) and clean up your existing connections before applying a
band-aid ground and confusing anyone else that has to work on your car.
  More often than not it's corroded terminals and corroded wires that'll
be the real culprit during poor starter performance.  My starter has
*plenty* of juice with the stock ground strap locations.  I think it's
safe to say that the VW engineers knew what they were doing on this one,
so just maintain the stock setup and you'll be just fine.
