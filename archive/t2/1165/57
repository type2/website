Thanks, Jim. That's right, a Cal 2.0.

The weird IS is 171 906 083. The link in the bus depot catalog is:

http://busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=171906083

I found 251 906 083 in a Scirocco in the junkyard and installed it. I  
also found the OXS relay and plug, and wired it as you advised. The  
bus starts and, while idling, it you move the throttle switch to the  
closed position, the idle RPM drops. Is that right?
