That again won't be as accurate as the stop method because there is a 
few degrees of rotation where the piston stays high.  You want to catch 
the piston at a point during the steeper slope of the curve (it's a sine 
wave essentially) and you'll get the least amount of error if you catch 
the piston on the up-slope, not the top of the curve.
