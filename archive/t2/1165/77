Subject: vw bus iphone app

This looked like an interesting iphone/ipad app for the bus owner with too
much time on his hands. http://www.busbuilda.com/  I'll let another reader buy
it ($3.99) and review it, then make my decision. But I would think most of us
with time on our hands would be....out in the shop, working on the real
thing!
