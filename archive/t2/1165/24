Yeah, Jim had recently informed me about that as well.  I hadn't heard 
about that before, but it does make sense.  That said, poor grounds can 
lead to all sorts of issues - i.e. current getting pulled through places 
it's not meant to be pulled through (other electronic devices).  That's 
why it's important to make sure all of your grounds are clean and in 
good condition.
