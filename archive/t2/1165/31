Subject: Re: [T2] Finding True TDC

I used No. 3 and found that TDC does line up with the big dimple on the rear
(rear-is-rear) edge of the crank pulley.

With a pulley diameter of 170mm I'll
be making my timing marks at 11.13mm and 44.51 mm for 7.5 BTDC and 30 BTDC,
respectively.
Feel free to check my figures.

One thing I did notice was that
I was able to loosen the spark plug for No. 3 by hand. That is, I slipped the
socket on the plug, I started to move it around to make sure it was seated,
and then realized I was actually removing it! I went and checked the others
and No.'s 2 & 4 only needed hand-pressure to start them loose.

Is that
normal? The engine was cold. I realize that the 25 ft-lbs spec for tightening
plugs is not much, but I thought it would take more than hand strength to
loosen them.
