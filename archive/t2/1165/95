It's a 2003 Winnebago Itasca Sunstar, built on the Eurovan
platform.Sleeps 4, full bath w/shower and toilet, fresh/grey/black
water tanks,3 burner propane stove, propane heat and fridge, hot water
tank, 12'awning, and 2800 Watt generator.  The VR-6 engine gets ~15
mpg (betterthan my bus on some tanks ;-) ) and at only ~21 by 7' (10'
tall) canbe maneuvered in suburban parking lots.
We are looking forward to taking our first trip later this month
toAssateague Island.
