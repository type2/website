022906301D is for 79 FEDERAL Buses, it doesn't even have an O2 Sensor
input, so the sensor does nothing.  Explains why the OXS Relay wasn't
connected properly, the necessary wiring of the FI Harness wasn't
there to begin with.  Sounds like a "Frankenstein" set up.

I'm going to guess disconnecting the throttle switch will help, but
not solve the immediate problem.
