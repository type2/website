Subject: Seat compatbility

Hi Type 2 list! Long time lurker, first time poster here!

I'm pretty new to the bus game, having acquired my friend (a 78 Riviera, 
orange, cosmetically challenged and with one cylinder a little tired, 
but chock-full of good vibes) and just last summer. She's taken me on a 
few camping trips and I am always so happy when I am driving her. 
Obviously, other people have been too, since she has about 260,000 miles 
on her. Or maybe 360,000. Anyway: her seats are all worn out.

Here are my questions: what year seats are compatible with mine? How can 
I find that out? How hard is it to replace the seats (I am thinking here 
will be rust and grit and corrosion but I am up for it). Will that set 
of 84 vanagon seats on craigslist fit? Should I just redo my current seats?

Any and all advice warmly appreciated!

Laurie
