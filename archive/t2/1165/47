Ahh Josh, then you can have a degree ring (aftermarket pulley) and use stops
to do it in the car.  You can thread a metal bolt through a spark plug as a
stop, as long as you don't slam the piston into it, will be fine.
 
On a T4
this would be a practical impossibility (no easy way to attach a degree ring)
but with a 1600 with a degree pulley you can just use a stop and find the
midpoint.
