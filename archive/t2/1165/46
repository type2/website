Subject: Loss of power

Yesterday I used my 1982 Vanagon (aircooled, of course) to go to an  
appointment. After the appointment, I pulled out and through an  
intersection, turning left up a grade. In the middle of the  
intersection, not quite climbing yet, the bus lost power. It didn't  
stall, just lost power. It took me about ten minutes to get backed up  
and by the side of the road. I checked for hoses that might have  
popped off, but saw nothing.

The gas was low, but not yet in the red zone.

Then I tried the ridiculous technique of "reboot," as though it were a  
computer.

Suddenly I had just enough power to creep up the hill, about a half a  
block, to the beginning of a long down grade. There were three or four  
backfires. I eventually got to a gas station, filled up, and drove  
home without further incident.

So, I'm thinking crud in the tank. Or maybe at the filter?

I recently drained 7 gallons of old gas from the tank, and there  
wasn't any sediment in it. Also, about the color of pale ginger ale.

Later, I discovered (a) that the idle stabilizer was wrong (bus depot  
lists it as a "lambda H20" with no applications, and (b) that two of  
the four wires to the O2 relay are missing. Could either of these have  
caused loss of power?
