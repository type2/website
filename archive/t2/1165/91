Subject: '71 For Sale?

All-

Considering selling my project.  She is a '71 camper that was stripped down to
bare metal, repaired appropriately, and has been put back together through
paint, new engine, etc.  The interior has not been re-installed, and the
camper top needs to be attached too.  There are certainly more details about
what remains to be done, but the great part is that I have photo documentation
for all work done to date.

Did I mention that Mark Harney of Harney's Carburetor Clinic built the motor?
I have between $5K and $6K in the engine alone.

If you have any interest, feel free to contact me offline:  dcm7293 (at) gmail
