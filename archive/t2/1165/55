Mark -

The OXS Relay *could* be the culprit.  If not connected properly, it
can't work in concert with the Throttle Valve Switch in Wide Open
Throttle (WOT) conditions.

Relay Wiring:
Terminal 2 goes to "negative" side of the coil.
Terminal 6 goes to Chassis Ground
Terminal 8 goes to Throttle Valve Switch, then to Pin 3 on the ECU
Terminal 4 connects to the FI Harness obtaining signals from the Fuel
Inkectors, Kombi-Relay (Term #88) and the Air Flow Meter (Pin #39)

The Idle Stabilizer is 251 906 083 and should look like this:

I tried to look for "lambda h20" on BD's site and find that.  Could
you provide a link for reference.

BTW, because of these components, I am assuming you have a Calif Model
2.0 Vanagon.
