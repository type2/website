Subject: Re: [T2] What to say at customs

Just don't be trying to bring in any of that "mad cow" beef.
 
Only thing the
US (AK) has ever messed with me at customs about is confiscating (and I'll bet
eating) 2 pounds of sealed new beef jerky bought in the Whitehorse Walmart. 
The hillarious bit being of course, that I buy the exact same brand, made in
Canada jerky in my Wasilla, AK Walmart, but they must somehow be able to sort
out the good from bad.  My wife of course just cussed me and said, why the
hell did you tell them (because I was specifically asked of course about beef
products and it was sitting right between the front seats) since it was our
last snack and we couldn't find anything else till like Tok.
 
I'd agree, just
say what you will be doing, driving around the country seeing/meeting friends
with no fixed itinerary.
 
John
