Subject: RV coverage for BCAA, AAA etc

I'm looking on the BCAA insurance site, and I notice that they have optional
RV coverage. They describe this as for "service and towing for motor homes,
trucks with campers and recreational trailers". Now I'm wondering if my
Baywindow needs this RV coverage since it's really just a van? Has anyone got
this RV Coverage? It seems that the regular CAA Plus membership gives me a tow
up to 160km free or to nearest garage which would be adequate? Of course that
might mean that if the garage is closer they'll just take me there?
Thanks,
Courtney
