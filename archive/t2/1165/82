Subject: Re: [T2] Seat compatbility

Laurie, the early vanagon seats fit right in to 77 and up Type 2's. Right 
now, my 77 Westy has 82 vanagon captain chairs with the armrests. You will 
sit a bit higher in the vanagon seats, and you have to remove the door side 
arm rests becasue the doors don't close, but they are wonderfully 
comfortable; much more so than the stock bus ones. They slide right in on 
the existing seat rails. It's truly plug and play. No other seats I know of 
that just slide right onto the rails like that; you'd have to build some 
type of adapters or something.
Hope that helps,
Courtney
