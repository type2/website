Subject: Re: [T2] Finding True TDC

Not so long ago, I replaced my distributor, but didn't have it pushed
down tight enough, so when I started the engine, the dizzy popped up a
little bit.

At that point, the distributor rotor was pointing in a random
direction, and the engine was at a random point in its cycle.

After some cussing, I took out the #1 spark plug and turned the engine
round until the #1 piston was as high as it was gonna, and the TDC
mark lined up. Then crawled under the bus, removed the valve cover to
see if I was in compression or exhaust stroke. Feeler gauges slid in
both valves, which means both valves are closed (compression).

Pushed and turned the dizzy until it seated solid, and lo and behold,
it was pointing where it should! Tightened it up REAL GOOD, and
buttoned up the spark plug, valve cover, etc. and fired her up.

Idled just fine!
