I don't agree with the author's recommendation. I agree with Bob Hoover. I
have never seen anti-sieze cook off of a spark plug thread.

If there is any concern, use a copper based anti-sieze compound that has a
much higher temperature rating. It is what I use on spark plugs and on
applications that require extreme heat resistance.
