Pablo,

Are the cooling flaps installed correctly? The left flap is critical to direct
air to the oil cooler. What about the engine bay seals? What condition are the
carbs in? If they are original they may be leaking around the throttle shaft
making you run lean. Are there leaks in the exhaust, particularly where it
joins the head?

Martin.
