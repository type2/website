The AFM on my bus is 022 906 301D, which is for a bay. I cannot find
the right part # for 1982 California.

This may explain why the switch depresses RPMs instead of increasing.

This bus started life as a diesel and was changed to aircooled in
1994. Some of the things I find in it are strange.

Until I get this straightened out, I should probably disconnect the
throttle switch so that I don't have a leaner condition at full
throttle?
