Pablo,

Wow, you have a lot of data there.  I also ran a 2000cc with stock dual 
carbs for many years and also had overheating problems.  I rebuilt the 
engine myself and triple-checked all bearings/rings/etc.  I was very 
sure there were no problems with the engine.  In the end, I was only 
able to find minor improvements in temp/pressure and always had to be 
careful when driving in warmer temperatures so as to not overheat the 
engine.  I always ran Mobil 1 15W15 synthetic oil and went about 100,000 
miles on the engine before I retired it and converted to water-cooled 
diesel.  It never failed me!

140 is very large for the mains - I would recommend 132.5 or 135 
instead.  Air correction at 160 is a bit lean, you could go richer, 
150-155 would be good.  My favorite combination was 132.5 main and 155 
air correction which I ran for many years.  The idle jet will make 
little difference in how your engine runs on the road so don't worry 
about it.

I am concerned about the "different size holes" in the oil pump.  This 
may cause flow to be reduced.  You might try going back to the stock 
pump (a new one with tight tolerances) and see if that helps.

Your compression ratio is fine.  I started at 6.8 and changed spacers 
two times to slowly move up to about 7.5.  It didn't seem to have an 
effect on temperature but it did increase power.

As the engine breaks in, the temps will go down and pressure will go 
up.  A brand new engine has a lot more friction than one that is broken 
in.  Take it very easy for the first few thousand miles and after that I 
think you will see an improvement.

Do you have one vacuum hose or two?  If only one, I assume that is 
vacuum advance.  In that case, your timing looks good, that is not your 
problem.

You have obviously done your homework and there is not much I can 
recommend that you change.  Only the jets, but that is not a serious 
problem.  One thing I can tell you is that 240 degree oil is not 
necessarily a problem (if you run synthetic oil) and 25psi on the 
highway is not a problem either.  It seems low, but it is adequate.  If 
you are only at part throttle, even 20psi is okay.  I have driven 
thousands of miles at 20psi and 240+ degree oil with a light touch on 
the accelerator.  However if you have 20psi, 250+ oil temp and your foot 
to the floor, you will damage your bearings.  Keep a close eye on your 
gauges, run good synthetic oil and don't floor the accelerator and you 
will have many trouble-free miles from your bus.

Good luck,

-David
