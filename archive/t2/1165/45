I'm fairly short 5'7" and even with vanagon seats can see thru the tinted 
windshield with no problems, but just a couple inches more and it would be 
a real problem. I look thru the top part of the non tinted area.  I would 
guess 5'10" or taller would have problems. especially if using a vanagon 
seat as they are just a bit higher.
