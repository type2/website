Subject: What do you say to the customs guys when heading South??

Whenever I go to the states for a weekend or a week, they always ask us where
we'll be going , itinerary, and even what hotels we've got booked etc. I have
never done an extended stay in the States, like say 3 months on the road. What
do you say to the customs guys when you're going to be a nomad in a 77 Westy,
and don't really know where you're going to be for timelines etc? Will they
expect an itinerary and all that stuff? I'm kind of wondering about this??
Thanks,
Courtney
