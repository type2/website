  All-

  Considering selling my project.  She is a '71 camper that was stripped down
  to
  bare metal, repaired appropriately, and has been put back together through
  paint, new engine, etc.  The interior has not been re-installed, and the
  camper top needs to be attached too.  There are certainly more details
about
  what remains to be done, but the great part is that I have photo
  documentation
  for all work done to date.

  Did I mention that Mark Harney of Harney's Carburetor Clinic built the
  motor?
  I have between $5K and $6K in the engine alone.

  If you have any interest, feel free to contact me offline:  dcm7293 (at)
