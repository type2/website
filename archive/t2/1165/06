Not sure if you got this problem solved, but I had a similar
dead-battery issue that I dealt with today.  I hooked up my multimeter
and I saw that my radio was drawing 0.8A when off!!  Upon disconnecting
the radio, the current draw dropped down to 3mA.  That said, a 3mA load
will still light the test lamp, but it will not kill your battery.

So, use your lamp to verify that you have current being drawn, but then
use your multimeter to figure out how much.
