Subject: Re: [T2] Should Say 1.5 Millionth Bay Window Made in Brazil!

Rob, 1968 MSRP may have been near that.  I think our '78 was like $5600,
and '68 was still the glory days when a VW dealer could ask what they would or
just give it to the next waiting customer before the Japanese decimated VWs
market share (not on transporters, but indirectly so.)  Dad had a '67 (brother
in law seized the engine and he traded it) and a '69 and I think he told me
the '69 was about $3200.  I'm not sure if that was new though or like a 1-2
year old unit (may well have been.)  But that was for a full on deluxe (such
that it was) bus, not a stripo van like the $24k Brazillian one.  The money
figures for various years are out there somewhere, perhaps Richard's site.  I
still just don't see it, I mean they got to be $2-3k over several competitors
engineered 4 decades later.  If they could sell them at even $18k or so I bet
they'd still have more than 3% of their market share.  Like I said, I just
wonder what they actually make them
 for, though like Jim suggested, in a presumably not very automated production
line, and with Brazil no where near cheap labor anymore, perhaps it is nearer
the MSRP than I might think.

I went to http://www.westegg.com/inflation/ and did
the inflation calculation. What cost $4000 in 1968 would cost $24785.31 in
2010.
Not sure what a new bus sold for in 1968 but I'll bet $4k was a lot of
money then.
