Yeah, but if I remember correctly, the problem in the movie was that the 
clutch broke - so pushing the bus with the engine off and then sticking 
it in gear isn't possible.  You have to put it in gear, then start the 
engine, and then shift through the gears.  Now, would most people 
watching the people know that (or even care), probably not, but I 
noticed it because I've had to drive a few hours with a fried clutch a 
few years back ;)
