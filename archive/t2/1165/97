My point Rob is I didn't cut anything off to use them.  On '81 Vanagon swivels
at least.  Not sure if anything would be different between that and a fixed
track.  My '95 EVC was a theft recovery sans seats (still had the pedestals)
and I welded vanagon swivels to the pedestals and briefly used a set of '93
seats, though I actually eventually installed '87 Vanagon seats.  The '93 slid
on the swivels fine with no modifications.
