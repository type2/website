one connection that is very often overlooked, is the ground connection to
the starter.
if you follow the path of gremlins.. the last hurdle they have to jump is
from the transmisson shell to the starter body.

some actually paint the starter body..  so.. you have a good connections
from battery to car body,, from car body to trans shell.. and then the last
transfer point, from the trans to the starter... is bad.

oh,, btw, alum oxide is an insulator.  so.. if the starter body, and the
trans are bare alum,, they might just be an insulator!

I recommend putting a copper cable right off the battery neg terminal, to
the starter ...  like under the nut of the bolt with a D head..
or, under the other stud that holds the starter..

either way,, it is a good idea to clean the starter to cable , or starter to
trans connection, and then coat it with a little De-ox electical conductive
grease.

hope that helps
