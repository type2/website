Josh,

Loose plugs are not a good thing.

When installing or torquing spark plugs, make sure the motor is cool. When
your plugs were installed the last time, the motor was probably warm or
even hot. Removing a hot plug exponentially raises the chance of the
aluminum threads from the head coming out with it.

25 ft. lbs is plenty since the plugs have a crush washer integrated into
their design.

Don't forget a coating of anti-sieze on the plug threads when you reinstall
them.
