Sounds good.  I'll try to mark my pulley based on No. 3 piston movement and
time against No. 1 spark plug lead.
If that's a pain, then I'll mark and time
against No. 4.

Josh, your logic is sound.  If looking to mark true TDC with a pencil in a cyl
not #1, then #3 is the correct choice.  I think Jim was just saying #4 is the
easiest to access not #3.  It's a tough spot to get to on either of the sides
for the odd numbered piston.
