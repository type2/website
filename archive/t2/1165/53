Subject: Sudden death

I took the bus for a ride today for the first time in 2 months.
Theres no shock on the rear at the moment so I was gentle.
I went to the dump to get rid of some old flooring from the bathroom. The trip
was fine other than a stubborn hyd lifter, which cleared up after 20 minutes
or so.
So when turning onto my road I put on the left turn signal and noticed it was
flashing fast, which usually means an open circuit somewhere or dead bulb, so
i get into the driveway and go to get out to check it and the bus dies, now
when I turn the key I get nothing, but the hazard lights still work...well at
least it died in the driveway!
