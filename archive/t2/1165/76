how many hills  do you drive up.

the Westfalia is a heavy vehicle and the auto transmission is only 3 gears 
vs 4 gears on the manual transmission.

part of the problem is the engine does not cool well enough, I often shift 
manually down to second on steep hills (don't over rev the engine) this 
will help.

I find the engine cools best around 55-57miles per hours (90-95kph)  I 
have a fuel injection system on my engine with electric fuel pump.

didn't think the auto transmission was avaliable except in the USA and 
Canada. how did you get one in Chile,  do you have an 004 or 010 automatic 
transmission.

oil presure is more important then temps, within limits.  to help preserve 
the oil after the engine is broken in 3,000 miles (5,000km) I use 
synthetic oils Mobil one 15W-50 this is a specially designed oil for older 
cams like in the VW.

do you have solid or hydraulic lifters.

good luck
Bob
