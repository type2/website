Subject: RE: [T2] Turn signal sequence

I'll take a stab at it- I believe the flasher relay has a bi-metallic switch
that when power is applied heats, which causes it to loose contact and then
cools and regains contact, causing the t/s light to come on and off.  This
cycle may not be of the same exact duration each time in either flasher relay,
causing your and your companions in traffic to have alternately syncronous and
non-syncronous turnsignals.



Or not.
