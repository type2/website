Subject: Bug Case Into 71 Bus

Has anyone ever drilled and tapped a 70's stock bug case to accept the rear engine mount for a 1971 bus?  If it can be done, is it possible to do it at home with a drill press and tap or is it best left to a machine shop?  Other then that, is it the same case as a 71 bus?  I'm looking to build a 78x90.5 (2007cc) engine and live in Alameda, CA.  I could use a recommendation for a machine shop.  What does it cost to ship a case within California?
Also, I'm looking to run a single 40mm IDF and don't know how to handle the brake booster hookup.

Thanks in advance,
Doug
