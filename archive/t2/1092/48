Yes, that's exactly what you need to do - testing by rotating the rotor 
won't tell you much other than the mechanical advance mechanism is 
(possibly) working (it should be springy).

When you pull the distributor out, take a look and see if there's a 
spring in there.  If not, that could be allowing the drive gear to jump. 
  If there is a spring, pull it out with some kinda grabber or a 
screwdriver and then using a large screwdriver (or something with a big 
blunt tip), try and rotate the distributor drive gear.  There shouldn't 
be any (significant) play.
