Subject: Regulator wiring hookup

When body work was being done to my '74 Westy, the body guy, chopped off some
wires in the engine compartment.  These wires went to a plug on alternator
regulator.  I have since acquired that plug and about a foot of wire from it,
but I cannot figure from all my manuals, where they hook up to, since I can't
find the place where wires were cut off from harness.  The piece I got had the
red, green, and brown, plus a black wire, square female plastic plug encased
in a tan colored plastic sheath.  Can someone help me to figure out where I
can hook these up to?  Thanks.
Syd
