Joe,

Courage, mon vieux, du courage .....

The winter is a good time to let the bus rest and to build yourself a nice 
engine.  You can do it at your leisure.
Once you have that there shouldn't be problems with fumes or oilly or 
running poor, and your bus should hum right along for years and years and 
years.  It will be the best investment you can make.  I know.

So don't get discouraged.  Think how far you've come.  Think what a short 
distance it is now to the finish line.

Cheers and support,

John R.

BTW .... 1600 or pancake ?
