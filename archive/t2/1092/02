Subject: Colors of upholstery, versus year of van

Was just 'Surfing" through ..Samaba, and noticed a ''for sale', '74 Westy,
but...the interior..was not of the "marmalade', cover I expected to see for
the ..Canadian..'74s, so..was there a major difference, between countrys..as
to color of upholstery..by years?
Cheers
Syd
