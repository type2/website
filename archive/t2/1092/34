I would NOT use a flammable liquid like WD40 for finding 
a vacuum leak.  I once caught a 914 engine on fire doing this.
Everything turned out ok, but it convinced me that using water
in a spray battle to cause a misfire is a better idea!  It works
just as well.  Common practice is to use a propane bottle with a 
small hose and tip to locate vacuum leaks if you have access to 
one.  Obviously you still have to be very careful in the confines
of a VW engine compartment.

When do you want to go to Haiti?  I can make it happen.
Christ lays opportunities to serve him at our feet every day.  
We can choose to pick them up or expect that someone else will.
I choose the first.
