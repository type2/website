Subject: more brake questions

One more question about the brake system (for now).

It appears as though the line between the reservoir and the master cylinder
is leaking. I think it is leaking right where it attaches to the master
cylinder. This is a clear hose. I haven't fully looked at it, but if I need
to replace this hose, what is the part #, or where do I find it? 

I'm not sure exactly how to tell if/where it is leaking, except to clean it
up, then watch it for a while and try to find leaks.
