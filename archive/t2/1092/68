Sounds like a 68-70 Transaxle's been retro-fitted on yer High Top somewhere
in it's lifetime.

You could install an earlier clutch on a 71, but you would have to change
the throw-out bearing operating shaft to the earlier one and remove the 71's
throw-out bearing guide collar to do it, just 3 bolts.  The mounting boss
for the guide collar is low enough to run the earlier set-up I believe.
