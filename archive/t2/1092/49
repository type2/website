Well twisting the rotor was misleading. I was seeing the mechanical advance.
I thought for sure I wasn't, but it was. 

So I pulled the distributor to check out the drive. The spring was present.
Pulled that, tried to rotate the drive with a drift, not really any
noticeable slop. Enough to tell it was not zero clearance, but not much
more. Drive was a nice fit in the bore too, as far as I can tell. 

So I pulled out the drive to check it out. Nothing looks too crazy to me. A
little wear pattern on the teeth, but nice and even.

The spacer looks a little crazy on the one side. Looks like it is riding on
the high spots created by the coined in oil passages on the other side. The
I.D. has some wear marks on the high spots, and the hole is not very round.
Probably doesn't need to be. 

The spacer measures .054" over the high spots. Bentley calls out .051, but
probably a product of the rebuild. Should it be a flatter surface? The bore
in the case shows no real noticeable wear or scoring on the bottom of the
counter bore. 

Any thoughts or ideas on what to look at while this is all pulled out? 

Another thing I noticed is the drive cog keys on the distributor is a little
sloppy in the slot in the top of the drive. I had a couple other
distributors lying around and tried them and they were tighter, not a snug
fit, but definitely tighter. May try a different cog on my distributor.
