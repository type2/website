My thanks to all who helped me with their suggestions, but I placed a similar
size socket over the shaft .."pole', and tapped it down with a screwdriver
handle, and viola, everything was..momentarily..good.. so I now had to remove
the .."base plate' ..nuts to remove the 'ignitor'..and one came off well..the
other..decided to..'hang' up, and after a ..'fit' of temper..got it off
also,..so now..there is a 'wobbly' post on one of the hold down studs, and I
buy some ..HD epoxy, and glue the stud down..and now I await ..fates..next
incursion!  Everything else,..is..a go!  It is interesting ..that life is not
a ..Given..it is just a composite of Variables!!
