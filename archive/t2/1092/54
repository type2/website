Subject: Re: [T2] Bug Case Into 71 Bus

Doug,,
here is some info
http://www.ratwell.com/technical/FAQ.html

To make your case universal (the stronger solution) you can drill and tap
the bosses cast into the beetle case:

There are 3 holes, I'll refer to them as 1, 2, and 3 left to right.
1 and 3 are along the same plane, 2 is a little over 71mm below that.

If you make a template, draw a line 190mm long mark hole #1 center 5mm from
the left end of the line measure 178mm along the line from hole #1 center
and mark hole #3 center.

scribe an arc below the line from hole #1, 104mm
scribe an arc below the line from hole #3, 125mm
where these arcs cross is hole #2

#1 is M10X1.5 x70 stud the hole is 22mm deep 8.5mm drill bit or 21/64"
worked
#2 is M8X1.25 x55 stud the hole is 28mm deep 6.8mm drill bit or 17/64"
worked
#3 is M10X1.5 x70 stud the hole is 28mm deep 8.5mm drill bit or 21/64"

> Has anyone ever drilled and tapped a 70's stock bug case to accept the
rear engine mount for a 1971 bus?  If it can be done, is it possible to do
it at home with a drill press and tap or is it best left to a machine shop?
Other then that, is it the same case as a 71 bus?  I'm looking to build a
78x90.5 (2007cc) engine and live in Alameda, CA.  I could use a
recommendation for a machine shop.  What does it cost to ship a case within
California?
> Also, I'm looking to run a single 40mm IDF and don't know how to handle
the brake booster hookup.
