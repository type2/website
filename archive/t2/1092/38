Hi Mark,

That would be true in a single-cylinder engine, but in the VW engine 
these forces are balanced by the other cylinders. As one valve is being 
opened on the #1 cylinder, there is always a cylinder with a valve 
closing somewhere else. This should compensate and neutralize the forces 
causing the rattle. At 3,000 RPMS I'd expect that a little movement as 
described would pull an engine apart in no time.

OTOH, I have heard of cases with a drivable engine that had a totally 
broken cam. It was just ragged enough to keep turning, but very 
difficult to tune properly.

I think it's gonna have to come apart to tell for sure.


Happy Trails,
