Posted something on Samba...  the center contact points on the drive
gear are a symptom that for some reason grabbed my attention...  I've
seen that before, on a different type of motor, and the root cause
there was a combination of mismatch and poor machining not only of the
bearing surfaces of the driven gear but the bearing surfaces and end
play of what the drive gear was attached to.  ;)

Since it's been
there from the time you got the motor, it really could be this, as it
sources back to the machining (or lack thereof) of the worn case, etc. 
I would love to check the bore of the dizzy drive to see just how out
of round it is...  but that's not an easy job!

Anyway, posted deeper detail "over there"...  may help.

Well twisting the rotor was misleading. I was seeing the mechanical advance.
I thought for sure I wasn't, but it was. 

So I pulled the distributor to check out the drive. The spring was present.
Pulled that, tried to rotate the drive with a drift, not really any
noticeable slop. Enough to tell it was not zero clearance, but not much
more. Drive was a nice fit in the bore too, as far as I can tell. 

So I pulled out the drive to check it out. Nothing looks too crazy to me. A
little wear pattern on the teeth, but nice and even.

The spacer looks a little crazy on the one side. ....
