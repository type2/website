Subject: Megasquirt in a VW

Hey Type 2ers-

  I'm a software engineer by day, and a Linux enthusiast as well.  I'm pretty
comfortable with the technology in the Megasquirt.  I'm wondering if anyone has
any experience running a Megasquirt in a VW.  I think it'd be really cool, but
if someone has recommendations, I can get a headstart on some of the research
I've been doing.

Cheers,
Paul
