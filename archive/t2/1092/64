Take what you need and leave the rest. This stuff is crap but you can
have it if you want it

One lot mostly splitty door bits, to wit:

Assorted handles, a couple of these might clean up to 6 out of 10.
One of them appears to have been stripped from a bus that skidded
for some distance on its side. I don't know who was so desperate
that he stripped that door handle

Inexplicable stirrup looking things, I don't even remember if these
are bus bits but they are sort of rickety looking so probably

Tumblers. It is interesting that galvanic corrosion actually turns the
objects it is ruining into a small battery. It makes electricity. Did you
know that? These are knackered, one of them consists of parts that
all still move freely upon cursory examination

Ernie Ball thumb picks. In bluegrass circles picks with rust stains
make you seem cool

Door lock surrounds or whatever you call it, they are pitted, if you put
these on a bus you have low self-esteem

Intriguing ceramic hand

Cooling flaps. Yeah. Dance, monkey, dance!

WCM # 211-521C
WCM 211-120-L/R so presumably these comprise one set but
wtf knows

Those were stored crumpled up like that for a very long time,
they are still pliable but I don't know if the black one will unwarp
with time and gentle but firm discipline
