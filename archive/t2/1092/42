I believe you want the -833 part.  That is the gasket sleeve that connects the
cab reservoir to the tube and the tube to the MC reservoir.  The one most
likely to be leaking is where the tube connects to the MC reservoir.  The -817
part are grommets that connect the MC reservoir to the MC.  At least, that's
my memory from when I did this six months ago.  Someone correct me if I'm
mis-remembering.

Do you think the small crack is causing a leak?  Have you checked the parts
yards?

See you on the road,
