It is only about 10% complete but is accessible now. Busaru 4 sale info is in there, much more complete than previously. The website will be like my initial photo album site. It will be up until the end of 2009 and maybe thru January, so check back in frequently to see the changes. I have a lot of time to work on it now, unfortunately! Check the captions on the "Under Construction" pics for latest update info. Thanks. -BaH
