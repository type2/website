Subject: whaddya call this hose/tube?

Hello I just got a 1970 camper type 2.  It has been over 15 years since I
drove a aircooled VW.

I recall stock 1600s having a metal curved tube that comes out of the
carburetor and goes to the distributor.  This engine just has a regular
hose.  It seems to me this could present a fire hazard.  Where can I find
this curved metal line to replace?  Thanks,

David McCracken
