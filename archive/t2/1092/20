Subject: Re: [T2] tires

A tire warning .... for Michelin Agilis buffs.

Agilises are great great tires ... but getting extremely hard to come by 
.... and very, very expensive.

Tire Rack (my orginal source) no longer stocks them.  Sears will order them 
for about $138.95 each.  Good as they are, and they last forever, they are 
now IMHO priced out of the market, even if you can find them.

Next time around I'll be looking at Hankooks from Bus Depot ....
