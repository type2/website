Subject: Turn signal sequence

It is Friday..so I have a ..'whimsical' question!  As I was sitting in a PNW
downpour at a traffic light..I was so bored..I looked at the turnsignal from
the car in front of me..left.. and counted the 'sequences' from' "matched
flashes' to totally not matched, to again 'matched' flashes.. of the turn
signal lights. compared to mine. so my question is..why did they vary?  I have
watched this on GM, ..'other domestics" and "Euros", but there is always a
sequence.  They are presumably 12 volt, and is it the 'Wire loom length' that
creates this, due to resistance factors in different cars ..or? Prolly when I
do get an answer, the 'traffic bordom' will intensify..but....?  Cheers
Syd
