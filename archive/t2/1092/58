Subject: 1600 won't start

I'm running a 1600 with dual Solex PDSITs, a CD ignition, and a 
CompuFire in my distributor.

It ran well until last Sunday. It had been raining for three days. I 
started it up and made it for three blocks before it coughed and died.
I towed it back to the driveway and began troubleshooting.

Lots of spark at the two plugs that I checked, fuel squirting from 
the accelerator tubes in both carbs, compression 130, timing 7 
degrees BTDC.
All of these have been verified several times.
The engine turns over but won't start.
I'm stumped and would welcome suggestions.
