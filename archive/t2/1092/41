Thanks, I saw this part on the net:

and this one:

C

 

I also noticed that my brake fluid reservoir cap has a small crack in it. I
saw this part that looks the same:

 

http://www2.cip1.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=VWC%2D111%2D611%2D349

 

but it says it is not for a '69 bus. All I can find for a '69 bus for the
brake is the whole reservoir and cap. Which is $20, the cap is only 50
cents.

 

Some guidance here would be appreciated.

Hi Kevin,

 

I had the same trouble with my '70, and I thought it was the tubing that was
leaking.  Turned out it was the gasket that seals the tube to the master
cylinder.  The gasket is available at any VW dealer.

 

See you on the road,
