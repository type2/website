Hi Jack,

An engine needs air, fuel and spark. If you are observing fuel and
spark, something is fooling you.

If you pump gas through the accelerator pump, will it burn off that
fuel that has been squirted in?

If yes, try pouring a little raw gas down the throats and open the
throttle wide open and crank until it fires to see if it will run a
half a minute or so to burn off what you primed it with. Starter spray
works for this test too.

If this procedure works, your jets may be clogged which will require
taking the carb apart for a thorough cleaning.

Also check your idle solenoids to see if they are tight and the 12v
wires are attached.

Conversely, there can be too much fuel. Chokes not opening? Flooding
via needle valve stuck open?

Spark yes, but is it going to the right cylinder at the right time. Is
the rotor firmly seated and pointing at #1 when # 1 is at TDC?

Sure the spark is the right color? Blue to white, not yellow?

Good luck!

John

 I'm running a 1600 with dual Solex PDSITs, a CD ignition, and a CompuFire in
 my distributor.

 It ran well until last Sunday. It had been raining for three days. I started
 it up and made it for three blocks before it coughed and died.
 I towed it back to the driveway and began troubleshooting.

 Lots of spark at the two plugs that I checked, fuel squirting from the
 accelerator tubes in both carbs, compression 130, timing 7 degrees BTDC.
 All of these have been verified several times.
 The engine turns over but won't start.
 I'm stumped and would welcome suggestions.
