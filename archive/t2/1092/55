Subject: On a touch tranny...

I have a friend with a 1970 bug with a touchshift that has ceased to  
work.  Can she replace the touch with a regular tranny?

Please any e mails that would advise will be greatly appreciated.

You can send them to me (-at-) charlie(-at-)lillysystems.com.

Thanks,

Charlie Ford
