Subject: Re: [VB] Hubcap

Hi all,

Since its still Friday:
Any one come up with the hubcap where abouts? Should we move forward with 
the project?

Let's get some votes.

Pmail me with your vote.

1. Do we want to do this?
2. With old hubcap?
3. Start with a fresh hubcap?

Send me your votes. I'll tally them up and report back next Friday.

Chris
