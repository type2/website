Subject: re:front and rear end

Just to update.
I got the adaptor plates off the rear and they look very much like the Bus
Boys Boomerang plates. Supposedly $375 new, and they are pretty much new.

They have been removed, and the front end was moved up two notches, although
it looks like it could still go up a little bit more. I figured I would
drive around with it for a bit, and see how I like it, if not, I can bring
it back and he will adjust it higher. (it was the end of the day when I was
getting my bus. He and I both wanted to get out of there, so I just took it
as is. I know I need to go back to replace a tire anyway-so I'll deal with
further adjustments at that time.

The ride is way smoother! I like it much better. I also had the front ball
joints replaced. Although I realized I was missing some type of dust cap on
the upper ball joints, I need to figure out what part that is, and my
mechanic will put it in for me. The steering is tighter, but he alignment
feels way off-I'm sure this is heavily affected by one of the front tires
being unevenly worn.

So next up - new tires, then maybe another adjustment on the front. Also try
to find that dust cap thing.need to find one of the parts diagrams to figure
out what the heck this things is called.

Thanks for help and suggestions...
