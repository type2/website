Hey guys-

  My buddy is finishing up his 12 year project, Bugzilla (see
http://www.bugzilla.com/chapter14.html).  He has just left after bringing it
by to show me.  It is the epitomy of sexiness, and I would be lying if I said I
didn't feel a bit jealous that he's finishing up his project.  I'm still
working on mine, and have at least a year's worth of work to do on it.

  Anyway, he had some toys that made me wonder, and so I thought I'd ask here
about them.  I've slowly been convincing myself that I want to do all the work
myself, but after seeing his car, I'm rethinking that.

  He paid for a Bernie Bergmann engine.  It looks like it's worth the money.
Anyone here have some experience with him?  Mike (my buddy) said he was
awesome, and had considered a turbo engine.  If I sprang for a turbo engine,
would it be worth it?

  The Bugzilla interior is amazing, but it was also costly.  Anyone have
experiences with interior guys, maybe in or near Fort Collins, CO?  I don't
want to spend too much, but I would like it to be nice inside.

  His guys used pool lining on the engine compartment.  Has anyone else done
something like this?  Does it mitigate sound? (Yes, I've read the article on
rust and sound, but it didn't cover anything like this.  I'm going to Dynamat
the passenger compartment heavily around the engine, but if I can find better
ways to mitigate sound, I'm all for it.

  I'm willing to spend the dough if I can feel confident about my Marley (see
http://www.flickr.com/photos/theironlion/sets/72157612425183906/).  If I can
make people feel even a tinge of the way I felt looking at Bugzilla, it'll be
worth it.  :)

Cheers,
Paul
