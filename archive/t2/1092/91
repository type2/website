In the case of raising the voltage, I'm curious how trying to push more 
current which is already in limited availability by raising the voltage 
is going to help things?  Sounds like people should be either cleaning 
their wiring and connections, get a voltage regulator that actually 
works, or like Martin said, add additional wiring if the current wiring 
can't handle the loads you're placing on it (because it's too resistive 
due to age or inadequate gauge).  Switching to a newer style Bosch 
voltage regulator makes a world of difference in proper voltages.

Also, you need to be careful that you don't bump up the voltage to 
compensate for poor wiring up to the front as it might push the voltages 
too high to the battery and mess up the charging voltages.  Plus, a 
voltage regulator in good operating order already compensates for cold 
temperatures.
