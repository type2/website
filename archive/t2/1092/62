Subject: the right clutch

Howdy y'all,

I'm planning on replacing the clutch in my '71 but am confused by what I
see. The current pressure plate has a collar which is accompanied by a
pre-'71 throwout bearing.

Does this mean that the transmission (002) is from a previous year and
requires this type of clutch? Can one install an earlier clutch on a '71
transmission?

I've got a 1600dp and flywheel with O-ring.

Thanks much, Ryan
