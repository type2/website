I recently read an article that said VW was not able to eliminate
interior fumes with the stock heating system. Best thing is to
disconnect it, but a good professional heater system safely installed
will probably set you back a grand.

You may not need a new engine. Have you checked to see it doesn't just
need a tune up and valve adjustment?

 road trips!

 It's tough being on TheSamba or mailing lists and
 seeing buses that are always in better shape than your own, or worse,
 seeing some that were in greater shape than yours, and you paid more
 for yours to begin with.

 I'm 50/50 right now on keeping my bus.
 During the summer I poured money into it for the interior, for
 maintenance, engine bay sealing and tin, replaced missing parts, etc,
 but I can't eliminate fumes in the cabin and my engine is running
 awful. While I wouldn't skip a beat during the summer and fix something
 immediately when I needed to during the summer, these days I have no
 motivation to get under my bus at all, nor the desire to pour any
more money into it.

 A
 bit longwinded, but in a nutshell, I feel ya. It sure does suck being
 at the beginning and seeing friends' cars/buses in finished condition.
 Good luck - I hope you are able to stick with it.
