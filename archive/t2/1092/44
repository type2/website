My best educated guess it's probably a stocker 1600.  Mexican produced Buses
produced from 1972 thru 1987 came with the "AF" Series Dual Port
1600 Upright Engines (according to official VW Survey for Mexican
production) with Mechanical Cam Followers.  "ACD" Series 1600 engines have
the Hydraulic Followers.  The fact that your engine doesn't have an engine
serial number isn't surprising, considering that many Buses/Kombis are
literally "run to death" in that part of the world.  New engine cases don't
come with serial numbers, so it's a safe bet that the engine (or engines,)
previous to your purchasing it has been replaced somewhere along the line.
