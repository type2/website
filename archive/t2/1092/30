Welcome to the list and congratulations on your new bus.

The Mexican replacement motors come with no serial number on them. We
just had a lot of discussion on these if you want to search the
archive. They are 1600 engines and can come with hydraulic or solid
lifters.

 Greetings from Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico!

 My name is Lawrence ... I've owned several air-cooled VWs over the
 years, my latest being a 1976 'Combi' in pretty ratty shape.

 On the up side, it was nearly free -- I swapped it straight across for
 an '84 Oldsmobile station wagon I had been driving for the last two
 years.  The Olds was a rolling advertisement for the benefits of the
 VW ( it had trouble with it's auto transmission, it overheated, it
 consumed gasoline like it was free, and it had a sneak-circuit
 somewhere that kept the battery drained)

 It is Mexican made and it has a Type-I engine   I'm curious to know
 how to identify the engine (i.e. I assume it is a 1600, but with other
 displacement
 engines being commonplace, it could easily have been swapped).  The
 title document has the VIN for the bus (which I haven't been able yet
 to find anywhere ON the vehicle), but no engine number.

 In the place I expect to find an engine number (on the boss just below
 the stanchion for the generator), there is nothing but smooth metal.
 The firing-order legend is worn to unreadability ("Z|ndfol      " is
 as much as it says)

 In the absence of an engine code, what are the hints for making an
 educated guess about the engine model?
