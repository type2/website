Subject: emergency brake cable & brake servo?

Still more questions that came up while trying to get the front and rear end
back closer to original.

I noticed while removing the boomerang plates from the rear axle-the
emergency brake cable housing right near the rear wheels is cracked. It
looks like a plastic coated metal tube that the cable goes through. This is
cracked clean through on both sides in a couple places. Does this housing
come with the emergency brake cable, or is it something separate? Ie what do
I need to be ordering for this part?

I was also wondering what a brake servo does, and if I am supposed to have
one on my singlecab. The PO put a new adjustable front beam in, along with
disc brakes. While reviewing things in the Bentley, it looks like the buses
with disc brakes front and drum brakes rear are supposed to have a brake
servo. I don't know what this does exactly, if I need it, why I might need
it etc.

Could it explain why my front disc rotors were shot, and needed to be
replace? I don't think the bus has that many miles on it since the new front
beam was installed.

Anyway my mechanic said he could install a servo, if I thought I needed it,
but I don't feel like installing one unless there is a real reason to do so.

Thanks for suggestions, comments etc....
