Subject: RE: [T2] tires

Great stuff,
This is the very best thing about this group.  There are knowledgeable,
professional people willing to take the time to educate and inform.
A side note, I have been running Continental CONTACT tires
on my Riviera camper for the last 4 years.  They are reinforced
sidewall, but have a lower pressure rating (40 psi) but sufficient load
rating
(1540) at that pressure.
They have not been a problem with a full "normal" load and the
handling and traction have been excellent.  I run the tires at 32 front and 40
rear.
