Subject: photos for FI

I'm trying to put together to top of my FI '78 Westy engine. I thought I
took photos of the engine before I took it apart, but I can't find them, not
can I find any good clear photos that I can look at?

I've tried on line, I have t he Bentley book that is next to worthless for
photos. Is there somewhere I can find good photos to help me get my engine
together before they take my license away from due to old age?

 

Thanks in advance,

 

Bob
