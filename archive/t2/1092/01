Subject: Everybus 2009

The first VW event I attended was Everybus in 2001. It was a pleasant
experience with lots of camaraderie. People shared their experiences,
food and drink, and space. The community breakfast and potluck dinner
drew families together. The Saturday evening award gathering brought
almost all together for a transition to the enjoyable entertainment that
followed. Because of that experience, I have gone to and enjoyed many bus
events over the years. None of that was evident this year. If Everybus
2009 had been my first event, I would not have gone to another, anywhere.
I probably will not attend Everybus 2010, nor will my traveling
companions.
We arrived late on Thursday evening and parked in a familiar spot for
only a moment as amplified music drove us to a quieter corner. After we
were settled in, the amplification increased and continued to assault all
that were down speaker from the perpetrators. Quiet returned about 11
PM but only lasted till mid-afternoon on Friday when the self-serving
musicians started again with harsh amplified live bass guitar and drum
assaults broken by recorded interludes. This enforced participation
continued well into the night, much to the displeasure of some of our
neighbors who were trying to put their children to bed. A ten-thirty
request to lower the volume, as some were trying to quiet their children
down was responded to with a surly Quiet time begins at eleven. A
retaliatory increase in volume took place to spite the request.
Once again, quiet only prevailed till mid-afternoon on Saturday. My
children and grandchildren who have been to several Everybus events were
disturbed by the noise and lack of consideration for others. My neighbors
with a young child chose to relocate.
The bands that played Saturday evening were a welcome relief from the
audio onslaught of previous times. Their speakers were directed toward a
gathered listening audience and did not produce offensively loud or
unpleasant music.
It was very obvious that the theme of this event has changed dramatically
to favor a few, at the expense of many.

Here is another opinion:

I'm over Everybus. I wish that it was like it used to be. I really missed
that. Our first time at Everybus was 2000 when our daughter was 9 months
old. I remember that it was nice for a few years and then it started
going down hill. I loved the company but I hated the noise level. I know
that not everyone is a night owl and it is a shame that people don't
recognize that.
 
And another:

Civility - Civilized conduct, especially courtesy , politeness.
Wonder why I opened a trip report with a definition.
Civility is what we love about VW events, what we drive hundreds of miles
for.
Civility is ...
Lining up, waiting your turn, helping clean up.
Sliding your camper door slowly & quietly when you HAVE TO GET OUT and
folks are sleeping.
Driving through a campground with parking lights.
YOU GET THE IDEA...
Considerationon
It is NOT:
Starting your HARLEY full decker and revving it at 2 AM before riding
through the sleeping campground.
Playing your version of ?Music? (sounded like a continuous practice JAM"
to me) at full volume for hours on Thursday & Friday , and claiming you
do not have to be quiet till 11, when asked to tone it down.
