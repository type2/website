The stock tire a 185R14.  In this tire size, the "middle number" is actually
82, so it is actually a 185 82 R14. That - not 185 70 R14 - is also the size
of our stock Hankooks.

The middle number represents the ratio of the sidewall height to the tread
width.  Your 195 70 R14 is a squatter tire than stock - approximately 1"
shorter and 1/2" wider.  It is throwing off your speedo by a couple mph.  In
theory, the fact that it is wider has also a negative impact on its wet
weather handling (although it is close enough in width to perhaps be
insignificant). All things being equal, a wider tire will handle slightly
better on dry roads, but it will be more prone to hydroplaning during rain,
and have less traction on snow.  On a Bus in anything but a desert climate,
this is a questionble trade-off, as you are giving up handling when you're
likely to need it most (driving rain, snow, etc.). It's not like you're
going to be drag racing your Bus on dry roads or taking corners at 50 mph,
conditions where it would make sense to sacrifice bad weather handling for a
little more dry-road grip.

The good news is that you can easily migrate to the correct tires if you
want to. 1" in height is not a huge difference. You could get away with
using a pair of 185R14's on one axle and your existing 195 70 R14's on the
other axle, eventually replacing them with the correct 185R14's when they
wore out. You would not want to mix the two sizes on the same axle, except
for short-term driving such as using it as a spare. 

Most important is that the tire you choose (in either size) has the correct
load range and inflation capacity for a VW bus.  The Hankooks do, of course,
and they also have an all-season tread design in case you get stuck in an
unexpected snow squall (not unlikely since you are in New England). If you
plan to drive the Bus all winter, then you should also consider our
Vredestein 185R14 snow tires. While the Hankooks do great in snow for an
all-season tire, even the best all-season tire cannot begin to compare with
a good directional-tread snow tire.

choosing safe tires for a VW Bus.
