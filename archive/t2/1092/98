Good point! Yes, I neglected to say that I run it through a inline fuse.
I put it at the other end, but given your suggestion will move it to the
supply end when I get the chance.

I, too ran a duplicate heavy gauge wire to the front, mainly for the
radiator fan. Since the new wire is much more exposed and will make a
much bigger mess if it shorts out (it won't "just burn through" and be
done!) it is important to add a circuit breaker at the supply end of
that wire! Something big enough to allow all the current you want but
small enough to prevent too much current for the wire size/length. -BaH
