Subject: adjustable regulators

As we are heading into winter in the northern hemisphere it isa good time to
check ones charging system and ignition system.   If you run big lights or
other heavy drains you might consider bumping the output voltage out of your
alternator.  Clean wiring, terminals, and connections are ALWAYS the first
step.  However, if you still feel that your delivered volatage is insufficient
there are a couple of adjustable regulators that may help.

 and the Transpo IB373A available from several sources.  

 One can modify the BOSCH one to make it a variable output variable regulator
with a few parts but that is beyond this email.  Google is your friend there.
