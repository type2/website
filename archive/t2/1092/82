It's a custom EFI that you can do anything with.  You get to program 
everything and share your results with the rest of the VW and megasquirt 
community.  You're not limited by the "black box" l-jet and have 
complete customizability.  That also comes along with a certain level of 
complexity and a learning curve.  You can't just plug it in and expect 
it to work as you have to tune your entire fuel curve, warmup 
parameters, etc.  However, if you're sick of dealing failing components 
or would like to deviate from stock and already have a stick EFI system, 
it's not that difficult to switch.  Plus, I can share all of my tuning 
parameters and installation instructions which would make things easier.

I would definitely check out www.msefi.com or www.msextra.com for more info.

Btw, for others watching this thread, I'm currently looking on a means 
to monitor exhaust temp.  It looks like someone made an expansion board 
that can monitor 4 EGT sensors, so I'm going to look into getting that 
and seeing what I do.  It also supports sequential injection, so I'm 
going to see if that's possible as well, although I might need to figure 
out cam timing... I think I might be able to put a trigger wheel in the 
distributor... I'll look into it shortly.

thanks,
Mike
