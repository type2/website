Subject: Petronix install

Hello, on my '74 stock VW 1.8L "dizzy", I followed instructions for installing
Petronixs magnet on Dizzy shaft, and pushed down hard, but feel there must be
a measurement I can apply for the correct distance from top of said magnet, to
top of shaft, so I can be sure I have it seated correctly.  Anyone have a
reading I can duplicate? I had to install the 'spacer", to get correct
alignment with bottom of magnet and sensor..and since this is elctronic
ignition, stock condenser, is not used?  Thanks
Syd
