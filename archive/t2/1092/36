Hi David,

Regular vacuum hose will work, but over time it will eventually soften 
and may collapse, robbing the distributor of a signal to drive the 
vacuum advance.

It can be replaced with steel tubing, you could use a chunk of brake 
line or anything else locally available. Most modern vehicles use 
plastic line for vacuum and there's certainly nothing wrong with that. 
You should be able to get a good size chunk at your local wrecking yard 
for pocket change.


Happy Trails,
