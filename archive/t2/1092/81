Subject: Thanks...

There were so many that wrote back to me concerning the Touch shift  
bug problem.  Thanks to all of you.  I will reply to each of you  
individually but wanted to iterate the true value of this listserve.

Still a fine bunch of aircooled motorheads that are always willing to  
toss out words that help, and beyond if necessary.  Now, all I need to  
find is a nice bus body to put the Motherships engine intoand one of  
these days I might see you in  person.

Thanks for tolerating the ramblings,

Charlie Ford
