Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon 2.0 into '79 Baywindow?

I'm afraid it's not that simple.  The Vanagon 2.0 case does NOT match up 
properly to the 79 fan housing and tin.  I suppose it could be made to 
work with a BFH and lots of Permatex but it would be a kludge.  When I 
was faced with this situation, I took the Vanagon motor apart and put 
the rotating assembly into my '73 case.  Yes it's a lot more work but it 
will work perfectly and look factory.
