Has  anyone ever drilled and tapped a 70's stock bug case to accept the 
rear engine  mount for a 1971 bus?  If it can be done, is it possible to do it 
at home  with a drill press and tap or is it best left to a machine shop?  
Other  then that, is it the same case as a 71 bus?  I'm looking to build a  
78x90.5 (2007cc) engine and live in Alameda, CA.  I could use a  
recommendation for a machine shop.  What does it cost to ship a case  within California?
Also, I'm looking to run a single 40mm IDF and don't  know how to handle 
the brake booster hookup.

Thanks in  advance,

hey Doug  If the case has the bosses then yes it can be drilled and  tapped 
with not too much problems.  IF not they make an adapter that does  work 
but isn't the best way to go. that carb set up gets really bad gas mileage  
and will not run very good in cold wheather.you will have to drill and tap a  
hole for booster hose  later  mark dearing
