Subject: Introduction; My "New" '76 Baywindow; Engine Number Woes

Greetings from Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico!

My name is Lawrence ... I've owned several air-cooled VWs over the
years, my latest being a 1976 'Combi' in pretty ratty shape.

On the up side, it was nearly free -- I swapped it straight across for
an '84 Oldsmobile station wagon I had been driving for the last two
years.  The Olds was a rolling advertisement for the benefits of the
VW ( it had trouble with it's auto transmission, it overheated, it
consumed gasoline like it was free, and it had a sneak-circuit
somewhere that kept the battery drained)

It is Mexican made and it has a Type-I engine   I'm curious to know
how to identify the engine (i.e. I assume it is a 1600, but with other
displacement
engines being commonplace, it could easily have been swapped).  The
title document has the VIN for the bus (which I haven't been able yet
to find anywhere ON the vehicle), but no engine number.

In the place I expect to find an engine number (on the boss just below
the stanchion for the generator), there is nothing but smooth metal.
The firing-order legend is worn to unreadability ("Z|ndfol      " is
as much as it says)

In the absence of an engine code, what are the hints for making an
educated guess about the engine model?
