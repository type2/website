Subject: Auto StickShift (touch tranny) question

MAJOR mondo PITA job...  you need to not only replace the trans unit, but the entire clutch system needs to be done...  linkages and all...  New flywheel, too, if memory serves me right.  I knew someone who attempted it and gave up, not because he was a putz but because of the hassles involved.  Sold the car eventually, and the new owner (as I am told) replaced the contact switch and clutch gizmo solenoid thingy and it worked fine again, after he put the old parts back in.

If it were me...  I'd find out why the A.S.S.stopped working - usually it's something relatively simple (bad contact, broken wire, etc.).  The usual culprit is riding ones hand on the shifter - while on a regular car it's not a sin, on that unit it is.  They're otherwise a good unit...  

I remember a similar issue when a friend tried to reverse the procedure in a 7 passenger bus (and he was a machinist, so he could fab stuff he didn't have) - it was eventually done. but not without major headaches, never worked right even then, and the gearbox eventually gave up the ghost - don't know if it was because it was old or just had a heavier load on it.

Subject: On a touch tranny...

I have a friend with a 1970 bug with a touchshift that has ceased to  
work.  Can she replace the touch with a regular tranny?

Please any e mails that would advise will be greatly appreciated.

You can send them to me (-at-) charlie(-at-)lillysystems.com.

Thanks,

Charlie Ford
