>As we are heading into winter in the northern hemisphere it isa good time to
check ones charging system and ignition system.   If you run big lights or
other heavy drains you might consider bumping the output voltage out of your
alternator.  Clean wiring, terminals, and connections are ALWAYS the first
step.

I ran a thicker, duplicate wire from the solenoid to the front specifically to
run the additional loads that had been added to the ignition (driving lights
and fridge).
