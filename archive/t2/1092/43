It appears as though the leak is right where the tube from the reservoir
connects to the Master Cylinder.

 

I don't think the small crack is causing the leak, I just worry about it
breaking, or debris getting into the system. I figure I should be looking
for a new cap before it falls apart completely.

I believe you want the -833 part.  That is the gasket sleeve that connects
the cab reservoir to the tube and the tube to the MC reservoir.  The one
most likely to be leaking is where the tube connects to the MC reservoir.
The -817 part are grommets that connect the MC reservoir to the MC.  At
least, that's my memory from when I did this six months ago.  Someone
correct me if I'm mis-remembering.

 

Do you think the small crack is causing a leak?  Have you checked the parts
yards?

 

See you on the road,
