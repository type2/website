Subject: tires

As I mentioned before one of my front tires is worn unevenly and needs to be
replaced.

The four tires I have on the truck are all 195 70 R14's.

I see Busdepot sells the OE equivalent in a Hankook, it is 185 70 R14.

I am thinking that all 4 tires should be the same size. So, as my rear tires
are ok, I just want to buy two new tires for the front. I'll take the one
front tire that is ok, and make that my spare. So I plan on getting  2 -195
70 r14's, unless there is a reason I should be driving in 185's.

From what I understand the 195 means it is a wider tire, I'm not sure what
that  means for driving.more stability?

Looking for suggestions on tires...
Thanks,

-Kevin
