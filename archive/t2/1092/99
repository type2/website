Subject: Proper Timing for 050 Distributor

Hello, I have a 1973 Westfalia which came with a 050 distributor when  
I bought it. Does anyone know the proper timing for it at idle  
(800rpm). I have it dialed in at 0 (TDC).

I have a stock pancake 1700 engine and stock dual carbs. Neither are  
modified to my knowledge. The engine has been rebuilt, which is  
probably when the 050 was put in.


Thanks!
