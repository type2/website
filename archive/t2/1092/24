Yep, there was a tube as you described. I believe it was a liquids trap. 
Been about 25 years since I had mine on my bus as I changed out to a weber 
and a mechanical advance dizzy. Darn thing is buried up in the rafters of my 
garage along with the vacuum dizzy and 28pict carb.

Anyone have a handy photo?
