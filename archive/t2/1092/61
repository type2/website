Subject: Looking for parts in Southern California

Hi to all,



I am i canadian bus freak working in the south western california area. My
question; anyone recommend wreckers or part distributers in this area that
would make it worth while to bring back to my canadian buses? I am looking for
heater boxes(79 square exhaust) and various body and mechanical parts. I am in
the area for about 20 days. Also, i would like to know if there is any meet
and greets that maybe i can visit. I hear the vw scene down here is awesome,
and i would like to see it.  Thanks for reading and to all a nice day!



cheers



Frank

Live to fly another day
