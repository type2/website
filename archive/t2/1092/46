Subject: RE: tracking down clacking.....

OK, Greg talked me out of the cam gear backlash... So...

Had just a moment to stare at the bus yesterday, so I popped the dist cap
and gave the rotor a twist back and forth to see if there was play. There
was. More than I thought there should be. How much is acceptable? At the
stopping point in each direction, there is a clang down inside, in the
engine, like in the region the clatter comes from at idle. 

Could be the drive cog in the dist. drive slop.  Probably need to pull the
distributor and see if the rotational slop is is present in just the drive.

Any ideas?

Mark
