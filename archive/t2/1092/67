Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon 2.0 into '79 Baywindow?

Don't know of a specific thread that deals with this, but it's pretty easy
to accomplish.  The Fan Housing and some of the tin from your 79 must be
swapped onto the Vanagon 2.0 for eveything to seal up properly.  Heater
Boxes & Exhaust Components, while very similar between the Bay &
Vanagon, will need to be used from the 79 as well.  Breather connection the
top of the crankcase is different, so a slight modification of the
hose/connection may need to be made.

If yer starting with just a Vanagon 2.0 longblock, just start bolting up the
79's stuff to it.
