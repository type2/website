Subject: Re: [T2] Another source for GL4 synthetic gear oil

Hi John,

Not to split hairs, but your link to Castrol SMX-S SAE 75W-85 synthetic
gear oil is for a product, not a source. It sure does sound promising
though. I have heard a lot of good things about the Redline synthetic MT90
for Vanagon and I'm definitely willing to try this product in my baywindow
transmission if I can get my hands on it.

As far as sources go, my Google searches don't show it being available
from suppliers in North America, at least not at first glance. It does
seem to be available in the UK though.

I wonder if BusDepot could find space for some in their next container
from the EU???
