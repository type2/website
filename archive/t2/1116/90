I browsed the old literature on TheSamba.  In the US brochures the first
reference I could find to "station wagon" in the US was 1959.  Previously, it
was called the MicroBus.  There is a 1952 Canadian brochure which used the
term "station wagon".

I'm not offering this as proof one way or another.  Sometimes companies have
an inside track to the political machine and can behave proactively.

BEFORE 1963, then this claim might not be valid, but otherwise I think that
the use of the term "Station Wagon" to describe a type2 is just a US-market
name-game...
