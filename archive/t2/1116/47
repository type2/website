Hi Gerald,

Nice to see your progress on the camper.

I'm inclined to look to fuel system issues rather than electrical.

It could be with fresh fuel flowing through the carb that residual
dirt and gunk are getting flushed out, so I'd look at idle mixture
again. Step up the idle speed setting too. Check for stiffness in the
linkage that may not be allowing the throttle to fully return to idle
when you let your foot of the gas. As it gets broken in, it might be
more easily returning to idle position. Also check that a sticking
distributor advance plate isn't adding RPM via extra advance, and then
when returning to normal position taking those RPM back.

John
