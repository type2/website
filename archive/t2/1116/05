Actually, it looks like the NGK B5ES (Bosch W8CC) is the correct plug, 
regardless of carbs or FI (according to the NGK site and everywhere else 
that I read); it seems like the proper heat rating is based on your 
driving style.

The NGK site recommends the BR5ES for VW transporters, but most of us 
should already have the correct rotor (with 5k ohms resistance), and 
resistor cables (1.3k ohms), so resistor plugs aren't needed.  Plus, all 
the message board threads say to stay away from the resistor plugs, 
because like I mentioned, we have all the resistance in other places.

Amazon has both the NGK B5ES ($5.75) and B6ES ($4.08) plugs in stock. 
As for cross-reference and random tid-bits of information I gleaned from 
various forums:

Colder plug (plug tip stays cooler) - better for long-distance, high-RPM 
driving:

Bosch: W7CC
NGK: B6ES


Hotter plug (plug tip stays hotter) - better for commuting and varied 
driving applications:

Bosch: W8CC
NGK: B5ES

This is if you want to stay as close to stock, of course.  Many people 
have chosen to experiment with other plugs, but I figured this would be 
a good starting point.


As far as projected tip (BP6ES, BP5ES) and its benefits, it seems like 
the jury's still out on that one as nobody seems to have any hard 
evidence that one is better than the other.


I've been using the W8CC so I might try using the B5ES as they say it 
also fits better with the CHT sensors.
