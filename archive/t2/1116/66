Yeah, he's being a bit sarcastic but I laughed at what he says about the
steering wheel:

"There is no comfortable way to hold this wheel; you end up with your
hands splayed over it. "

I just ordered one of those padded lace-up steering wheel covers big enough to
cover it and soften the grip a bit (and cover the cracks in the wheel. Another
thing on the "replace eventually" list). I found one that looked like it was
going to work at NAPA but it wasn't big enough, it ripped when I was trying to
stretch it over the wheel. The one I found online ("RoadPro RPSWC-4002 20 to
22 Steering Wheel Cover - Black Cushioned") should do the job.
