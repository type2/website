Good work, Greg! Even historians can't always claim solid proof. I
think a find as early as 1952 clearly indicates a marketing attempt to
compete in a niche market. It may also indicate that they felt that to
the North American ears, "bus" did not evoke an image of something a
family searching for a new car would want to investigate.
