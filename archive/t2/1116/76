Well, I learned something new. I always thought the name Amsoil meant
it was an Amway product! When I visited your site and read about
Amatuzio I checked Amway and realized there is no connection!

A mechanic buddy back in 1990 first told me about Amsoil. Back then
synthetic was quite expensive, so I never started using it until
Castrol Syntec started coming on the market in the $3 a quart range. I
guess those days are gone!
