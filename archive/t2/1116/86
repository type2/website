Subject: Re: Hippy shaker: Kombi is 60

<snip>I undid the lacing, purchased a cheap standard slip on cover which
obviously was not big enough to fit the wheel so I cut it & slipped
it on with the gap at the 6 o'clock position then fitted the lace-up cover
over the top & re-laced it.<unsnip>

Oooh, I like that idea. That's the problem I have with the wheel -- not that
it's flat or too big in dia or anything, but that it's too NARROW and it's
uncomfortable
for my hands to grip. I spend my working life almost exclusively at a keyboard
and
have to watch out for carpal tunnel type stuff. I can tell a long trip
of holding tightly on to that skinny steering wheel would NOT be good.
I popped one of those padded wheel covers on my Subaru almost as soon as I
bought it. If the laceup one I ordered online turns out to be loose I'll
remember this tip, thanks!
