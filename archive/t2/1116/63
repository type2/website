Hi Greg,

Isn't that interesting! I went to the Castrol article at Wikipedia
because I had seen Magnatec at FLAPS. They linked me to the Castrol
"official site". When I got there, a selector box invited me to pick
my local site. It was United States by default, but instead of
clicking on that, I clicked on "Motorsports". From there I was able to
click on which oil is right for your car and view the Technical Data
Sheets. I had no idea this was a global site that might offer products
not available in the US, or that it possibly defaulted to the UK since
BP owns Castrol.

Sure enough, going through "which oil to buy" on the US site yields
"No recommendations" for GL4. Very interesting....

John
