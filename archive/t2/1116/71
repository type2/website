Ever since I was a little kid, I always thought it was
cool that a school bus had a steering wheel that was in 
the exact position that my bus has.  The reason I have
owned so many buses is because of the comfortable way to steer.

My '75 has the newer ('79) type wheel, with a lace on cover 
that just came loose after 10 years.  I'll get another one,
if I remember correctly I got one that was made for "trucks".

Might try one of the suppliers I use for truck parts at work.
I'll let you all know what I find.

When do you want to go to Haiti?  I can make it happen.
Christ lays opportunities to serve him at our feet every day.  
We can choose to pick them up or expect that someone else will.
I choose the first.
