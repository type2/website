Subject: VW Camping Event in Northern California June 11-13: Train

Please join us for a Northern California VW camping event in June,  
Train Spotting 2.  Drive into the beautiful Feather River Canyon and  
fall asleep to the sounds of the trains climbing the grade across the  
river.  Highway 70 is a scenic by-way, so the drive itself is a  
perfect VW bus windshield experience.  Nearby is a natural hot spring  
and other railroad history sites.  Located about 15 miles west of  
Quincy in Twain, CA, Hallsted NFS Campground has 19 sites and we have  
about half of them filled so far, some are doubling up.   Those of you  
who can't make it to Maupin, this is the weekend before, or, it's on  
your way!  We'll have some swag and goodies from sponsors such as  
GoWesty.com and https://www.highwayonecoffeeco.com, featuring Type 1  
and Type 2 Coffee.

Please see website for info:
