Kind of the same feeling here. Another reason I don't visit the forums
much is because of the higher volume there, but even though I've seen
it before, having been awhile, I was kind of shocked and surprised
anyway at the shrill tone there. What a contrast to the reasoned tone
of our very own Ratwell's write up. I added my own observations to the
Samba thread for what it's worth, or what good it might do.
