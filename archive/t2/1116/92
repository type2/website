FYI to Mike & Jon Stiles -

I just recently researched the ECU and Kombi Relay Harnesses for another Bus
owner.  The harnesses are as follows:

022 971 761 P  ECU Harness 75-Mid 76 (To Vin 2x6 2077 583
The late 76-onwards is different in that the throttle switch was dropped in
mid-year.

211 971 761 D  Kombi Relay Harness Auto Trans 75-76
211 971 761 E  Kombi Relay Harness Man Trans 75-76

I make the Alternator Harness:

Mike - I would get Jon Stile's harness and other necessary componets as 75 &
Early 76 FI is rather unique.
