Subject: 66 Green Bus - in transit -   Spotted in Rochester NY

Hey Gang,
I was so pleasantly surprised this morning on my way to work in Rochester NY when I spotted a 66-ish green VW Micro bus.  Beautiful!  On its way to one of you.  It was on the back end of a car-hauler just parked there, probably overnight.

Nice and straight and with a full roof rack. ...  I won't mention the oil puddle below the engine........

I took a shot of it and it is posted on our Yahoo site.
