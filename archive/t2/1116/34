Stan,

Single port or Dual port?

If you have a 009, it will hesitate and buck using single barrel PICT  
30/31 or PICT 34 carb.

If you are using a SVDA (Single Vacuum Dual Advance) distributor with  
a PICT 30/31 carb, it can hesitate like the 009 combination. PICT  
30/31 carbs pull a different vacuum load than a PICT 34.

The correct dizzy for a PICT 30/31 carb is a SVA dizzy or Single  
Vacuum Advance used from '68-'70. There are no advance weights, just  
vacuum.

For a PICT 34 carb, the correct dizzy is a SVDA or "034" dizzy. They  
are offered by several companies new now and range in quality. The  
difference in drivability is profound. A SVDA dizzy will work on a  
PICT 30/31, but not nearly as well. They advance too far and the motor  
runs hot. It is also tough to keep them idling smoothly without a  
bunch of tuning work.

The PICT 34 is the correct stock carb replacement for a dual port  
motor. Single port motors used the 30/31. Don't run a PICT 30/31 on a  
dual port, it makes the engine run too lean. Conversly, you shouldn't  
run a PICT 34 on a single port, as it runs too rich.

If I were you, I'd move up to some dual Kadrons, dual ICT carbs or  
dual 36mm Dellortos. Dual carbs are correct for a Dual Port motor.  
Buses and Beetles in Mexico were equipped from the factory with them  
on later models. The engine will be able to breathe and your mileage  
and power will increase dramatically.
