Hi List,

I wanted to share a successful van weekend project. I got my van back from
my friend doing the body work and my brother and I updated the interior
yesterday. New interior wood and floor installed. Here is a link to the
album.

My fresher engine is going in next weekend and then just the front needs
final body work to make KK solid again.
