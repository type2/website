Regarding the "station wagon" reference, I remember a TV ad that started
with a paper cutout of a side view of a standard US station wagon. While
the comments on the differences between the sw and VW were made, they
folded the front of the car back, putting the wheels under the front
seat, and unfolded the body up, to double the interior space.... and
tada: VW "station wagon"! I don't remember the year this ad came out,
but I do remember it was for a Split window Bus. Hope this helps, Timo
