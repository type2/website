Subject: Re: [T2] Another source for GL4 synthetic gear oil

Go to 
http://www.racerpartswholesale.com/category/Red_Line_Gear_Oil_And_Transmi
ssion_Lube
for all redline products.  Found this after going to Chevron Product
Guide on Google.  We 
used to buy pony drums of special VW/Porsche 89/90W GL-4 from our oil
suppliers. Haven't been 
at the shop for a week, so I don't have my paper version of the product
manual, so I don't
know if that is still a listed product.  Shouldn't have to go to the UK
for proper oil
for our VW's.

When do you want to go to Haiti?  I can make it happen.
Christ lays opportunities to serve him at our feet every day.  
We can choose to pick them up or expect that someone else will.
I choose the first.
