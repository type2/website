Douglas that is a truely nebulous question.  Anywhere from $1000-10000 would
probably be reasonable...  Your best bet, hit thesamba and look for similar
condition units in a similar geographic location (east vs west coast.)  Then
if the price asking is over $5000 or so (should be a nicer bus, or a dreamer
with junk) look at how long the add has been there to decide if the bus and
and the price is the latter (dreamer.)  This is consistently probably your
best method of getting a good comparable idea.  Or/and of course follow online
auctions, but those can oddly go high or low depending on standard auction
frenzy craziness or general disinterest.  Is the right time to sell though
(spring) so even things that have been asking more than they are worth over
the winter may suddenly sell to someone with a road trip urge.  Feel free to
have a look at whatever NADA lists, but generally speaking NADA with collector
car values tends to support the dreamers,
 not what things actually sell for, good for supporting an insureance claim,
not so much for reality.

I have a 1973 Westfalia that I am thinking of selling. My mechanic advised
me not to sell it too cheap, as they are becoming rarer, but I really have
no sense of what the market price might be. Any suggestions on how to get
some info about pricing
