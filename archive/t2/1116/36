Have you cleaned the point where the ground strap attaches to the body
and where the +ve wire attaches to the solenoid? If not, take them
apart, clean the mounting surface and the terminals to bright metal with
a wire brush, reassemble and coat with battery terminal protector. I
assume you cleaned the battery terminal clamps when you changed the
battery?
