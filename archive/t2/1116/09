Subject: Source for westy top hold-downs

A few years ago I bought a set of westy hold-downs from an online  
vendor.  They are black rubber which comes off on your hands when you  
use them.

Driving home from a VW show last weekend, a gust of wind lifted the  
top a bit and broke one of them.

The original ones were gray and held up well for more than 25 years.   
I would like to find more like those.
