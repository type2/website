Hi Dan,

Ping is usually caused by timing being too advanced. It will burn up an 
aircooled engine quite quickly so you need to correct this ASAP. Verify 
the timing as 7.5BTDC at idle and around 44 degrees at 2800 RPM. It's 
possible the vacuum advance is not operating properly due to a cracked 
vacuum line or failed vacuum advance can.

Next thing to look at is to verify spark at all 4 cylinders. Plug wires, 
cap, and rotor are all suspect, the points and coil will also need to be 
checked. If you do anything with the points you will need to reset the 
timing as well.

A bad coil in particular can be impossible to detect until the engine is 
under load at moderate to high RPMs. But for around $40 it's an easy fix 
and not hard to do.

Happy Trails,
