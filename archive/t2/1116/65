Just for grins I followed my path again, and yes, it is the UK/Ireland
site. If you click "Buy Online" from the oil recommendation page, it
takes you to Halfords:

but they only offer UK delivery. Doesn't appear any cheaper than
Redline, though, which is what I was hoping. I've run Redline in a
couple of my cars, but was looking for a cheaper alternative. I
thought if a mainstream brand produced it, there would be some
savings.

That guy on eb*y is making a killing, selling at over twice the
in-store price. Opie Oils is looking much better at 8.50 GBP - even
less for members, and some additional discounts being offered on the
product page. The checkout cart does offer the US and Canada as
shipping destinations. Judging by their shipping chart for European
destinations, I would guess about $50 to ship a case of 4 liters.
