I have a '69 SC with I believe a 1600 motor with a Solex 31 carb.  Right now I
finally got the idle to work but there is still having hesitation when
I accelerate.  The points are good and the timing has been set for for the 31
I am not sure how to fix that problem.  I have a Solex 34 available with a
rebuild kit so I was wondering if that would be a better match for the 1600
motor?
