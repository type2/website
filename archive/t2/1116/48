The engine is the easy part. Your 1975 would have come with an 1800,
but you can use anything from a 1972 1700 cc to a 1979 2 liter engine.

Wiring harness is pretty much year-specific, but can also be repaired
by just cutting off the burnt wire splicing in new wire. But I'm
thinking 1975 was the first year that fuel injection was standard
equipment, and that fuel injection wiring harness is very expensive if
you can't find a good one on a donor bus.

All this depends on how serious the fire was. If the engine didn't get
too hot, you don't necessarily need a new one. It might have gotten
hot enough to ruin some oil seals, so you'd want to run it to see if
it leaks oil.

Fuel injection components may have been ruined. Just depends on the
fire. I had a light fire in my 75 camper that just damaged some of the
tips of the FI wiring harness and didn't damage any components at all.
