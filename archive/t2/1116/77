Hi Larry,

Interesting piece. "Free time" - what a concept! Look here:

There's a few up your way in the next few months. The biggest, Seattle
Vintage is in July.

 40 years.  Most of the buses I have owned had dead engines and many
 were given to me for disposal.

Same here. Once people found out I was into VWs, they'd come looking
for me to take away their cars or clean up parts laying around from
family members who had moved on.
