I'm pretty sure that the oil breather goes to the S-boot.

>I have two 13 mm (1/2 inch) ports on the air cleaner. I know that one
goes to the charcoal canister, but I can't figure out what is connected
to the other port.

>>I have dual carbs so I'm making a guess that it connects to the
crankcase breather at the top rear of the engine (front is front).
