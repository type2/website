I did some searching earlier this morning, as well.  Found a few sellers 
on a certain auction site (in the UK) selling it.

Also, found this vendor in the UK:
http://www.opieoils.co.uk/

They don't specifically state if they'll ship to North America or not, 
but I sent an email inquiry to ask.  If it ends up being cheaper than 
Redline, I'd be game to order some and be a test subject.
