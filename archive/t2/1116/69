Subject: Re: [T2] Another source for GL4 synthetic gear oil

I got an email replay back from Opie Oils:

"Sorry we cannot ship oil to US"

So...no joy from that vendor.  Too bad, their pricing was pretty decent 
compared to the others I found.  I'll probably just go with Redline or 
Amsoil for the next change (which needs to be done last year  :D  ).
