The used motor is from a beetle or a split window bus or a crazy  
assemblage of parts which is common on used stuff. Your used motor has  
a less efficient non-doghouse type fan shroud. Your blown motor is a  
doghouse style. Stay with the doghouse cooling! Use ALL of your  
original tin and install your original oil cooler and adapter bracket  
with new seals on the used engine. Your used motor is most likely a  
single port, so check to see if the motors match. If your blown motor  
is a dual port and the used motor is a single port, you are in for a  
huge headache.

In 1970, VW used a single-port, non-doghouse style motor. 1968-70. '71  
is the first year for the dual port. The dual port conversion is  
popular for a long list of reasons and is considered an upgrade. Keep  
with the dual port.

Use your original engine mount or "mustache bar". If there are not any  
threaded holes in the case, you can drill them and tap them to fit the  
engine hanger. There should be three, two large to the left and right  
of the oil pump cover and one smaller below the oil pump cover. It is  
best not to mount your bus'  motor using the oil pump mounting studs  
if possible. If you don't have a "mustache bar", you should find one  
and use it, but using the adapter plate has been done for years.

Yikes, good luck but try to take your time and use the right parts  
whenever you can.
