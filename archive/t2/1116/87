Subject: Re: [T2] Another source for GL4 synthetic gear oil

Redline MT-90 is my choice. The only drawback is that the gear oil  
tends to seep at the nose-cone and can be pricey (but the seep has  
been reported by others using any type of synthetic in the bus  
transmission). The good thing is you can go longer between changes  
than the time that most folks own their bus.
Shifting is much smoother and gear noise is almost eliminated (on a  
new rebuild). I have also seen a slight increase in mileage, but that  
observation isn't at all scientific.
