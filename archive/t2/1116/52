Subject: Re: [T2] '75 Type 2 Bus Engine Compatibility

Mike,

There are several differences between each year. 1975 is the most  
specific and the most unique (but not at all a bad system), so in  
order to return your bus to stock, you will need to get a '75 harness.  
It has too many differences to list. The only years that are close  
enough to swap over are between '77 and '78.

If the rest of the fuel injection components are undamaged, you can  
get a brand-new spanking harness for '75 from Kyle at  
kyleautomotivespecialties.com. I bought a '78 harness from him and it  
was worth every single penny, a work of art. He does '75-late '80's  
harnesses and alternator harnesses as well.

If you want to go original, I may have a nearly complete working '75  
FI system, from the throttle body to the harness. PMail me if you are  
interested.
