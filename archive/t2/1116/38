Ok, I took a look and it appears that I have a 009 Dizzy with a Solex
30/31 carb on a dual port head. 
A while back I took the carb off to replace it with another 30/31 that I know
works. 
Well the old one had an adapter on it to connect to the motor, thought it was
a bit strange but without it it wouldn't fit. 
Now as I think about it the setup is for a PICT 34 so I guess I will need to
look into getting another dizzy for the 34.

If the above is correct then I should rebuild a 34 that I have here and start
with that.

Hopefully the weather will clear up and I can work on it this weekend.

Tks

Stan
