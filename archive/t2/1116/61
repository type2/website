Subject: Source for GL3 in 85-90 W 120-140

Seeing the nice Castrol topic has me looking for a GL3 of any type (dino oil
fine) in a multi vis in the 85-90 W 120-145 range.  A bit off topic (for my
wonderful new to me 1981Troy Bilt tiller) but vaguely applicable in a VW
sense, probably correct fill for a bus tranny in continuous Sahara operation. 
I use to just always be able to find a Sta-Lube product in either low or high
viscosity in GL3 in WV, but in AK alas, or if just time creeping on (haven't
bought any in 5 years likely), I'm at a loss.  Any suggestions folks?
 
John
