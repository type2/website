Subject: RE: [T2] Air Cleaner - 1975 FI Bay - Where does the extra 13 mm

I know that that one hose goes from the air cleaner to the charcoal
canister, but where does the connection go on the other side of the air
cleaner?

http://tinyurl.com/34vmjkd This port I believe connects to the charcoal
canister.
http://tinyurl.com/34tyywa This is the port I can't figure where it goes.

<My FI has a hose on the air cleaner that connects to the charcoal
<canister about that size.
