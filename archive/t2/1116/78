One of the reasons some insist that it should be called a bus and not
a van is because two distinguishing features of buses are rear engines
and horizontal steering wheels. Then I looked through vintage
brochures on the Samba and saw that VW called them vans themselves.
Still don't feel right calling it a van and get my tongue tripped up
sometimes.
