Subject: bus rescue in the mid west

Sorry again,

 

I can't remember the group who is trying to save busses from the crusher.
There are at least two near Quincy, Ill. If interested I have a couple of
photos to show you. There are 2 splitties, one with no window on the sides
and one with jalousie windows on both sides. I'm not sure what year they
are. I do know that one doesn't have an engine in it, but looking at the
photos, there are plenty of engines and engine parts to build one. I live
near Boston, MA so it would not be practical for me to take a look myself.
There are a number of bugs in different states of disrepair too.

 

Bob
