As I recall the 71 bus was the first to have the oil cooler which did  
NOT go into the shroud - it was offset and the cooling tin had the  
removable bulge which would have incorporated the cooler into the  
shroud.  Oil coolers on pre 71 engines mounted "straight down" onto  
the block and the '71 had an off-set "foot' which mounted onto the  
block.

First dual port was the 1600 in '71

Sometimes you can drill out most of the remaining middle of the stud  
and when you have just a shell left on the perimeter you can use a  
punch to force this thin layer with the threads into the hole you just  
drilled and the twist it out using something like the "needle nose"  
vice grips.

I have also discovered that someone at a machine shop, having correct  
tools, may be able to do something like this quicker and "cheaper"  
especially if you consider the time you may invest and then still have  
to have someone else finish the job.   I'm referring to an 'owner  
operated' type of place.

If your muffler has the output opening for the preheater hose, for  
cooling efficiency, you might consider blocking that outlet, not just  
blocking the hole in the engine tin for the pre- heater hose.

IIRC the 68 through 71 all had the same rear engine mount which I've  
seen referred to as the moustache   bar".  The left and right end are  
attached to the frame using heavy rubber engine mounts.  The middle of  
the bar has 3 holes in a smiley face orientation. Below the crankshaft  
pulley the correct engine would have three tapped holes in the block.

Depending the the source vintage you may have one like I had.  It came  
with the oil pump cover type of adapter.

I looked at the block and there was a hole in the block at the 9  
o'clock position which was tapped.

There was a hole at the 3 o'clock position which was NOT tapped.

At the 6 o'clock position there was no hole BUT the block did have the  
enlarged area (boss) where a hole should have been

I tapped the 3 o'clock hole and I drilled and tapped the 9 o'clock  
hole - make sure you get the correct sizes - 9 and 3 are the same size  
but the one at 6 is smaller.

If your block doesn't have any holes don't drill until you are sure  
you have the 3 reinforced areas (bosses) otherwise you will probably  
do irreparable damage to the block.

Now don't use that adaptor plate - use the moustache bar.  The bar  
should have 3 big spacers attached to it to keep the bar at the  
correct distance from the engine.

I have no experience with the adapter plate other than removing it so  
I'll let someone else help you with that - good luck.
