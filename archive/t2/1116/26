New problem on the the 78 that has been sleeping for several years:  When 
you crank it over when cold, it either turns great, or slows down to the 
rrr,rr,rrreeer mode, then if you turn off the key and try again, it fires 
up.  Seems to maybe ping when you take off.  At full throttle, it surges as 
if it wants to go, but just can't.  Changed the spark plugs yesterday- the 
electrodes are clean, but the outer area has good amount of black soot. 
This is an FI motor with only 15k off the rebuild.

What should I do next?

thanks,

Dan
