We have a lace-up steering wheel cover as well.  It came with the bus

cover which
obviously was not big enough to fit the wheel so I cut it & slipped  
it on with the gap
at the 6 o'clock position then fitted the lace-up cover over the top  
& re-laced it.

The wheel now feels much more comfortable and easier to grip with  
probably
twice the rim diameter to hang on to.
