Subject: Fixed front main seal

 Hey,

Couple months ago I attempted to replace the main seal on my 69 Westy with a
non-pleasing result (about a quart of oil spewed out in seconds).

Finally got a chance today to pull the engine and redo everything.  I think I
figured out what went wrong.  The first kit I bought only had the seal that
goes on the case.  I completely forgot about the seal on the flywheel since it
was missing from the kit.

Today I replace both seals with new ones today and am happy to report that
(knock on the nearest piece of wood) NO MORE LEAKS!

 Ran it for about 30 to 40 minutes just to make sure. So far so good.

Thanks everyone for you input.

Brian
69 Westy
