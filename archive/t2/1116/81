Hi Greg,

I think they called it a station wagon to avoid the retaliatory tarriffs 
the US gov't put on foreign made trucks after the tax Germany placed on 
US grown chickens around 1963

If you can find a reference where VW refers to the bus as a station 
wagon BEFORE 1963, then this claim might not be valid, but otherwise I 
think that the use of the term "Station Wagon" to describe a type2 is 
just a US-market name-game...

Happy Trails,
