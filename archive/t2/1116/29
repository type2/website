Subject: 1970 camper - engine replacement

One more question regarding the stock studs supporting the oil pump cover
and the needed replacement (longer) studs I should replace to use
replacement flat oil pump cover and engine mount bracket....  The stock
studs in my new engine are M6.  The supplied longer (2") studs in the engine
mount bracket kit are M8, thread pitch 1.25.  The bolts supplied in the kit
are pitched 1.25.

I figure the stock M6 studs in this new engine would be thread pitch 1.0
because I, nor no none I speak with, has seen M6 stud with any pitch other
than 1.0.

I bought M6 nuts and nylon nuts (pitch 1.0).  They dont seem to fit on the
stock studs.  I planned to get longer m6 stds and replace the existing
shorter ones.  Are these stock studs installed in fact thread pitch 1.0?

Curious and confused and bamboozled.

Thanks in a big fat way,
