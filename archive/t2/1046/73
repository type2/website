Subject: RE: [T2] 1974 Bus Dash

I actually did this with a dash. I wish I had pictures. I welded up all of the holes, used som Bondo to smooth out the dimples in the welds, primed and painted it. I ended up selling it with my old bus but it looked just like the Euro ones. It is not a bad option if the padding on your dash is beyond repair.It was actually more of a pain-in-the-butt to remove the dash and keep all of the wiring and fasterners orgizined than it was to actually weld and paint the dash. That was the fun part.

 The dashes are actually different.
 American dashes have several foam extrusion holes punched
 in the metal
 stamping to allow the foam to be injected and expand. You
 will have to weld
 in blanks to fill the injection/extrusion holes. You can
 flip the dash
 upside-down and see where the foam shows through the
 injection/extrusion
 holes.
 
 Other than that, they are very similar and would fool most
 folks in thinking
 it is a Euro-spec dash.
