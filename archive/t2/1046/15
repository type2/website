Subject: RE: [T2] 1974 Bus Dash

Good luck.  I could not find anything for my 72 T2 either.  All I could
find was originals that were as cracked as the one I had.  If you find
something, let me know.

I WAS TOLD, the difference between Euro and US dashboards was that US
forced them to put the foam coating on them.  Also, that I could remove
the foam and finish the metal and reinstall and it would work just as
well.  I did just that and have a beautiful dashboard (Blue), but have
not installed it yet because I am working through all the botched
wiring.

Scrape off the foam, sand and paint.  That's what I did, it fits
mechanically as far as I can tell.

If anyone knows different, I guess I should be told before I put more
effort into it.

Good luck.

Paul
