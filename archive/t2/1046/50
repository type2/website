If you don't want to go to the trouble and expense of air conditioning, 
I found a reasonable solution.  Buy a small spray bottle and pump once 
onto each ear about every five minutes.  That and a small breeze will do 
wonders to cool you off.  I made it from Dallas to San Diego once in the 
dead of summer using this method.
