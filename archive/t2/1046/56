>>Hey All, I went to adjust the valves on my 1600 DP in my 71 Westy and
found that the #1 valves would not adjust. No matter how far I backed them
out, I could not get >>even the thinnest feeler gauge in there. Did a
compression check and I got ZERO compression on #1 but very good compression
on #2 (140 psi). T

Hey, John . . .  Take the rocker arm assemblies off the #1 & #2.  You will
see that #1 exhaust valve is somewhat higher than the other three.  All you
have to do is take an angle grinder to the tip of #1 exhaust valve stem
until it gets ground to the level of the other three valve stems.  You can
take a little off the keepers if you need to.  Use a little 60 emery paper
on the valve tip for a professional look.

With a little practice, you can get a decent fix.

At least, that's the way (I heard)  they did it at GEX, but they probably
had a lot of practice.
