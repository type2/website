	A modern electric car has (AC) motors in the wheel hubs  - 
quite readily all 4  -  and no transmission whatever.  Such motors, 
with the controllers available this past 2 decades, resemble steam 
engines in that you can spin the wheels at almost any speed.  No 
gearbox, let alone clutch, is needed for a smart takeoff from scratch.
	But for a retrofit, depending what type of motor(s) you 
choose, you may find it easier to keep the std VW transmission (i.e 
gearbox & clutch), as well as the diff.
	In Auckland a small firm retrofitted Fiat 127s with such a 
system.  It was even a DC motor, which no self-respecting 
technowanker would contemplate in a modern design.  But I believe it 
emitted less RF interference than some AC controllers do.  Range was 
only c.30 mi  -  so a 6 km round trip daily didn't require charging 
every night.
	There are several ways to slap electric drive into a T2. 
They will all give short range; but for many owners, that is not a 
serious drawback.
	It's the water, youse yanks will have heard; well that 
applies to what you slap into batteries too.  Very pure water is best.
	And the dominant theme remains: what batteries you use will 
make a big difference.
