Subject: Re: Powder coating

There must be a way to do it.. I think I have heard it refered to as 
E-coating..  is that the same.. electrostatic ??? 

They did my office furniture in place ,, over night.  I went home.. a 
contractor came in.. and in the morning,, my steel shelves ,, doors, etc 
were all painted to match ... all the did was slide some cardboard under 
them to protect the carpet.... there was no over spray.. or fumes... I 
wished I had seen the process...
