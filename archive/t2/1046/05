Subject: Headlights Not Working

Hello all,

Recently had to completely re-wire all rear lights on a 1971 T2. Bought the bus after a small electrical engine fire. 

Since, I have checked all existing wiring and all appears good. No burnt wires, fuses, etc...

Problem is both headlamps will not turn on. I'm 100% positive the lamps themselves are good after an ohmeter check. 

But...nothing. Any ideas?

Thanks,
