Hmmn although the compressor install pictured is nice on a T4 (assuming the
tin is removed only for clarity of the pic) those interior units for Buses are
an abomination to man as far as ugly, for the splittie or the Bay.  For a
split I'd rec finding a nice old classic chromed up under dash generic unit
off ebay (they kind of think JC Whitney would have sold you in the 70s or 80s)
and using these guys or ICE's compressor, for a bay a stock Cool or DPD
interior unit would be the only way to go, a couple on samba right now, some
dreaming $$, some about right $$.  If these guys are the "accepted leader in
VW A/C" I'd hate to see the runners up...  I do note BTW that the under dash
bay unit will really piss you off when you want under the dash for other
reasons.  Again, see my EV thought as well, comined with one of these guys
compressor installs...

is an option.  I'm picking one up; will likely document the install.
