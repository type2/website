Subject: Re: Headlights Not Working

My understanding is that the headlights are on a separate contact on the  
headlight switch, because they come on separately after the marker lights and  
such, so the headlight switch is one place to look.  Also, the headlights  are 
on separate fuses, so check those. too.
