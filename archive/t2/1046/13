Subject: Valves - seems loose, but isn't.  I'm confused.

Awhile back I adjusted my valves and the #3 exhaust was very loose almost to the point of not
being able to get it tightened down to the .006.  The consensus was that there is a dropped or
loose seat, bent rod or other issue.  

Checked it again today and it's still right at .006.  The thing is, there is A LOT of play in the
rocker arm.  The .006 feeler slides through perfect, the .008 doesn't fit but rocking the rocker
back and forth it feeeeeeels like it should be VERY loose.  I'm confused.  

Might it be the push rod rather than the valve after all??   

Thanks,
Steve
