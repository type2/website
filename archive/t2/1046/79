You too, eh?  My condo association wrote me up for having a dirty
concrete driveway.  If I didn't clean it up in 72 hrs they would
hold a hearing.
I told them it's just marking it's territory.  Wrong answer.

Just keep at it.  If you are worried about toxic spills from the
cleaner(s), put rolls of cheap paper towels at the bottom of the
driveway to soak it up.  Bag the dirty towels and recycle them.
