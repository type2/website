Subject: Cleaning my driveway.

Just wanted to know if anyone has a surefire way to clean all the stains off
my driveway and get it back to looking nice? I have been scrubbing it with
Purple Power and a wire brush, but the soaked in stains are still there.

Any suggestions to make my driveway look like I really DON'T owe a 33 year
old VW?
