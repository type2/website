Subject: Fuel Flo Electric fuel pump problem

Good Day, eh?  I was about to install a Fuel Flo electric pump in my '74
westy, when by the "magic" of clamity, I was able to drop the pump not once,
but twice, on the garage concrete floor, and better than Las Vegas odds, broke
the inlet and outlet fuel nipples, clean off both ends!!  I have managed to
"cement" a brass barbed fitting to the inlet end, but there is very little
"purchase" to hold anything to the outlet end, since it is an 'interference'
fit between the pump innards and the exit.  I was thinking I would "cement"
the exit with another barbed brass fitting, using the same cement, but am now
not so sure, so, thought I would throw out the problem to the list for ideas.
No, I don't want to buy another pump.  Thanks.
