Subject: Re: Tranny adapter plate size

why waste the HP thru the trans and diff... drive the rear wheel directly 
off the motor... you might use a drive shaft to allow the motor to be 
mounted to the body... 

also... once you pull the motor.. and you still want to mount it to the 
bellhousing.. pull the bellhousing off and use it as a template to drill 
your holes....
my suggestion for the adapter... spin the plate in a lathe.. marking the 
center.. and the diameter of any bolt patterns... ie the motor , and the 
trans ... and put a small lip on it to simulate the lip that is on the VW 
engine.. then you can slip the bellhousing over that lip,, and use transfer 
punches to mark the bolt pattern for the trans..
you can use the circle to plot the motor mounting bolts... and keep in mind 
you have to use an input shaft coupling ... most of them are in a cage that 
is also a mount ... I am thinking of all the hydraulic pumps I have seen 
mounted to a gas engine...
good luck!   I can't afford the batteries or my electic vw would be on the 
road.
