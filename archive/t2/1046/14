Subject: Re: [T2] Valves - seems loose, but isn't. I'm confused.

When I had my 73 with solid lifters I got so good at adjusting the
valves I could tell when I was spot on by the distance the rocker was
able to travel.

They moved freely as if they were on a polished lubricated steel shaft.

Which they are.

Have you done a compression check? If your compression's fine, and
you're adjusting properly, don't worry about how freely the rocker
moves.

Unless it moves from side to side, in which case you have other problems.
