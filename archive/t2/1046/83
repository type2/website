Subject: RE: [T2] Cleaning my driveway.

Once you get all the excess up with kittly litter or such, the best way I have
found with concrete is good old Muratic acid.  It's very inexpensive and can
be found at the local hardware store.  Be careful, however, Muratic acid is
highly volatile and will have fumes.  After the muratic acid has got the spots
up, use soapy water, with a power washer if you have access, and, if anything,
the newly cleaned space may only be noticeable by the fact that it is cleaner
than the rest of the area.

My driveway (most of it) is asphalt.  Power washer gets most but if it is real
noticeable I guess I can always "reseal" the asphalt (basically painting it
with tar).

Good luck!  :-)

Peace,

Michael in Montevallo
