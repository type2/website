You know, when most cars catch on fire, it is covered by something called
COMPREHENSIVE, not the collision part of the insurance policy.  .

Most insurance companies attribute this to an 'act of God'

But in your case, I think God was trumped by stupidity.

Sorry for this; I know it is improper, but hell, no one reads my posts
anyway....  I'm going to have to start signing my posts with 'Karl' or
'Richard'
