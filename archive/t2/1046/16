The dashes are actually different.
American dashes have several foam extrusion holes punched in the metal
stamping to allow the foam to be injected and expand. You will have to weld
in blanks to fill the injection/extrusion holes. You can flip the dash
upside-down and see where the foam shows through the injection/extrusion
holes.

Other than that, they are very similar and would fool most folks in thinking
it is a Euro-spec dash.

Good luck.  I could not find anything for my 72 T2 either.  All I could
find was originals that were as cracked as the one I had.  If you find
something, let me know.

I WAS TOLD, the difference between Euro and US dashboards was that US
forced them to put the foam coating on them.  Also, that I could remove
the foam and finish the metal and reinstall and it would work just as
well.  I did just that and have a beautiful dashboard (Blue), but have
not installed it yet because I am working through all the botched
wiring.

Scrape off the foam, sand and paint.  That's what I did, it fits
mechanically as far as I can tell.

If anyone knows different, I guess I should be told before I put more
effort into it.

Good luck.

Paul
