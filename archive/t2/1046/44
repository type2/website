You could drive the halfshafts via a belt and get some gear reduction at 
the same time, but of course you would need two motors, and there is the 
problem of picking a ratio that provides adequate torque when starting 
AND sufficient top speed.  This might be possible if you're happy with a 
45mph top speed, but I don't think freeway speeds are possible with a 
single ratio, especially if you ever had to take off up a hill.
