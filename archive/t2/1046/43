    The driveway oil and grease remover from your local home center works...
    Just use a stiff bristle brush to work it into the stain and then cover 
it with
    the cat litter looking stuff for grease and oil stains...The grease 
remover
    emulsifies the stain and the cat litter pulls it out of the asphalt... 
;-)

    BTW, how much DO you owe your 33 year old VW... ?-)
