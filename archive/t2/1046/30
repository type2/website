   Just curious...What're you planning on using for a motor? I'm on another 
list and a guy
   is seriously considering this conversion for a small kit car...He's come 
up with plans but
   the cost of materials - motor, batteries, controller, etc. has him in the 
$5-10,000 range,
   depending on the type of battery, mostly...Still only a 50 mile or so 
range... ;-(
