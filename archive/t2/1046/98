I use a hyd transmission jack with a modified base to raise and lower
my engine... the problem with lifting a VW engine is there are not a
whole lot of places to grab onto..

the way I did it for a friend who had a dune buggy was to use a "T"
handle shifter with a sliding second "T" the rode on the shifter and
used twin Vanagon slave cyl to reduce the effort, a motor cycle cable
would probably also work "BUT" you would need to be really strong.

I don't think I would remove any of the springs, maybe put in "weaker"
springs but you would want it even presure all the way round.

I have an automatic in my 78 bus, with HPBus dropped floor.
