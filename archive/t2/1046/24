Subject: RE: 1974 Bus Dash

Jeff, I don't know where you are located or if you would be interested in
buying a bay window dash. But I have had one in my barn for years that does
not have any cracks in it and I have been saving it to put on a bay window
someday. If you are interested in buying it let me know (pmail). I am in
Grand Rapids, MI and you would have to pick it up. I have a ton of bus parts
and I am to the point if someone gave me an offer for everything I would
sell them. I have been saving this stuff for too many years and haven't used
it. It's time to pass it on.  

Wishing you many miles of smiles!

Is there a book or anything describing how to take out the dash for
re-covering? Anyone know of an upholsterer where bus dashes are repaired?
