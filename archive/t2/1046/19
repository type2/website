Subject: linkage / transaxle opportunity maintenance?

Hey volks.  A recent post about shifter couplings got me trolling the archives and thinking about what I should look at replacing when I drop my transaxle in the next couple of months.  I won't bore you with the "why" I'm dropping it.  Anyway, its coming out, and I have the opportunity to replace linkage components or whatever while I'm there.
I saw BusDepot has a linkage bushing kit ($15) that appears to have "the commonly needed replacement bushings for your VW bus shifter".  Ok.  Neat.  Is this a worthwhile effort?  The bus was shifting fine the last time I drove it, and my usual rule of "ain't broke don't fix it" tells me to leave well enough alone or I'll make something worse before I make anything better.  This theory is battling with my interest to get ahead of the curve on maintenance on something that you can only do when the transaxle is out.  Classic impasse. 
So, opinions welcome.  CV joints?  bushing replacement?  Scrape out the crud above the transaxle and spray that rubbery undercoating junk up there?  Replace the 4yr old tranny oil?  Put racing stripes on it?  Other ideas?
