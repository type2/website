Someone flipped their manifolds around and built a custom exhaust to simplify
the complex system on 75-78's. I'm sick of all the hard to locate pieces etc,
so not needing heat exchangers is fine with me. Would whoever has done this,
send me a link to some pics, so I can put one together.
Thanks,
Courtney
