I've had good luck with kitty litter although it's "labor intensive" 
unless you are dealing with a pool of oil.  Give this a try  to see if 
it helps.

The method:

I have  old Birkenstock shoes which work great - big, flat, somewhat 
rigid, smooth soles.  Put a suitable handful of the kitty litter on an 
oil spot and with one foot press down on the k.l. and imagine yourself 
doing "the twist" and grind the k.l. into the pavement with the ball of 
your foot.  As the k.l. becomes pulverized it starts to work better - or 
at least that's my opinion.  Apply and work in a necessary, then 
remove.  Advanced method - get both feet working at the same time.  
Super advanced level -  break out your Chubby Checker albums and have a 
party, making sure the condo rules committee is invited :-)

 AutoZone sells ($10) drip trays, about  3ft x 4ft, and any of the 
sweepings go into one of the trays, helping to clean up them.
