Subject: RE: [T2] Shift Coupler

Jim,

The sleeve and the cage should move as one unit. The newer aftermarket units
are welded, the older original and some poor reproduction examples are
stamped together. If the stamping fails, the sleeve will move, but the cage
won't (so it won't turn the input shaft).

You can weld the defective one, or get a welded unit to replace it.

Subject: [T2] Shift Coupler

I think my new shift coupler is defective but I didn't keep the old one to
compare it to.  The main part of the coupler is a kind of box shaped cage
with a round sleeve coming out of it.  The round sleeve fits over the shaft
coming out of the transmission.  Sorry about my terminology.

The problem is that the sleeve can rotate about 15 or 20 degrees relative to
the box.  It looks like the sleeve and the box should one rigid piece but
it's not.  Am I correct?  Should there not be any play?

Assuming I am, I'm going to ask the vendor for a replacement but, in the
mean time I wonder if I can use a punch to stake the sleeve so it doesn't
rotate.  Good idea? bad idea?

Thanks for your help.  It's a '74 Westfalia with a stock manual
transmission.

Jim
