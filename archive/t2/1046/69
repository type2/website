Subject: Re: [T2] One more time - who reversed their manifolds and built

Sorry Greg.  Had no intention of stealing all the credit  :)  Mine are  
quite loud as well, but I doubt the noise is at the awesome level that  
would be your Harley mufflers  :)  It is loud enough though, that we  
have all grown a bit tired of it being as noisey as it is.

There was also talks about possibly having a loss in torque due to  
less back pressure in the exhaust system.  I don't have the education  
to comment on that, but here in the Rockies, it's hard not to think  
about whether or not it's a factor.  Maybe someone else can chime in  
on that.
