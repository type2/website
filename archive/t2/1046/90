Subject: 78 Gas tank woes

Hi all,

When I stored my bus last fall I had a leaky hose between the fuel filter
and the fuel pump (78 2L FI Boston Bob engine). So I fixed that and planned
to pull all the hoses off when I brought her out of hibernation (which turns
out to be now, which is very late, but I've been traveling). I put her up on
the lift last night, only to find that it isn't the hoses leaking (which I
changed about 8 years ago, so they need to be done anyway) but it is
actually the tank that is leaking. Some history: About 8 or 10 years ago I
was having the dreaded rusty fuel filter problem, so I pulled the tank,
cleaned it with acid, and planned to use POR 15 Gas Tank Coating. But after
the acid, I inspected the tank and found pinholes around the fuel inlets. I
took an epoxy putty and packed it around them, then sealed the tank, and it
seemed to hold. Until now.

So, long story longer, the question is, what do I do now? I could try the
easy route, and pry off the old epoxy and put new stuff in there. I know
that would only be a temporary fix again, and I'm not wild about the stress
of worrying when it's going to give. I could pull this tank, and see if I
can have it welded up, I could get a new used tank and redo it. Or I could
get a brand new tank, but from what I remember, these don't actually exist.
Or, as my mechanic says, we could have a tank made.

One other thought is to do the temp fix, and at the same time, order a tank
and get it prepared. She's going in this winter for her full body massage
and a new coat of paint, so I could pull the tank then.

Thoughts? Advice? Slander?
