Subject: RE: [T2] Can an engine lose compression from sitting?

Even with the cylinders being dry for a while, there will be some
compression, unless the exhaust valves are rusted open or fully dropped.

My suspicion is your motor is shot, that is why it was parked.

Beware of the quote, "it ran when I parked it". Every bus I have rescued
with this premise, the motor was toast.

Subject: [T2] Can an engine lose compression from sitting?

I am working on a 77 Westfalia Automatic with the stock engine and it does
not
have compression on two cylinders and around 50 on the other two.  It's been
sitting for several years.  When I did my compression check I did not squirt
oil in the cylinders. I was thinking of trying that.  The engine was out of
the Westfalia when I bought it because the guy was going to put carbs on it
but now am wondering if there is more to his story that I wasn't told. So
what
do you think?  Any and all help will be appreciated.
Thanks,
Kevin
