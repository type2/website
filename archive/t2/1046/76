Some other thoughts folks, a Eurovan rear evaporator unit is a REAL slick
little unit, entirely self contained, about 12x5x10 inches probably, with a
very high power blower, has 134A expansion valve, etc.  I can't actually
believer that the street rod folks (who pay like $500 for just the evaporator
units for their custom installs) haven't latched onto these for
retrofits.  I've kept a couple from parters for thinking about custom
installs.  They live in the right rear of a EV, just rip off the trim cover
and a couple bolts pull them out.  That plus a little compact Subaru
compressor, the air pump pulley system, and a little ingenuity would make a
REAL nice little system.  I figure you could mount the evaporator/blower under
the back seat in a camper and route it to the underseat heat distribution
outlet in reverse, if you rigged a little one way flapper valve inline before
the main heat distribution box so that air from it went forward only
 (some years have such anyway in various locations) you would have A/C out
your stock middle and front floor ducts as well as your dash for defrosting,
PLUS you would be pulling the warmest air from the back into it for a nice
recirculating system.  I've junked 3 EVs without keeping these, kept a couple,
probably would only go $20-30 in a pick and pull.  FWIW I looked on ICE
systems limited WWW site and they don't mention a T4 setup anymore (though I
think they once did.)
