Hi Courtney,

Well, one of those guys is me. I got the local harley dude to weld these up.

They are quite loud. Really obnoxiously loud. I ran them for about six 
weeks before I got tired of them. Then I put them on a year later, for 
another six weeks.

Maybe they'd be quieter if they had baffles in them.
