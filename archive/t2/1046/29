Subject: Tranny adapter plate size

Volks, I'm in the process of converting my '79 9 seater to a fully electric vehicle. To do that, I basically pull the 2L engine and mount up an electric motor in it's stead. I haven't pulled the engine yet, but I want to keep my eyes open for something that will work as an adapter plate. Could anyone with a later 70's tranny out just measure, in an X, the eye to eye distance between the bolt holes, and then the distance in a square? It doesn't need to be exact, like down to the .0004 or anything. 
If you are interested in seeing what a converted bus looks like, search for Electric VW bus on Youtube. That's not mine, but it will be similar. 
Thanks,
Joel
