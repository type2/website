Subject: Re: [T2] 78 Gas tank woes

I bought a used FI tank said to be in excellent condition, and to the eye, it
looked brand new.  Upon installation and filling, there appeared tiny, tiny
pinholes in the inlet and outlet pipes at the bottom of the tank.  I was able
to snug the fuel line up the pipe to cover one of the pinholes in one of the
pipes but not the other.  I will pull the tank and use JB weld to fix both of
them.  The area where hose clamps are used on these inlet/outlet pipes on FI
tanks gets weak over the years due to water settling in the bottom of the tank
and road grime from the outside.  Bottom line:  Even though a tank may appear
to be in excellent condition, check those fuel inlet/outlet pipes closely
prior to installation.
