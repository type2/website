NOVA - Northern Virginia

As I start cleaning up my 'stash', I think I am not going to offer any more
FREE items on this list.  I get a derth of responses for a local pickup at
Springfield VA.  And no, I am not going to send this stuff over to Dolan for
him to put in his garage....  He is full up as is!!  The last successful
give-a-way I had was for seven early bay seats, and 12 wheels on rims, and I
think THAT may have been on the samba.

The wife's new rules are, if it does not fit on my current project right
now, or it cannot be fitted as a replacement, then it has to be 'solved'.  I
will not be allowed another VW, even the '64 camper that I crave.

My extra set of wheels have to be solved, the 68-71 rear bumper brackets
with splash plates have to be solved, the '72 only rear bumper brackets, the
pop top canvas with two slight rips because I was careless in taking the pop
top off, the extra mosquito nets for the pop tops, and on and on...
Particularly the Sapphire radios, even the 6 volt Sapphire I radio.

I will offer them on some auction site or craigslist and charge for
shipping, and maybe someone might be interested.

Otherwise, in the trash they go....  to enjoy the same fate as  the 2.0
head...

But if ANYONE out there of repute (Karl, Richard, David, Mike, and the list
goes on) is starting a MUSEUM of old, 'rare', NLA or NOS VW bus items, I
would like to contribute.  PM me off line...

However, this stuff that is not to be sold or given away, except to enrich
another MUSEUM of VW *memorabilia * .  Like a VW  trailer hitch, or a
Bentley with color wire diagrams, or wheel cylinder (brake) rear rebuild
kits,
