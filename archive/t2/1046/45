I know that during the winter there is a lot of talk about how to stay warm
in your bus. However, At this time of year, keeping warm isn't the concern.
Now I know that someone like Uncle Jerry would tell me that I don't know
what "hot" is, being that we have so many fine folks in AridZona driving in
115 degrees, but the question I believe is still valid...

Is there anything that anyone is doing to combat heat during the summer
drive? Living in Denver, it has been in the 90s lately and it is to a point
that I am almost afraid to take my son out in the Hornet because he might
get heat exhaustion. I am dealing with it alright, but it sure is making me
jealous of that car next to me with that nice cool A/C.

Just curious.
