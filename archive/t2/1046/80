hehehehe... ;)

and you know, on top of that, I think any person on this list would feel 
very uncomfortable giving advise other than what was already given as we 
do care about our buses so much.  This is one of those things that can 
endanger you, your bus, and the general public, so do the right thing 
and find a proper fix or buy a new pump.
