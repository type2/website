Subject: RE: [T2] Cleaning my driveway

Jason, is your driveway (1) asphalt, (2) concrete, or (3) other

If it is concrete and you can get to a satisfactory condition, perhaps you
could seal the driveway, or paint it with comparable color garage floor
paint, stuff that is oil resistant.  Quite expensive, though.

I had a parking spot in my apartment bldg, and my old car had a terrible
leak.  The oil had weakened the asphalt so much that the asphalt started
coming apart in pieces.  Only one year....

I don't know the impact on concrete, though.  Perhaps others had experience.
