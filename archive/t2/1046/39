Subject: Rave!

I just had to take a moment and rave about the Restore stuff I got at Pep
Boys for my last oil change. I have been having a little issue with loosing
oil and it just getting beat to hell. I just checked my oil for the first
time in about 1000 and not only does my oil still look good, but the oil
level hasn't dropped. I also noticed that I am not dripping next to anything
anymore.

Just wanted to share.
