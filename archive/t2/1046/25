sell it and see what the market will pay.

but aside from that the value is somewhere between $100 and $10,000 most 
likely.  A good solid rust free bus in Colorado is worth between $2000 
and $6000 generally.  That same bus in New York may be worth 50% more. 
It's really hard to say without pictures and more details.  Search our 
the sale price of similar buses in your area on craigslist.

good luck.
