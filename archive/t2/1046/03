Subject: ICABOD Camp Out - Aug 15-17

Hey Volks,

I just wanted to invite everyone to the 2nd annual ICABOD camp out.  It 
will be taking place 4 weeks from today and all campers are invited (you 
don't have to own a Westy, etc).  Right now I am thinking we should 
shoot for camping spots 13-20 as the "first come first serve" sites are 
also on that road.  I will be reserving my site next week (when I get 
paid) and will be getting sites 17-18 so please plan around that.

Hope to see you there!

Andrew



*August 15, 2008 - August 17, 2008 - ICABOD Campout *
*/ Iowa City/Mt. Vernon, Iowa /* 	


I wanted to invite everyone to the Second Annual ICABOD (Iowa City Area 
Bug/Bus Occursion in the Dale ) Camp out held in the Valley of the Cedar 
River - Palisades-Kepler State Park in Linn County, Iowa August 
15th-17th. Come out to camp in a beautiful park located on the Cedar 
River just outside Mt. Vernon/Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

Reservations can be made for either electric or non-electric spots 
starting May 15th via the Iowa DNR Reservation Website 
(https://eservices.iowa.gov/iowaparks/index.php). Prices are $16 for 
electric sites and $11 for non-electric sites. In addition, there are 12 
electric and 9 Non-electric sites on a first-come-first-server basis. 
Modern shower and restroom facilities are available, as well as a dump 
station. Please make reservations as soon as possible and pmail me for a 
site suggestion.  I would like to have all of the VWs in one area but we 
cannot reserve an entire section - just site by site.

There are both dock and trail activities available. A dock to the Cedar 
River is available for boating and fishing is available on the river 
banks. Trails include a variety of wildlife, scenic views, and 
exploration of Indian Mounds.

We will once again be traveling to the Bi-State VW Club 13th Annual Show 
and Shine Picnic located in Hamption IL on Sunday Aug 17th.  Attendance 
to the show is not required but there will be a caravan traveling from 
the camp out to the show on Sunday morning.  This is a very worth-while 
show and I would like to bring a stronger showing to their events.  The 
drive is about 80miles from the camp site on Hwy 30.  More information 
can be found at http://home.mchsi.com/~bistatevw/picnic2008.htm

Directions - ATTENTION:  State Highway 1 is closed between Mt. Vernon 
and Solon IA due to flood.  Please do not take this route and please 
follow the route listed below.


Feel free to google/mapquest this address. It is in the correct location

700 Kepler Dr
Mt Vernon, IA 52314


Basic Directions from I-80: Take Exit 239B and head North towards Cedar 
Rapids for about 17 miles. At the intersection of Interstate 380 and 
Highway 30, head East 9 miles. Turn right onto Kepler Drive and into the 
park. The entrance of the park is in a grove of trees and is difficult 
to see. However, that grove of trees is the only cluster of trees on the 
highway.  From the East,  take  Hwy 30 West.  The park is about 4 miles 
West of Mt. Vernon IA.

Feel free to respond to me with any questions or clarification requests. 
I will make any further information available as it becomes available.

Hope to see everyone on Aug. 15th!
