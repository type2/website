Be aware of the draw backs:

(1) The alternator bracket needs a place at the end to be fastened to the
heat exchangers.  Without the heat exchangers, your alternator bracket is
only fastened at TWO places, at the alternator's adjustable bolt,  and at
the top where it is fastened to the fan housing.

(2) FI models need an EGR filter to be technically correct for inspections.
These imaginative exhaust versions do not allow for the EGR filter. (Test
question: What carburetor VW bus yearl also needs an EGR filter??)

(3) The basic VW bus discards the exhaust to the side, to the passenger
side.  It does NOT discard the exhaust to the CENTER of the bus.  VW
engineering is correct on this one, do you agree??

(4) You will have problems backing up when you go to a VW bus campout.
(There is bound to be some VW aficionado underneath the rear of your VW bus,
trying to take pictures of your exotic exhaust so they can duplicate the
same.)

(5) Backing up over someone is considered less that good in some circles,
but not necessarily at VW bus campouts, so ignore warning #4

Is today Friday??
