Subject: Estimated Value

Hello all again,

I'm wondering what the best way is to discover the value of my bus. I realize there are probably a lot of you that have been around T2s for years that could give me a reasonable estimate. I on the other hand have only been an owner since March this year. 

This is simply a curiosity question and I would appreciate any help. 

Cheers,

Taylor
