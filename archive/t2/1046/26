kbb.com only went back to 1988

nadaguides.com went back to the forties.  I popped in "1973 Volkswagen 
Transporter Campmobile" and it came up with the following values:

Low Retail: $7,400
Avg Retail: $13,800
High Retail: $23,800

That can't possibly be right, at least not in my neck of the woods...
