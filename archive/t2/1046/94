hmmm,  I was always told that JB weld would hold up to gasoline.  I used it on
a Karmann Ghia tank once with no problems.  does anyone have more info or
opinions on this?  Greg

That's the exact problems I had. I'm
wondering if I can do a temp fix with a marine grade epoxy (my mechanic says
jb weld will break down with gas) and either find a good used tank or have it
brazed. Is that an option?
