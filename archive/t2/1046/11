Subject: Re: [T2] question about r&r bay window doors

"Walkthrough" refers to a bus where there is space between the two
front bucket seats that allows you to walk through to the rear
passenger area. 99.9% of all bay window ('68-'79) buses fit this
description. I've never seen a non-walkthrough Bay, but I'm sure
they're out there.

Non-walkthroughs are more typical in the split-window era ('49-'67),
where you couldn't get from the front bench seat to the rear passenger
section without climbing over the divider/backrest. For split window
buses, walkthroughs are less common.

What you're looking for is a "Double-Door" meaning two cargo doors on
each side of the bus.

This should help you in your search for parts.
