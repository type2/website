Thanks for the info. The alternator bracket will have to be looked at; the 
EGR doesn't matter around here, we don't have a smog test. Hell, we don't 
have smog, so I'll create some. :-)
Seriously though, I didn't know about the alt bracket; I will look at the 
configuration. I'm just really sick of this stupid 77 exhaust system with 
all the gaskets and rusting flanges that need constant attention. I even 
painted them in rust preventive paint and it didn't help, with the heating 
and cooling cycles I guess. Oh well.

I envision a system similar to the S&S aftermarket header system, but with 
shorter runners to the center collector. From there it would use a standard 
S&S single quiet power muffler (since the flanges all match up) or 
aftermarket less restrictive muffler. I'm not interested in a dual muffler 
system; too noisy. Any input would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Courtney



 Be aware of the draw backs:

 (1) The alternator bracket needs a place at the end to be fastened to the
 heat exchangers.  Without the heat exchangers, your alternator bracket is
 only fastened at TWO places, at the alternator's adjustable bolt,  and at
the top where it is fastened to the fan housing.
