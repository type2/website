Subject: Hoist Lifting my motor

Greetings!

I'm new to the list and glad for it.  What a wealth of info in a steady 
stream, even tho it's trivia now, I can feel my brain fattening up on 
info I'll put to good use someday.

Today's issue is about using a hoist to lift the motor for my VW powered 
trike.  I'm a wheelchair using fella, so most brute force methods are 
kaput.  How do I safely strap, hook or attach to the motor to lift it 
with my chain hoist?  Me and a pal manhandled it out and I am not doing 
that again, my wrist still hurts...

While I am at it, how about I throw a question out that is sure to spark 
controversy?  I want to have a hand clutch that I can mount on the 
shifter.  I am looking into the obvious methods using brake boosters and 
slave cylinders until I get my AutoStick serviceable (hard to find info 
on those by the way).  It has bees suggested that I could remove a third 
of the springs in the clutch assembly to reduce the force I need to 
apply.  This kibbitzer said that the lighter load of the trike frame 
would allow this arrangement to work in an acceptable manner.  Any comments?

Thanks in advance,
