Subject: No valve movement

Last week I wrote the list about no compression from a long sitting engine.
Today I pulled the valve covers off and watched no movement from my valves or
push rods as the engine was turning over.  The heads are bolted down tightly
along with the rocker arms.  The rotor spins in the distributor.  Does anyone
have any ideas?  I can't believe the camshaft could be that bad that none of
the valves are opening and closing?  Again all help would be appreciated.
Thanks, Kevin
