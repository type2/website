if "it was shifting fine" then leave the stock shift rod bushings (look like a badminton shuttlecock).  last I have seen all the repro rod bushings are really poor casting quality, it is difficult to trim them to fit (and I failed at this).  replace the easier bushing up front, you can pull the center rod and grease it but if it was working you really don't want to mess around with the stock bushings.

sure, change the fluid with NAPA Sta-Lube GL4. if you are getting any weeping of fluid, you could change the seals.  before removing CV axles, check for radial play, then after removing, go ahead and repack them with moly / German CV grease and they will last a long time.
