I don't have a darn to clue about any of this but FWIW I still have a
set of German ATE rotors that a seller assured me were '73-'79
rotors and ended up being '71-'72 parts if anyone out there wants
to buy them off me.  I'll take whatever Bus Depot wants currently
for south american, nice rotors, chance of me ever needing them
is sort of slim.  I will trade them even up for even a set of quality
brembo or the like '73-'79 rotors BTW, not for south american though
likely.

Anyway hate to steal the subject, but WTF.
