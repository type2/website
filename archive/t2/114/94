Mark,

Since you don't have 'excess' crankcase pressure you probably don't have a
hole in you piston. With a compression reading of ZERO you probably have a
really bad burned exhaust valve. It's not your intake valve - your engine
would have a hard time running with a lot of back-flow into your intake
manifold. And yes, you need to drop the engine.

Good luck!
