Subject: Glove Box- Enlarge it!

In my 78 Westy I always mourned the fact that a road atlas doesn't fit
in the glove box unless you fold it.  When I had the box out to play
with the wipers, I redesigned this by putting a piece of plywood
paneling between the rear (that lip above the air scoop stuff) and the
lip of the dash inder the glove box door.  Then glue velvet over
cardboard that was bend, cut, and fitted to the entire space, interloped
only at the left by the air duct to the dash heating vent.  Looks good,
holds the Bentley, atlases and a 3 ring binder plus a group of
magazines..  I can send a pic off list if interested.
