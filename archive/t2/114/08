Though I may not agree with the way another repairs his bus, I will be the 
last one to criticize his efforts.  As long as they aren't life threatining 
shortcuts I will stand by and watch.  Even the idiots guide states as your 
"bread allows".  Let's just be glad they are on the road and that we have a 
chance to keep them going however we make it possible.  Now  I'm the kind of 
guy that loves to do it as right as possible and spend lots of money getting 
there, I am still not in the (trailer trophy) category.  So however you keep 
it running, on whatever budget you have grab those zip ties, bread ties, coat 
hangers and whatever else it takes, and get busy. See ya on the road......
