Subject: blue bus on hwy 60

Hello all, My family and I  was traveling west saturday morning (in our 
silver '87 VW Vanagon) to see my parents, on US Highway 60 in southern 
Missouri and came upon a blue VW Bus with a white top. I followed the 
bus quite a way until I had to turn off on Highway 17 right before 60 
goes into Mountain View, Missouri. Was it anyone on this list?
Thanks, Tony
