Subject: vanagon seats

Hello
Would a passenger seat from a 1980 Vanagon fit in the drivers side seat
track
of a '77 standard bus?

I'm confused on what year seats do and do not fit, and if the passenger and
drivers side seats are interchangeable. Anyone know the exact years?
My driver side and pass side seats are interchangeable I've found so I dont
see
why this would be a problem. Although someone mentioned in the archive that
the seats tracks are not the same though, maybe they were talking about a
westy though.

thanks in advance
Alex Wisniewski
