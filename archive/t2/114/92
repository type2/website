Subject: Glove box Question

I found the glove box for my 75 bus hiding behind the passenger seat.
It's a little warped and has a small tear in it but I think I can repair
it. My problem is I cant figure out what is supposed to hold it on the
back side of the dash. Is there supposed to be some kind of clips or
something that fell off or was removed by the P.O.?
Any info is appreciated in advance. Pictures might help considering
there is nothing there now.
Thanks,
Tom
