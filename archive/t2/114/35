Hello all,
I drive a '73 Transporter (Manufacture date 11/72), manual transmission, =
carbureted (dual), and it's got a nasty oil leak. I noticed the old girl =
had been "marking her spot" a little more than she should, but unwisely =
chose to ignore it, until this weekend when I adjusted the timing and =
noticed a four inch diameter puddle of fresh oil on the cement, and =
decided I should address the issue. The leak seems to be concentrated on =
the front (meaning front) driver side of the engine, around cylnder #4. =
But the entire underside of the block is so soaked that I'm not positive =
that's where its happening. I had originally thought it was the oil =
cooler, and the oil was just dripping through everything and down, but =
upon closer inspection I realized that the oil cooler looks dry, and =
doesn't appear to be leaking. So now I'm at a loss, perhaps the oil =
filter? Any ideas, comments, tips, help at all, is greatly appreciated. =
Thanks in advance.
