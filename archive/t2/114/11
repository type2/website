With me, the path of least resistance is a governing "law"-, ie, what
works right now vs what will work after waiting for parts, futzing with
things that won't come apart or match,......
An example many are aware of: a heater cable end breaks off.  The bolt
with the gripping end is likely on the road somewhere. Wanting immediate
heat and being lazy, I grab the needlenose pliers, put a nice bend in
the cable bit that's left, bridge it with a loop of (house wiring endies
I have lots of- flexible, can't rust)) looped through the flapper box
lever end, and voila all works.  Eventually the looped end may break,
and then to get heat, one just wires open the flapperbox.  Come spring
or you can't stand the excess heat, unwire the box.  I have this dream
of simpley running choke cabling from the flapperboxes through the wall
under the rear seatbed and installing handle pulls to allow easier
control.  Someday I'll buy the cable and wrestle with the levers under
the dash, the rusty guides, buying the right grabber bolt, etc........
