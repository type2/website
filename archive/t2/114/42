Subject: Re: [T2] bus towbar??

What year is your bus?  Those tow bars only worked for 70 down buses.  And
unfortunately the man who made those passed away recently so all that is
left are what he left behind.  Jerry Jess may be able to help you find one
as he lives near where the guy used to.

As for 73 and later I have found tow bars that bolt right into the holes
that hold the bumper in, seems to work well.(none for sale all homemade
though) As for 71 and 72 the only way I have found to tow them is with a
dolly...  As I did this weekend with my 71 Single cab.  To see a pic of the
dolly or to read about our adventures.  go to
