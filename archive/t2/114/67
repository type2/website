Jason,
    You said..."Yesterday, I was out for a drive in my 1979 Westy, and I got
pulled over for speeding.........Fortunately, I got off with a written
warning"

If I were in your shoes, I'd have that warning plastic laminated and then
put it in a frame.  Who woulda ever thunk an old loaf could go that fast?
Your friends won't believe you, your parents won't believe you, and I'm not
sure I believe you! (yes I do)   :-)
    Now all that being said, be careful.
