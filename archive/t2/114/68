Subject: Sliding Door Handle

The outer sliding door handle on my bus has a thoroughly mangled lock (I =
can see springs and tumblers pointing in all the wrong directions if I =
look in the key hole).  Is there a way to  install a new lock into the =
existing handle or am I better off looking for a different handle with a =
key.  Its a 71 btw.
