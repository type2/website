You can get a shit extender. This is a piece of medal maybe about 12 
inches long and bent at a 30 degree angle in the middle. It has a threaded 
feaml end and a threaded male end. You unscrew the knob on the shifter, 
screw on a lock nut, and then the shift extender. Orient it in the right 
direction and then lock it in place with the lock nut. Then screw the knob 
back onto the top. I have one on my bus that I got from the guy that sold 
e my westy tent. He had it in a box with a bunch of parts, and when he saw 
I didn't have one, he threw it in for free. :) Now when I shift I don't 
have to tkae my back off of the seat.
