Have you checked out your points & timing? Also I would really double
check any vacuum leaks. You can check these out by letting it run &
using starting fluid, spray it in areas. If it speeds up you have a

shoot, i should have read further. My leak was where the throttle
connects to the intake manifold. I would try here and also where the
manifold and the runners connect.
