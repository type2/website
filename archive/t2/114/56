Sears has a fuel pressure gauge for $40.  After
I bought that, I ran across the same one at FLAPS
for a few dollars cheaper.  I didn't really want
to spend that much but what's done is done and
next time I need one I'll have it.

Go to www.partsamerica.com and search for part number
CP7818, that's the some one that Sears carries.
