Subject: Re: [T2] Busted for Speeding!

I was cruising east for a New Year surf, having recently had a new engine
fitted, and kept up with a freinds Ford Galaxy Turbo deisel... at 70 mph....
he shot off over the hills in Devon (south west UK)... he had only got out
of the car and was stretching when we caught up with him at the Surfed Out
shop in Saunton..... the look of suprise on his face.... and the body of my
van in such a mess...  (http://www.wognum.co.uk/breeze01.html take a look at
the painted bus.... no the one with too many colours)...  Still the guys in
the surf shop spent an hour pouring over it while I poured over their
Baja....
