Subject: Brand New Prob w/ bus, (new valve tick and loss of power)

Ok everybody,  I get a handle on one problem and
shucks, soon as I figure what I have to do, a new one
starts up.

New problem,  I had a sudden brand new, loud valve
tick.  This was literally all of a sudden, driving
down the road.  I stopped as soon as I could, and with
all the leaks I had, I was about 3/4 quart down of
oil, but I never had low pressure.  Anyways, I top it
off, and let it warm up, and the valve ticking does
not go away; in fact, there seems to be a loss of
power at higher rpms.  There seems to be an
intermittent backfire, and that happens when trying to
give it gas.  If I let up, then it will go down the
road, tick and all.

All these problems keep stacking up as I address
others!!

Anyways, has there been a valve seat become detached
(dropped) all of a sudden?  Am I in for a rebuild?

Any and all help can be appreciated.  I am sorry for
monopolizing the list with my problems every week or
so.

Thanks and Kindest Regards,
