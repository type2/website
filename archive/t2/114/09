I suspect, and others have commented on it, that this list (and others,
dedicated to various marques, or even genres - Scions of Lucas), has
had a great effect on the old car "hobby". Those of us in the wilderness,
i.e. outside of California, have had a tough time keeping our old VW's up
and running...If the closest VW dealer didn't have the needed part(s) or
wanted more than the cost of the VW...Well, that's when the creativity
and baling wire came in...Or, the check went off to magazine-ad-driven
vendors like - GEX (the Enron of VW-dom ?-( Or the parts counter guy
who said (in the best way, remember?), "...Don't have that...Here, try/
wire this one in, it'll get you running at least..."
