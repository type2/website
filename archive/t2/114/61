May me a Friday topic...   If so, my apologies...

I was coming off a viaduct here in Vancouver BC,  (west on Dunsmuir for those
who know the area)
and I saw the cop with the radar gun put it up to check me.  "I'm doomed!"  I
thought. I was doung 45mph in a 30mph area, coming off the bridge.  I let off
of the gas and as soon as I did that, the cop lowered the gun and it was as if
he decided that my van mustn't have been able to speed as I was allowed to pass
by him w/o even a second glance.  I got a chuckle there.   I guess my speeding
Karma was up to date that day...
