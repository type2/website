Folks, for what it's worth:

I recently bought a gorgeous Volvo 765 with nary a problem but a sagging
headliner.  I took it to a local
Headliners Plus! guy, and was consequently so impressed with his work and
rates, I went home, drove
my 78 Westy back to him, and asked what he could do about that godforsaken
mildew stain on the
"fuzzy" crap that lines the inside of the poptop. (I had, by that point,
spent egregious amounts of money
on surely every commercially-available product... and nearly killed myself
in the process a number of times:
fumes tend to congregate up there!)

Well, he takes a gander, and in the end, for a mere $250, he installed a
"marine-grade" headliner, a nice
comfy kinda stuff, PADDED mind you, and (here's the kicker) applied 3/4" oak
strips all the way around
the inside of the poptop - to which he re-stapled the canvas (which was
sagging on one side) and screwed
them into the fiberglass.

It looks incredible - and is surely the one-thing-I-didn't-do-myself of
which I am the proudest! I highly
encourage other folks to investigate similar options, if $250 is reasonable
for them.

Cheers!
