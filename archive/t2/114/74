Thanks for all the tips and advice, however, the saga continues. I =
originally posted some misinformation, I apologize. Again, it's a '73 =
(11/72) Transporter, manual transmission, carbureted (dual), and is =
leaking oil pretty badly. The leak seems to be centered around the #4 =
cylinder (not the #3 as I originally said). I replaced the old oil =
pressure switch, but the old one didn't look bad or leaky, but at 4 =
bucks I figured what the heck. I started rooting around on the top of =
the engine, and noticed that the tin surrounding where the plug wire for =
the #4 cylinder was pretty oily (the top of the plug is pretty nasty as =
well). Then I looked up at the cylinder from the underside of the =
engine, and noticed that the cylinder looks pretty oily too... How bad =
of a sign is this? It's hard to tell where the oil is coming from on the =
underside because everything seems to have oil on it. The top looks =
pretty dry except for the tin around #4... I've ruled out the oil cooler =
in that it doesn't appear to be leaking... Also, on a side note, my oil =
breather and air filter where pretty gunked up with tan sludge, is this =
an indication of anything? Any suggestions are appreciated!
Thanks,
