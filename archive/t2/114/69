Hey Y'all,
Anyone have any good photos of a BN4 gas heater installed their 68-71 bus?  I'm trying to figure out how the heater and ducts sit in relation to the spare tire well on the top of the engine compartment and the drivers side rear tire well from the bottom. Does the duct go over \ through the drivers side rear wheel well?  There's some good stuff in the type2 Library, but not a real good picture fromn the engine compartment perspective showing this.
