Subject: compression problem

After getting the donor engine installed and running in my
79 bay, it seemed to be running rough so I started troubleshooting.
I tested the compression in all cylinders and #1 was the only one
to test bad, it tested at 30psi (60 with engine running.)  Any
ideas?  When I replaced the plugs, that one was fouled out big-time,
had lots of gunk on it, the others we're OK.

Also, is it possible to remove the head without removing the
engine?

Thanks,

Rob
