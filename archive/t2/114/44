Subject: re:headliners,painting tin,oil leaks

This shop in Seattle does do excellent work.I'll
second this reccomendation
--
I had a new headliner put in my 77 Westy by a
convertable shop and they
charged $75 bucks. They put it on over the old
material.
--------------------
Painting tin: I put my tin in an old Bar-B-Que and
cooked it real well. This burns off the oil residue
and IMHO works better than solvent/wiping.. unless you
have a dip tank. Used Krylon rattle can paint. Been
good for a few years now.
---------------------
OIL LEAK: I would change the "O" rings on the oil
cooler. Took my engine out an all the tin off for
other reasons... it had been leaking for a while..
it wasnt the oil filter or the pressure sender (dry as
a bone).. it was the oil cooler. It was only wet on
the
very bottom the rest was dry. My theory on this is
that the fan blows air kinda down and through the oil
cooler which keeps the oil off the cooler so that the
body is dry even though the seals are leaken... my 
seals where as hard and brittle as a brick.
Something to ponder. does it leak more when the oil
gets warm? Mine did as the bypass valve shunts the oil
when it is cold an thick... as soon as it start to get
warm the valve closes and routes the oil through the
cooler. So with the bus cold, start it up and see if
the leaking starts right away or after it has been
running for a while... doesnt take long.. maybe
aminute
or so.... unless you are in North Dakota (-at-) -30 F. :^)
