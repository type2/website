Subject: Fuel injection pressure

Hi All,

If my bus were fuel injected,
and had a Schrader valve in the fuel line,
could I check its pressure with, say, a 
tire pressure gauge? 
I have found fuel pressure gauges for no
cheaper than $75.00.
Do any flaps rent these things?

Thanks for any thoughts.

Jeff
