Jonathan,

No.  The VW bus has a cable-operate clutch and it sounds to me like your
cable may be a touch tight.  the pedal is suposed to have 1/2-1" of free
play before you get pressure.  If you don't have that, then the cable is
tight.  If you have more, then the cable is loose.

Try adjusting the clutch cable.  Crawl under the bus from the driver's
side, just forward of the rear wheel.  Look up and you will see above the
driver's side half-shaft (or axle) the clutch cable, the actuating arm and
the adjuster nut behind the arm on the ned of the cable.  If you don't
have the requisite play, try loosening that nut by 3-4 turns and see if
your clutch operation is improved.

Well, on the Saab and the Chevy, the trans is right ther, under your feet
and the shifter almost certainly went straight into the transmission thru
the floorboard.  On a VW bus, you are about ten feet from the trans and
there is:

a) a ball and socket joint at the bottom of the shifter;
b) a rather long rod with one or two bushings (depending on year); and
c) a rubber linkage (the rear shift coupler).

between your fist on the shifter and the trans.  This arrangement will
*never* be as stiff and positive as a direct connection, but was pretty
crisp when new.  30 years down the road, it has probably gotten a bit limp
(don't we all :-)

To improve the shifter feel, the easiest and most important thing to do is
to replace that rear shifter coupler.  You can order one for a reasonable
sum from any of the list vendors.

Bus Depot link to this part is:
http://www.busdepot.com/ASP/drivetrain.asp?PartType=D&VehCod=H&B1=Search
and look about 3/4 down the page for the rear shift coupler set.

Bus boys link to this part is :
http://www.bus-boys.com/shifter79.html
and look for set "P"

To replace this, you will need a needle nose vice grip and an ?8mm?
wrench.  When you get the replacement, you will see that the coupler has a
screw with an ?8mm? head that goes into a barrel.  In theory, you can put
a screwdriver into the other end of the barrel to hold it wile you crank
the screw in.  I have never had any luck with this and use the needle nose
vice grip on one of the tangs on the barrel to hold it while I crank.

The front ball and socket is pretty un-curable if severely worn, unless
you are in southern California or have access to a low-mile parts bus
elsewhere. Packing it with stiff grease helps some.

The bushing(s) on the long shift rod are easy to replace and very
cheap....  once you remove the engine and transmission!  I would put this
off until you need to remove them for some other reason, frankly.
