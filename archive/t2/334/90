Billy,

I am not anything near an expert on CA emissions, there are others who are
far more knowledgeable about that topic than me.

Dr. Tim is correct in all his points, to be sure. I am not suggesting that
everyone should start trying to "fine tune" their bus by pulling the cover
off the AFM and tweeking away. This will likely make matter worse. The
Bentley has all the specs you need to set up a completely stock bus, and if
the specs in the Bentley are achieved, you should pass emissions, I would
say.

BUT... if you had an AFM which you knew had been tampered with, and a dyno
and analyzer, and some skill, you could make your injection system function
very well. The last thing you want is bus which runs perfectly at idle and
very lean at 3200 RPM. Dyno tuning will find this and give you an
opportunity to correct it, whether by AFM tweeks, distributor tweeks or
anything else. Many people's busses are not completely stock, so it is
difficult to tune "by them book". CA emissions require everything to be
stock, so this doesn't apply as much in that region.
