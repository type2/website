usually having a stove and fridge is enough, and a Westy has those...

copy page 3 of the Bentley manual, second paragraph says in part

"The Station Wagon, Kombi, Campmobile, Delivery Van, and Pick-Up truck
share the same frame...."

further in paragraph 4 it says "The bodies of the Station Wagon, Kombi,
Campmobile, and delivery van differ only in their window arrangements and
trim"

Hope this will help
