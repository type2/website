a tank for the compressed air and piston!

press the air to fill the tank to run the motor. There's a huge volume of
air required to fill a motor repeatedly. The designs I've seen are mostly
for "local" use; limited range and top speed. Another problem with a com-
pressed air motor...No heat or AC, and no electricity for lights, etc. with-
out power robbing ancilliaries on the motor. I'm not saying it can't work,
just that the trade-offs are enormous...
