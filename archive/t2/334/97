Subject: BeetleMex Seat Belts

I want to thank everyone who responded to my recent question
about purchasing tires.  I ended up purchasing Yokohama Y356's
from The Tire Rack.
Now I have another question.  I just received 2 retractable seat belts
from Beetle Mex.  Unfortunately they sent me 2 passenger side belts
instead of on drivers side and one passenger side as I ordered, but
I will deal with them about that.  My question is about the installation of
the belt so that I can pull the retractable portion of the belt from the
roller.  If I install it as designed  (i.e. passenger belt on the passenger
side with the roller assembly below the attaching bolt) I am unable to
pull any of the belt out of the roller assembly.  If I install it
incorrectly (i.e.
passenger belt on the drivers side with the roller assembly above the
attaching bolt, which seems to be upside down) then I can pull the belt
out of the roller assembly.  If someone has successfully installed this
seat belt as it should be installed, will you please e-mail me off the list
and tell me how  you did it.  Again thanks for all the response to my
tire search.
