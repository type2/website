Well, that depends on what one's idea of "reasonable" is.  They have come down to a little under $4/watt, but that is still a lot of money.  

>I think if one were to compare the cost of a 75 watt panel (under $300) vs the cost of a windmill, frame, pole to mount it on, guy wires, then add it the time to assemble, dissemble place to store it in the bus, pissing off neighbor campers with its constant noise, solar starts looking real good.

You have a valid point, but your comparison isn't exactly fair.  You can buy a 400-watt wind generator for $650 or just over $1.50/watt.

That is much cheaper than solar.  400 watts of solar panels would require 40 square feet of space which is a lot more than is available on the roof of a bus.  The wind generator also works at night and in stormy or overcast weather, which of course most people don't *like* camping in, but often it happens anyway.

Not saying I'm in favor of wind, just pointing out that it does have some advantages.  In a perfect world, I'd have both.
