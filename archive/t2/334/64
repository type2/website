Subject: Re: [T2] Braided wire on dissy plate

> Hi could any one enlighten me to the purpose of the copper braided wire inside my dual vac dissy- is it
really important or over-enginering as my wire has come adrift when I changed my points recently and I'm now
getting a misfire in mid range.

Your distributor advances/retards timing, on the vacuum part of it, by rotating the breaker plate. The breaker
plate is made up of two main pieces, the upper and lower. The lower is fixed and held to the body of the dist.
by screws. The upper rotates in a machined hole in the lower plate and is held in place by a hook and a spring
loaded ball-bearing. In order for it to rotate it has to ride on a layer of grease. No grease = no turn.
Grease does not conduct electricity. Your points have two contacts: the hot side and the ground side. To
discharge the coil, you have to ground the negative side of the coil thru the points. The braided wire
bypasses the grease so you can have a direct ground to the base of the distributor. No ground = no coil
output.

Is it repairable? Usually not with any success. The only 100% repair you can do is to find another distributor
and swap out the breaker plate with a known-good one.

What is your distributor number on the side of it?
