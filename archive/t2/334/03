Subject: favorite parking spot/grab bag

List,

Content lately has been pretty non-technical, laid back, and since today we've referenced the amish to tonopah, 

(not complaining, I enjoy all the .02 stuff!)

I'll chime in about my favorite parking spot at work.

Across the street is Bavarian Autohause, specializing in sales/service of BMWs. Parking is tight around here and there
is a carlength strip of sidewalk between two driveways that
the owner likes to park B'mers on the sidewalk and street parts,
sorta high/low style.

But every once in a while the street B'mer has to go somewhere and I get the spot in front of the sidewalked (how lame is that?) B'mer, obscuring it from view with my offensive, multi-hued german array (O.M.H.G.A.).

I secretly hope it fires him up.

Questions:

1. who makes good intake valves? (79 2.0L Cal.)
are the ones I got on (censored) for 10 bucks not a good idea?

2. where do I attach the +/- of a tach/dwell meter? And will it work with my factory electronic ignition? (ie. is it just for points?)

Billy
