Also having a smog-required 79 california engine, I would like to know how this plays with smog check.

Tim says that the correct for the mixture screw setting is at idle, and it give a 2% CO or CO2, I don't remember. Is this what the smog checkers are looking to see as well?

What I'm asking, Are the smog check people together with VW/Bentley on what should be coming out of the engine, and if not, is this the reason people are tweaking this more now? Or, Will Dr Tim's procedures lead to successful smog check, as well as just good running? Or is Scott Lyons method required to get thru?

Sounding obtuse today,
