Subject: Aftermarket Pull starter?

--Sure. You know those fire suppression systems in kitchens? The manual pull stations look like electrical conduit runs to them, and it's close, but there's a cable inside. And everytime they change direction, there's a small pulley in the fitting.

You'd only need to rig up one 90 degee pulley to get a good pull straight out of the bus engine bay.

John has a snowmobile recoil pull cord modified to fit the CRANK pulley, also, he changed the prop for the engine deck so it gives enough room to pull the cord. He made the engine deck lid stand up almost against the upper hatch door.
