Subject: Re: [T2] Red & Blue Plastic Heater Levers

Got a question for y'all.

Looking at the red heater lever master, I seem to remember having a problem
in my first bus (20+ years ago) with the two red levers getting caught on
each other when they passed each other in slot in the dash.

Is this a common problem?  I've got a fix in mind for it, if necessary.
