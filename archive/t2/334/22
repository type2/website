Tom, I agree 100% - Don't fool with your distributor drive gear because it
rarely ever is the problem - instead recheck your procedure for TDC#1, valve
Settings, point gap, and timing per the book and instructions for your
specific distributor and motor. Misalignment of the Distributor Drive Gear
is one of those once in a decade phenomenon.
