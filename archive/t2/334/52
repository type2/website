Subject: Tie Rod seperator

Hello all, I'm thinking that before I send my "old" bus off to the boneyard I'd 
like to pull off the tie rods, which have less than 1,000 miles on them and 
exchange them for the ones on my "new" bus, which are of unknown age. In the 
Bentley section on front end, it shows a tie rod seperator being used. Is this 
a special vw specific tool, or can I rent one from my local autozone?
TIA--
