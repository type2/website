 Heh heh, up here in BC they call them access centers, where you can deal
 with your licence or health care etc. Other day I needed driving abstracts
 for my commercial lic. Walk in, one person in front of me, wait 30 seconds,
 hand her my licence and she prints it right out, there you go, no charge.
 'Course it gums up the works when you have to take a test with no line to
 study in ; )
