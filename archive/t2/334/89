Stan,

Welcome to the list,
 
Won't find that dash in a catalogue for our buses Stan.
It'll be a junkyard or Famous Internet Auction Site.
I frequently see them on the auction site for minimal dollars.

Also, if the problem is with the metal on top, or the rubber bumper that seperates the metal top from the front panel, both those are seperate pieces.
