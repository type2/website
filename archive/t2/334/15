Considering that the life of CV joints is usually over 100K miles
(sometimes _way_ over), there is probably not enough data out there for
the time that the reman axles have been available.

I'm a bit suspicious of the idea of "remanufacturing" CV joints.  Sounds
to me like they are taking old axles, keeping the OK CVs, and making up
the deficit with new CVs.  Could be a good deal, could be a
failure in
1000 miles.
