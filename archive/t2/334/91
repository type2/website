It works like this:

- the engine has to warm up first, then throw the lever
- the heater tubes and seals to the fan shroud have to be close to leak free
- the cable to the flapper boxes have to be taught and open the flaps
- the booster fan in the engine compartment has to be running (check the
fuse, see it turn, they can seize after lack of use)
