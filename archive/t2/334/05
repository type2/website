I bought one at the last BNNTA (busses nowhere near the arch) get together
and it has worked nicely to eep my battery from running out of juice while
sitting. It's basically cheapish chinese moulded plastic.... but it's held
up well and does what it was designed to do. Apparently, these are taken out
of VW luxury vehicles by the dealers. They are placed there to keep the car
computers from draining the battery dry during shipping.
