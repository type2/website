Subject: RE: [T2] The answers or conjectures re the Electric Beetle

my first thought when i saw the engine was  that it as a compressed air
engine!!!!  In europe some small car work on compressed air!!  All you need is
a tank for the compressed air and piston!

Now why an electric engine would need piston like design??

Enclosed is some info I received, which may be of interest to those who'd
like to someday have an electric engine on their bus, and/or were curious
about what it was.

Any more electronics people out there, this is most interestin.
