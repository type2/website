Subject: Westy tent plastic clips - what to use if broken?

Hi all....

I helped my friend put up his Westy tent yesterday,  the late model one with 
a floor.

1/3 of the plastic clips that hold it up on the poles are broken,
the "rubber band"  loops are fine....

are new plastic  ones available ?
or is there a hardware store item that will work ?

thanks for your help....
