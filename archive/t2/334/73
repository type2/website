Speaking of Virginia/DC busses:

Do and bus owners in the DC-area (30 mile radius) have any garage space 
for rent/trade?

I just moved to the area and am actively looking to either rent a garage 
(I'll sign a lease) or get in contact with a bus owner who will let me 
work in their driveway/yard/etc for a reasonable price.  I'm pretty VW 
saavy -- having worked in a couple of VW shops over the last two years -- 
and would more than willing to barter working on your bus for a space to work 
on mine.

Thanks,
