What Chris says is also true, but I'd like to apply a version to Occam's 
Razor to this problem. [1]  It is possible for a distributor drive gear to 
be oriented incorrectly, but it is more likely that there is another 
problem.  For example, different distributor models have different rotor 
orientations.  To wit:  for a stock vacuum adv. dizzy on a '71 bus, at TDC 
and when #1 is firing, the rotor points roughly to the (let's see if 
i can visualize this correctly) front, right corner of the bus (FIF), 
whereas if you were to pop a 009 in without turning the engine at all, the 
rotor would point to the rear, right corner of the bus.  

I guess all I'm trying to say is:  Make sure you have everything else set 
up properly: your wires in the correct places and your valves adj. 
properly, etc. before you go suspecting and/or pulling your dizzy drive 
gear.  The dizzy drive gear is seldom the problem and a real PITA to pull 
and replace "just right" without cutting up your worm gears at all.  More 
often than not, this will be a "wires on wrong", "engine not timed close 
enough", or "valves not adjusted properly" issue.
