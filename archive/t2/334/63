Subject: The answers or conjectures re the Electric Beetle Engine

Enclosed is some info I received, which may be of interest to those who'd
like to someday have an electric engine on their bus, and/or were curious
about what it was.

Subject: What is it, the answer. I was right!


Hi There,

Wow! I guess I was right about the motor being fully electric. It is
designed to power the car.

Here are some of the emails I have received (from the owner and another list
he has going.)

----------------

First I would like to thank you all for the overwhelming response i got on
the VW motor.  Next I would like to answer some of the many questions got.

Well some of you asked if it was a joke.  As far as I know it is not a joke,
it is someones invention.

Some asked if it runs,  and the answer id I do not know. Haven't tried

Asked about the fuel delivery... I have been told it is completely electric

Many asked if it is for sale...  I don't what I have so can't decide on what
it's fair value may be,  but I may soo take offers depending what I find.
The problem is the case is original so it will not go,  just the electric
set
up.  I also may sell the whole car or trade,  and it is in Excellent shape.

I have had 2 electrical engineers look at the car and they confirmed it was
fully electric.  It has a hommade distributor,  which also acts as a
throttle, it is turned by the accelerator cable,  and returned by a spring,
potentially incressing the power.  I  would like to have someone eventually
get it going,  but I have no need to own an electric car.

Now that you all know more lets hear some more feedback

Aaron

Thanks for the reply I was not sure if I should just send this back to
the owner or every one on the list.

I have been discussing this on a forum for a few days now and a couple
of the guys actually figured out that it was infact an electric engine
of some description and have there theories on how it may work before I
paste them onto this email just wondering if u could tell me the size
and number of batteries, and what is the operating voltage??

Some of the things people posted on the Forum (Performance forums)


------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------
I have given this some more thought overnight , it is probably the most
cunning, ingenious and efficient electric car engine I have ever seen.

The biggest problem with any electric vehicle is controlling the power
to the electric motor. The load and speed range are both going to be
very high, also the battery voltage will vary as it discharges.

To work properly you really need a continuously adjustable electronic
control attatched to the accelerator pedal. Now while this can be done,
it is complicated, wastes a lot of energy as heat, is expensive to
build.

The most efficient form of control switches the power on and off very
fast, this is called switched mode operation.

Now how I think this engine works is as Tuna suggests. There are four
electromagnets that operate as linear motors. Instead of pistons, the
electromagnets work by attracting solid iron pistons inside the hollow
barrels which have electrical coils inside.

Now there would be some very clever features here. First because the
engine is a horizontally opposed boxer engine, the massive weight of
solid iron pistons would be completely balanced. Also the electromagnets
could be operated together as the pistons move togeter. This would
greatly simplify the control system.

Now the idea is that the elecromagnets would only be energised for a
very brief time for low power requirements, and for longer time when
more torque is required. The switching on and off of the power could be
very slow (in electronic terms) as switching is inly required once per
engine revolution. The SCRs on the large heatsiks are the perfect thing
to use for something like this.

But the cleverest feature might be how the electromagnets are cooled. As
the pistons move in and out, reed or flap valves in what you might call
the cylinder head, pump air through the barrels in one direction only.
You would need an air cleaner to prevent grit and dirt from wrecking the
engine just as with any other engine. But the air is for cooling only.
The air exits through the large crankcase breather next to the
distributor.

Where is SECOH, he is another power electronics engineer like myself.
Any more electronics people out there, this is most interestin.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------

have never seen a linear motor driving a crankshaft before, but the guy
that built this up must have been a very clever person indeed.

The more you look at this the more ingenious it actually is, not only
from the mechanical aspect, but also the simplicity and efficiency of
the electronic control.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------

If it works the way I think it does, all four cylinders are powered
(fire) together simultaneously, and there would be a flywheel to keep it
turning. If it stopped, it may not always self start, so it would
probably need to idle, and still require the stock starter motor to kick
it into life.

It would be like a petrol engine to drive, requiring clutch and
gearchanges for best performance. The torque curve would be completely
flat, and it might rev a lot harder than you might think as well.
Absolutely fascinating.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------

The more I study that photo, the more convinced I become that it is an
electric car of some sort. There are pairs of heavy wires going into the
base of each of those ribbed cylinder looking things.

Also the three large heatsinks carry very large silicon controlled
rectifiers (SCRs). The only purpose these could possibly have is the
control of very large amounts of power.

Coupling four individual rotating electric motors to a stock VW
crankcase makes no sense at all. Why not replace the whole engine with a
single large motor straight onto the gearbox. Unless of course the four
motors are actually linear motors that push and pull on the stock crank
and conrods.

Apart from no exhaust, there is no cooling system either. Any sort of
internal combustion engine requires both. What else could it possibly be
?

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------

think the original VW was only about ten horsepower or something.
Electric cars are usually slow, efficient, and underpowered anyway. A
practical electric car could be even less powerful and still be quite
usable.

There are so many ways that these electromagnets might be configured.
The best way might be to build it like a loudspeaker drive, where the
coil moves in and out of a fixed radial magnetic field.

A loudspeaker gives a very linear push pull action over maybe 15mm of
travel. You could make something that worked over about 80mm, or
whatever the piston stroke is on a VW.

A half decent loudspeaker can dissipate pehaps 100W continuously without
any cooling system at all, but the coil would be just about smoking. If
you forced high velocity air through the small magnetic gap around the
drive coil, the cooling for far higher power might be quite easy.

As for the magnetic field strength, if the internals are made from mild
steel or cast iron, it would be totally saturated by two teslas I would
expect. It may use permanant magnets, or electromagnets for field
excitation, who knows ?

The SCRs and the gauge of wiring looks like it might handle about fifty
amps continuously, but the battery voltage may also be quite high,
probably far more than 12V.

Well I just thought u might find this stuff interesting, good luck
