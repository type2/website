Actually, AC is the easyest thing to achieve, as exhaust air will be
freezing cold... more complicated will be heating from an engine that
doesn't go over 400C...

I heard that the Compressed Air car comes with a 3,3 KW or 5 Kw air
compressor on board... and "refueling" takes a lot of time (4 hours) because
you need to compress air to 300 bar without raising too much the
temperature; otherwise it takes 3 minutes at a gas station equipped.

It runs (-at-)130 Km/h ('bout 80 Mph) for 300 Km only, but it is cheaper.
