Check out the laws about how dark you can tint the windows, too...Most
police take a dim (sorry) view of over-tinted windows, assuming that
you have something to hide and it increases their apprehension when 
approaching a vehicle, even for a routine stop. Also, over-tinting
might even cause a problem with your insurance, if you have an ac-
cident...
