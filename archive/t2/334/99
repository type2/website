Hi Susan,

This is normal, the heater systems on most buses are neglected more 
often than not.

Start from the back, and work your way forward. Verify that the paper 
hoses from the doghouse to the heater boxes are present and properly 
fastened in place. Without these in place there will be no air pressure 
to push heat out the front vents.

Now look underneath and verify that the heater boxes are intact. This 
is much less of an issue on CA buses than it is here in the Rust Belt, 
but you should still check.

Moving forward from the heater boxes, there are flapper valves joining 
the heater boxes to some thick black plastic flex pipe. The flappers 
inside these fittings vent unwanted heat when the cable connected to 
the red lever is pulled. If the flapper boxes are intact, be sure to 
check the cabling is also connected and verify that the cables move 
with the levers. It is quite common to find the flappers wired wide 
open in the fall and then wired shut again come spring.

If everything is fine up to this point, inspect the piping going 
forward from the flappers for blockages. Mice LOVE to make themselves 
at home in here, and their building process does NOT help warm air pass 
from the engine up to the cab.

If you've checked and repaired all of the above you can improve the 
stock heater system by adding a blower to recirculate cabin air into 
the heater boxes, this will help both by increasing the flow of warm 
air and increasing the temperature of incoming air at the same time.


Happy trails,
