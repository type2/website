That is not the proper procedure.

The only proper mixture adjustment is at idle. If that is set right, all 
else will fall in line. This assumes that compression is spec as well as 
ignition timing and energy. If it doesn't seem to be running right with 
idle co at 2% max, something else is wrong. Start playing with the 
internals of the AFM at your peril. This is a screwdriver pokin' procedure 
that virtually guarantees poor results.
