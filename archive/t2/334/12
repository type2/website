Be very careful of that spring under the distributor drive dog. I got to
overhaul my engine at Xmas because the spring 'sprung' into one of the oil
galley holes. Muir recommends using a broken coat hanger to guide the spring
into place. I do to.

Of course, I found that my cam and crank gears were off by a tooth when I had
the engine apart. The engine runs _MUCH_ better now that the time can be set
right. Also, I found that my fan is mounted 180 degrees off so my timing marks
are 180 off. Aren't these things fun!
