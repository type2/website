Subject: Good News (for a change)

My '78 Westy was acting stubborn, like a mule, and hard to start.  Yesterday 
morning it just would NOT start.

I measured the voltage at the battery wire going to the starter.  It was 
going all over the place, from 12.+ down to 4.something, just jumping all 
over!!

First, I figured my ground was messed up.

But I have a quick disconnect at the positive post of my battery, connecting 
the starter power cable, so I can disconnected the battery when working on 
the '78, and during a long rest period (I have a small amperage drain).

And THAT was the problem.  The quick disconnect was burnt pretty badly and I 
guess was not making a good connection.

Now I am getting full power to the starter and the rest of the system, and 
it starts and runs like the champ it was...  I am expecting better gas 
mileage, too, and maybe the wart on my hand will go away...



Moral(e) of the story:  check all your connections for good contact, and 
check the circuits to make sure none are shorting out (my next step)
