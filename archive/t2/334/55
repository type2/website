Mike,

No puller you can rent from Autozone will remove them easily and all will
waste your time (trust me, I tried in vain one afternoon renting all of
their tools). They are all claw shaped instead unlike the VW tool which of
has a C-cup at the end and won't damage the rubber grease boot. The VW tools
also has a round end screw which won't damage the threads or the stud.

A real VW tie-rod tool is a worthwhile one to own. It will pop tie-rods in
10 seconds without damage and it also pulls the draglink form the pitman
arm:

It's ACC-C10-7081 at California Imports, PEL-TOL-P211 at Pelican Parts,
BugPack catalog item #7080.

Samstag sales sells one from Hazet <http://www.samstagsales.com/hazet.htm>
and so does Zelenda in the VW/Adui catalog <http://www.zelenda.com/> but I
would go with CIP1.
