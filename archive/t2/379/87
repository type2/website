Not that it matters now, but you probably don't have the computer
diagnostic hook-up either...Welcome to the wonderful world of (very)
previously owned cars...One of the benefits that some high end old
cars come with is a "log book" detailing the service and changes made
during the car's history...Useful when the pictures in the "official"
manual... look nothing like what you've got ;-(
