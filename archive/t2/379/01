Subject: Passenger side mirror

Hi All,

I need to get my 70 westy inspected here in Massachusetts this weekend, and
forgot I am missing my passengers side mirror (Kayak slipped last time I took
it off the rack and broke it off). Any one in Ma have one they want to part
with? I will pick up.

Thanks

Jeff
