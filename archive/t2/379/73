Subject: I didn't want to have to do this,  but.....................

I know this is not how things are supposed to be done, but,  after sending
six,  yes count them SIX  unsubscribe messages in the last few weeks to
theproper address and NOTHING has been done about it!!!!

Not only that I have sent 3 or 4 emails to the supposed site adminstrator
explaining this situation but to no avail.........
I am in a situation where I cannot check my email often,  so now whenever
I check my mailbox is totally full,  therefore bouncing any messages that
are sent!  I don't need to go into how very annoying this is...........
So please for God's sake take me of this list NOW!   I mean NOW!!!!!!

I have enjoyed this list and it has helped me tremendously in getting my
bus up and running but this is just absurd..........it leaves a terrible
taste in my mouth...................
