That's what I thought. While changing the regulator I saw that the exit hose
from the regulator to the tank had been cut a little to long and was
slightly kinked. I'll fix this next weekend when I replace all the fuel
line. I thought that could be the blockage. After thinking about it, that is
after the regulator so should not affect the pressure right? There is only
pressure from the pump to the regulator if I understand it right. As long as
it's within spec I'm not going to worry much about it, just keep an eye on
it.

Thanks Richard
