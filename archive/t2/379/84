The eBahn viewer software is basically an Acrobat plugin running in a
neutered web browser but all file access is through a local cgi service. I
didn't like it that much. I've never tried using Virtual PC to run it but I
suppose it's possible and probably slow.

The data is stored in PDFs but they are further encoded into a format that
eBahn reads to keep you from stealing the content. The files are
sequentially numbered. With a lot of work it's possible to create for
yourself a CD of just PDFs that you can read using any PDF viewer and leave
eBahn in the dust.
