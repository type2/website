Subject: Re: [T2] 2.0L Rebuild saga

These sort of questions are impossible to answer in the abstract.  You need
to know a lot of facts about the individual asking the question.

How much money do you have?

Do you have a workshop where you can work on this thing?

Do you have a lot of tools, and experience working with them, particularly
the measuring tools needed for a "good" rebuild?

Do you have another ride?

Is this vehicle a daily driver or a hobby?

Do you get some sort of psychic reward from rebuilding engines?

And, etc., etc. etc.?

Do all the permutations on the questions above, particularly the "etc.,
etc., etc." and you presented a question that's impossible to answer.

That said, the common wisdom about GEX is that they are pretty poorly built
throughout and you'll only get a reasonable amount of mileage out of then if
you're unreasonably lucky.

So, if you have a lot of money, a lot of time, another ride and really,
really want to build a good engine, tear that thing down to its smallest
component and start over.

If you have a reasonable amount of money but less time or need to get on the
road fairly quickly, then use this engine as a core for a quality rebuild.

Here's the bottom line:  You can build an engine that's *better* than the
"volume/reasonable quality" rebuilders, but you *can't* build it cheaper
than they can.

These are tough questions to deal with.
