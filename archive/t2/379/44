Subject: 2.0L Rebuild saga

ok volks here is the story...

i bought a 74 westy with a 2.0L single carb'd GEX rebuild with only a few
thousand miles on it. when i bought it cylinders 1, 2, & 4 were firing
around 120 but my #3 cylinder was losing alot of compression. upon tearing
the engine apart i have found that the head gasket is cracked/broken which
deffinitely could bethe culprit. my question is this...

i know gex rebuilds are shotty so should I:

a)replace the gasket & slap the motor back together hoping that the
compression problem will be fixed

b)have the lower end checked out

c)have the upper end inspected and possibly rebuild the entire top end to
fix the low quality GEX heads

this is my first vw so i want to fix things right the first time. however,
the bus has been parked in the garage for over 6 months as i try and
acquaint my self with the motor. i would like to get it on the road as
soon as possible but dont want be forced to drop the motor again in
another 5,000 miles. how far should i be going with this overhaul
considering the passenger side head looks brand new?
sorry about the lengthy mail, ANY advice would be greatly appreciated.

74westy still in the garage.
