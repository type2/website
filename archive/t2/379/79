Subject: gas tank wireing

Hey all,
can anybody tell me where the fuel tank sender wire exits the body? Got an
extra wire back by the starter and no fuel gauge. This is on my 68 westy.

Anybody ever shimmed the wiper arm on a 68? right side wiper arm kinda flops
around and refuses to be tightened.

thanks all
