Visit an automotive upolstery supply house. (see local yellow pages)
They'll have an adhesive remover that should work.  If you take your bus
they'll probably have a bit you can test...

Note that you'll need to scrape and tear the material off, first, then
work on the remains.  It's not easy, even with a good solvent.

Of course, you could first try mineral spirits or naptha...be careful if
you try various chemicals.  Mixing them could be deadly.  Have plently of
ventilation and wear rubber gloves!

Are they vinyl?  I'll probably get flamed for this, but I'd suggest
limited usage of something similar to Greased Lightning, maybe 409, etc
as a last ditch effort.  The pro leather cleaners I've used felt and
worked and smelled exactly like Greased Lightning....though probably
diluted.

They're not recommended for vinyl so use carefuly.

Before solvents, though, you should try just good ol' soap and water
first.  You may be surprised.

If they're cloth..well. good luck.  you may try some carpet/upolstery
cleaners.

Perhaps ask at the upolsterly supply house while your there, they may have
some better suggestions.
