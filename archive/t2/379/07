I've been considering getting the CDs. My problem is that have Sparcs
running Solaris and Macs running OS X. Is there a chance in heck that
I'd be able to look at the CD with either? There's a windows emulator
that runs on OS X, and that could be used if necessary.

I don't suppose the CD is just a bunch of .pdfs with some proprietary
indexing/access software is it?
