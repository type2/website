Subject: Fuel pressure

I just replaced my fuel pressure regulator because my old one measured at
41lbs without vacuum. I tested the new regulator and the pressure is now at
38lbs. Still to high right? So, is there anything else, besides a bad
regulator that would cause to high fuel pressure without vacuum? If I am
thinking correctly the regulator only keeps pressure within the system from
the pump to the regulator. With vacuum it is right on at 28lbs. The Bentley
says that 33-37lbs is acceptable. I suppose my pressure gauge could be off +/-
one or two pounds. Opinions, thoughts?

Thanks all
