Depends on what your opinion of "perfect" is. If you are wanting something
that has been restored (new engine, body work, paint etc. etc.) I am
thinking somewhere in the $7,000-$10,000 range. I am assuming you are
wanting a bay single cab? Are you open to a double cab? Check out
www.thesamba.com . There are several single cabs and double cab bays in the
68-up classified section. Here is a link to a very nice 69 double cab.
