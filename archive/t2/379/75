Tom,
    how much do you know about this company? Are they for real?
I mean their warranties are unreal:
    "These engines have a 12 Month unlimited mileage warranty from the
factory"
    "We give you a lifetime warranty on this engine against manufacturing
defects. "
 Also, no core charge, all this just sounds too good to be true and
contradictory
If they are legit, then this may be a great deal.
Let me know.
Later,
Jim
