You've got a few options here:

1st: a V-8 engine conversion with a Porsche 915 tranny. Use the Rover V-8 
b/c it is all aluminum and weighs less. Shouldn't cost anymore than about 
$6000 or so unless you have to pay someone for their services... Cheaper 
than a new VW engine every 7500 miles.

You've got 70 HP that is overloaded by it's OEM application. Don't tow more 
than 1000 lbs. per the owner's manual. Actually it is 1000 lbs for the Type 
IV engine, dunno what it is for the Beetle motor. If you NEED to tow this 
much you are a good candidate for a full size RV or a V-8 powered full size 
Amurikan van. In addition to being rough on your engine you are going to 
cook your brakes ASAP. Have drum brakes or disc? My discs get pretty hot 
braking a 1000 lbs. coming down a mountain. A Geo is probably 2200 lbs.

2nd: consider an electric scooter option. It's quiet. They come in many 
different forms - I prefer the E-bicycle version. That's 12 miles at 12 mph 
and more if you pedal at the same time. Buy a $300 utility trailer to carry 
a set for the whole family. Your campground mates will think you are the 
coolest (if you care) and love you b/c you are quiet. If you've got kids I 
recommend a bike trailer. We've got a trailer I can pull behind my bike 
very easily. It came from K-mart. It has pneumatic tires and is silent. 
Carries two kids and a diaper bag. Collapses in about 5 minutes (no tools). 
We've put bunches of miles on our trailer / bike combo.

3rd: gas scooter. The local Kawasaki dealers are selling little gas 
scooters for $1000 that will run about 50 mph, are quiet, and look pretty 
cool. The model name is "Cappucino".

4rd: drive the bus. Learn camp bonzai setup and teardown methods.

Have fun... Let us know what you decide.
