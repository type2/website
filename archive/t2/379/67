Slightly says the manuals but I haven't spent a career testing every new unit with calibrated testing equipment to prove otherwise. You are ok. Chock is up to rounding error.

Maybe a blockage of some sort.

If you are at 28psi at idle with 19" of vacuum I say you're ok. 19" is about 8.5psi and that would be about 37 psi without the vacuum so it's all within reason.
