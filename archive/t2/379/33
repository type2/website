Subject: aux blower.

when I said that I couldn't get the aux blower to work, that meant that I
had already tried the lever up front. I am curious what the little box (the
one with all the wires going in and out of it) that sits right above the
blower does. My guess is that either a) its not doing its job or b) its not
getting the message to turn the blower on.
