Subject: Re: [T2] vacuum level

I have a vacuum gauge installed in the engine
compartment.  It's been there since the last rebuild
about 10K miles/9 months ago.  The bus runs fine -
though still get passed routinely on hills - and has
been on two 1000 mile+ road trips.  

However, even after all the vacuum hoses were
inspected, clamped, changed, etc., I almost always 
read between 15 and 16, occasionally 17".  This is at
idle of about 950-1000 rpm.  I live in Los Angeles and
the altitude where I live is oh, maybe 100 feet.

Is 15-16" a little low for a fresh engine?  Any other
places I can look or test for leaks?

Minimum: 15"
Ideal: 16-19"

Vacuum drops approx 1" for every 1000 ft you are above
sea level.

No one seems to remember what the reading is on a
brand new factory 
fresh engine. Who was talking about too high a reading
being bad?
