Subject: Re: [T2] Cracked case

Does anyone have any insight or opinions on www.importmotor.com aka Imports
So Cal?
I found them on ebay and checked out their site.
Although they use rebuilt cases, they claim thorough testing and a 12 month
12000 mile warranty.

Also, What is the better choice of case, aluminum or magnesium  & why?

Later,
