Subject: Suspension Clunk

Hi All!
  In the ongoing quest to improve my '78 Westfalia's handling, I have 
replaced the shocks with KYBs, the tires with BF Goodrich All Terrain tires, 
and replaced the steering dampener.  My wheel bearings have always felt a 
bit loose, so I replaced the rear wheel bearings (which turned out to be not 
nearly as difficult as I had anticipated) and adjusted the front ones.  Now 
there is no play in the wheels, aside from very slight play in the rear 
left.  It handles better, with less "yaw" when I drive, but the clunking I 
hear when I go over bumps that I thought was the loose wheel bearings is 
still there.  It is coming from the front right wheel area, and also from 
somewhere in the rear.  What else in the suspension could be causing this 
clunking?  Could it be my motor mounts?  How would I tell?  It is very loud 
and distracting, and the handling is still not tip top (whatever tip top for 
a bus means).

P.S. Has anybody had a chance to check out How to Modify Volkswagen Bus 
Suspension, Brakes and Chassis for High Performance by James Hale yet?  I've 
got it on order and I'll give a report when I get it.

Thank you all for any information!
