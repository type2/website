I don't think this is necessarily a wise move.  When VW stopped using the
cylinder/head sealing ring they also started using a thicker cylinder/case
sealing ring to add back the deck height lost when the head sealing ring is
removed.  Who the heck knows *what* GEX did in this case?  Unless I was to
tear the engine down far enough that I could check the cylinder/case rings
I'd leave the head sealing rings in place.  To simply remove them at this
point risks setting the engine up with a too-high compression ratio.
