Subject: Re: back up lights/engine stall

Andy,

Hooked everything up the way you said on the coil and then hooked the old 
voltmeter to both of the back up lights (not at once) and am getting 12.4 volts 
in reverse but still no lights. The bulbs look good to me. The only thing I can 
think of is the bulbs are bad but I cannot see it. No telling how long they've 
been in there.
