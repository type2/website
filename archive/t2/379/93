Subject: [T2] aux blower

Duncan,

I had a very similar situation on my bus several years
ago.  If I remember right (this was a while ago) when
you push the red lever up front down that doesn't
provide power, pushing the lever down actually closes
a circuit that provides a ground.  I could tell where
the power was supposed to be coming from to the aux
blower but that wire was never hot.  I ended up just
taking a small jumper right from the battery (it's so
close WHY NOT??).  I did keep the in-line fuse. (I
guess you just need to make sure you don't leave the
blower running since it's always hot).

I hope this helps.

Mike

she's still hibernating under a blue tarp and needs a
new alternator... maybe this weekend.
