Subject: Re: [T2] Sunroof parts needed

Dan,

It seems to me a sun roof rebuild kit with all the odd parts such as the 
lever blocks and crank parts along with some redo instructions would be a 
money maker.

Working on the sunroof is a hard heavy job for one person and good used 
parts seem to be hard to find.

I pulled the, prone to rust, roof on my 77 for painting and replaced the 
seal. Not fun for an old man. I would't do it for less than $500 plus parts.

Have you considered a poptop? There must be a lot of creative ideas, out 
there, on what to replace a worn out sun roof with.

Chuck
