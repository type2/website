Subject: case reassembly advice

Hey folks, I need advice about putting the case back together.  The last
time I did this was about 25 years ago and as I recall, my 1.7L bus back
then did not have the plastic vibration dampeners in the case.

I'm about to put my GE case halves back together.  Those plastic
vibration dampeners on the main bearing bolts prevent the case halves
from coming together cleanly when you slide the right side on the left. 
I'm afraid the cam half bearings and the main half bearing will fall out
of the right half of the case as I lower it onto the left half.  Should
I not be concerned? Or does anyone know a proper method to get the case
halves together and ensure a proper seating of the bearings in spite of
these plastic vibration dampeners.  Bentley is not helpful on this. It
says to put the right bearing halves on the crank and cam and then
install the left side of the case.  I am not confident that the tangs on
the bearings will line up and seat properly if I do that.  I've always
put the right bearing halves in the right case and then lowered it down
to the left.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Many Thanks,
Greg
