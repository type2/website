Subject: gas sending unit and ohms?

Meters have several ohm ranges.

If you're reading something which has a resistance of, say, 1-100ohms, but you're reading it in the 1,000-10,000 scale, your readings will be zero becase of the limitations of the number of digits on the meter.

Know what I mean?
