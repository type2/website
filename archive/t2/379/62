OK, then- So you bought it. Then you heard GEX is bad.
So you took it apart and discovered the primary problem.
You would like to reassemble it at this point, but don't
confident that this engine will be as dependable as you
might like. A very wise deduction.

For cheap, remove all the head gaskets, bolt it up and go.
GEX maybe hasn't seen the vw service recommendation.

For peace of mind,and more money, you are only a couple
hours labor away from total disassembly and verification.
If you lack the tools and experience, defer to a machinist.
You can at least save the cost of many parts and partial labor.
There are many clues in an engine in service.
You are looking for parts which don't meet the factory tolerance
and can improve the bottom end if you go to higher standards.
