Subject: Re: Transmission output shaft bearings loose... Help

Giles,
I had my Transmission (2L '77 model) re-built some time ago, by a very
reputable repairer. When I got it back to install I had similar movement in
the output flange. When I questioned this he told me that on the left side,
the output flange is supported by a very short bush which is where the
movement is. Even though he never replaced the output bearing (It was fine)
he said the movement would cause not problems, which it hasn't (I've done
~15k Km since).
The right side flange has a longer bush so it doesn't have the same problem.
So if it drives OK, and there's no oil leaking I wouldn't panic just yet.
Do check the oil level and keep an eye on it though (as I still do for
mine).
Richard,
