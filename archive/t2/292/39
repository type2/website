Subject: Battery for a 1977 Type 2 campmobile.

I'm having trouble on the internet finding the proper battery for my 1977
type 2 campmobile.  I believe that I need to get a Type 42 for the starting
battery, but wanted to make sure before I go drop my cash on the wrong one.
My battery is now only holding around 9.5 to 10.5 volts in the cold so it
has to be replaced.

Any tips???
