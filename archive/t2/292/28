John;


<When I'm in my bus and it's humming along I sort of back there, back
<to the
<era when, hey, we all knew the truth .... Comes the revolution, as my
<friends used to say.

<The mountains of Mexico, the coasts of Carolina and California, the
<plains
<of Texas, the blue skies by day glittering black by night .... the bus
<is
<home, my home, to all of them.

A MEN
