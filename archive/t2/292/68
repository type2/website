Subject: Carburetor assembly adhesive?

Hi,
I'm trying to maintain a 30+ year-old Solex carb. Specifically, what is the 
best way to secure the accelerator pump injector (the goose-neck brass tube) 
into its hole in the pot metal of the carb body? The hole is enlarged to the 
point where the tube is no longer a press fit, and so the tube tends to 
vibrate loose and fall down the throat of the carb. Is there a fuel-proof 
adhesive, or should I bend the tube slightly to get it to wedge, or?
Any suggestions from the list would be most appreciated.
Roland
