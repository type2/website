Subject: no oil  pressure

I had hoped to be in the final stage of assembling my new Berg 
engine, my first with full flow oil system. I  even had visions of 
starting it for the first time today.  This was not to be.

I cranked it on my test  stand  and  looked for flow of oil out of 
the hole where the pressure sensor resides.  Nothing.

I begin the troubleshooting by removing the oil line from the fitting 
on the oil pump cover plate.  The following pattern was repeatable. 
Five seconds after I would begin cranking, out of the fitting would 
come a healthy spurt of oil, then foamy oil, then nothing.  Wait ten 
minutes, do it again.

Oil pump not properly primed prior to bolting on its cover?   I'm 
guessing that I would never get the spurt. To  me, that rule out this 
possibility.

Oil pickup tube not extending far enough into the (stock) sump? Might be.

Does anyone recognize my symptoms? Could you suggest further checks 
to isolate the problem?

Thanks much.
Jack
