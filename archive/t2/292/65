Subject: Re: [T2] Spot weld drill bits....

I use a split tip drill.  The split tip keeps it from skipping and you 
carefully drill through only the amount of weld you need to pop the top layer 
of the parts you are trying to separate.  Split tip drills are available 
almost everywhere and cheaper than the "specialized" spot weld drills.  Both 
do the same job.
