Subject: Shipping big, heavy bus stuff.

Ok, this IS a bus related question.

How do you ship very large items across the U.S.? A buddy of mine in Colorado 
wants to give me his interior for a busted up 76 camper......The bed, the 
matress, the sink/fridge/stove, and the cabinets. How in the world do you get 
Huge Heavy items like that shipped half way across the country? 

I doubt this will happen, because every way I see this happening, it adds up 
to major $ signs.
Any ideas and/or brainstorming are appreciated.
