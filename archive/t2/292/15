I started out as one of the "hippies", skipped the "yuppie" era and 
stumbled back in 18 years after giving my 69 pop top to my brother. I 
drove that one for 11 years.

I started with VWs in 1963 when I was stationed in Holland, got a neat 
coupe, not with the hatch back, or Bug. In 70 hooked up with a splity 
with a small pop top, forgot the year, traded it in the 69 Westy in 
1975.

In august I bought a 69 Westy. I bet there a lot of people just like me 
returning to the "old daze".

Is the other half (gracefully) aging hippies?

BTW, this list is a tremendous resource, I love it.
