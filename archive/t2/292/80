Sydney in a couple of VW Buses. We're currently looking for vehicles -
ideally VW T4s - the later the better (1979) at any rate. We've found one
that's perfectly suited - complete with Westfalia-Helsinki interior kit.
It's an automatic though - would this be problematic in terms of
repair/wear & tear on the way. Ideas/theories/suggestions on the best
type of vehicle to conduct this trip/offers of buses gratefully accepted.

You really need to talk to the Zebrasafari folks about their trip!

I question the use of a type IV engined bus for trips to the boonies.
Seems that the type 1 is easier to get parts for and bodge than they FI
type IV engine.
