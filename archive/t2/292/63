You may want to check out PODS.  I've never looked into their pricing or
exactly how the system works, so I'm not sure how costly it would be.  Basicly
this company drops of a big storage container, you load it up, and then they
store it or take it to where ever the destination is.  It's used most of the
time for people moving that don't want to use a Uhaul.  Hope you figure
something out!

Have a good one,
