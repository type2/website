Hazet makes one. I have no idea who carries it in the U.S. because I got
mine in Germany, but I would think that any professional tool shop
should have them. 

Order a bunch of extra crowns. They break easily when you are not
drilling perfectly straight. The rest of the tool (the expensive part)
is indesrtuctable.
