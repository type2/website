Subject: 76 deluxe auto Westie in Southern Vermont

Hello list,
  Been a bit, but I have something that may be of interest to list members 
in New England.  I have aquired a 76 sage green deluxe westie, with an 
original auto transmission.  This bus is for restoration, or an excellent 
parts donor.  Bus needs an alternator bracket, and I was told #3 was bad.  
Doglegs are shot, and there is a little rust through on the bottom edge of 
sides, but doors are excellent, and the rest of the body seems ok. Great 
tires.  Has deluxe interior: refridgerator, stove, ect.  Interior in fair 
condition, still has that center table.  I can answer any questions about 
the bus you need to know. Bus is located in Brattleboro, Vermont, and must 
be picked up there. This will go cheap! If there is no interest in it as a 
whole bus, I will begin parting it out in a week or two.     BG
