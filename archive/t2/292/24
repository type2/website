Karl,
I ain't sure what a self supporting starer tester is--my guy lays it on
the bench--hookks up the wires,and puts the juice to it---he holds it
down with his hand.

Reads the current draw, and thats the end of it---

All he does is rebuilds starters and alternators / generators, been at
it for 30 years--and he does all my Mack starters / generators/
alternators.

So they jump around on the bench a little bit---at least I know what the
condition of the windings / brushes/ diodes whatever is--
