All air cooled VW starters have an exposed end out past the starter drive. The
bushing to SUPPORT the armature is pressed into the trans bellhousing. *Except
the auto stick-shift and bus auto trans starters. These are self-supported
starters. You do not need the bushing in the bellhousing for these. They will
spin out of the car.

Unless he supports the end of the armature, it will DRAG on the pole shoes.

No way, no how!
You CANNOT test a VW starter with it jumping around on the bench!!
