Never try to turn rusty nuts off the studs, you may ruin the stud.  Take a
sharp small chisel and keep it along side the stud and split the nut.  Works
great, doesn't take too long and if you keep the chisel along side the stud,
you won't damage any threads.

Always use new nuts and anti sieze compound when replacing.
