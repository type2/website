Subject: Electric T2s

To accomplish such a feat at this is well beyond my means, but I thought some
out there might find this of interest.  Making your air-cooled into an
electric car!  It's only pratical for commuter vechicles, but it makes for a
very efficient daily driver.  They have a picture of a single cab that has all
of the batteries in the treasure chests.  If anyone has more info or knows of
other sites about this, please p-mail me.
