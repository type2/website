Subject: wiring in a stereo-amp

i need music for those long journeys....

trying to get my head around wiring up a stereo amplifier, the instruction 
booklet for the amp i have recommends using 10mm cable straight to the 
battery - problem is the hot wire to the existing nackered-stereo isn't 
10mm. so i need to run a new one - is this going to be a 'mare of a job? any 
tips? also need to run a 10mm for the ground to the chassis - where does 
this usually run.

there are wires everywhere and none of the wiring diagrams i can find seem 
to match.

ahhhh..

ta,

sam.
