Subject: My dual carb duel....

Sorry I know it's a bad pun... Anyhow, she's a 73 Bay window, dual
carberators (stock 34 PDSIT 2/3) and I just finished rebuilding them and
installing them. When I went to fire her up to make a few needed
adjustments, the 3/4 bank carb, the 34 PDSIT 2 with all the idle controls on
it, spits gas at me when the engine turns over. She'll start, and run for a
few seconds and then die. What should I check? I just need her to run well
enough to get her to a real mechanic tomorrow morning, and if it is too
hard, I can always tow her with my trusty old truck. Any suggestions are
appreciated.
Danke,
--Kevin
