You CANNOT own too many vise grips--the real ones, not the
cheap-shit knock-offs.  I've got about ten different ones in my
collection.  I've bought ones that I didn't have the slightest idea

particular one was the BEST POSSIBLE tool for the job.
Can't own too many.  The perfect answer for that person bugging
you about what you "want for Christmas."
