Subject: London to Sydney overland in VW Buses

Me and a group of friends are planning an overland trip from London to Sydney in a couple of VW Buses. We're currently looking for vehicles - ideally VW T4s - the later the better (1979) at any rate. We've found one that's perfectly suited - complete with Westfalia-Helsinki interior kit. It's an automatic though - would this be problematic in terms of repair/wear & tear on the way. Ideas/theories/suggestions on the best type of vehicle to conduct this trip/offers of buses gratefully accepted. Cheers.
