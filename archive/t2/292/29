Subject: What I need 

I hope to put in the engine (2.0L '82) this weekend. But it'll still
be incomplete.

I changed from CA to Fed emissions exhaust so the driver side heat
exchanger has been changed. Unfortunately, this means that the pipe at
the rear of the heat exchanger that leads to the blower no longer
fits.

Does anyone have an '80-82 2.0L parts vehicle or parts engine with the
correct pipe? This is the metal pipe that connects to the driver side
heat exchanger and it  goes through the tin and connects to a plastic
pipe that routes above the fan and to a T pipe that goes to the blower
on the alternator.

Thanks.
