Subject: Engine stall

Hello Volks

I have been experienced some problems with my engine. Up hills, in the high
revolution zone and starts is very difficulty. I decided to check the electric
system and when I plugged the dwell meter to the coil terminal that comes from
the dizzy, the engine hesitate badly and almost die, then back to idle
normally when I unplugged the meter from the coil.
The facts:
Battery almost dead (by lack of use)
Points new 460 dwell angle
Timing 7.50 BTDC
Coil unknown but the spark is blue and strong in every cylinder
I tried the dwell meter in my other car and works fine, somebody has
experienced a problem like this?
I will appreciate any help in this subject.

Thanks in advance

From the sunny lands of Caracas Venezuela
