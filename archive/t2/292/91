What happens when if you ROLL the van? Your health is already in danger by 
the crash - but what about a heavy battery flying around in the bus with 
you and yours?

Steel clamps, bolts, battery boxes - all good.

Anyone know the driver of the bus that rolled his/her bus about a dozen 
times near Tazwell, TN recently? They walked away.

Basically the bus failed the MOOSE test but it is unknown if it was driver 
error or crummy tires. According to my friend it REALLY did some serious 
acrobatics in the process. Once again dual sway bars and 15 inch tires are 
looking GOOD!
