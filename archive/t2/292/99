Subject: Re: [T2] Carburetor assembly adhesive?

I would assume an epoxy type of adhesive would do the trick.  You could 
either add the epoxy-weld with the orifice tube in place, or you could add a 
bit, and then drill it out to an interference-fit.  A third option would be 
to have it bushed at a carburaetor shop.
