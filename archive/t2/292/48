When the boot rips, it's done for. It flexes quite a bit as the half shaft
rotates and when the rubber gets old cracks form easily.  Make one part
stronger, if you can, and the other end will surely rip.

The grease really has to be pressed in the joint itself.  When the
instructions say pack the extra grease into the boot I can only assume if
means "on" the joint in the boot end.  I can't see what good the grease will
do just sitting inside the boot as it gets flung to the inner surface as it
rotates.

You mean the flange? This should not have any travel in it but I don't know
how bad 1/8" movement is.  Normally bad for any kind of bearing.
