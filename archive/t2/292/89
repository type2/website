Hal,

Got preheater hose?<grin>

In my experience it helps a lot during the cold/hot transition.

You may wish to set your choke so that it stays engaged a little longer
before the bi-metallic spring inside gets warm and opens it fully.

I would adjust the choke in this manner until it worked right!

Cheers, dave
