Subject: rear wheel clunk

List,

Had the rears off yesterday to to my valves.

On the way to work today I get a clunk in the pass/rear wheel in synch with tire rotation under the following conditions:

1. Typically at speed, not accelerating, just holding speed.

2. While slowing/braking.

It is somewhat intermittant. Didn't hear it on the way to work or driving last night, but heard it on the way home.

Pulled the wheel at lunch, nuts were tight, spins by hand when out of gear, cv boots are okay, but cv's have never been inspected by me.

Whassup?

Billy
