Group 42 is stock, but Group 41 is larger capacity and fits fine as an 
upgraded alternative for maybe $10 more. The key to the life of the starter 
and alternator and battery is keeping the battery case clean. Your cables 
will never start to corrode if you do. When the top of the battery gets 
dirty and you add the acid vapors, you get cross cell amperage flow through 
the layer of acid and mineral grit/dust and it stresses the whole system. 
For some that means cleaning once per year, for others it may need a quick 
cleaning service every month or even week, like if you live at the end of a 
dirt road you travel daily.

It doesn't take 5 minutes. Flush it with water, sprinkle it with baking 
soda, brush it with a nylon brush, rinse it, blow dry it or paper towels, 
remove the cell plugs, then wipe the whole around the top bone dry and 
clean, rinse the caps, shake them out, several times, dry them and replace.

Takes me less than half an hour to clean the whole engine compartment if 
maintained clean, and keeping the oil/dust accumulation down will extend 
the life of all the plastic and rubber as well as reduce surface amperage 
leakage from all the terminals going on in there.
