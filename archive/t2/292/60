Subject: Head temp reading (i read the archive!)

Hi again folks,
Well, after reading many post in the archive I am not sure what to think 
about the head temperature reading with a VDO gauge!
I installed an oil temp gauge this summer; reading was at the most 210F 
on hot days and around 185 on normal day (70F). Yesterday I installed a 
head temp gauge from VDO on the #3 cylinder, under the spark plug, so I 
took the bus for a 100miles rides today (run's fine at highway speed and 
it doesn't ping at all, even with my carburetor problem!), my 73' 1700cc 
heads temp reads between 390F (with the wind) and 420F (Against the 
heavy wind) at highway speed (60mph), on secondary road with stop and 
go, the head temp average between 325F and 350F, at idle I get 280/300F. 
The oil temp was 150F at the most at all time!!!! The temperature 
outside today was 32F (On the cold side!!!).
Timing is fine (7.5 BTDC without retard vacuum), valves a well adjusted. 
Engine compression is between 110 and 120psi (a bit on the low side but 
equal).

 The cooling system was recently cleaned/rebuilt (head fins, cylinder 
fins, fan housing polish, fan fins polish, new functioning thermostat 
and cable, oil cooler cleaned, all metal thin cleaned, new engine seal 
and so on)
Carburetion is weak (see my other post) but running on the rich side! 
The outside temp was cold, what should I expect on a 80F day???
Am I the only one reading head temp over 400F?

I am preparing a trip to Mexico next February, by reading the archive I 
would say that those reading are a bit on the high side, I don't like 
it! But as my oil temp was never over 150F, I suspect a somewhat false 
reading. I have a tendency to say to myself; I bit above or bellow the 
central mark of a gauge is always fine!!!! I am a bit above on a cold 
day!!!!

I bought this bus in august, the engine is in the middle of is life; 
it's a "reman" engine by VW Canada. I don't have the time (to cold) to 
put my new rebuilt heads and cylinder so I will have to deal with this 
engine for my next trip to Mexico. I have 2 spare engines that I am 
rebuilding as we speak but no time to put those one on the bus.

Any advice on that reading!

Best regards, Ben
Ps.: #3 cylinder as the lowest reading!!!
