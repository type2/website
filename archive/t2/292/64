Being a Calif bus has nothing to do with it:)
Having a dual vacuum dist tells me it was built before the end of 12/75.
The engine has 3 vacuum sources on it.
1) Manifold vacuum nipple on the right side of the plenum between 1 + 2 intake
runners. This feeds the decel valve and the fuel pressure regulator. You need
a tee in the line.
2) Ported vacuum nipple on the front of the throttle housing [FRONT is
FRONT!]. This feeds the EEC valve on the air filter housing and the advance
side of the distributor. [the one pointing away from the dizzy]  You need a
tee in the line.
3) Manifold vacuum nipple on the rear of the throttle housing. This one ONLY
feeds the retard side of the distributor.
Remember: front is towards the windshield. The retard port on the throttle
housing is tough to find. It is below the idle speed screw and points under #1
intake runner.

Here is a site that shows it, except for the retard hose.

The retard hose was only used on 75, 76 to 12/75, and 79 Calif.
FI buses. ( yes, also on 74 Cal FI w/auto trans...but they are very rare)
