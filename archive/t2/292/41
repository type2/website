A 42 is a small cased battery. I use a 41 in my 77. Here is a Interstate
website that gives the specs:
 http://www.ibsa.com/www_2001/content/products/product_auto.asp
Scroll down to the import section.
The factory battery for USA buses was 54 AH.  Unfortunately, they do not give
that spec.... Only CCA and CA.  Supposedly, CA is AH but not when they give a
CA rating of 815 for the MT-41!
This site talks about battery sizes/specs but does not mention AH [Amp Hours].
