Subject: Oil Cooler Cleaning?

I have driven my type IV powered 73 Westy with oil leaking in various
degrees from "just a drop or 2" on up to a quart/200 miles.  Over the past 2
years my oil temps have gotten worse and worse and I'm thinking my oil
cooler is gummed up with oil/dirt/leaves.  Is there a feasible and effective
way to clean it without removing it or do I just need to get down and dirty
and pull the sucker?

Thanks.
