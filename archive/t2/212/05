Hi again

Well, I got Bessie-Lou's engine back in.  All it needs are the final adju=
stments, however:  I cannot get her muffler back on for the life of me! E=
verything was put back as it came off in that respect...  I did have a ti=
me getting the heater box on the left side on...  Now the exhaust ports a=
re about an half of an inch too close together it seems and hence that ol=
' muffler just will not go back on...  I just am at my wits end...
 Any helpful tips or suggestions?

Thanks =20

:)
