Well, he didn't quite make it. 

It seems that somewhere around Harrisburg, PA there
was some sort of mechanical failure; lots of smoke and
loss of power. The vehicle still runs but is
apparently quite crippled. Fortunately, he printed the
AIRS list and the guy he hooked up with set him up
with a nearby mechanic. He even loaned him his car to
drive the rest of the way to Maine! Unfortunately, the
mechanic can't look at it until the end of the week
and is then going on vacation the next week. So, he
may just have it trailered up here to Maine for repair
lest it sit in PA for a couple weeks.

What a bummer to not be able to play with a great, new
toy!
