Subject: Custom Bed & Re-doing interior (71 Westy)

I was wondering if you could get a bigger coushin in the very back of the bus?  I get rather annoyed by that spare tire hole back there, since mine is mounted on the front and I don't need one in the back.  I wanted to know if anybody made and seat cover setup that went over and covered that thing.  I wanted to do that so my bed will become a perfect rectangle shape, and I can have my Mommy (a seamestress) make me custom sheets and a blankee for it.  I really thought the idea was neat.

Also I want to re-do my interior.  The walls/roof covering is really bad and I was wondering if anybody had any recommendations on how to replace it.  Is there a kit from any body?  My Dad can do word work really well, so if I took the old stuff out we could copy it really well but what kind of wood should I use?  I was also thinking of doing the same for my cabinents, and the table tops.

Also I was considering a few mods to the bus too:

A sink that you don't have to pump is the first one since pumping mine is annoying

Being able to use the power outlet without plugging into an external power source

Maybe making the ice box into a refridgerator?

This is both for my high school's senior project and my future residence in the bus once I move out for college.

Any thoughts, ideas or suggestions?  Thanks for the help.
