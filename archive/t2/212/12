General thank you for the tip on Tire Black (not a brand name;-).
Tried it on some of my tired rubber window gaskets, and while 
not perfect, it did spruce up the looks of the ol' Bus...Didn't use
it on the tires tho'...Waitin' 'til my coffee can exhaust tip gets
attached so's my Bus can do 100 mph...
