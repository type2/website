Nick,

I see your point and agree with the use of a new cooler when rebuilding
(especially on a catastrophicly-failed motor).  But what I'm talking about
is cleaning the crud off of the outside of the cooler.  

I don't know how many old type IV engines (both bus and 914) that I've
pulled the sheetmetal off of and discovered the fins on the top side of the
oil cooler almost completely covered up with oily leaves and other debris.
This is what I want to clean.
