Subject: Re: [T2] baseline run  made  ??? is oil way to high??

Just finished a messy job.  After everything looked perfect and no tin 
probs found i pulled the sender.  I pulled another out of the bin and 
put them both and a thermometer in an oil bath and checked the readings 
from the senders.  no problems found there either then i noticed that 
one of the senders had the probe further up.  I installed that one and 
temps dropped 30 degrees.  the one style of sender wasnt picking up oil 
temp.
