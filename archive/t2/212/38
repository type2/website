Subject: Re: [T2] Dual batteries?

Battery bank is two or more batteries of same type, size, age, strapped 
in parellel as one big battery.    You  normally would not charge this 
from the vehicle alternator or even have anything that was attached the 
normal vehicle operations attached to these batteries.  Not in a small 
bus anyway.  The big RVs will have capabilities for that but not on a 
small bus.  Unless of course you have one that according to VW type 
lists was made with two alternators.  The ones i normally put in the 
conversion vans were either group 27 or group 31 deep cycle.  Usually 
two batteries but occassionally 3.  Note that in our VW vehicles this is 
a LOT of weight.  The 80/83 westy has room in the rear seat storage for 
3 batteries but there is no way i would use the alternator to charge 
that bank.  I would get a small 110v charger and plug the 110 into the 
outlet to charge up
