Subject: Hot, won't idle or start

Yes, I installed a hot start relay fix three years ago.

73 Westy, newish AVP motor (less than 3,000K), newish Solex carbs. Living in
Tucson, where it is hot, hot, hot. 

I don't drive it much this time of year, the airconditioner in the F*rd is
very seductive.. But I do try to run the bus every week or two. I've noticed
the past couple of months that the battery is losing its charge after a week,
ten days of no driving. Battery is two years old. 

When the engine gets really warm, (in-town driving or taking it up Mt.
Lemmon)it won't idle and dies if I take my foot off the gas. And it won't
start up again unless I pop it. This was very exciting driving down the
mountain, pulling over to let traffic pass and then popping the clutch to get
her going again as I tried to not drive over the edge. Obviously, I
succeeded..

Oh Bus Gurus: I think the battery may be bad, which I know what to do about.
But I don't think that is the problem with the idle when it is hot. Any ideas?


Thanks!
