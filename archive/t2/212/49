i have a 70 westy and i found this rectangular piece of board with
rounded corners in my bus when i bought it... had 4 clips around the
edges. i asked my friend pete what it was cuz i couldnt figure it out. he
told me it was a piece designed to cover the spare tire hole so you dont
fall in. sure enough, it fits perfectly!!! wouldnt be too hard to
fabricate more, if you could find some clips.

unfortunately, the cushion is still the normal size. i think my friend
dawn (vwtankgirl) suggested getting some foam from somewhere (fabric
stores sell cushions, but not sure how big they get) and making a bigger
cushion. i plan to, since a few of the seats have little tears and stuff
already, so they need to be recovered anyway (eventually)

the suggestion made to make an extra cushion for that section sounds
great to me. i may try it until i can make a new BIGGER cushion. 

thanks for the idea!!!
