4-6 reading the voltage across the bus' fuel pump wires connected or disconnected, as it doesn't matter.

Why would you see a difference in voltage?

I was only able to get this pressure via a remote battery supplying the pump with a decent 12volts.

Never touched it.

The double relay switches 12volts to the pump right? I'm only getting 6. Will do the Bentley double relay test procedure today.
