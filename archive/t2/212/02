When I said "capacity", that's what I meant.

I WAS paying attention.  I used the original fuel pump spacer with my new 
brazilian pump which, if the part was really a "replacement" pump as 
advertised, should have resulted in the proper pressure.  The pump was 
obviously not designed to the specs of the original pump, and to me that 
makes it a piece of crap.  The fact that it also leaked gas *and* oil just 
reinforced my opinion.  After installing it I brought the pressure down 
with an external regulator (did I mention I was paying attention?) but the 
pump still failed after a measly 30k miles, approximately.  If you want a 
quality fuel pump, don't bother with this Brazilian pump from the Bus Depot 
- it's a waste of $40.

p.s. This is not meant as a flame to Bus Depot.  I'm sure they weren't 
aware of the low quality of this pump and I appreciate them at least 
selling parts that will fit my bus.
