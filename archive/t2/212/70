You know, that is actually a valid point. If the oil and gas fire didn't
do it along with the paint, the fumes coming off the interior from its
original '70s (or earlier/later) owners would probably also do its
damage.

Of course all this talk of Halon wrecking the atmosphere when you
compare 
the damage of one extinguisher to the pollution one burning VW van would

create....
