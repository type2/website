Subject: 68 Westy brake fluid resevoir?? 

Hey all, well I am finally getting the old 68 back on the road, and
getting all those pesky little things out of the way, and now I am in
need of the master cylinder resevoir, has the threads on the bottom for
the line that goes to the master, and is kind of U shaped on the rear of
the resevoir to. if you happen to have one, please let me know what you
might want for it, it doesnt have to be brand new or anything, just
useable...thanks..Brian
