We sell brand new pumps built by the Pierburg division of Kolbenschmidt
(who, like Bosch, is an OE supplier to Volkswagen).  The Pierburg pump is
comparable in quality to the Bosch.  (I recall perhaps 2 defectives ever,
out of many hundreds sold; even in those cases I am very skeptical that
there was really a defect, but Pierburg took them back no questions asked.).
The Pierburg pump differs from the Bosch in very minor respects.  The main
differences are that it is a tad smaller and is encased in a rubber shield
(which reduces noise/vibration).  It also uses a different terminal
connector from the Bosch, but includes an adapter for your existing wire so
it is easy to install.

Our price $143 with listmember discount.  This is for new, not rebuilt, and
it is not made in Brazil.  No core deposit, of course.  Our part number
GFP301.
