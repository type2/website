Berg did not have a wind tunnel
Berg did not have a rolling dyno

He did have an engine dyno.....

His bus that he said had 100,000 miles on it with no repairs was BS as he 
kept taking it apart for "inspection"

Gene had some good ideas, and some crazy ideas
but he put them all down on paper and sold them as his "bible"

Question what you read there, and also most of them were done 10-20 years ago 
without any feedback from the rest of the VW public

No internet back then to hash around ideas !

Back to the original question , the bigger top airscoops cool better
and VW did not put in the owners manual to drive with your windows UP  !
