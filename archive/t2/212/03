Subject: More living in a bus questions

I was wondering if anybody on the list has ever been a
ski bum living in a bus? This is my plan for next
winter and am wondering how people who do this manage.
I am thinking of telluride ski resort in colorado. I
saw a pbs documentary a while ago about a guy who
lived in a school bus up there and he had two or three
neighbors that were probably busses. They were covered
with about two feet of snow so they could have been
other vans. 
Later,
