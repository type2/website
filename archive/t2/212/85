Subject: Engine in!

List,

Just finished installing Sande's engine, and running it in, and seating the 
rings a little ;-) and boy am I tired but the satisfaction and a bit of 
money isn't bad either. It looks great and runs great, though dialing in the 
idle after rebuilding the carb was a chore (and probably not done yet). But 
very satisfying, the whole experience.

I never did get a pair of the proper clamps for the heater box junction 
(where the little, rear-cylinder box and the main one get friendly) It is 
passing air down there and I need to get it done, but still have to 
fabricate a seal. Will the air dams in the fan make sure enough air gets to 
the cylinders? Can it wait until 300 miles or do I call the thing out of 
service (yikes, sounds like a recall)?

Glad to have put one more on the road again,
Mick McQuilton
Aspen, CO
