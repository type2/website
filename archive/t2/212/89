Lee,

Yup.  The price of admission, tho is ~$150.  About the cost of a tune up.
That $150 does not go in a plain envelope to me, tho.  It goes to a
variety of tune-up instrument sources.

You need:

A dwell meter.  You really cannot live without one.  Someone (Barry?)
recently found a discontinued SunPro modle on sale, discontinued, for <
$20.  Buy one.

Timing light, buy a $50 basic one without the digital advance crap.  Nice,
but you don't need it.

Vacuum gauge.  Should be about $20.  If you want to combind purchases, buy
a Mity-Vac.  You can use the gauge on that as a vacuum gauge.

If you have $60 more, buy an FI fuel pressure gauge.

Tools in hand, head out to the bus and connect the vacuum gauge to the
vacuum port between cylinders 1 & 2.  While someone cranks the engine,
read the vacuum.  Less than 10"? then trace every hose off the main air
hose to its terminus.  Especially check the hose leading to the aux air
valve at the right rear corner of the engine.

Then go to the library (www.type2.com) and print the articles on setting
dwell and timing.  Set, or at least check, the dwell and timing.

If you are coming to HCBF, I will be teaching a seminar on setting dwell
and timing there. come on Saturday at 11:00 and I will lecture till the
audience wanders away or my voice gives out :-)
