Rattley noise when clutch pedal is out and bus in neutral = idler bearing
going bad (I had this symptom, but it went away, I think that I also now
have a leak in my oil seal that has lubricated it).

Whiney noise when clutch pedal in = throw out bearing going bad (I have been
driving like this for more than a year, I think that my leaky oil seal
lubricates it when it warms up).

I dunno about all this.  Does it shift in and out at all.  It will not move
in neutral?  Engine running?  How did you replace the rear coupling without
taking the engine out?  Maybe you over adjusted the clutch so that it will
not engage completely and you misadjusted the shifter so that it is stuck in
gear?  Either that or you have transmission problems, maybe you need to
rebuild the nosecone.

Every time mine has had hard shifting, it has been to the clutch cable too
loose.  I have replaced the front bushing and disassembled, cleaned,
relubed, and reassembled most of the shift linkage towards the front.  The
'72 has that one year only short shaft in the back.
