Subject: HCBF - Leaving Chapel Hill/Durham Thursday night

Hello,
  If anyone else is leaving Thursday night from Chapel Hill/Durham for the
HCBF and wants to carabus with us, let me know.  My parents will be in their
Eurovan and I'll be in my bus.  We're planning on leaving around 6 or
6:30pm.  BTW, does anyone remember if the camp ground has fire pits to grill
on and will drums/drum circles be allowed?
Thanks,
Dallas
