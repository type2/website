Billy,

32-35 psi is about correct.  IT will actually start and idle
down to about 22psi...Don't ask how i know!

4-6volts at fuel pump with fuel pump disconneted? or connected and 
running?

Disconnected, you should see full voltage on the wires.

Billy, if you have 32-35, it should start.
Did you get the main FI plug back into the ECU nice and tight?
No bent pins?

Trigger wire from coil to ecu on the correct coil connector?

Hmmmmmmmm, still gotta be something simple(yeah, right).

Might be double relay...as in unplug and replug to clean contacts a 
little.

Cheers, dave
