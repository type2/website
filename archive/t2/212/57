I'm glad to see that others have had good luck with H&R also.  Mine has 
been working perfectly for about five years now since they rebuilt it, and 
it was just over $70 (I'm local so I didn't have to pay 
shipping).  Specialty shops like H&R are almost extinct today - I hope 
everyone needing booster repair will consider using H&R.
