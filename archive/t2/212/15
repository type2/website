Loosed all the exhaust port nuts, then install the muffler loosely, then 
tighten all fastener in turn until all are tight. If that doesn't work, you 
have non-spec somewhere. Did you check the deck heights?? If the cylinder 
bases in the case have been cut several times, you must use thicker base 
gaskets to reset the cylinders out properly. I've seen aftermarket mufflers 
and such which were in fact uninstallable due to being way out of wack with 
a real VW.
