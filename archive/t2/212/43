Chris,

it has been many years since i traveled down that road & memory is
very hazy. but what i do remember of the Natchez Trace is that
there is _nothing_ for miles!

that was a long time ago so there might be more going on out
there now.

& yes, some very interesting history!

good luck,

Joel Wilson
