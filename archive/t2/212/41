I can hardly wait!

Way back in high school, I did a research paper on the Natchez Trace.  That was long before the Natchez Trace Parkway was completed from Natchez to Nashville.

The first week of August, I am going to New Orleans for a national conference, for which I am in charge of education.  I will take Lurch down the Natchez Trace Parkway from Nashville and take two or three days doing it (from 8/5 to 8/8).  Naturally, I'll take the AIRS list.  Does anyone have any recommendations for stops/things to do/places to see/people to meet?  This is my first trip down the parkway.
