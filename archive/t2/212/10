Richard,

Go find a vwflaps.  In Austin, there should be a ton of them.

The one about 40 miles from me has about 15 different size hoses
on reels on the wall...this is in a town one tenth the size of Austin....

Already replaced mine as it fell of one night shortly after I got the bus 
running.

Cheers ,dave
