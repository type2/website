Save your $22 and go to Tractor Supply Co. or most Co-Ops. They sell paint 
by the gallon and by the rattle can in all the popular  tractor colors like 
John Deer Green and Ford Blue and Ford Grey and a nice red Massey Ferguson 
color.

Seriously I used their paint on a VW Beetle pan with good results. Fairly 
durable even... Mine has been on my Beetle that has alternately been store 
inside and out and it is still rust free. I used their primer as well.

$15 a gallon last time I bought it.

Good paint for somebody on a budget.
