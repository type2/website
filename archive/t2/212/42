Subject: top end rebuild and compression

Well, several weeks of rebuilding work finally culminated yesterday.  I
started the engine after my first shot at rebuilding and... it worked!
She started up the first time!  I ran the engine for 20 minutes (-at-)2000
rpm as recommended by Tom Wilson to break it in.  I had some problems
getting it to idle at the correct rpm since the engine would die under
about 1100 rpm.  Today, I realize that this was probably due to the fact
that I forgot to reconnect the air flow meter cable.  (Duh!  That one hit
me in the shower this morning).

Anyway, yesterday, I didn't realize this so I started investigating.  My
wonderful wife helped crank the motor while I did compression readings and
here's what I got (1/2/3/4 order): 100/110/90/100psi.  I was somewhat
disappointed, since I had replaced the heads with rebuilt ones from AVP
and re-ringed the pistons.  Wear on the p&c's looked good (actually
borrowed a micrometer from a coworker), so I kept the old ones and
cleaned the heck out of em.  With the old setup I had: 110/110/0/110psi
before the rebuild (dropped valve seat in #3 was the reason for the rebuild).

My question is: shouldn't my compression be a bit higher?  I was expecting
something like 120-130 all the way around.  Why would mine be so "low"?
Is there something I may be missing which is causing a small compression
leak?
