Me too.  The current price is $1,000 and the reserve has been met!  Seems 
an incredible bargain for that price, if it's solid.  I showed the picture 
on Ebay to my wife last night and she said, "No way" would she be seen in 
it (this from a woman who has no problem being seen in my beat-up Safare 
highroof).  I agree with her that it is ugly, but I think it could be 
improved.  Lose the red bumper color, lose the Ford V-6 engine in favor of 
a Raby stroker, replace the highroof with a full-length one, get original 
hubcaps.  And my mind goes nuts thinking about the neat camper floorplans I 
could build with that extra space!

But the longer wheelbase and higher weight would make it a better highway 
cruiser.  :)

I bet the V-6 engine is responsible for that.  It's heavy.  It's also not 
very efficient.  I have owned... three of those engines in my lifetime.  In 
a '72 Capri, they would be lucky to get 20 on the highway.  In that bus, 
going 70, I would guess it would get 12mpg.  Ugh.  It also has a 
trouble-prone water pump design and those flimsy tin valve covers that will 
never seal properly.  Despite those flaws I loved that engine in my 72 and 
73 Capris but it would be the last motor I would want in a bus.
