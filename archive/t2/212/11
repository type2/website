Subject: [T2] Bizarre mutant VW-Ford Stretch! 

Being just as weird as the next VW bus pilot,
this thing intrigues me in an illogical sort of
way.  I'm sure it would be a bear to drive. 
Aligning the frames and adjusting suspensions for
this radical of a modification is not something I
imagine the average mechanic or even engineer is
capable of doing.  

I assume everyone has seen the other famous
stretches by Otmar:  http://www.evcl.com/vw/  
The link to his stretched loaf is hard to find: 
http://www.evcl.com/vw/Main/oldstretch.jpg

Notice that in the ebay strech loaf the rear
suspension geometry looks wrong and in the new
stretch the front looks broken or lowered.  (I
would drive it in either condition.)  

Can't help but wonder that if you really need an
extra few feet, wouldn't you be better off
getting a long Ford, Chevy or Dodge.  The Dodges
come in one version that is about sixty foot long
from the factory.  (Just kidding, a little.)

Peace and blessings,
