Volks,

Richard Atwell reminds me that it was him who found the sale. Way to go
Richard!!! The address for all the tools that he found and that Andy found
is:

www.actron.com

Go to:
Sunpro then
Garage Sale (top, center of page)
Test & Tune
Digital Engine Multimeter - CP7676GS

That said, I decided to bring some to High Country, so if you are planning
to be there and want to take a chance, I ordered 10 of them and will bring
them for sale (if they get here in time).  The Actron store wants 14.95
per plus 5.97 shipping for UPS ground for a total of $20.92.  I ordered 10
and paid for 2nd day air ($28.25). So *if* they get here, and *if* I get
there, they would be $20 from me ($14.95 + 1/10tho of $28.28 (or 2.83) +
$2.77 making-change charge (I hate making change :) for a total of $20.
So wait up, take the chance, and save a whopping 92 cents!!!!!

Seriouly, I did order, and will have them if you want them.  And believe
me, you *need* one of these!!!  Dwell, tach, volts, ohms all in one small
box.  Barry bought a couple back a bit, I got one from him and I would
sooner part with my <deleted> than this pup.
