Subject: Re: [T2] brake booster

When I replaced my m/c, it was braking fine, I knew that it was going to die
eventually, I am pretty  sure it was the original, 30 year old m/c.  My
booster was full of water/brake fluid?  I cleaned it with rubbing alcohol.
When I put the new m/c on, I discovered the booster was then shot.  I sent
it to H&R.  Now everything is fine.  I wonder if I will discover fluid in my
booster in a few years.  My m/c came from Brazil.

The only way that I can see that the brake fluid can get into the booster
would be from a m/c leak.  There is no other possibility.

I am also certain that, since the booster is connected the intake manifold,
one can get gasoline/air/exhaust fumes/??? in there as well.  The H&R guy
says that often gasoline kill boosters.

I cannot help but think that there is a slow fluid leak from the m/c in this
case.  Not enough to affect braking, but enough to accumulate in the booster
with time.
