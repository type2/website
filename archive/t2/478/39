Subject: RE: [T2] Empi nylock engine nut kits

  Made in Taiwan, really soft nuts and the washers, well!. I have used them
and they did work, I just didn't like the feel, thats just a personal thing
to me. I also have had German nylocks that stip out at 16 ft lbs of torque.

ronnie  use what you need

Is there any reason to NOT use the Nylock nut kits from Empi on my Type1
1600 engine case? At 6.95 for a complete new nut set, I'm very tempted to
use them. Would appreciate any reasons pro or con about using them, from
those who have.
