Subject: 78 Westy; filler neck hose

As a preventative maintenance procedure while my engine is out...
I found the filler neck to tank hose cracking. The hose is removed and 
sitting on the bench...I called local VW parts house and they don't have it 
available...
Question:
Okay to use regular fuel neck hose from Napa that is straight without a 
manufacture bend...This hose seems flexible/plyable enough or do you think it will 
kink too much? I guess the best thing to do is try. 
Although the hose they sell at Napa does seem to be a little stiffer...Anyone 
found a new molded one?
