Subject: Re: [T2] Pardon My Gas

Here are some I have experience with,,, JB Weld says resistant.... Goop
says resistant... but Seal-all claims to be not affected by gasoline...
THe local FLAPS highly recommends Seal-all,, I used it on a gas tank
filler neck 2 years ago, and it is still like the day I put it on...
