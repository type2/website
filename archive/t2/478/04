Chris,

You haven't lived untill you've seen all of the little old ladies
in the train station in Paris at 10am on Sunday morning having a beer 
before they board the train for a visit to the grandkids in the country.

Mandatory bus content:  This was 30 years ago when I drove around 
Europe in my 67 panel van that I bought in Koln, Germany from an ad
in the newspaper.

Even in my latest visit to Germany, we had beer at lunch before we 
did a plant tour....we consider beer before/during lunch a little weird
someplaces....thanks to our ancestors and the women's temperance movement.

You never saw any one in Europe pass anything similar to the 21'st
amendment did you?....Why?...the answer doesn't require a list 
reply<grin>....left as an exercise for the student...

Cheers, dave
