cover for my small car doesn't have grommet holes to tie to so I do have

Thanks,

My cover is the Bus Depot Stormshield, and it came with grommet holes (one
at each of the sides) installed.  There is also a flap of fabric on the
inside of the grommet hole so that your rope or other fastening means does
not rub on the bus - nice touch!
