Hi Rob,

A friend of mine has a similar cherrypicker truck. He uses it as a
promotional vehicle for the VW Euro event in the Netherlands.
In the weeks prior to that event we could use it for our own meeting this
year as eyecatcher. A real cool vehicle and it too is in good working order!

Look at the several pages of our event for some pics of it.
http://www.vct2.nl and choose clubfoto's. Scroll down for Najaarsmeeting
Naarden 2003 and pics of this cherrypicker truck are all over the four pages
covering this clubevent.
