This is VERY classic for "one of your vacuum hoses has come loose."  Have
you taken a vacuum reading lately?

This is, of course, never a bad thing to do but I would check vacuum.  If
your vacuum is over 15" I would check the dwell angle and the timing.  I
would say that well over 99% of the "FI problems" that I see are actually
vacuum or ignition problems. Of course, then I would recommend freshening
all your electrical connections or at least dis- and re-connecting them.

I use a compound called "Noalox".  It is an anti-oxidation and anti-sieze
compound for aluminum wiring and it (or an analog) is available at any
electrical supply house. While it is not specific for copper or for
automotive use it does seem to work.  The problem with being definite is
that I have not seen any cars 30 years later after I used this treatment
on them (yet).

                             OOK!
