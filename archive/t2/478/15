Subject: Spring Tension

Hello All,

I am wondering if anyone knows if there is a "correct" tension for the
spring that attaches from the throttle to the accelerator cable. My
spring died this weekend.

A scouring of my FLAPS yielded no results. I did managage to find a
multiple choice kit to at CarQuest. I found one in this kit that was
close to the right length, but the wire was significantly thicker. Now
the accelerator seems hard to press. I don't know if this is a result of
the old one being stretched/weak before dying, or if the current one is
"too strong".

Mr. Bananahead is a FI 1976.

Any advice would be appreciated.

Thanks,

--kevin--
