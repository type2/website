Subject: Re: [T2] Hidden Stereo

When I bought my '79 it didn't have a stereo mounted and had the original
"panel" covering the hole - basically it's a curved square flap of sheet
metal covered in vinyl.  It has two screws on the bottom corners that go into
the dash --- anyway I thought it would be cool to leave the flap in
place and create a "secret panel" when I installed a stereo.  I put a
piano hinge on the top of the flap and ground off the pointy bits of those
two screws.  Now I simply lift up the panel to turn on the stereo or
change tapes and the flap rests back down again, looking like a dashboard
panel.  Two break-ins and stereo is still there.

Now if I could figure out how to perfect the thief-activated ejector
seat....
