Subject: Cylinder Head Sale !

Dear vw friends-
I am still here !
Some of you may know I am involved in a serious
legal situation, and I thank those of you who cared
to wish me well and provide support when I needed it.
I have had no time to participate here, and the list
flies by every day, it was very hard to keep up the
last two months, and I can only read a few posts daily.
I am going through significant changes in lifestyle,
and trying very hard to protect my ass(ets)from theft,
and keep what I can. I am a survivor:)
I have lost considerable personal posessions, but I am
happy to report that diligence (and surveillance:) have
sucessfully thwarted the wholesale theft of my business.
Tonite I have an immediate need for cash.
I am offering a set of your choice of cylinder heads
for your choice of payment. I have sets of OG heads,
rebuilt and powdercoated black hi-temp.
The T1 heads are mildly ported and include new guides,
3-angle valve seat cuts, valves, springs, and shims.
Stainless valves and stiffer springs are optional too.
I have both single port and dual port heads.
I have most every kind of aircooled T4 heads.
Let me know what you need, and make an offer.
If you like to haggle, and need these things, this is
your opportunity. You will not be disappointed!!!
If you want to know what's been going on, drop me a p-mail.
It is snowing here in western NY, and we need heat!!!
I'm glad to see most of you are still out there tonite !

Dave \X/










I can also supply stainless valves
