Subject: Flywheel shims

Greetings,

I am getting ready to put a '79 2.0L in to my '78 Westy resoration project.  
I plan to remove the flywheel to replace what I think is a leaky front main 
crankshaft seal. I had the engine rebuilt and fully balanced 60k miles ago. 
Ran great when pulled and compression was 108 to 120psi on all 4.

Are there any online instructions for this main seal replacement procedure? 
I've read something about crocus cloth??? Archives reval little to me. Just 
trying to visualize it all before I start.

And all the "zero endplay" talk got me to wondering if I should use new 
shims? or if I can reuse the ones that are on there? I think I know the 
answer.

Also, the end play tool looks like it would be pretty easy to make. Has 
anyone made one? I can't see paying $30 for a tool I would only use once 
every ten years (at least I hope). Maybe I am just cheap.

For those who are wondering I am also doing the following while the engine 
is out:

New clutch stuff
New pilot shaft bearing
New starter bushing
cleaning and painting cooling tin
new vacuum hoses
restore fuel tank
new fuel lines, sender unit, and filler neck
repack CVs and replace boots
Perhaps a few pushrod tube seals
New engine compartment seal

Anything else?
I wonder about the heads (AMC) and the Alternater. But they both seemed fine 
when the engine was removed? Comments?

Many thanks,
