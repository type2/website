Subject: Gas Heater For Sale

I have an Eberspacher BA-6 that was removed from my recently plurchased 1978 
Campmobile.  I'm not sure if it was working or not at the time it was removed. 
 My mechanic tells me that the fuel pump and glow plug both work fine.  
I will sell the heater, pump, and glow plug for $200.00

Thanks -  jotmk(-at-)aol.com
