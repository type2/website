I don't think such a site exists. If you like you can
send me the part numbers and I can look up for you
what they are used for.

You can get a clue by looking at the numbers. The 4th
digit tells you to which group the part belongs:

1 - engine
2 - fuel and exhaust system
3 - transmission
4 - front axle / steering
5 - rear axle
6 - wheels and brakes
7 - cables and pedals
8 - body
9 - electrical
0 - accessories

for example the nr of the VW emblem on the front:

  211 853 601 E

211 = it is a Type 2 part
8 = group: bodywork
