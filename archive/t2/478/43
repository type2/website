I agree with this wholeheartedly. And beware of any fastener that has no
hardness markings on it.

The large case studs are a critical fastener and are hard, class 10.9 I
believe. You want to have all parts of the fastener (nut, stud, washer) the
same hardness, which is why the nyloc nuts will strip when torqued on a stud
that is much harder. Nyloc nuts are usually class 5.6, not hard enough for
anything except holding a fender on.

The fasteners that came on a VW are superb. I re-use everything I can on a
project. Here is an example - try to find wavy washers that are close to the
ones found on the VW engine case. It is difficult. Yes, 8mm wavy washers are
available, but the ones I have found are never as good as the OG ones. They
are too soft, or too hard and brittle, or the OD is too small, or the ID is
too big, it is always something.

It is also amazing how many of the OG fasteners are still available for VW,
and not expensive either. The other day I bought the special fender  for VW
for less than the mail-order places charge, and they are much better than
the ones sold in the aftermarket.
