John,

As I recall EVERYTHING is wired through the ignition switch. There 
are two types of circuits : switched and unswitched.

+runs from the battery to the ignition switch.
When you turn the key to start it sends power to the starter and 
feeds the switched and unswitched + to the fuse box as well as 
everything else.

When you release the key back to the run position it cuts out the 
starter circuit but feeds + to switched and unswitched.  I am pretty 
sure some of the circuits are routed through the headlight switch but 
it varies from year to year so consult your Bentley of the wiring 
diagrams on www.vintagebus.com.

Drop your fuse block down and inspect the wires for burns and chars. 
Check all the fuses as well. Pull the ignition switch and check for 
burns and chars. Pull your headlight switch because lots of stuff 
goes through it as well. Also inspect the wires in the engine room 
that ground out the oil pressure switch, feed + to the coil and 
solenoid on the carb.

Check the type 2 library. There is some good info on removing the 
ignition switch and replacing the electrical part of the switch.

Good luck
