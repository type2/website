Subject: Towed Home today, pully fell off.... Why???

why is it that pullys fall off VW motors.. I have a 70
bus w;/ the upright.. PO had the same problem,
overheated it and left it to rot for 7 yrs before i
came along and saved it..

anyhow its a good thing that i upgraded my AAA
membership to the plus program, where i got a free tow
of over 50 miles..

my road trip today was 140 miles round trip, ran like
a champ until my pully broke, and of course i wanted
to pull it off the freeway after finding the problem,
then i think she over heated causing the 1-2 cyl to
pull from case a little .. im assuming because this is
the same prob i fixed when i bought it not running
from PO..

Why do pullys fall off.. everything seemed fine.. 

peace,,
