Subject: Re: [T2] vacuum, PCV hose & carb tuning

UPDATE (regarding the missing hose): I received a response from the
provider of the pictures on the link:
---
well, this hose is a "breather" hose (over pressure from the engine
goes into the air cleaner carying a bit of oil also):
http://www.benplace.com/weber/weber4.jpg It goes from the breather box
(black,  top of engine) to the under side of the air cleaner box, what
you call the "BIB" (i guess) is simply a plastic elbow. Go to NAPA or
any other auto part, ask for a 1/2(Inside Diameter) """oil resistant"""
hose, about 2.5 feet.  They will also cary all kinds of elbow
adaptor...

It doesn't sound like a real participant in the vacuum issue. I'll be
"carb cleaner" vacuum testing next. Any suggestions?
