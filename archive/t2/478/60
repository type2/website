If you are familiar with Peek Performance VW in Lanham just off the beltway,
they must have one of those cheap ones that you hold together with a pair of
pliers. Sounds hokey but they work great. I've used this one for at least 10
years of cylinder replacements on 2 old cars. Shouldn't cost more than $10.
(Shouldn't cost more than $3 really). Or maybe you can get one from a flaps.
