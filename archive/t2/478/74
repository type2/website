Subject: Thanks and Goodbye for now

Volks,
Just wanted to thank everyone for their help on fixing up my buses over the 
past couple of years.  My 1981  just drove off this afternoon without me.  
Amazing how attached you get to these things I was pretty sad. So I'll be off the 
T2 list till spring or summer when I try to find a late 70's sunroof van.  
Till then I'll be playing with the wasserleaker.   Thanks for all your help
Cheers
Kevin
