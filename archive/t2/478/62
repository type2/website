Subject: Re: old air cleaner with Weber Carbs?

James et al:  What a coincidence. I just sat down to post a question 
to the list and I find that James has  asked first. He for a Weber, 
me for Kadrons.

In my case, I just mounted a pair of Kadrons on my 1776 and I am 
replacing the "stock" Kadron air cleaners with  smaller cone-shaped 
ones make it easier to install the engine.  On the original Kadron 
cleaners, there was a port on the right hand cleaner top.  One could 
lead a braided line from this port to the port on the oil filler to 
suck vapors from the crankcase. Alternately, one could route the 
vapors through the cannister.

On the new air cleaners, there is no such port.

One possibility would be that I drill the cap on the new ones and 
weld a port there.

Has anyone else faced the situation that James and I find myself in? 
How did you handle it?

Jack
