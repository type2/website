Subject: Re: [T2] outside storage...

A buddy of mine inherited (i.e. it was being thrown away) that appears to be 
in
not so bad shape...He won't be able to get to it for some time and talked me
into stashing it in my back yard. OK, now I can cover it and do a few/many
things to preserve it as best I can but I'm curious about controlling the rust
on the undercarraige (particularly the front beam which poking and sticking
shows to be substantially solid)...Any tips...Since if my buddy is consistant
with his projects, I may well end up as owner a few/many months down the
road... ?-)

TIA
