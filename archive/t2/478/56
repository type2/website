Subject: Re: [T2] When Temp Sensor II Goes Bad

The failure mode all resisistors I have observed has been for the resistance 
to increase beond its nominal value. The temp sensors increaseing in value 
would cause a rich running condition.  Are your plugs sooty?
Tail pipe black?

If the wire from the sensor (to the ECU) is open, the fuel conditon would be 
very rich. If the wire from the sensor is short to ground the fuel condition 
would be very lean.
