       I am new to the list & Type 2 ownership as 9/10/03 I bought  a '70 bus 
[Sportsmobile/penthouse] with the plan of taking the winter monthhs to rehab 
it as our vacation home.  I bought a car cover tent [$100.00 (-at-) BJs] which 
stands on its own can be driven into & out of.
       While most of the posts are more technical than my abilities,  
Immediately had all engine seals & hoses replaced & new brakes installed.  I am 
enjoying learning all the things that can [& most likely will] go wrong.  I hope to 
stay current & knowledgeable. One of the first things I will do is install 
retractible seat belts.
