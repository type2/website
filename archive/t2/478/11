Subject: RE: [T2] VW SAUSAGES in WALL STREET JOURNAL

Sorry it's not Friday yet, but is anyone traveling to Wolfsburg, Germany 
soon?  If so, can you bring back some of these VW Currywursts?  Suddenly, I 
really need to have one.

Ok...mandatory bus content:
If I place a currywurst wrapped in foil between the 3 and 4 cylinders, how 
fast and long do I need to drive to fully cook/heat the sausage?  Can I 
toast the bun likewise? If spite of the Berg gage rant, will the CHT gage 
provide an accurate reading on cooking temp?
