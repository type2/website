I may have one laying around but I doubt I stull have
the screws. You might try calling the original
supplier of the Westy parts to VW.  The phone number
is on their website: www.deltasix.com

Happy Friday.. I need help here..
there is a square plate that goes around the
exterior 110 electrical inlet.  It has 3 screws that
screw it and a foam gasket to the body.  
My body shop lost mine and I can't find another at
all.
Anyone have one or know where I can get one?

 If anyone's headed to the junkyard this weekend,
 keep me in mind  :)
