Subject: Re: [T2] wiper caps

> 73 Westy.. are there caps to cover the exposed bolt on the windshield wipers (end of shaft-wiper arm bolt)?
I ordered some but they actually go below the wiper arm (over shaft bolt). thanks.. Friday is only a day away.

Are your wiper arms silver or black?

Silver:  the hold down nuts are silver acorns.

Black:   the nut is a standard nut and there is a black cap that covers the hole. Same as on later bugs.

If you need a couple of black caps, let me know..... I grab them everytime I see them at the yards.
