Subject: thanks for input

I wanted to thank everyone for their input with my fuel problems, especially 
Richard, Chris and Corbett.
What started out as a seeminly innocent effort to replace the fuel filler 
neck has become a much grander effort, which I suspect is going to require 
replacing the metal fuel line from the tank to the filter, as well as all 
the typical fuel parts. I'll post when I get it all straightened out.

Thanks
Mat
