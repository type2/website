Subject: Looking for original VW stereo resource.

Well as luck would have it (or wouldn't as the case may be) my '78 Westy
was broken into last night.  The perps jimmied open the passenger wing
vent, rolled down the window and unlocked the door.  They got an
inexpensive Kenwood CD deck (which they will have to try and figure out
the four digit lock code for since they disconnected the power) and two
Kenwood speakers out of the doors.  Fortunately they were nice enough to
remove the items cleanly and didn't do any damage to the camper.

 

Which brings me to my question.  I know there is a web source out there
for original stock VW stereos but I can't seem to track it down.  Does
anyone know what I am referring to and have the URL?  Looks like a
vintage stealth install is in the cards for me.


Thanks in advance,


Duke
