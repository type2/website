The ignition switch draws unswitched and unfused power from a jumper in
the fuse box.  If you threw a direct short there it is quite possible that
you damaged the electrical portion of the ignition switch.  The hazard
light switch draws unswitched but fused power from a nearby location in
the fuse box and it is less likely that you have damaged that switch but
it is possible that you have blown a fuse.

Check for 12V at terminal 30 on the hazard light switch. If there is no
power there then check the fuse box for blown fuses.  The power to the
emergency signal switch is constant but it is also fused. Also check the
power to your overhed lights as these also draw power through the same
fuse.

If you go to:

and look at the wiring diagram you will see the red/white wire entering
the fuse box.  Follow the current across the 8A fuse and you will see two
red wires leading from that fuse.  The larger one goes to the emergency
flasher switch and the smaller one goes to the overhead light.

                             OOK!
