Subject: 9th Annual Mid-Atlantic Holiday Fest : Dec 6 2003

Less than a month away, all are welcome. 

1-5 Pm, December 6.
7001 Westmoreland Ave 20912 (use Mapquest). This is in
the Washington DC area, inside the Beltway. Very close
to I-95, about an hour from I-70. If you are lost, 301
270 8073.

Please bring a food/drink thing to share. 

We will also have some nice doorprizes this year. Any
vendors wishing to add to the pile of loot, please
email me or just go ahead and ship to the above
address if you cannot attend.

If you are coming from far afield, we have room for a
few campers in the driveway, there is also a
commercial campground nearby:

This has traditionally been a family event, providing
an opportunity for our significant others to compare
notes on their partner's compulsions, and for kids to
visit Washington DC. 

This is always a good opportunity to hookup and trade
parts, but no setting up tables in the driveway :-).

If you haven't attended before, we typically end up
with about 25-30 buses from splits to eurovans. One
year we got 19 vehicles in my driveway! For
descriptions and pictures from  past Mid-Atlantic
Holiday Bus Fests, see Tom C.'s page:

No need to RSVP, but if you think you will come please
reply to this message so we can get a vague headcount.


Hope to see you there,

Tom F.
