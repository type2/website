Subject: I am to the pont..

Well this has been an ordeal... If the shop cant figure out whats  
wrong without spending much money... I think i am going to pull the  
engine, split it.. rebuilt it.. and throw dang hydraulics in it....  
find me a set of good used stock carbs.. re jet them.. and send them  
off to be rebushed if needed and be done with it.. im pretty sure it  
was rebuilt not too long ago but i dont know the po.. so.. wish me  
luck.. ;) at least i have a spare engine longblock to start with.. :)  
thanks to a local guy who didnt want it.. it sat outside for 3 years  
and still turns over by hand.. so.. yeah.. i need to head to bed and  
quit racking my brain so hard.. I did find a vacuum leak.. one of the  
elbows was messed up.. i put caps on the brake booster ports on the  
manifolds.. thas how i got it to run on 3 cyls.. just hope they can  
get it to go on all four tomorra..

Jason
