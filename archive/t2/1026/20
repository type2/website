Subject: towing 83 vanagon - again

Thanks everyone, I have that adjustable tow bar pictured in the link but mine clamps onto the bumper and it flexes the bumper real bad and has even bent them all to h***.  Don't want that happening before I even get it home.  
    Tried to buy that neat tow bar sold on TheSamba but it's not made for the Vanagon, only Bays and earlier.
    Guess I'll just fly over and rent a truck with a dolly.
thanks
Robert
