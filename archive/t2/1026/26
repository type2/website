Subject: Re: Wiring  'passages' from front to back on Westy? 

I'll have to go look, but I just found a path somewhere right of center,  and 
was able to thread the wires through existing holes in chassis  crossmembers. 
 I had to drop the front pan to get to a point where there  was a grommet 
that I could push through to get inside and under the dash  area.
