Subject: Wiring  'passages' from front to back on Westy?

 Hi, I am in the process of removing the "mid pan" from under my '74 Westy,
and plan to route sender wires along the 'heater tube" to the front.  Has
anyone done it a different way?  I really want to avoid drilling holes into
the body work, but 'ease' is please.
