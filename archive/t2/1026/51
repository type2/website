Subject: Re: [T2] Old van in freighter.

OK, could it have been possible?
 
The Fitzgerald went down on November 10, 1975. She was 729 feet long.
The  total space on deck was probably less than that, maybe 700 feet?

If this old van we are talking about spent its life on the Big Fitz, it
couldn't have had more than 25 years to clock those 451 miles,
traveling  about 18 miles per year at the most.

The van would have been required to make an average of 135 trips from
one  end of the big freighter to the other every year for 25 years to
rack up  the 451 miles (about).

 The Fitz was only in service for 17 years, a relative youngster when she
went down.
