Subject: Re: [T2] RE: towing 83 Vanagon

I see you picture my BayWindow bus bar fabrication to hold a Beetle towbar.
The pics showing the 2 brackets holding to the Vanagon front bumper tell 
me it would be easy to fit the pipe to those brackets (or between the 
brackets if you use the allthread inside the pipe design)so it can then 
hold the beetle bar.
