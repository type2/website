Subject: Re: [T2] z bed

The z-bed requires something like 9 holes in the floor per hinge  
plate.  With two hinge plates you'll be putting a lot of holes in the  
floor.  My tip is this: mock it up over and over again, hopefully with  
the help of a friend, to make sure everything works as expected before  
you drill all of those holes.

I did the following:

1.  Put the hinges in place resting on the floor, loosely installed  
seats on hinges, cycled entire seat system a couple times to make sure  
it worked properly.
2.  Repeat step 1 until you're sure everything is where it should be.
3.  Drill for and install two screws in each plate, then cycle the  
hole thing.

Since it worked at that point I just finished up by drilling all the  
holes and installing all the screws.  The bed works great and is super- 
convenient to use.

One other thing:  You'll have to install two adjuster gizmos, one on  
the inside of each wheel well.  They mount with two bolts penetrating  
the flat sheet metal on the inside of the well there.  I highly  
recommend putting some sort of gasket material between the bolt heads  
and the sheet metal in order to prevent leaks when driving in wet  
conditions.  I used pieces of bicycle inner tubes for the purpose and  
it hasn't leaked in that location yet.  (This anecdotal evidence is  
suspect though because I live in dry Tucson).

Good luck!
Zack
