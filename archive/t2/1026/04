Subject: Alt. wiring cooked; my fault

I put the rebuilt engine and (non rebuilt) transaxle back into my '77 and went to fire it the other day and the starter would barely roll it over.? I knew that the motor was nice and free, the starter was good, and the battery was fully charged.
Those of you that know what I did, raise your hands.? 
You're quicker than I was.? By the time I realized that I had forgotten to hook up the transaxle to body ground strap, the ground (brown) wire in the alternator harness had been relieved of all of its insulation.? What are the chances that I fried the alternator and or regulator with this bonehead screwup?? Do new alternators come with replacement harnesses?? (the short one between the alt. and reg.) The harness goes into the alt case instead of having external connections like most vehicles.? What are the chances of replacing the brown wire and living happily ever after (with a good charging system)?
I really wish I'd had the throttle cable hooked up.? Easier and cheaper to replace.? But I was running everything from the back of the bus and was working the carbs by hand. 
I feel like an idiot, but it's not the first time.
