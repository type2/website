Subject: Re: [T2] Progressive..

I agree with Greg, Weber progressive is Hard to tune up. Had one in my bus 
for the last 20+ years. Only recently have I spent the time to figure out 
the tuning. Did get 23mpg on my last long trip in June with my 1776 dp. Best 
mileage I've ever had in my bus. Never got more than about 21 when I had a 
single port 1600 running a 28psit.
