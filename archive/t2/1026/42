Subject: Coil maybe??

ok, so im going to go pick up my T3 Carbs to put back on my bus.. See  
if the rebuild helped... cause they were working great before. new  
intake gaskets etc too.. The intake gaskets i got are like tin or  
something.. crush gaskets they said, that they work pretty good. So i  
will try them.. i will double check for vacuum leaks.. but does anyone  
think this could be a bosch blue coil weakening maybe?? Thanks.. Off i  
go to grab my carbs back..

Jason
