Has anybody said vacuum leak?  It has to be a vacuum leak, I'm about 99% sure.

My experience is that everytime my bus runs and it is not running well it is blowing them off, so between tuning I make they are all reconnected.

Make sure your brake booster is hooked up.

Do not clamp your vacuum lines to make sure they don't come off, you can damage something.
