Subject: RE: [VB] Smooth quiet engine

Chris,

We always made sure the spark plugs pointed towards the combustion.  It
sounds minimal, but the racers can't be wrong.  We even shimmed (slightly)
or counter bored the hole to make sure they always had the right direction.
It is much easier to setup when the heads are off.

Another more time consuming task, was to polish the inside of the case.  It
sounds crazy, but the oil slides off and goes back to the sump quicker.

Checking the fit of the manifold to the heads helps a little performance.  

I think hydraulic lifters are a personal preference.  If you only use low
rpms, then they reduce the maintenance.  Upper rpms and the solid lifters
offer better performance.  Look at the type 4 engines; the buses got
hydraulic, but the 914 used solid.  Your driving habits should decide.  I
have always used steel pushrods and solid Scat lifters.  I set them at .001"
and they've always worked great.  YMMV.

Hi,

In addition to careful balancing and CCing the combustion chambers, what 
else would contribute to smoothness and quietness of a running VW engine.

Will hydraulic lifters make a significant difference? What are the ups and 
downs of using them? Any recommendations on where to get them?

TIA
