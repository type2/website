Hmmn, in WV it was not only legal, but used to be required if you were towing a vehicle at interstate speeds with just a tow chain !!!  Which believe it or not was legal in WV, at least 8-10 years ago the last time I checked !!!
   
  Anyway, common sense needs to prevail towing anything, and certainly you need to call the state police through any state you go and find out what is OK.  Some states now don't strictly allow ANY tow if the vehicle doesn't have an aux braking system like a Brake Buddy or on a dolly or trailer with brakes if over even a meager weight like 2500lb (though that is still more uncommon in the states but is VERY common most areas of Canada.)

  Be sensible people.
