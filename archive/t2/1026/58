Subject: I Thinks it was my coil?

Hey guys.. Good news kinda.. ok, I finally replaced my coil... No more  
popping out of the carbs!!!!!!!! Woo Hoo!!!! now.. I still cant get it  
above 55.. but i need to redo my valves, and reset my points, as the  
reason i figured it might be the coil.. is i changed my point gap to . 
018.. instead of .016.. so.. Tomorrow I will try to dial all that  
stuff in.. and maybe i can get her up to cruising speed :) I had my  
carbs gone though by somone else and was told they are fine.

Jason
