Subject: State Towing Requirements

A good quick reference for minimum towed vehicle requirements is found on Brake Buddy's website.

  Good to see in AK I can tow 5000lb without anything, but of course to get through Canada to get here from the 48 I would have had to have aux brakes for any weight in some locations.  Some state require break-away braking, some don't, it all gets very specific.
