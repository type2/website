OK, could it have been possible?

The Fitzgerald went down on November 10, 1975. She was 729 feet long. The 
total space on deck was probably less than that, maybe 700 feet?

If this old van we are talking about spent its life on the Big Fitz, it 
couldn't have had more than 25 years to clock those 451 miles, traveling 
about 18 miles per year at the most.

The van would have been required to make an average of 135 trips from one 
end of the big freighter to the other every year for 25 years to rack up 
the 451 miles (about).

The iron ore shipping season on the Great Lakes was about 8 months a 
year....depending on when the lakes froze up in the fall and thawed out in 
the spring.

That's 240 days to make 135 trips.......about one trip every other day.

It certainly would have been possible.

I wonder why the van didn't end up on the bottom of Lake Superior, with the 
rest of the ship? Maybe they off-loaded it for service at a VW dealer 
sometime in Detroit, before November 10, 1975, and nobody showed up to pay 
the bill......
