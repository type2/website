Subject: It Runs! (well... almost)

Hi All, 

I rebuilt the engine in the bus, and yesterday evening got it fired off
for the first time.  Timing isn't dialed in quite right, and the engine
still needs broke in, but it's still fairly smooth and hitting on all
4.  

However, I ran into 2 snags.  

Towards the end of the evening, the starter system went out.  When I
turn the key I just get a solid "CLUNK!" from the starter, a rattle-hum
from the fuel pump (normal) and nothing more.  The starter engages the
flywheel, but doesn't spin.  I put a wrench on the alternator pulley nut
and turn the engine over, so it isn't stuck.  My guess is the starter
crapped out.  Not sure.  

Snag #2.  One of my Kadron carbs *still* dumps gas into the engine. This
is the second time it's filled the crankcase with fuel, and I'm getting
a bit peeved about changing the oil twice in 2 weeks with a total of 3
minutes runtime on the engine.   Last time I disassembled both carbs,
re-cleaned them, and set them in the engine compartment in a pan to see
if they'd leak.  Left them all week.  Nada.  

Checked this morning, and I have a crankcase full of gas *again*.  I am
seriously displeased with that.  But, I know which carb is the culprit
now.  When I put them back on, I swapped them side-for-side.  Last time
it was the passenger side that was dripping.  This time it's the
driver's side.  Bingo, found the carb with the problem.  

But, what *IS* the problem?  Anybody else run into this?  What was the
problem, and the fix?

Thanks!

Shad H. 


PS.  Timing this engine was *much* nicer than say, a big block V8.  If
the timing was too far retarded or advanced, it just didn't fire. A V8
would have been snorting, farting, and burping fire out of the carb!
This engine either just spun or sputtered when I got closer. :)  Very
nice!
