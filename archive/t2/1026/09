On early buses, the filter comes out of the bottom of the tank.  Crawl
underneath and see if there is a big nut around the tank outlet.  If there
is, you can unscrew the nut and pull the filter out of the tank.  This
will completely drain the tank, so be careful!

I don't know about later buses.  I think that their outlets are fixed.
