Hi all,

  I used to be part of the type2 mailing list a few years ago when I was in
college.  I know have moved away from home and living in Charlotte, NC.  I
am planning on bringing my old 74 sportsmobile down to NC for some degree of
restoration.  Does anyone have good insight on mechanics in the NC area?
Hope the list is still as good as it was a few years ago.

Jason
