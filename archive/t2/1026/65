Jack asked:


A question. I read about 3 angle valve grinds on the heads. Does one have to
buy special valves that are contoured to match?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

No, the valves still use a single face cut. Usually 45 degrees.

The 3 angles are in the seat: a 30 degree cut, a 45 degree cut, and a 60
degree cut. Usually, you make the 45 at 44 to give the valve an interference
fit.

3 angles are done for better flow.  Some shops are doing 5 angles but not on
VW's.
