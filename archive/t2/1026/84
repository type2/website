Subject: Lifter..

Anyone have a picture of a normal t4 lifter?? Solid.. I am looking at  
this lifter here next to me.. It looks to me like the place where the  
the pushrod rides has sunk??/ is this possible???i am looking around  
the inside edge and there looks to be a groove, where the edge of  
where the pushrod rides went against the wall of the lifter.. all in  
all if i go along the inside edge of the lifter... it i down there  
about a half an inch.. is it wupposed to be down that far?? because if  
the place was in the small groove area that i see.. i would have full  
pushrod movement.. im going to go pull one that i know is working and  
have a look at it.. please let me know
