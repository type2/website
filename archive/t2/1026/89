No is the answer,
   
  And FWIW an incredible "3 angle" valve job is actually just a valve job done to stock VW factory specs.  A cheap shop will try to just touch a 30 or 45 degree stone to the seat (depending on the seat angle) and clean it up.  If not badly burnt this may clean it up and keep it within range of seat width, hell lapping it by hand might if not badly burnt.  They then may if you are lucky hand or machine lap it for a second or two and test it with dye or other fluid for fit, possibly with vacuum applied.  I actually often do the same with my own Sioux grinder, and all things being the same it is probably OK if the heads have never been rebuilt and if the seats aren't cut too much.  However if it does end up putting the seat's contact width out of spec, the inside should be cut with a 75 degree and/or depending on what the book says the outside with a 15 degree cutter/stone.  This is simply a factory VW seat job though some people consider it a "racing valve job" if used to the
 ole American iron.  Regardless a valve is a valve is a valve to sit on it.  True race places will sometimes do 5 or 7 angles, or even cut the seats with a continuous profile for improved flow.  3 angles is stock and sufficient for a street car.

A question. I read about 3 angle valve grinds on the heads. Does one 
have to buy special valves that are contoured to match?
