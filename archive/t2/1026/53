Hey, Dan.

Are you talking about the tubes that look kinda like exhaust pipes, little
notch cut out near the end?

Those tubes take the heat that is dumped from the heat control valve and
drop it out behind the engine rather than in front of the engine. They don't
affect the amount of heat going to the cabin, but they do aid in keeping the
engine just a bit cooler when you're not using the heat.
