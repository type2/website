Subject: '79 Shifter problems

I'm still trying to put the shifter on my '79 back together. I took 
out the 'shift kit' bracket 
http://s197.photobucket.com/albums/aa190/becida/ and put in some shorter bolts.

To my untrained eye the bushings in the system looked ok.

When I torque it up I can hardly move the shifter... and nothing I 
have been doing gives me any spring action for reverse.

Actually I'm having trouble visualizing what happens when I push the 
shifter 'down' and forward (is down and forward the correct direction 
for a '79?).

Advice anyone?

Thanks,



Rob
