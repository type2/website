Are you getting spark to these cylinders? You can check by holding the
lead close to a metal surface while the engine is running. The spark
will still get out even with the bakelite end on the lead. I'm not sure
if you mean 1.4 ohm or 1.4 kohm for the lead resistance. The bakelite
ends have about 1kohm resistance in them. The leads themselves have
negligible resistance.

Assuming the spark is ok, the next alternative is either no fuel getting
through or a massive vacuum leak. Test for the leak by spraying WD40 or
carb cleaner or propane around where the carb joins the manifold and the
manifold joins the head. Do these carbs both have vacuum ports for the
carb? Are they both in use or blocked?
