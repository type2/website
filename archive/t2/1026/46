I agree; bending the 5/8" allthread I used to hold the pipe for the
beetlebar seemed like the weak spot to me, which is why I also joined
the pipe to the front axle with old signpost- visible under the bus-it 
was "insurance".

	quoth John Anderson:
folks I would be VERY careful about relying on althread, particularly
heated then bent allthread for any long towing without a well doubled up
system, and or/safety chains.  Same goes for Kevin's thoughts about his
brackets, even though Grade 5 hardware.  Althread is often Chinese made
cheese steel nowdays, perhaps not even Grade 2 in properties, and
bending it will introduce stress risers and the heat will kill whatever
little bit of zinc or cad is plating and stopping rust on it to boot.
Now using 1/2" or 5/8" you got some margin, but how much, I don't know,
do you?
