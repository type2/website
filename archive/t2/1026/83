passenger side all the way towards the back of the bus is not moving as much
as it should.... any ideas??? how can this happen??

I believe you said earlier that you have a 2.0 with hydraulic lifters?

If yes, you have a bad lifter IF the valve on the other side of the engine
has full movement. [the lobes run both sides of the engine]
