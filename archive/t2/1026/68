Subject: ok... last leg i hope

Ok guys.. here are the specs... 72 westy.. 2.0 Solid lifters/cam good  
compression T3 32's for carbs that had no problems running before..  
and have recently been gone through. Here is my last problem. I  
finally got rid of most the popping and farting... but.. i can  
accelerate "ok" but if i floor it.. it kinda still wants to  
pffffhhph.. kinda on its face a bit.. so i cant get it over 55... I am  
going to change the plugs.. cause i can pull off the wire to 3 or 4  
and there is a noticible drop in rpm.. but #1... barely.. and #2 none  
at all.. I can actually take 1 and 2 off and it stays running the same  
pretty much.. any ideas there?? i take 3 off and it wants to die real  
quick.. #4.. a little less dying.. #1 and 2.. no die.. same..I am  
gonna take my daughter to school soon and pick up the plugs.. but im  
kind of at a loss why this would be happening, wires are correct.  not  
sure what else to do?? How much resistance should be in the plug  
wires??? im getting about 1.4?? i thought i should get continuity..  
but im not.. well let me know asap.. if ya wanna talk to me in person  
feel free to call 801-337-4438 I appreciate all the help you have  
given me.

Jason
