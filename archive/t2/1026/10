By the time I realized that I had forgotten to hook up the transaxle to body ground strap, the ground (brown) wire in the alternator harness had been relieved of all of its insulation.? What are the chances that I fried the alternator and or regulator with this bonehead screwup?? Do new alternators come with replacement harnesses?? (the short one between the alt. and reg.)

Rest easy, things aren't that bad.

The brown wire is the alternator ground.  Lacking the big ground wire, the
engine tried to ground itself through the little brown wire, which
probably failed somewhere inside the harness pretty quickly.

Replacing it in the harness is a pain, but you can simply make a new
ground wire that goes from the alternator to a ground connection on the
body.

I did this once and managed to drive the bus all over the west coast
before noticing the ground strap dangling under the bus.  Somehow, the
clutch cable managed to carry the current without welding itself to the
tube.
