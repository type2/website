Subject: Smooth quiet engine

Hi,

In addition to careful balancing and CCing the combustion chambers, what 
else would contribute to smoothness and quietness of a running VW engine.

Will hydraulic lifters make a significant difference? What are the ups and 
downs of using them? Any recommendations on where to get them?

TIA

Chris
