Hi Jason,

The weber progressive  is hard to tune for optimal performance.  
Usually they run well at throttle, or at idle. Rarely will they do  
both well. Gas milage will suffer, so will emissions. They are prone  
to suffer icing problems during cold weather.

I would recommend dual carbs or FI over the single weber progressive.

Happy Trails,
