Subject: ok.. got 3 running... one more to go!!!

ok, I got 3 cyls firing now.. The only one no firing now is 2. I know  
i have Spark, I can pull the wire, throw a plug in it and ground it..  
it fires.. I pull the wire at the cap.. good spark hitting the wire on  
time.. i capped the brake ports on the manifolds, now it makes a  
difference when i pull 1,3, and 4. So.. any ideas now?? I am letting  
the motor cool and am going to check the valves on that cyl again.. i  
redid valves this morning and i believe they are spot on. so.. any  
idea why 3 out of 4 would fire?? no vacuum leak or # 1 wouldnt fire i  
guess... so now im at a loss.. so i get steady puh puh puh out of carb  
cause that one is not firing.. compression was good when we checked  
it.. so if you have any ideas.. please let me know..

Jason
