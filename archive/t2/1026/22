Subject: Well that didnt work out..

ok, so i got my hands on  pair of weber 34's... stock manifolds are  
too short for them, and the bus manifolds they had with them wouldnt  
let me use my brake booster and have a balance tube too.. so.. scrap  
that idea... i ordered 2 rebuild kits for my carbs... type 3 ones..  
but for 190 i can get a stock set of carbs for the 72 complete.. is  
this too much?? thats 120 for the carbs, 30 for shipping and 20 a  
piece for rebuild kits for them... I know eventually i need to go back  
to stock.. but im just trying to get it running right now.. i guess i  
will re-do my valves and borrow a dwell tester to check that out..  
hope the drivers side head is ok.. im gonna go check that out.. see if  
i have any messed up valves on that side.. shouldnt though.. anyways..
