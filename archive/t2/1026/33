i think you are referring to charlie hamel. he was one of the  
founders of the OCTO bus show. he is a split bus expert, to say the  
very least. the bus was on board a lake freighter in lake michigan,  
iirc.

there is a pretty cool movie about his collection called "charlie's  
garage", it was made by flat-4.
