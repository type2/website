My suggestion would be to find a tow bar off of Craigslist you can get for
cheap. I got one for my bus for $40 and have used it several times. I have
also loaned it out and it was very easy to use.

This one is similar to the one I have:

I took the chains off the rear loops and connected those to the tow loops
under my bus. That way there is no need to "mount" anything. I figure with a
few good lock-nuts on those loops, you will safely be able to take your new
bus to the moon!
