Subject: Re: [T2] Bus pricing and vw shows

I always say the value of any vehicle is the one it's current owner was
willing to pay.

My 71 is far from perfect in its appearance but it's a joy to drive.

It is mechanically sound and gets peoples attention anywhere I drive it.

Do you have a price in mind for your future Bus?

Perhaps one of us knows someone willing to part with one of theirs.
