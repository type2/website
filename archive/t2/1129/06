Subject: Fw: [T2] weatherstripping seal: old adhesive removal

Not sure what to do for removal other than carefull scraping and cursing.

When you install the new seals, use only a few dabs of adehesive or none at
all as the seal should fit tight into the channel and hold itself in. I have
no glue at all on my seal. Holds tight on its own.

Will save you time and trouble next time you replace the seal.

Hi,

Can someone recommend a product for old weatherstripping adhesive removal?
I'm trying to remove the old crud in the rear hatch channel... Goof Off
seems to be able to lift the paint when combined with the scrubbing that
seems to be needed to remove the old adhesive.

Thanks for any help. Mike
