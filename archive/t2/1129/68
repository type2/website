Might sound nutty, but if you can find the right place to attach to, you 
could tie a rope to the hatch and then to some very sturdily affixed 
post (or something obviously strong) and then drive the car forward to 
try and pull the hatch back out.  Kinda risky, but if you're in a pinch, 
it might be worth a try.  Obviously something got bent in there - I 
would first try to identify where the bend is and then see if you can 
band it back by appling the correct force...
