well it was the same ones that had been on there before the rebuild and worked 
fine for the previous year or so.

the ones I got from Bus Depot seem to be the same,  right I can't figure out 
how the durn thing raises up enough to come loose.  unless the shaft drops 
some, but isn't there bearings etc in there to hold things in place.

I don't have a spare stock distributor....so all I could throw in there is an 
old 009.
