Hi Josh,

The US has the largest aftermarket parts market in the world. VW sold
more cars here than any other country. It's getting harder to find OEM
and German made parts. Increasingly parts stocks are reproductions
made in China. I suspect VW Heritage and Just Kampers is accessing the
same sources.
