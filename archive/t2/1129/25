Subject: RE: [T2] battery luck & gauge install

Hi Jim,

Yeah, one of my first thoughts was that the terminal block was grounding. I
checked it, and I don' see any grounding points, and my meter is not picking
anything up.

If I disconnect the battery ground, and put the meter between the chassis
and the battery-I am getting about 12V. I am wondering if this could be the
radio? It is a modern radio-so it is always drawing a tiny bit of power to
remember the time and the station presets. I also have an original clock in
the bus. I imagine it draws a little bit of power all the time too.

Kevin:
I would start out and find if you have created a circuit to ground with the
terminal block and see if any of those wires have a current in them while
the key is turned off.  I am guessing that it is a direct short to something
like the starter or something else that draws a lot of amps in a short
while.
