PS - One thing easily forgotten because by now most buses don't have
them anymore -- support brackets that hold the exhaust system to the
head (so the manifold studs don't do the weight-bearing).

Trying to remember the locations. Probably at the four corners --

1 - Alternator adjusting bracket - follow it down to the right heat exchanger

2 - Go to the left exchanger and look for another one. Probably a
small strap from the shroud to the exchanger.

3 & 4 - look at the front of the engine for short straps from the
heads to the heat exchanger.
