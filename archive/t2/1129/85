Subject: RE: [T2] Rear deck lid

Thank you all for your help.  I have rigged up the rear hatch to two eye bolts
I've installed to the inside of my garage and used tie-down straps to pull...

Thus far, I have not been lucky enough to bend the hinges enough to get
clearance to shut the hatch yet.  I have even tried to drive forward with the
bus and not had any results (but at least I haven't driven through the front
wall or pulled the garage wall down either).

Suggestions,

Michael in Montevallo
