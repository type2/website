Subject: weatherstripping seal: old adhesive removal

Hi,

Can someone recommend a product for old weatherstripping adhesive removal?
I'm trying to remove the old crud in the rear hatch channel... Goof Off
seems to be able to lift the paint when combined with the scrubbing that
seems to be needed to remove the old adhesive.

Thanks for any help. Mike
