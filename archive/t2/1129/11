Subject: Re: [T2] Type IV Heater box removal

To Recap, this is a 75 bus with what is likely a GD engine, using the
mid year exhaust setup, trying to remove the US passenger side heater
box:

Support brackets removed (fore and aft)
Exhaust removed
Heater hose clamps removed
Exhaust studs removed

Heater box won't budge. Not an inch, not a millimeter.

Had to reassemble everything to give it a shot on another day.

Thanks
