Subject: RE: [T2] battery luck & gauge install

My volt meter does not measure amps(or at least if it does I don't know how
to use it as such). I think it just does Voltage (DC), Resistance, dwell,
RPMs & diode. It is a SunPro CP7676. My other meter is a Wavetek 5xl, It
only measures Voltage (DC&AC

My other meter measures voltage (AC & DC), Resistance, and I think Amperage
- but I only getting readings of zero when I test that. So I'm not sure if I
am using it correctly. It is a Wavetek 5XL.

I hooked my meter between the ground strap and the body, and consistently
get readings over 12V. I unhooked each fuse, one at a time, and the readings
stayed the same. This make me think I am leaking power somewhere before the
fuses, does that sound right? 

My vehicle had been upgraded from a generator to an alternator.

Hey Kevin,

I would go with the light bulb first. If its a bit dim, then you can go with

your meter set on the 10 or 20 amps scale ( use the current measurement 
rather than voltage). As the leakage reduces you can set the meter to lower 
scales to get accurate readings. Remove fuses until the current is zero to 
locate the problem(s).
