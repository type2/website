Subject: Buses By The Depot &  Bus Depot Warehouse Sale - Sat. 10/2

The annual Buses By The Depot and Bus Depot Warehouse Sale are Saturday Oct.
2. I look forward to seeing many familiar faces from years past, and
hopefully some new ones as well!

Most of the details remain the same as previous years. It's $15 to camp (or
$30 for 2 nights), or free if you decide to make it a day trip instead. If
you do plan to camp you must reserve in advance. There is a caravan to the
Bus Depot Saturday afternoon for our annual in-store Warehouse Sale,
followed by a pot luck dinner that evening. You can find full details, as
well as instructions for reserving your spot, at
http://busdepot.com/BBD2010.htm .  

We will be running some killer deals during the in-store Warehouse Sale that
weekend - the biggest discounts we have ever offered.  Attendees can save up
to 20% on our entire inventory, and up to 90% on distressed merchandise and
customer returns. The more you buy the bigger the discount. See the coupons
at the bottom of the Buses By The Depot page (linked above). Basically we
need to make some room. We stocked up this summer to take advantage of the
temporarily weak Euro, and 3 container loads later we're literally tripping
over boxes.  I'm hoping to reclaim some space by offering some serious
bargains.  While the clearance area will only be opened up on Saturday, the
other specials will start Friday, in order to reduce the Saturday rush and
also accommodate anyone who can't make it on in the weekend.
