That's kinda what I was wondering.  The problem is that you can't really 
pull any way other than away from the bus because the door will just 
"hinge" in the direction of the pull.

One thought would be to put 4x4s under the U of the hinge and then pull 
the door downward, or outward, or any particular direction as the 4x4s 
will hold the hinges at a certain angle while the force can be applied 
in a different direction - that could also have the effect of "opening" 
up the U, if that's where the actual bend is.

I think this is where some measurements would be helpful.  Could you 
make some measurements for us to compare to our buses.  That way we can 
hopefully provide a bit more exact advice on what force to put in what 
direction.
