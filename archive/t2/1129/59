Martin,

Just be real careful with those torsion springs, they pack a wallop!
If you have a helper working with you, be twice as careful. You don't want 
any lost fingers.

I've repaired a worn out pivot in the hinge system and found things to be 
wound quite tight.

Best of luck.
Can you discern what is bent? Can you post any photos somewhere? Maybe one 
of us can come up with an idea.

Chris
