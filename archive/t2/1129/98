Check local upholstery shops.  I bought a very good imitation of the Westy
interior stuff from a local one, I have no idea what it was intended for, but
a very similar texture and thickness product, wasn't anywhere near as thick as
vinyl, I do not know what it was intended for.  I have also used heavy
textured vinyl roll up window blind material which is easily available (if you
look hard enough you can find something similar to the westy stuff, though
most of it is more of a pinpoint material) with good results as it is made to
take a beating from day to day light and heat.  As with any headlining
material, use a good heavy-duty moisture and heat resistant contact adhesive,
and obviously test to make sure it doesn't disintegrate/melt the material. 
Real wallpaper glue might be an option that I've never considered until now as
well.
