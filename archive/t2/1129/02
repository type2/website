Hi  Folks
My 1973 Bus appears  to have a 1600 upright engine, the two 
pipes from the fan shroud had been  sealed and the connecting holds in the 
panels around the engine have also  been plugged. I have opened up the 
outlets on the shroud, and was  surprised with the volumn of air produced. 
Not sure what to do about the  plugged holes in the panels if I open them 
up 
and fit hose the air would  just blow out under the van, there are no heat 
exchangers. Any  recommendations???
Cheers Ben   irishrover



Ok if it is an upright you really should install heater boxes and all the  
air duct system that goes with them. Do not unplug the outlets and run that  
way.  With the whole system hooked up like factory it helps to keep your  
heads running cooler.  later  mark d
