Subject: Rear deck lid

Help!

I've done it now.  My family and I were loaded up in our 71 Westy about to go
to a local cruise-in.  I backed up and then.... BAM!!!  Seems I forgot to
close my rear deck lid and backed into the garage door.  Now after spending
the better part of the day, I've managed to fix the garage door, take the curl
out of the lip of the deck lid BUT I'm no closer to getting the lid shut.
Seems the hinges hit the to of the lid opening on the body and the lid won't
come down.  I've looked over my manuals, other books, and Internet and I'm no
closer to figuring out how to adjust those lid hinges.  Anybody out there that
can help.

Thanks,
