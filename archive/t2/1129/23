Hi Gerald,

I think I see what you are saying. Could I just do this with my voltmeter as
well? Ie, disconnect battery, then run the meter from the battery ground to
a bare spot on the chassis?

As far as disconnecting things, I will just disconnect connections at the
fuse box? An watch my meter...is that the right way to go?

Was writ:
"If its dropping the get a 12 volt light. Disconnect the GROUND from your
battery. Connect the 12V light where the ground wire used to be(from the
battery negative post to a good chassis ground)  and it should light up
(indicating there's power flowing through it). The brighter the light, the
faster your battery is draining.

Hang the light where you can see it from most anywhere. Now start unhooking
stuff trying to get the light to get dimmer and, eventually, go out."
