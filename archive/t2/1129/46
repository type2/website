Subject: rotor spinning

78 auto tranny bus.
just got rebuilt engine and reinstalled my dist, untouched from when it 
was running from before rebuild.   several times now, at higher RPM the 
rotor has spun on the rotor shaft in the dizzy.

have never had this probelm in the past, is an easy fix but still is 
disconcerting to suddenly have your engine lose power and backfire...

bought new rotor, even shortened the length some small amount. but it did 
it again yesterday.  made sure dizzy was fully seated... can't figure out 
what could be causing the rotor to spin on the shaft. yes the nub is 
seated solidly in the notch. and when it spins it doesn't break the nub 
but rather the rotor works it way up and then spins.   have crane optical 
ignition but this is untouched and has never caused a problem in the 
past..   rotor seems to seat solidly when pushed down.   rotor shaft does 
not appear to have significant play.   this is a stock dist. and has been 
rebuilt a few years ago.

is frustrating to say the least.

ideas????  even off the wall ideas welcome
