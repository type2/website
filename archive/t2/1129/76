As for lack of new parts, I know of at least two good sources here in the UK.
VW Heritage and Just Kampers. 
That's probably not very helpful for all those rotting VW's in the US, but they 
will ship internationally for a price.

Their catalogs a re fairly extensive.  You could almost build an entire vehicle 
from those catalogs.
In fact, I thought a team actually built a beetle in a weekend from catalog 
parts at one of the large festivals over here as a challenge.
I could be mistake, but if someone can find info on that, then that would be 
awesome.

Anyways, are there not parts manufacturers like VW Heritage or Just Kampers in 
the US?
If not, then maybe it's time for some enterprising individuals and investors to 
start something similar of enter into an overseas distribution agreement.
Or has this idea already been floated and flogged to death?

On another note, I attended my first VW show (Bugout in VA) in ten years and
was shocked at the lack of new parts vendors and quality show cars. One person
indicate it was due to the lack of new parts manufactured and dwindling
numbers of older VW's...
