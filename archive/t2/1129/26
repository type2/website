I wouldn't use a meter. No telling how many amps draw will be going
through the system. Good way to eat a meter. 20 minutes is awfully fast
for a battery to drain to uselessness. 

Also, before you get started, start the bus and make sure you are
seeing around 14V at the battery with the bus revved up a bit. Maybe
you're not charging and it's dying as you drive around.

Yes, pulling fuses is the best way to start. Easier than pulling wires
loose.
