Subject: Type IV Heater box removal

Hi List,

Pausing mid-project for a little data collection. I'm attempting to
remove my passenger's side heat exchanger on a 2.0 Type IV in order to
fix an exhaust leak that appears to be happening at the head/heater
box connection (the one with the copper gasket). Has the mid-year
exhaust setup with a pacesetter muffler. This is my first time dealing
with the type iv heater boxes so bear with me for a few moments.

I've successfully removed the bolts for the various supports, loosened
all the heater tube connection clamps, removed the cover plate at the
fan shroud heater box connection, and removed the 4 head bolts without
destroying any studs (BIG sigh of relief there!)...

...but the thing still won't budge.

Ideas, thoughts, suggestions?

Bentley gives very little instruction. Any been-there-done-that tips?
Should I remove the pushrods and tubes for extra working space (of
course I'd rather not if I don't have to)


Thanks in advance for any help
