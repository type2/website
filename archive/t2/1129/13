Well, more likely warped exhaust manifolds, which is normal. Part of
the procedure for installing is to use a long flat file to make sure
both orifices are parallel and to overdrill the holes for more wiggle
room.

But even then, you should be able to drag the manifold off. It's
common for them to come off rubbing and scraping on the studs as them
come. Should just take moderate effort with a pry bar. Nothing strong
that would endanger the heads.
