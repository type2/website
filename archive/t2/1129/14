Mornin',

Thank you all for the tips. Scraping and cursing...well, I have the cursing
part covered...

I'm certainly curious about Orange Glo... a citrus-smelling bus would do
well in FL!  On a whim, I tried and had some success with WD-40 (also
suggested by another listee)... it did not seem to penetrate well, but did
lift off the very surface.  I left some more on and will see this afternoon
if the remainder of the glue sloughs off.

Regarding install: My plan was to try to use adhesive only in the corners
(where I see the most leaking now). However, when I saw that the potentially
original weatherstripping had been glued all around, I thought about
revising that plan. Does anyone know what the original install was like? I'm
now thinking I'll try it first without any, hit it with the hose, and glue
were leaks pop up. I purchased one of the German-made pieces from BDepot, so
I'm hoping for a solid fit. Thanks again. Mike


Not sure what to do for removal other than carefull scraping and cursing.
