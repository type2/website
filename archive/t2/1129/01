Non-US markets received the upright 1600cc engine post 1971 (when the
switch was made in the US to the Type IV.

In these markets you had the option to purchase the Type1 engine in 1973.

I believe the original poster is outside of the US, and by the
description of the pipes and fan shrouds it sounds like he has a Type1
"upright" engine.
