Be careful letting someone share a DropBox folder with you if you're not
sure of the file content.  If you're running the DropBox utility and have a
DropBox folder on your computer, it will copy the files to your computer,
then allow the other person to upload other files into that folder without
your permission.  Not entirely safe.

Not that Michael's files are suspect.  I'm just not into sharing files with
casual acquaintances.

I have a DropBox account, but I don't use their utility on my computers.  I
use the browser interface to upload files to my clients.
