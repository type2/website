I had to get some heat exchangers off of an engine at the yard and I 
used a breaker bar to put some pressure between the head and the 
exchanger and I was able to successfully wobble them free (with copious 
amounts of wd40).  If you removed the muffler and the head nuts, then at 
least the exhaust should have a little bit of play (between the head and 
the manifolds).  If that isn't moving, then the issue is somewhere 
around where the exhaust manifolds connect to the heads and that's where 
I'd focus your attention.  You might just need to figure out a creative 
way to pry something in there without damaging the heads.
