something to think about,,,, a battery can fail in one second. 

the internal links fail quite often.. just like a fuse.. boom, 

there is no external evidence,, except the click click click at the starter. 

if there is an external load,, short, draw.. then it does take some time to 
drain a fully charged battery... even a dead short with cables starting to 
glow red hot... that few minutes can feel like an eternity! 

I had a beetle battery without a tie down.. went over a bump.. and it jumped 
up,, the positive terminal caught the rear seat springs,, which acted JUST 
LIKE a toaster element... nice gentle flow of RED HOT coils.. lol  yah.. my 
heart jumped a bit when I knew I had to lift that seat,, and undo the 
connection,, or just run, and let it burn down!
Stupid.. but I lifted the seat,, and saved the day... without any burns to 
me !
