Are you sure it's an upright?  Doesn't that year have the pancake engine 
in it?  Or did someone swap an upright in there?

That's where the majority of the heater air comes from.  The 
squirrel-cage fan doesn't do very much.

Since you don't have heat exchangers, plug 'em back up :)  You might as 
well use the air for cooling instead of wasting it.

That being said, if you truly have an upright engine, I'm not sure what 
your fan shroud looks like.  If you actually have a pancake engine, I'd 
plug the holes, but I'd actually do it on the inside of the shroud so as 
to keep the air flowing smoothly.  If you just do it on the outside, 
it's going to disturb the flow and it won't circulate as effectively. 
Will it make a difference, I don't know - but every bit of cooling is 
needed with these engines.
