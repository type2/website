Hi Chad,

Generally you look for about 10psi per 1000 rpms as a "good" oil pressure.
You are not very far off of those numbers.

My 1.7L engine has oil pressure and the temp sender is in the sump plate;
I usually run at around 90C for the first few hours but once I start
climbing long hills in central PA or WV the temps will steadily rise,
usually no worse than 110C. 260F sounds kind of scary. The CHT on the
other hand sounds quite good. That tells me the heat is from friction
rather than from the heads... What oil was used for break-in, and how many
miles since the rebuild. Some hot running could be expected until the
rings get seated.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
