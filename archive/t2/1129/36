Hay Chris,

The first flash of light-when initially connected, is bright for a split
second, then it is a barely discernible intermittent glow. When I disconnect
the wire from the fuse box, the lighting stops. Do you mean for me to
disconnect the 'acccesory' wire from the radio?

If your lamp is flashing bright, I would say that is a major amount of 
current even though intermittant. Remove the accessory wire and see if the 
problem persists.
