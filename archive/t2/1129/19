Subject: battery luck & gauge install

Well, I spent a little time this past weekend trying to clean up the wires I
used when installing the gauges. I also installed a terminal block under the
dash, to power the gauges.

Yesterday while driving around, I parked, then came out about 20 minutes
later-and my battery was totally dead. Nothing happened when I turned the
key. I thought maybe I had screwed up some wiring over the weekend, or
knocked something loose. I checked all my connections, checked the fuses,
everything looked fine. Then I got my meter out and tested the battery-it
had only 2V I happened to be stuck about 3 blocks from my sister's office
and about 1 mile from the national auto parts store where I bought the
battery, and they had a new one in stock.

So my sister picked me up, I took the battery in, swapped it in about 15
minutes, then back to my single cab, installed and away I went. 

Things worked out pretty well on that warranty-I only had 2 weeks left on
it. 

All in all-not bad, now I have a new battery. Next I need to figure out if
there was something draining my battery while it was sitting there. Is there
a way to figure this out?
