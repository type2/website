Hi Kevin,

The problem with using the voltage scale is that a very tiny leak will make 
the meter read 12V. The leak could be so small that it takes a month to 
drain the battery.

Your Wavetek may have a blown fuse. Most meters have a fuse in line with the 
amps measuring to protect the meter.  Look inside. I bet you find a blown 
fuse.

Once again, try the light bulb. You could use one of your parking lamp 
bulbs.
