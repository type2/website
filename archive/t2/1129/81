Good advice from Greg. You can try increasing oil viscosity to improve
oil pressure to get closer to the 10 psi per 1000 rpm mark.

The idle pressure does seem a bit low. Mostly I've heard not to let
the oil pressure light come on at hot idle. Are you still running your
oil pressure light?

Also, you might up your idle speed to 900 or so to get the idle pressure up.
