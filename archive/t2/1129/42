Me, too.

And, a year later, my wife and I were driving
the beetle on washboard logging roads in Maine
and stopped on a (freshly denuded) hilltop for a
picnic.  After that, went to start the car and
nothing, not a click.  Thought "Oh no! All the
camping gear in the back seat has pushed the
springs down far enough to short the battery
again!" and I tore out the luggage and yanked up
the seat as fast as I could (adrenaline).

And there it was - a rectangular hole in the
floor with the battery cables hanging out.
But no battery.
