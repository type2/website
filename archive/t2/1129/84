Subject: Re: [T2] 1978 bus oil pressure/oil temp

I have a 2.0 GE engine in my '79.  Your Cyl head temp on #3 is same as mine
(always 300-350).  My oil temp runs between 180-220 -never gets higher than 220.
 However, my sender is mounted on that round plate with two dimples.  I remember
reading that dipstick senders weren't as reliable.

My oil pressure was low until I reset the timing. Now it's around 10 at idle
when fully warmed up.
