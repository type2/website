have to push it down quite hard.
check to see it is alinged correctly and push down til it seats.

would need to lift a half inch or so to rotate on the shaft.

seems to happen at speeds over 55mph or there abouts.

so far have not damaged the dist cap,  once years ago a rotor on a 
different german car but similar dist wobbled enough to hit one of the 
pins on the side for a cyl.   dist literally exploded.....just 5 wires 
hanging loosely.
