Subject: Re: [T2] rotor spinning

Not to be silly about this, but have you doublechecked that the rotor is the 
right one for that dizzy? I have wrenched on these things since 1974, and 
I've never seen or heard of this happening. The dizzy cap should be almost 
right over top of it with the spring loaded center contact pushing down. Is 
the cap correct?
