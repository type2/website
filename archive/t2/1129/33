Subject: Re: [T2] battery luck & gauge install

Well.I was able to get the bulb to go out and stay out. The wire causing it
to light up was the one hooked to my radio. I'm not sure why it blinks on
and off. 

I do know that when I hooked the radio up, I connected both to the same
connector. In other words the radio had two power in connectors - one for
power all the time and one for accessory power. I don't think my fuse box
has an accessory connector, so I just hooked them both up to this fuse. 

I am assuming that the battery drain for this is so minimal, I shouldn't
worry about it. Is this correct thinking? I guess if I didn't drive it for a
while-I should disconnect the battery. Ie over the winter.
