Kevin,

When you first connect the radio there is a surge of current that charges 
the circuits in the radio. This causes the bright flash. The intermittant 
faint glow is the radio using a small amount of power to keep its memory 
running. Are there any LED's or anything else lit up on the face of the 
radio? I know on mine I can tell it to go black or display the time. If it 
displays time, I got about 3-4 days before my battery goes dead, other wise 
I have about 3-4 weeks.

The first flash of light-when initially connected, is bright for a split
second, then it is a barely discernible intermittent glow. When I disconnect
the wire from the fuse box, the lighting stops. Do you mean for me to
disconnect the 'acccesory' wire from the radio?
