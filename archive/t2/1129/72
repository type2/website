True enough, Neal.  My best loved bus was not even close to a show car, but it
got you where you needed to go and kept you dry when you camped.  
 
I guess at this stage of the game I'd like something that isn't a project -
not at first.  Something that might last a few years till I have a bit more
time (if I ever will).   My primary concerns are:  solid body - no rust rot or
heavy bondo, ideally replaced ball joints/tie rods, solid brakes and as
original as possible - interior can be worn, but nice enough to use, and an
engine with known history.  Of course I know you get what you pay for, so I'd
pay more for better conditions/engines.  My wife is onboard with this purchase
as long as it's not an immediate project just to get it road worthy or to keep
it on the road.  We both have played with enough busses and bugs to know that
any purchase from a $12k show car to $4000 daily driver could become a major
project overnight.  We just want good odds for a year or two.  Budgetwise we
started with a $4-5000 starting point but are willing to move around a bit.
We're trying to see what you
 get for different price levels and what sells quickly.
I also wonder, if the unexpected happens, what is easier to sell at close to
our purchase price - an $8k for a bus in great shape and unkown engine
history or a $4000 bus with semi-solid body but good engine?
 
Perhaps I just think too much now-a-days.  I don't remember ever worrying
about such things when I was younger!  Back then I purchased a bus from an
AZ member of this list sight unseen and trucked it out to NJ.
Thanks for the help.
