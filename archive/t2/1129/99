Subject: Driving me Crazy - '73 Westy for Sale in Indiana

Hey, guys, this one is driving me crazy!

If had the $$$ I would definitely be looking at this:
http://southbend.craigslist.org/cto/1942983879.html

It's been on Craigslist for a while and the price has dropped 2X.

Let me know if anyone is interested and needs me to take a look; I am in
South Bend, Indiana, just up the road from Amish country. Just looking for
an excuse to take a road trip to see a bus!
