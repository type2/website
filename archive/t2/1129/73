Martin,

After seeing the photos and looking at my bus, I would start by lowering the 
hatch, backing out of the garage and then raising the pop top. I would also 
remove the hinge covers for a better view.

I would wag that the U shaped hinge member is bent a little closed. The 
torsion arm link is not likely to be culprit.

Do you have any buddies nearby with a bus that could be used as a 
comparison?

I do like the idea of using a come-along to pull it back out.

Good luck
