Subject: Re: [T2] horn grounding

Happy Labor Day weekend, (almost)

The horn issue has been resolved. I received a used horn from a kind
list member, Mr. Maxson, installed it today and the horn works
perfectly. Donation to the list-serv has been made.

For people searching in the archives; if your horn does not sound
properly when connected directly to the battery, it is most likely
defective and a new one is needed.

Thank you all for the help in diagnosis,

Max
