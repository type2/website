Subject: 1978 bus oil pressure/oil temp

   I just rebuilt my GE 2.0 engine to stock in my 1978 baywindow. My oil
temp "dipstick" I am at 220-260, On my CHT at #3 I am at 300-350.
Driving around 60-65 MPH on 85F day. My oil temp seems high. My concern
is my oil pressure and oil temp. When I start my bus in the morning I am
reading 25psi idle when I rev the engine up to 2500rpm I am reading
50-75psi. But after a hour long run when my temps are hot as listed
above my oil pressure drops to 20-25psi at 2500-3000rpm and 5-8 at idle
is this to low of a oil pressure? I think it is because my oil temp is
so high. "thinning the oil to much". I have been trying to get a general
idea on the temps and oil pressure my bus should be at. I have call
around 50 or so VW shops in Oregon,California Etc. Some say my
temps/pressure are great others say they are not so good. Help I want my
bus to last do you have any good numbers I should be seeing in my bus.
Thanks.
