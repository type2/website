Subject: Re: [T2] Rear deck lid 

(a) I, too, have straightened a bumper by using the engine to pull
against something, but I used a heavy chain around a telephone pole
as my tether.  Both chain and pole were readily available ;-)

(b) Looking at my bus, it does not seem to me that the deformation
one would get by pushing the lid in would be reversed by pulling
it back on the same azimuth.  Intuition tells me that the pull would
want to be more downward, perhaps 90 deg off the angle of push, and
especially so if the lid was sliding upwards as the deformation
proceeded.


But what do I know.
