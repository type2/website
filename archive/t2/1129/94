Take a close look at the roof with the top popped up as mentioned before.

Find another bus that you can park next to yours and do an A-B comparison of 
the hinge arms.

I took some photos of my hinges, a 64, I think the mechanisms are the same.

Here is the photobucket post. Hope these might help.
