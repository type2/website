20 minutes from full charge to 2V would have caused a fire you could
see for 3 blocks around.

What you've got is plain old battery failure. It happens. Luckily it
was nice enough to fail *IN* warranty.

If you still want to make sure then the first thing to do is see if it
happens again (have a charger handy). Leave it sit and check the
voltage every 30 minutes or so.

If its dropping the get a 12 volt light. Disconnect the GROUND from
your battery. Connect the 12V light where the ground wire used to
be(from the battery negative post to a good chassis ground)  and it
should light up (indicating there's power flowing through it). The
brighter the light, the faster your battery is draining.

Hang the light where you can see it from most anywhere. Now start
unhooking stuff trying to get the light to get dimmer and, eventually,
go out.
