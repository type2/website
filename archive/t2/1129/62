Subject: Bus pricing and vw shows

Howdy,
Well it has been quiet some time since I was last active in this list; good to
see some familiar names are still here!!  It's been 9 years since I've owned a
bus and now I am ready to get back into the game.  I'm wondering if the
pricing I've seen is accurate and if buses are really selling in these
ranges.  I've been scouring the ads for a 68-71 pop-top, preferably a 71, and
it seems to me that $6-7,000 gets you a rust free, solid body with some work
required (paint, ball joints etc), an rebuilt engine, and a non-original
interior or a well used original interior.  $8-10,000 gets you a all original
solid rust free, newly rebuilt engine, new ball joints/tie rods, good paint
and little bondo with some minor odds and ends still to do.  Above $10k gets
you  total restore or low mileage original.  Does this sound right? 
 
On another note, I attended my first VW show (Bugout in VA) in ten years and
was shocked at the lack of new parts vendors and quality show cars. One person
indicate it was due to the lack of new parts manufactured and dwindling
numbers of older VW's.  Have all shows degraded or did I just hit a bad one?
 
It's great to be back and I'm looking forward to getting back to speed and
rediscovering all that I've forgotten about the VW world.
Thanks for any advice/recommendations.
Erik
