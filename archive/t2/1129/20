Subject: re:weatherstripping seal: old adhesive removal

Just thought I'd chime in regarding the install, as I have sort of been
working on that for a while on '65.

Even if you have perfectly made seals-sometimes doors sag, or frame members
are tweaked a bit. It makes installing gaskets difficult sometimes. While
doing the gaskets on my '65 I noticed some fit beautifully, no adhesive
needed, where as others I am still struggling to install. Some you need to
cut-as they are fabricated long, but you shouldn't cut them too short, as
they can shrink a bit post-install.

Just some things to think about while installing.
