What I am not seeing is the most important thing. Someone suggested
you pop the top. You need a visual inspection of the roof under the
camper top so you can ascertain whether or not the roof has been
damaged, and if so, what direction it needs to bend to come back into
a better position.

If the roof has not been bent, I'd hate to see you damage the roof too
with all the pulling.
