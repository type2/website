Like someone else said, those straps are probably going to stretch too 
much.  This is where a come-a-long would probably work best, and you'll 
get a much more accurate pull.  I would probably start with one hinge 
and pull it out a bit, then try and close the door and see if that side 
gets better.  Then move to the other side, pull it, see if it improves, 
and keep going back and forth.

Can you see any marks in the paint that would show where the stress 
points are (where metal bent)?  That might help you identify the 
locations where the actual bend is and also the correct place and angle 
to pull on/from.
