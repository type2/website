Hey Kevin,

I would go with the light bulb first. If its a bit dim, then you can go with 
your meter set on the 10 or 20 amps scale ( use the current measurement 
rather than voltage). As the leakage reduces you can set the meter to lower 
scales to get accurate readings. Remove fuses until the current is zero to 
locate the problem(s).
