Right. I just had surgery Wednesday, so the doctor estimates it will be 
about 6 weeks before I can get in and break the drive train down for an 
"autopsy", so I guess we are at an impasse for now. But you and Gerald have 
put me on the right track for tracking down this transmission mystery.

it. That will identify model and production date.
