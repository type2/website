Subject: MSquirt in an upright?

just idle curiosity at the moment... but is there any looming hurdle 
to converting an upright (1679cc T1) to MegaSquirt? i mean, i am 
aware i need to collect all the relevant fi bits, but will it be 
possible to put it on a bus that originally had a NON-fi motor?
i'm mainly guessing there might be some electrical components or 
wiring that need to be spliced in :)
