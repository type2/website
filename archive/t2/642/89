Subject: Compression and Valves

Someone shoot me. 

Just shoot me. End this miserable excuse for a life.

Did a valve adjustment and compression check yesterday.

1: 122
2: 125
3: 119
4: 124

Better than the 80's I got last time! So what did I do?!?!?! I must
have adjusted the valves poorly, obviously. Grrrrr.......

Plus found my bottom end rattle! It wasn't the bottom end. It was a
loose alternator cover.

Arrrggghhhh!!!! 
Put me out of my misery!!!!
