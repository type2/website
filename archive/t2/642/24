Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Caliper and Pads

I just leave the old pads inside and use an old tire iron or piece of
pipe to lever the pads apart as far as they'll go. This has the
benefit of not over-compressing the pistons since the pads keep you
from pressing them in too far.

I once had a piston compressor tool, and it rocked. But lost it and
never bothered replacing...
