Subject: Re: [T2] Saggy bottom

I was going to take a pic of my 77 Westy, which sits level because of coil-overs in the rear, and a pic of my
78 Westy this morning. To show the difference between them. The 78 rear is the same height as the 77, but the
78 front sits a lot higher. Not sure why but it makes the 78 look like it has a saggy butt even though it
isn't. The 77 has over 300,000 miles on it, the 78 only has 100,000 on it.
Maybe the miles cause the front springs to sag? Maybe the 78 is set higher in the front? Don't know.

But I do know that a drunk in a stolen pickup, at 1:15 am today, plowed head-on into the 78 which then got
pushed back into the 77. Took out the front and rear of the 78 and the front of the 77. Moved both back each a
car length. The white late model Chevy crew cab pickup suffered the most damage. The hood is bent back to the
windshield and both air bags blew. Unfortunately the drunk got away.
