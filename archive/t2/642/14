Subject: gas tank 

Sure. Lot's of venders mentioned on this list sell gas tanks. I bought one 
for mine and was very happy with it. You can also get one from a junkyard if 
you are sure the one you are getting is good.

Just a friendly reminder, typing in all caps is considered bad net etiquette 
because it looks like shouting.
