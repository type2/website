It should be totally doable.  You should be able to get the necessary 
FI bits (injectors, fuel rail, air plenum, fuel pump, fuel pressure 
regulator, intake runners, throttle body, air cleaner [though 
Megasquirt won't use the AFM]) from a '75-or-later Beetle.  You'll have 
to modify your fuel tank to provide a fuel return line.

Note that some of those Beetle FI parts might be identical to Bus FI 
parts (fuel pump and pressure regulator are likely suspects).  I 
believe the injectors are also the same, with the exception of the 
small bit of hose they come with to connect them to the fuel rail.
