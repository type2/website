yes, drilling out the jets can work, but other than driling a single
set to dial in a set of carbs, it's much better to replace the jets w/
a set that are properly marked. (otherwise you will forget what size
and assume the stamped size is correct). That asside I can understand
drilling out the solex jets, they are a bit on the steep side at $7-10
a pop.
