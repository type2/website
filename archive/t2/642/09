Subject: Re: [T2] late bay taillight assembly?

Just don't buy the cheap ones. I got a set of really cheap kits
(housings, seals, lenses, etc) and while they are brighter and in
better shape than my really rotted old original ones, they're crap.
Even Richard made fun of them. ;-)

Here's pics of the new lights and the old ones:

They'll do for now, but putting original ones back on is now on my ToDo list.
