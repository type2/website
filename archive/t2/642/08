I'd also say that you can't depend on the mechanical condition to be 
identical on both sides of the engine. I was considering running two guages, 
one for each side of the exhaust system.

I'm going to drive around with the meter hooked up and then dump the logs to 
the computer. I'll take the same route at the same time of day, same temp 
etc. I'm hoping this cold weather will favor good test results.

The mercedes shop down the road offered me some time on their smog tester 
but I never took them up on the offer. I'll see them again and would like to 
verify my numbers to see if they result in low HC and NOx levels as well.

I've been looking for information to determine sensor accuracy when at the 
tailpipe vs. the header. Do you have any information? I'm planning to have a 
bung welded on where it's about 500F.
