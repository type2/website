Is nobody measuring the their bus for level with the driver in the seat? Our Westy sits high in the front until I get into the front seat. Then it is level. Add a front seat passenger and it sits slightly downhill. Got 7 year old KYB shocks on it, stock everything else. 

Oh... Forgot to mention that this was the case pre-Corvair implant. Need to adjust the torsion bars a notch or two to correct the added 75 lbs in the Westy's rear.
