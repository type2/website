Subject: Re: [T2] winterizing a bus :)

 I am about to put my 74' bus away for the winter.
 
 The solution to all winterizing problems: 

 Drive it to Cali and hang here for the winter! We really don't mind
 having more busses around!!!
  
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Just don't park it in front of my house!

[74 FEET is a very long bus!!!]
