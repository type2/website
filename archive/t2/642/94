Subject: Re: [T2] Compression and Valves

Better than the 80's I got last time! So what did I do?!?!?! I must
have adjusted the valves poorly, obviously. Grrrrr.......

Plus found my bottom end rattle! It wasn't the bottom end. It was a
loose alternator cover.

Arrrggghhhh!!!! 
Put me out of my misery!!!! 


DON'T WORRY... BE HAPPY! <grrrrrr! grin!>

At least it was cheap. Took me two weeks to get my valve right way back when...
