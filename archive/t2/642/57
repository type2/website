Subject: [T2] Brake Caliper and Pads

I think Roberto's suggestions are spot-on, but I would make one minor comment!

It has been ages since I worked on ATE calipers as used on VWs, but at the time 
I thought (and still think) there are risks involved in popping the pistons by 
using compressed air.  If the piston is seriously stuck, typically with 
corrosion from road salt, it may not come out even with 100 psi shop air.  I 
had a porto-power pump that I adapted with an aluminum plate, fittings, and 
brake tubing.  I would split the caliper (despite Bentley's admonitions), block 
off the fluid openings, and apply several hundred psi of hydraulic fluid 
pressure.  Never failed to bring the piston out smoothly and safely.  Of 
course, you then must clean the parts thoroughly -- I liked dishwashing liquid 
followed by an alcohol bath.  I did this on dozens of calipers with never a 
failure or crushed finger.  So easy to work on them when they are apart, 
wirebrushing them to look nice...  Now that hydraulic fluid is so cheap at the 
mass merchandisers, 5 gals for maybe $11, it makes even more sense to me.... 
YMMV

..The force will depend of how bad are your callipers, the first time I did 
mines there were a lot of goo all around, some rust inside the cilynders and 
the boots were torn too, so I replaced the whole rubbers, after cleaned all 
parts in brake fluid, I used compress air to free the pistons BUT be 
carefully here, if you plan to do this, if you put to much pressure the 
piston will be coming out like a cannon ball, put a pice of wood betwen the 
piston is a safe mesure.
