Right. I have been referred to this site for comparisons. It was missing 
Porsche torque, so your input is valuable:

http://www.tunacan.net/t4/reference/case.htm

So the porsche motor I am looking at is a 1700. The 2.0 liter porsche motor 
you are referencing then has more torque than a bus motor with a 1.7 or 1.8, 
but less torque than a 2 liter bus motor. Also, I presume torque RPM spec is 
listed at the motor's peak torque? If so, then the porsche motor develops 
torque at a considerably higher RPM than a VW bus motor.

Here are the specs for Porsche 912e, one year only 2000cc with the biggest
valves ever installed in a Type IV engine.
86 HP at 4900 RPMS.
98 lbft at 4000 Rpms.
I don't have a copy of VW Bus or Vanagon air cooled specs.
They are in the various owners manuals.
