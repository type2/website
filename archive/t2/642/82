Subject: RE: [T2] winterizing a bus :)

If it is just for the winter, I would make sure that both batteries are
fully charged now and then simply disconnect them. Same thing with gas, if
it just for one winter - no bid deal. Just fill her up. Also overinflate the
tires to 50-55 PSI (if you have the correct 185R14C tires). Passenger tires
may not tolerate as much. The idea here is that the tires do not suffer from
not being moved.

If you are in a wet climate, spray some Kroil into the cylinders and make
sure that the points are in the closed position. Otherwise they may oxidize
and you may not have spark in spring.

Oil and such can wait until spring.
