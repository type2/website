11.5 VOLTS -- sounds like the fire:

a) toasted your battery
b) toasted your charging circuit (or wiring in the vicinity)

The fuel sender is a hint.

Break out the Bentley diagram and start checking for voltage where voltage
should be.

You'll probably have to replace most wires that are over/near the engine.
Heat damage to wiring is not always visually apparent.

If the battery reached 250 degrees or so it probably had a plate come loose
inside. Replace it.
