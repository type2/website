Subject: Re: [T2] Bumper question

I was at a VW shop a few minutes ago picking up some valve cover
gaskets and spotted some bug bumpers. Same basic style, just different
size/shape.

The middle had the black tape that Ron was talking about. I picked at
one and it started peeling right off. It appears to be just something
to cover the holes in the bumper.

Couldn't some of that crappy door protector rubber strips that
JCWhitless sells be used if the right width is found?
