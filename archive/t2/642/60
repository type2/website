You are correct. 5 fully charged cells and 1 dead cell would be 10.5 - 11
volts. There is probably 1 partially separated plate in there preventing
full charge across all cells.

But he jump-started it. If the alternator were working properly it should
run fine after being started and revved up fast enough to excite the field.

So, there are multiple problems, starting with the base electricals.
Voltage from the battery and alternator isn't getting where it should.

And, after even a minor fire I wouldn't trust any wires in the vicinity --
including not trusting the idiot lights on the dash that they connect to.

Fresh battery and good VOM. Pull the distributor cap to avoid toasting a
set of points and coil. Turn the key on. Get the Bentley. Make sure there
is at least 12 volts everywhere it should be with the key in the "run"
position (including up at the fuel guage -- there should be +12 from the
wiring harness to the guage -- the wire from the guage to the sender is the
ground run through a variable resistor). Use the FI section of the Bentley
to check for voltage at the proper points when you manually move the AFM
flap. 

Don't even try to start the bus until you're sure all of that is correct.
Don't replace any parts or wires unless you find no voltage in a place that
you should have it. 

While going over the voltage points remove, clean, and reattach all ground
connections and any high amperage connections (battery to starter for
example). 

Electrical problems are, unfortunately, not usually a 10 minute - replace
one bad part - fix. Especially in older vehicles an electrical problem is
usually a build-up of several parts partially failing due to age and
corrosion. Putting in a single new component can often cause another,
related, component that was marginal to fail. Domino effect. You have to
figure out what broke then visually and electrically inspect everything
that connected to that failed part to be sure you won't have another
failure.
