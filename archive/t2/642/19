Subject: cuts out

75 FI single vac 1800: i am trying to get this one moving after a small
engine fire. after driving 10K miles i had a fire but was still able to
drive. i went 60 miles then slowed through a town and the bus cut out. once
in a while it would start up after resting, but would cut out after a few
minutes during idle.

all the wiring and vacuum is on tight. overnight battery charge on a 20
month old battery brought it up to 11.5 amps.

first thing i did was get the battery in and expect to go. didn't, i had to
touch it up with another bus and drove the bus two blocks and it cut out. i
turned it around on a flatspot and push started it downhill home. it cut
out and while rolling i push started it again and got it to the driveway.
then no jumping with another bus would turn it over. while waiting for the
better battery to come home from errands i changed out the fuel sending
unit because the needle hadn't come up since during the trip. it still
doesn't.

when the V6 came home i jumped the bus and it cut out after a few minutes.
after that the big engine car wouldn't jump it.  any suggestions?  - steve
