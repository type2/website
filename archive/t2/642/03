I get mixed responses when I say "Gene Berg Enterprises". In Gene's days, he 
seemed highly respected as a forefront engineer exploring the facts of a lot 
of things that today we take for granted. But it seems some of his research 
is flawed, or superceded by current research, or just plain perpetuating 
false myths. I'm still a newbie, so I can't come up with any facts, but 
these are some of the kinds of impressions I am getting in conversations. 
Plus GBE does no type 4 at all.
