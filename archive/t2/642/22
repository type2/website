Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Caliper and Pads

Hello Brian

Congratulations for your effort trying to fixing your breaks, DIY and enjoy 
the process,
there is a tool to separate the pistons from the pads, but you can do it 
with the use of a lever betwen the pad and the disk just be careful not to 
damage it, you will need apply some force here and they move slowly, play 
attention to the fluid  reservoir because if you push the pads to far and 
there is too much fluid in the reservoir it will overflow with the 
respective problems.
You can do the pads one at time, after you make enogh space to retreive one 
pad work the other one.
The force will depend of how bad are your callipers, the first time I did 
mines there were a lot of goo all around, some rust inside the cilynders and 
the boots were torn too, so I replaced the whole rubbers, after cleaned all 
parts in brake fluid, I used compress air to free the pistons BUT be 
carefully here, if you plan to do this, if you put to much pressure the 
piston will be coming out like a cannon ball, put a pice of wood betwen the 
piston is a safe mesure.
Go try, look at your workshop manual (if you do not have one, go and get it, 
it is money in the bank) and you can always ask to the list, it is an 
endless source of information.

Good look
