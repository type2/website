GBE has started selling a FI kit for uprights. Complete with dual
throttle bodies and manifolds.  Looks like a stubby dual carb rig.

You do have lots of options. FI was installed on the Type 3 cars, so
the manifolds and such are around. Same heads, right? Same intake
ports? Some mickey mousing will be required to get the Jetronic style
on there, but shouldn't be too bad.

Man, I want to do this so bad I can taste it!!! My bus is SCREAMING at
me for FI! (Ok, it's just my love for the simplicity of fuel
injection. I've NEVER been a fan of carbs. heh)
