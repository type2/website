You don't say where you are so I'll think cold.
I'd fill the tank with stabilizer, a full tank won't get near as much 
condensation in it. As to the batts I'd think about taking them out & 
putting them in a no freeze spot but I'm not positive that's the best thing.

If you have a fresh water system don't forget to drain that and put some RV 
anti-freeze in any traps.

I'd change the oil and check the quality of the anti-freeze in the engine.

The best thing would be to drive it, get it really warm every week or so, 
but that's not always possible.
