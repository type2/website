Gerald,

The bumpers originally came from Rocky Mountain Motor Works...I waited a 
year for them...I'm sure, as Ron at BD said, they are the same as he 
sells.

To my knowledge, *no* one has the rubber bumper inserts and caps for the 
bus...you can buy the bug ones all day long....

THese were original, except for one replacement cap off thesamba for the 
front.

Gonna keep those over-riders? or sell them to me? <grin>
You *know* they wouldn't look right on anything but a Champagne Edition 
bus<double grin>.

Cheers, dave
