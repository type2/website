nope i used them as is when purchased...
just as they came out of the box from CB Performance...
they were suppose to be ready to go but i have had others tell me the same thing that the jets may need to be bigger for them..?
i never took them apart to see the insides of the carbs so dont even know what they look like inside....
 
Btw i now have the carbs back and they are still for sale if anyone is interested..
$200.00 + shipping to the first that sends me the dinero,,,,,,,,,,
a machine shop shouldnt charge much if you want to have the jets drilled out..for them..
i drove with them though so they are driveable until you want to do so..
 
heres a link to them

Did you buy the bigger venturis and air jets when you bought the carbs. Out of the box 34 from CB will not work good 
without these mods and rejetting on a 2 litre. I have also had to drill the air jet out bigger also to make work. Once 
mods made carbs work excellent.
