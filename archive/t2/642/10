Subject: Re: [T2] CIP1 10% off

Does this discount apply to GEX engines? 

Bwahahahahahah!!!

(Sorry, it's not Friday. I'd better stop. I just can't be interested
in buying from a company that sells known crap and pushes it as
quality. I'll pay the 10% and get stuff from Bus Depot or Wolfsburg
West.)
