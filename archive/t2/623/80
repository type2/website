Hello guys

After reading this brakes saga, I was wondering, if my bus (1977 Westfalia,
european style, 1600DP T1 engine, front brake disk no booster) could not
have a dual circuit brakeor not , since I losted all my brakes capability
due a cylinder faliure.
Another question that comes up is if I can adapt a booster system to my no
booster brakes.

Thanks

Roberto
