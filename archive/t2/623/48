Evening,
 
I was driving back to school around 4:50 in bumper to bumper traffic and the bus and everything was going fine.  As traffic started to speed up a car pulled right front of me,  I slammed on my brakes> My brake peddle went to the floor.  I down shifted and grabbed my hand brake all this while attempting to steer in a direction that was clear of cars.  I was able to just make the bus slow enough before traffic ahead of me started to pull away.  I was able to make it into an Advanced Auto and discovered that my left rear brake cylinder gave out.  Break fluid every where.  In less than 30 mins I was able to take apart and reassemble the left wheel and was on my way to work.  But as  I pulled in to the schools parking lot it gave out again.  My drive home was fun.  30 miles an hour depending mostly on the engine to slow for lights.  I prayed and the Lord delivered me home tonight.  I only had to stop 3 times.  You figure..... Here in Newport News?  So in light of all that has happened I am going to take the day to inspect and replace the break cylinder.   Probably end up replacing both the rears just to make sure.  Man all that I've worked on this month and then out of the blue this happens.   Praise God through it all.
 
I'll take some photos of the before and after the repare job and post them on my web site.
