Subject: First Engine rebuild problems

Hello all
i just wanted to say thanks for all the advice that
you gave me from both groups........I came home yanked
the engine out of my car after putting it in last
night, this evening and tore it down, found my problem
and the reason it locked or sort of seized up.
It seems that the two middle rod bearings got
smashed......I thought that i torqued all of the rod
bearing nuts the same but i guess as the engine heated
it got to tight on those bearings and smashed
them........all else is ok and good........but thanks
for calling my attention to the end play on the
engine. I believe from reading my rebuild book again
over and over that i have come to finally "Get
it".......
thanks again
