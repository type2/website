Mike & List,

I just got Michelin Agilis 81 for my '71 Westfalia.
They're "C" rated, 8ply, aggressive looking tread, and
M+S rated. Costly, but they ride great, steering is
much better (lighter) and highway stability great.

My old tyres were Michelin XZX's from 1991, they were
reinforced, lasted well, still had good tread, but the
sidewalls were getting soft and dry-rotted.. I needed
tyres in a hurry after noticing that one was about to
"let go", and I was running around on my spare.. In
hindsight they really were like driving on
mashmallows!!

If you're going to be keeping your Westfakia for a
long time, then maybe getting the Michelins is worth
the extra money? I hope this set of Michelins lasts me
10+ years like the old ones, though I'm doing more
miles now since my Westy is now my only transport!!

Hope this helps, sorry I can't tell you about snow!
