Oh no, you all have it all wrong. Perhaps as you/we go along the loops get
bigger.

Sold off all of the rat splitty bus shells and projects and funded an 83 2.0L
VanaWesty. Sold said VanaWesty to afford the ultimate resto splitty camper.
"Birthed" me some children and sold resto and everything else in the house like
I had a sudden crack habit or something. Financially recovered and bought '97
Eurovan camper. Used it (and LOVED it) for three years. Decide to clear out
every last piece, part and hint of aircooled VW stash. Swear to be eternally
-out- of aircooled VWs. Re-examine family budget and then sold much loved
Eurobago to stretch the budget. See above for 2, 4 and 44 year old reasons of
imagined crack habit. We will call it a family, rent and food.
Bought 72 Sundial with supposed fully built 2.0L and mechanically sound drive
train -to stretch the budget-. Budget gets REALLY stretched with supposed 2.0L
sucks an intake guide. Engine teardown reveals wornout 1700. Seller fails to
stand up to advertised text. Double checked to find that seller has a checkered
reputation. Name withheld. Next look is that wife spys a local newspaper ad for
one owner SunCity low mileage <60k OG odometer> 1995 Eurobago for $7500. Missed
it as it sold by 0630hrs first day ad. =(
Saving funds for a genuinely nice 1800 or 2.0L... Drive F150 in the meantime.
Dream of ultimate resto splitty camper. <Naw... or maybe...?>
