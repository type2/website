Subject: Bent bumpers

I was thinking about hooking a chain to the bumper....

YEP I have fixed two cars this way. Both had bent parts i could not straighten any other way. First was the rear bumper of a Lanica that got rearended. Hooked a chain to the bumper bolts, tied it to a tree, got a walkign start of 1-2 mph, and the panel popped out. When we got done, you could hardly tell the car had been hit. 

Other car was a '72 Super Beetle. Front fender got bumped in such a way that the headlight was pointing down. Got a bolt through the headlight bucket at the bottom and some gentle reverse gear persuasion and the headlight wnt right back. Slight cracking of the paint. 

Just remember to put in the clutch before the chain goes taunt. That way the weight of the car does the pulling and not the drivetrain. Too much of a shock on the drivetrain to snap against a chain.
