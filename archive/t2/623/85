<<Has anyone ever rollered it on to a bus, and if so, how did it come out?>>

It came out great but we had a bit of difficulty with rolling the bus over on it's sides so the paint would dry on a flat surface... <griN!> 

I have rollered enamel on (former sign business employee) and it works very well with a foam roller. Roll it one, and then several times after that (waiting several minutes each time) reroll it with no additional paint, same roller and progressively lighter touch. Will finish will only slight orange peel and looks fine. Tough to do on anything but smooth surfaces. Spraying is very much worth the trouble...
