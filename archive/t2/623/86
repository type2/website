But you've got to experiment a bit with other obsessions before you can settle on a VW and "KNOW" you've found the center of your universe. It's the reason we date, try a variety of foods, buy and sell cars, consider hang gliding (before a fall off of the family step ladder reminds you about gravity and death), and ride motorcycles.
