Heck for all the time I spent thinking about my Corvair implant, I could have whittled a new Type IV engine out of aluminum AND added an extra 2 cylinders. Spent WAY too much time pondering that project. Was pretty easy in the end. 

Yeah those stock-folks got it easy. Take it apart, clean it, paint it, replace the gasket/seal/bushing/bearing and put it back together. <grin!>
