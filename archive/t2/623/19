These are the wheels I bought...

Those pics are from the auction I won, so they are not currently available.... 

I believe they are the same dimensions as the measurements you listed Don. I think there are no fitment issues that I can see after putting them on my bus sans tires. The wheel had 1.5"-2" of clearance from the trailing arm (eyeballing the distance). I may have to add a spacer once I get a tire on there but a few mm (10mm) isn't going to scare me.

That is a part locator that is connected to a BUNCH of junkyards. Comparison shop on the prices though. A VW Cabrio top boot (cover for the folded top) was high priced compared to other sources I have heard of. Of course it is a junkyard, all prices are prob negotiable. 

Sure wish the local junkyards were as economical and well stocked as the CA ones. Well, it's not worth living in CA of course!!! <grin!> 

See ya!
