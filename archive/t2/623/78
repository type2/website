Not to quibble, but ya'll are not talking about the busloops here. 
You're describing a related but different mental condition. Busloops 
only come from having (or wanting) a bus and believing (rightly or 
wrongly) that it can fulfill your every dream. You know you have the 
busloops when you come to believe that you can drive your bus to the 
fields of ambrosia* and, once there, meet every creature desire and 
spiritual need you have ever managed to desire and need. Not to mention 
some desires and needs that you never knew you desired or needed, ones 
that only come with bus ownership.

*"Fields of ambrosia" is a joke from an old Stacey Keach movie about an 
itinerant executioner who traveled from jail to jail with an electric 
chair in the back of his truck.
