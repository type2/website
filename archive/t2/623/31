Subject: Re: [T2] Mercedes Wheels (Was: Tires)

I lucked out then because my wheels will slide on the rear hubs no studs problem - but the front's require the centerbore to be modified just a bit. Consequently I'll do all four so I can rotate the tires. Thankfully we have a full machine shop here at work so i think I can get the work I need done. 

Is there any reason a person couldn't bore out the lug holes a bit to go on the VW studs? Is it going to require machine shop work or would a big drill be enough? 

Also weren't the lug nut mating surface (with the wheel to lug nut surface) different? Just gather the right nuts? 

Thanks guys! 

Chris
