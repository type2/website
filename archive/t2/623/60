Subject: Driveway blues

Missed lining up on the driveway last night and hit the rear bumper on the
old tire and post marking the right side of the drive. :O(

The bumper's bent back into the body on that side.  I was thinking about
hooking a chain to the bumper and pulling the bumper back out to
approximately the right position.  Is this stupid, desperate, or simply
field expedient "okay"?

I feel bad that I gave him a boo-boo...
