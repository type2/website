Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Pump Harness

From first tests the Double Relay was a no go. Need a new one. Is your bus 
and Auto? What year is it? On the starter/solenoid there are to points to 
which I can connect a spade connetion, both are occupied. I noticed one of 
the wires going into that harness is the striped one to the fuel pump or 
same type of wire. Would it make a difference which connector it is 
connected to? I did not try switching them, just getting Busloops trying to 
think without looking and by memory what could be wrong here. Wait a minute 
looping back to the Double Relay again....wiring harness....spade 
connectors....I was getting spark....operated the flap on the AFM..... got 
to fix that rust hole....tires....windshield.....Pistons and Cylinders.... 
must kill FedEx.....fuel pump was working....8 track player laying on the 
bench.....flatscreen LCD for DVD in bus....Vanagon interior into a '77...... 
oh what a world, what a world .
