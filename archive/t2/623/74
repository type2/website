Sounds like my motorcycle habit. I THINK I've kicked it by buying a Cabrio so

Ah! not to say "been there- done that" BUT the reason that I originally got
into Aircooled VWs was switching from an old KZ400 (should have been a KZ! to
make a good story) to a 1970 Ghia convertible. I was just married for the first
time, wanted a touch of additional -perceived- safety and the ability to retain
the wind in our hair and hold a conversation without shouting over my shoulder
at my new bride. I sure miss that Kawasaki... 

I stole the mint condition Ghia based on some college girls' complaint that it
was "too much of a PITA to put the top up and down." Daddy was going to buy her
a new 2-door Oldsmobile something that was popular with the coed disco crowd. I
begrudgingly gave her $1450 for the car and then drove it for six years.
Bah-hahahaha!
Irony is that it came down to a Sophies choice between selling my starter house
or the Ghia in a post-divorce scenario. Ah but that was decades ago...
