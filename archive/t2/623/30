The bus is 5 x 112.     But, the bus uses 14mm wheel bolts.  Most MB and Audi wheels have
12mm bolt holes.  On MB, only the 140, 215, 220, 230, and ML chassis use 14mm bolts. All the rest: 107, 108,
114, 115, 123, 124, 126, 129, 201, 202, 203, 210, and 211 use 12mm.
Audi Turbo are 5 bolt and 112 but, some are 12 and some are 14mm........
