I had it bad this past weekend.  I was thinking, "I'll just pull the 
ol' engine out and swap transaxles and pop the engine back in.  But 
nooooooo.....

I had to re-do the inner CV joints because the grease became soupy 
(gear oil leak) on the left CV joint and the boot was torn on the 
right.

Sez Slay, "I just have one more thing to do."

I tried to do the two-screwdriver trick on the CV circlip.

Slay: "Just fifteen more minutes."

Skridge (me wife): "Is that Volkswagen minutes?"

Finally, I borrowed the wife's mini-van to go get circlip pliers.

I was now able to make twice the number of mistakes in half the 
time......
