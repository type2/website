I went to a tool place the other day and saw (not
kidding here) a padded seat you attach to the trailer
hitch.  A small mod would make it fit the hitch on the
back of the bus.  Add a garbage bag lined bucket and a
curtain (queen sized bedsheets work well) and you're
set.

My dream modification is to add a permanent tow dolly
to the front.  Seems that I'm always needing one...
