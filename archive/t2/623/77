Subject: AIRS help needed Bus Down!

I just got a call from Rob Henley.

Long Version short:

The three bolts from the flex plate to the torque converter have backed 
themselves out or atleast two of them. He needs the sixe and type of the 
bolts. I can get to them when I get home but can't from here. If anyone can 
help with the specs on these bolts please email me or call my cell phone at 
704-400-3089. He is trying to find something to get him home.
