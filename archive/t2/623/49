I have 15" wheels similar to this on my Mercedes-Benz 230CE.
My wheels are model RA184 (number 184 is cast into the
rim near the center hub).  Smaller center cap on my rims though.
The areas where the lug bolts contact my BBS alloy rims are
conical in shape.

The stock MB steel and alloy wheels have a spherical shape
to the bolt and rim contact areas.  IIRC, the VW Type2 nuts
also have a spherical shape where they contact the wheel rim.

I've heard that the "bundt cake pan" style stock MB alloy rims
attach to the late model Type2 hubs without any modifications.
