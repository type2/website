Hi,

John Brown's Buses in Harper's Ferry,WV is the  weekend of October 
15th.  Complete info is at the web-site 
http://www.johnbrownsbuses.com/  All years of VW Transporters from 
barndoors to Eurovans are welcome! Jamie, your humble host, is a real 
swell fellow who puts on a nice event  Check out the web site for a 
list of activities and pics from the last few years of the event. 
This is a VERY family friendly event.

I have already made reservations at campground. As it stands now, my 
family will depart Greensboro, NC on  Thursday the 14th about lunch 
time. We will head north on US 220 to Roanoke. In Roanoke we will 
pick up I 581 to I 81 north for the rest of the journey. If anyone 
wants to hook up for a carabus e-mail me.

There is also a group departing western NY Friday morning. Contact 
Greg(-at-)pottsfamily.ca for more info on that group.

Thanks
Chris
