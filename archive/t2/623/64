Noisy up top? Air injection ports -  a plug has fallen out. 

Noisy down below? Exhaust gaskets. If the manifold to the engine joint is noisy, remov ethe heat exchanger and file the tops of the pipes together with a long file until both pipes are shiny all the way around. These pipes warp every 20 years or so... You are getting them flat together so they will seal.
