Subject: John Brown's Carabus - Lake Erie State Park (NY) to Harper's

Hi Vollks,

This note is just to let people know about the carabus I'm planning 
heading from Northwestern New York state down to Harper's Ferry West 
Virginia for John Brown's Buses on Friday October 15th, 2004.

The plan is to gather a group of fully fueled buses at Lake Erie State 
Park at 8:30 AM, and head down to JBB at 9. We'll be taking I90 across 
the top of PA to I79 at 9:45, then south *almost* to Pittsburgh (11:30) 
before we turn East onto the Penna Turnpike. We'll take the pike 
through the Allegheny Tunnel, stop for fuel on the other side and head 
down to Breezewood (2:00) where we'll take I-70 to I-68 (2:45) and then 
I-81 (3:30) to Martinsburg. (3:45) This route should get us there in 
good time and keep us clear of the Friday afternoon rush hour traffic. 
We'll be rolling along at a more-or-less steady 60 MPH as much as 
possible, with the speed demons at the back of the line and the 
slow-pokes up front.

If there are list-members from Southern Ontario, Buffalo, Erie, 
Pittsburgh, or any other place enroute that want to join us, please 
send a message to greg_at_pottsfamily.ca and we'll figure out the best 
place to hook up. I'm expecting at least a half-dozen buses in the 
group so I need to keep the number of stops to a minimum. CB Radios 
will be helpful to keep the carabus rolling smoothly, so if you have 
one please bring it. I don't have an FRS radio but if someone wants to 
loan one to me I'll be happy to use that too.

I'm not planning an official carabus for the trip home, but it will 
essentially be the same route in reverse, leaving Harper's Ferry on 
Sunday around 12PM.

Only 24 days to go...

Happy trails,
