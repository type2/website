NO!  search for the C/D all season tires, they are out there. the
passenger tires cannot handle the weight, and a sidewall blowout at
highway speeds can be deadly.  (I was lucky when it happened to me)

get snow/winter tires, go up to 195 or even 205 to get em.  I have
205R70-14 tires on mine, all season radials and they do handle quite well
on snow (I ski)   mine are Michelins, not cheap.
