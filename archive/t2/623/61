Subject: Re: [T2] engine noises that sound like exhaust

high kyle.... i am not sure what you mean..? if there is an exhaust leak it will be loud..
try when the engine is cold and a block under the tire/s... reach your hand gently around the pipes but not touching them....from the side that is the loudest,.. see if you can feel air coming out of the pipe..starting with the connections of the exhaust at each connection point... and then work your way arund the exhaust pipe it's self....
 
also you can when engine is cold try a air pump like for a blow up mattress and stick it in the tail pipe and then see if you can feel any air coming out anywheres... make sure that it is light air not forcing air that you are using in the end of the tail pipe..
i have done this before and it seemed to work well and i found leaks i didnt know i had...
 
if you are hearing a hissing type noise by you saying air being forced you may have a vaccum leak... a hissing may be from the brake booster line... it will hiss at you...start with it at the servo...
work your way back... you can also use a air pump(blow up mattress kind) on it ... dissconnect each end of it and plug one end off... use the air pump at the open end and run your hand down it to see if you hear /feel air....
good luck 
peace
