Hi Everyone.,
Just wanted to let you know that Bill Colville, made it home okay, but had
some problems beginning Tuesday morning. To make a long story short he had
surgery on Thursday nite, came thru fine, but had a stroke Friday morning
leaving him blind and with short term memory loss. He doesn't remember much
past from last Sunday on. I'm holding up, but barely.
Please think good thoughts for us. I may be calling on your help soon.
Thanks,
Janet  Colville
