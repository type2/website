Well for new they are asking $1000 + . http://www.espar.com/... Someone in
the Midwest (I think one of the Buskatiers made a video on how to work on
your gas heater)  They were offering the tape for $19.95 if I remember
correctly.

Or if you have a friend in Cali, someone on vintagebus is always claiming
they can be had for $100...  Usually when someone else is trying to sell
theirs for more.  I have had my friends in Cali searching the swaps for over
a year now and they haven't seen a heater for that cheap yet.  But I have
seen them on the list for sale for $200-300... again that would be used,
original.
