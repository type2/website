Subject: Funky Jerry Can

Hi All -
As many of us do, I keep a Jerry can full of extra gas on board my bus -
strapped to the roof up in the front luggage area, to be exact.  The Jerry
can is one of those standard red plastic types, and is approximately 3 years
old.  Yesterday I took it down because I needed some gas, and noticed that
the outside of the can seemed deteriorated: the red color seems to now be
fading and morphing into an orangish color in many places, and there was
also what looked like bubbling on the surface.  Just thinking it was fading
from age, I opened it up and pulled out the long nozzle that, when not in
use, hangs into the gas on the inside.  Looking at the plastic
accordion-like nozzle, it had a reddish-orange tint to it (i.e. same color
as inside of the can?).  I wiped a portion it with my finger, and it came
off to reveal the normal white color of the nozzle.  This leads me to
believe that there is red coloration from the Jerry can in the gas itself,
and it is caused this apparent discoloration.  Therefore, my question is
this:  Is this gas still OK to pour in & use in my engine?  I don't know,
but it just seems like this coloration substance is not something that would
be filtered out and subsequently would not be good running through my
engine.  What do you think???  Thanks for your help!
