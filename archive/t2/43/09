Yep, it's mounted overhead to the left of the engine, screwed into the luggage compartment floor.  I can hear it all the time then the RPMs are below about 1500-
2000.

It reminds me of the sound that those Radio Shack 6v-12v voltage converters make, which I suppose is because both items use similar circuitry.
