Indeed, stock ist beste, sometimes a little better, most times a lot better
than other than stock. 009 will work on a T-I motor, but stock will
function beste always for normal street driving. Smooth power through all
rpm's and 2 or 3 or 5 miles per gallon better fuel mileage adds up to a lot
of bucks and satisfying use over time. Do not modify the maschine unless
you have other than normal street driving in mind. Refined factory specs
ist gut, holding closer to spec min/max clearances and balance. Changing
any factory components ist risky with time/money always, unless your going
to use the vehicle in a way not contemplated by the engineers who designed
each one of those thousands of parts. Then you become your own engineer,
and of course writing down all the data obtained from redundant actual
calibrated measures to prove results or lack thereof from the variables
interjected by non-stock components.
