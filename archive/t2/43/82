Subject: small kerosene heaters (only for us very poor volks)

Coffee can kerosene heater
Materials needed:
          One pound coffee can
          Small 15 or 16 oz soup/bean can
          Aluminum foil
          Small kerosene lamp
Tools: tin snips
           Pry style can opener that cuts small triangle holes

Step 1: Using your can opener cut vent holes around the inside circumference 
of the closed end on the coffee can and around the outside circumference of 
the open end of the can. About 12 holes around each end works good
Step 2: Remove one end of the soup can, eat contents. Drill or cut a hole 
about an inch in diameter centered in the other end of the can. using can 
opener cut two hole on opposing sides of the open end of can
Step 3: Place the soup can inside the coffee can with the small one inch 
hole to the closed vented end of the coffee can. You want to fashion a 
spacer(s) (three balls of aluminum foil works) to go between the ends of the 
two cans so the one inch hole is centered with about half an inch of air 
space between the end of the coffee can.
Step 4: fill the space between the outside of the cans by packing with 
aluminum foil
Step 5: light kerosene lamp. Place can over the top, kick back and enjoy 5 – 
10 BTUs of heat heehee!!!
Air travels up through the vents in the bottom of the coffee cans… making 
it’s way up through the hole in the center of the soup can where it is 
heated by the flame..  exits the small hole, flows across the inside top of 
the coffee can absorbing more heat and on toward the vent holes where it 
flows into your bus.. A few of these heaters will keep you from freezing to 
death in your bus or tent. Yay! Not the most efficient heater nor the 
warmest but it is very cheap. you can put a metal coffee cup on top of this 
and heat water for tea.. don't look at your watch, it may take awhile
happy freezing
