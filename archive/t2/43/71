Ronnie,

I wish I knew you were there, I would have tried to meet up with you.  I got 
back this morning about 2am.

I had a nice lunch with Ron Salmon yesterday of bus depot fame.  Thanks again 
Ron for buying lunch!

I spent most of my time at the convention center looking at accessories.  I 
met with a new European supplier that has stuff for Vanagon and EuroVan, as 
well as an Asian supplier that makes stick on deflectors for EuroVan.  

I was amazed to see a couple of firms showing off air cooled VW parts 
including a new Mexican turnkey motor.

The Hazet tool display was great.  These tools are beautiful and have a great 
feel.  They are also some of the most expensive tools I've run across. 

Attendance was down at the show this year, though it seemed crowded most of 
the time.  I had an interesting meeting with the folks at Duplicolor.  They 
have paint codes for most VWs back to about 1970.  I plan on offering touch 
up paint for the new EuroVan campers, but wondered if it would be worthwhile 
to carry some common bus or vanagon colors as well.  I might be willing to do 
a onetime purchase if anyone is interested.  You would need to order 3 spray 
cans or touchup bottles of each color.  I would need the actual VW paint code 
and it may take a couple of weeks before I could get back to you.
