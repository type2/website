Go with 12V appliances wherever possible.  Truck stops have the 
best selection.  You should be okay with a second battery and 
driving every couple of days.  Get a deep cycle battery or if you 
can spare $100 get two 6V golf cart batteries in series which will 
handle deep discharging much better than the 12V RV/Marine variety.

Unless you're parked way away from everyone, it will draw 
attention to you.  I'd avoid this route if I were you.

Again, use 12V appliances wherever possible as they are much more 
efficient than using 110V ones with an inverter.  With only one 
battery, I'd keep the inverter to no more than 300 watts and use 
it sparingly.

As long as you can keep it away from weather and theives.

Depending on how much you use the 2nd battery, probably not.  You 
would have to spend several hundred dollars to get a panel big 
enough to do any good, and it would be cumbersome and prone to 
theft.  If you use the second battery only a couple of hours each 
evening to power a light bulb, you might break even with a $100 
solar panel.  Those little $20 panels that you set on your 
dashboard are nearly worthless as they only put out a few 
milliamps.

Most people will recommend against it.  Even if you crack the 
windows you will likely wake up with a headache due to oxygen 
deprivation.  You might not wake up at all.  Don't risk it - 
instead buy a good sleeping bag!  If you must use the catalytic 
heater, do so only when you are awake and keep the windows cracked.

>Also, what about an

Forget it - won't work.  They draw way too much power.  You can 
only use them if you can plug in to wall power somewhere.  Rule of 
thumb - nothing that makes significant heat can run very long off 
of 12V.

Don't worry, we love this stuff.  Most of us are strongly 
opinionated grizzled veterans.  Ask all the questions you want!
