Subject: Re: [T2] Heating Question

Air flows the the area of least pressure -- basically just like water.

The heater blower will fill up the rear duct first and then it will back up 
and spill over in the front duct work. It takes about 1 second for this to 
happen.

There is a good chance that the center flapper box has a broken cable. Did 
you check it for free movement?

Anyone know who supplies a replacement cable for a '78 Westy for the 
flapper box under the front seats that divides air flow from back to front?

My bus came with a rag stuffed in the rear heater outlet. I'd make sure 
that the center flapper is set right manually so you don't reduce airflow 
to the front with the back portion shut off. I think that is what is wrong 
with my bus. That project is scheduled to happen about 10 minutes after I 
get the bus back on the road...
