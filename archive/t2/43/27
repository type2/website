Subject: Front Beam removal!

Hello all,
     I decided that today would be the today to remove the "good" front beam
from a wrecked bus and then was planning on removing the "bad" front beam
from my 74 and switching them.  I got an early start because I was expecting
a long day but I never imagined the difficulty I would have.  So I haven't
even removed the "bad" beam  yet.  I wasn't able to remove the drag link
from the relay lever, I do not have the tool which is being used in bentley
but I tried everything else and still know luck.  The threads are just
screwed but I don't really care but I will care when I remove the "bad" beam
from my good bus.    So for those who have removed beams before what did you
use to remove the drag link?  I've tried hammering, heat and a pitman arm
puller without results.  Lastly can I find and buy a tool at a FLAPS that
will do the job.  Thanks, Marcus
