Subject: Fast German Auto,  anyone know anything about =?iso-8859-1?q?them=3F?=

I hate to ask this question because I know we have several engine
rebuilders on this list and I don't want to offend anyone but I was
wondering if anyone knows anything about Fast German Auto?  I saw
their ad in VW Trends and have visited their website and the price is
appealing.  I know,  I know, cheap engine rebuilds only spell trouble
down the road.  Just was wondering about them though.
 
Thanks,
 
Kevin
