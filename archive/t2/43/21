The red coloration on your nozzle is more likely from the fuel itself.
You can still use the fuel, but I'd mix it with a tank of fresh fuel.

You should not let gas sit for too long in the can.  I keep a 1-gallon can
in my bus and use it to fuel my lawn mower and generator when they need
it.  When the can gets half empty, I pour the rest into the tank and fill
it with fresh gas when I fill the bus up.

Plastic cans will not last indefinitely in the sun.  About 2 years will
produce noticable deterioration and fading in the plastic and at that
point the can should be replaced.

OTOH, I have a can that I use for waste oil that sits in the sun every day
and despite fading over 5+ years is still structurally sound.  I wouldn't
use it for gasoline, though!
