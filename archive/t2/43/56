Subject: My SEMA Adventure

  I made my way to the SEMA (largest automotive trade show in the world)
show this week and found and didn't find out a few things.

1. Nobody is making a 185 or 195/15 6 or 8 ply tire anymore, but I am
looking into some 205/75/15 6 or 8 plys. I should have more info by next
week.( I visited with at least 15 major tire manufacturers)

2. Tools; I got some info on one of the best rust removel (also paint,
undercoating, etc.) tools I have ever seen. It's an air powered tool that
uses special wire, scotch bright and foam wheels for rust removel pait and
for polishing. The tool cost 300 dollars, but did it ever work fast and
good. More info to follow.

3. Met with my friends from MIRA CHEM, they make the best rust remover and
preservitive I have ever used. Go to there web site. Look for MiraChem 250

4. We are losing yet more oil companies. Cheveron bought Texaco and will be
phasing out Texaco in the next couple years with SHELL buying existing
Texaco stations. Union 76 bought Kendal and Phillips 66. We'll have to see
how this affects us, even though they did say that Kendal GT1 oil will
remain the same (the best oil there is for air cooled engines)

5. I opened my SWD status with SCAT (will now stock all there engine
products). Also closed my WD status with HAZET and other German tool
importers. My goal with that is to get the special tools at a decent price

6. For all you bay drivers with AC, I am working on low HP draw AC
compressors that will retrofit with the original compressor. 

I hope this info is of interest to some of you
