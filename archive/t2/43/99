Karl,
My friends 79 runs up to pressure when the ignition is turned on, and
shuts off when that pressure is met.

My Vanagon does the same thing---is a 78 that much different?

WHOA!! 
Doing this ''test'' will lead you to THINK you have a pump/filter
problem when you DON'T! 
The pump is NOT designed to run when you turn the key on. It only runs
when you are cranking the engine or the engine is running. 
If it runs on YOUR bus with just the key on, YOU have a problem. Go back
to the Bentley, the answer will be there.
