I've used mine for years now with various brands of rubbing alcohol. Never
had a problem with it.

That's why I only use rubbing alcohol. It burns yellow and blue. Quite
visible. 

Yes, there are some safety concerns. I'm not advertising these things. I'm
only saying I've used mine for years now without a problem. It's a chance
I'm willing to take.
