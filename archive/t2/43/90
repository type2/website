Hi,

Carbon Dioxide buildup in an unventilated area is a serious issue. Gas 
heaters are not meant to be used in small/closed spaces.

Old VW's are not air tight. CO2 levels should not reach a serious level 
if you leave your windows cracked a bit. However, don't roll the dice - 
if you use a gas heater (in your van or your house) you should buy a 
Smoke Alarm that can sense serious CO2 levels.

Here is a good article on "unvented kerosene heaters":
