That is undoubtedly the best advice.

I had that transaxle in my bus for a while and while it will 
definately be easier on the engine, BUT 70mph will correspond to 
about 4500rpm.  That's too high for cruising and way out of the 
powerband of the engine, which means that it will probably still 
overheat.

70 requires (educated guess -->) 50% more horsepower than 55 so 
the only way you're going to get there is to upgrade to an engine 
that can comfortably produce that much power.  Be prepared for a 
reduction in fuel mileage.
