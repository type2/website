Corbett,
A working gas heater in a bus is like a computer, if you've never owned
one, you don't know how much you would use one if you had one.  Believe me,
if you live in a moderate to cold climate, if you've never had a working
gas heater, you don't have any idea how much you are missing!!

A new gas heater is very expensive, around $2500, so you would be better
off finding a used one and either rebuilding it yourself, or having someone
rebuild it for you.  A gas heater can be rebuilt numerous times, just
replace the parts that are worn out (which is very few) or rusted out.  If
you have the gas heater in the cabin area of the bus, you should have very
little problems with rust.

Below is a list of people working on the gas heaters, you might want to
contact them about rebuilding one for you, or buying a rebuilt one from
them.

If you need South Wind parts and want to rebuild one yourself, I have parts at:
