List,
You probably already know, but Jake Raby's aircooled technology has a
multi-page step-by-step teardown procedure for a 2.0L in the most recent =
VW
trends.
As correct as the wilson book and very informative.
Its probably oldhat for most of us, but i can imagine some of the hard-co=
re
beetle readers thinking.. "damn them engines is wierd..."

props to Raby,

clark gordon
