I'll jump in here as a physics teacher type and add a BIG safety caution!

I'm rather surprised that ordinary rubbing alcohol will burn well enough.
Rubbing alcohol is only 70% alcohol (30% water) and is hard to light.  You
can get 90% alcohol.

Relatively clean.  It is a hydrocarbon, so any incomplete combustion will
result in HC and CO emissions.

Other worries.  Tip the thing over and you're likely to have a puddle of
burning alcohol in your bus.  Don't count on the toilet paper to contain
all the alcohol

An alcohol flame is not very visible.  If you use ethanol the flame is
almost invisible, particularly in light.  It will still burn you.

And be _darned_ sure that it is out and cold!  In a nearby school, two
students were adding alcohol to a tennis-ball cannon.  A residual flame
caught the fumes on fire, causing the bottle to explode in the student's
hand.  Two students spent over a month in the burn ward.

Personally, I wouldn't have any open flames inside a vehicle.  This device
is similar to the "Desert candles" we have used outdoor for years, but it
is just too dangerous to be inside.
