Reinstall the factory 2000 cc Type IV with correct transmission.

You've probably got the right transmission for a Type IV 2.0 engine which 
is too tall a gear for that 1600cc engine.

The other option would be to find a lower geared transmission - whatever VW 
was installing in late bay 1600cc busses in Europe - and install that. It 
will make the engine happier because it turns more rpms.

Either way don't expect much high speed cruising speeds, it won't be very 
happy pushing that much weight and that much wind.

There are plenty of cores around still but it may take you a while to find 
one for a Type IV. Rebuild it while your bus is running good and you can 
work much more at your leisure and in my case - budget.

Regardless - most of the busses turn the best mpg, least noise, and least 
engine heat at about (some with differ) 100 kph or 62 mph.

They will go faster and make more noise, drink more gasoline.

Whatever suits you.

I had a roommate with a 1200cc 40 HP Beetle that had a 3.88 gearbox 
(somebody blew the OEM engine and replaced it with an Italian spec engine. 
1200cc was the most common engine in that area. Vehicle taxes were based on 
engine displacement.)  Man would it fly on a downhill slope and purr along 
at such a low rpm HOWEVER it was a dog on the hills and ran hot anytime a 
load was put on it for any length of time.
