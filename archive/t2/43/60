Subject: EMPI CHRISTMAS BUS/floor mats

   I've sold out of the first shippment, THANKS to all. I've ordered double
this round before they are gone. 
  If you've ordered and have contacted me, your buses went out today. If you
would still like the pair e-mail me your phone number and we'll get them out
next week .  The cost is $30.00 for the pair, shipping included.

  I've also just recieved another shippment of bus floor front mats 55-59,
60-67 and 68-71, again thanks to all on the list that have purchased these.
