Hiya Gail,

You can identify your particular distributor by checking out the nine digit 
VW part number of your unit.  It is stamped into the distributor body but, 
with most of the distributors, the number winds up facing forward (in other 
words, away from the typical observer at the back of the vehicle) so you'll 
have to either pull the distributor or rotate it so that you can make out the 
number.  The number which is referred to (such as 009) is the last three 
digits of the distributor parts number as in xxx xxx 009.
It's very hard to tell exactly which distributor should be on your 1600.  
There were many distributors used in the overall production run of the 1600 
engine.  You'll need specifics concerning your engine.  Start with serial 
number and application (what exact vehicle is this 1600 from, manual or auto 
tranny, FI or carbed, etc) and work from that point.  There is a dizzy 
application list for to reference.  (For those who know) Isn't that at 
Ronnie's site?
One caveat however.  Remember that most anything could have been done to this 
engine before it fell into your hands.  It may not be a "true" 1600 in the 
original stock sense.  If that IS the case with your engine, finding the 
original distributor may prove to be a fruitless venture.
Good luck!
