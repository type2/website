Subject: 78 transporter $350 in bay area if picked up tonight

This is *not* mine, nor do I know the seller.

78 transporter, starts, idles and drives fine, needs brakes and registration
is not current.
Owner claims to "have all of the paperwork"

one of the heater boxes has a hole in it also. body starting to rust in
usual areas.

I might go check it out myself, not sure if my roommates would appreciatte
another bus floating around the place....

aur(-at-)efn.org

415-876-7424
on 34th and Geary

now you know what I do.

anyone interested in buying this bus together, and possibly using it for
parts let me know.

Christopher
