VW used fiberglass with a vinyl cloth outer layer.  Still intact on my
bus.

I think that the plastic backed fiberglass as sold for water heater
blankets would work fine.  Wrap it around several times, make sure the
edge os on the bottom, and that should keep water out nicely.

Don't try to seal it up perfectly, as that is a sure way to keep any water
that does get in, in.
