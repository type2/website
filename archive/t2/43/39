Thanks guys, like I really need to spend 45 minutes on a Friday morning
browsing mexican and brazilian busses you can buy new. Your just lucky they
don't sell the single cabs and doublecabs anymore in Brazil or I would have
been there for an hour! After I configured my water-cooled mexican combi I
discovered it would cost $19,872. A quick check of brazilian bus prices
leaves me guessing since I can't seem to find a price on the brazilian
site. An alcohol powered air cooled 67HP 1600 standard kombi looks pretty
nice though
