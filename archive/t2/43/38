Subject: 78' Westfalia

Hello,

 I recently purchased a 78' Westfalia.  The prior owner installed an
upright type 1, 1640cc (something like 1644cc or 1646? I don't remember)
dual port, single carb engine.  The other day I had it out on the
freeway for the first time and it quickly started heating up (closing in
on 250 degrees at freeway speeds).  It seems better if I drop it down to
around 55 mph.  Here is my question.  What kind of type 1 motor could I
build that would adequately push this Westy along at 70 mph?

Thanks,
Greg
