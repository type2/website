 do need is a pin that holds on the knob assembly.  Is there something I
 could rig in it's place?

I hate to tell you this but I can almost 100% guarantee that the pivot pin is sheared off on the bottom. No
amount of tightning the clamp will stop the window from flapping in the breeze.
I have a stack of nice pretty ones.....that are worthless because the pivot pin is broken.
Rust 1st appears at the pin, then the window gets a little harder to open, so you apply a little more
pressure, then it opens so easily......
