Subject: RE: [T2] Wal Mart oil change (was Re: [T2] GL4 vs. GL5)

My father and mother were driving their 77 bus to Colorado a couple years
back to visit Joe Cocker (long story) and in Colorado, my father, who
sometimes has questionable judgement, stops at WalMart to get the oil
changed on the bus. The idiot teenager uses his air gun (of course set to
maximum torque), and sheers off the nut on the bottom of the oil pan near
the strainer. Well we all know that means, goodbye engine.

So WalMart was on the hook for a tow across country back to CT, and for a
brand new engine and install. They actually paid for the whole thing. Big
pain in the butt, but a new engine for the bus.
