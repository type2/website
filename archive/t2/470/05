Subject: heater fan problem 

I'm going through the heating system in my '78 - I plan on going stock. But 
- I checked out my heater fan, and there are two empty plugs. On the back of 
the fan there's a plug with 5 prongs (I had to do it by feel). Also there's 
a two spade terminal that I think I read goes to some relay.

I don't see any stray plugs or wires laying around - anyone know where I 
should look for the source of these missing wires/plugs, have part #'s or a 
wiring diagram?

Thanks
Mat
