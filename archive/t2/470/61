Subject: Mechanical Fuel Pump

Hello,


I am in the process of installing a 1700 engine, with a mechanical fuel 
pump, in my 72 van. I am hooking up the fuel lines, but cannot figure out 
which lines go where on the fuel pump. There are three possible spots on the 
fuel pump: two on top and one on the bottom of the fuel pump.

Where does the line from the gas tank go and the one fuel line from the dual 
carbs? What goes to the extra outlet/inlet on the pump?

Thanks in advance, Phil.
