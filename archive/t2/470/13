Ahh---
Acually it's just a heat transfer set up---the water from the coolant
system runs either though some coils in the water heater of the boat
maintaining 220 degree's in the hot water tank--while the engine is
running--

I suppose some coils with ethelyene glycol in them could be wrapped
around or over, and under the heat exchanger's and pumped with a 12 volt
pump into a heater core--or water heater

But why do all this--BUY A VANAGON and get it over with---:>)--

George--you think waaaay too much---:>0

LOL!!!!!

Later,

Second, a 13.5 liter propane fired water heater, the 'Malaga'. Pricing
will be $349. The unit is small enough to fit into the small cubby of
the Vanagon Westfalia left of the fridge, and is self regulated just
like a home type water heater.
Which leads to the interesting idea of a "hydronic" heating system like
that used in some boats. Run the water through tubes located under a
false wood floor and heat the entire floor. Use a thermostat to control
the heat. You could have a nice warm bus 24/7 with such a setup!
