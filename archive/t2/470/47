Billy,

I know it seems stupid, but you *did* put lube back in....

Can you shift with engine off?

2nd and reverse means you are able to *pull* the hockey stick, but not 
apparently *push* it.  You need someone to attempt to gentley go to
1st while you looke...watch those fingers!

I'd call rancho about the leak(assuming you *do* have lube<grin>).

Worst case is having to pull it again and look.

Cheers, dave

seems to be from the side case seals, not the axle retaining ring, 
but the case itself. The trans is clean on the sides by the retaining ring. 
Only fluid is on very bottom of case at case seal.
