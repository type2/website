Subject: engine swap/assesment

Folks,

I am getting ready to pull the engine out of my rusty, canabolized '79 westy 
and intend to put it into my '78 restoration project. The engine has about 
60k on it since the last rebuild which included everything including a total 
balancing job (AMC heads). I had the engine rebuilt shortly after I bought 
the bus ~6 years ago, all the maintenance has been under my control. It runs 
well. I am wondering what I should check before i pull the engine and what 
to check while it is out. The engine has not had a thermastat or the flaps 
as long as I have owned it but I have a set of flaps now. All fuel lines 
will be replaced and the gas tack cleaned and coated. I have pulled several 
engines in the past so I am really only looking for advice about what to 
check that will save me headache in the future.

Here is what I have so far but I know there are more things I should check.

Before pull:

Compression test


While out:

cluch inspect
install thermastat and flaps
Clean and paint tin
Replace rear main seal? (I think this is what is leaking, up by the 
flywheel/bell housing)
replace pushrod tube seals (at least one is leaking)
New injector seals?
Check end play.
look for other oil leaks.
replace pilot bushing? in bell housing for starter.
check the rubber engine mounts


I've thought about checking the heads but I'd rather not take them off? Any 
comments?
I've checked the archives (most stuff I search under is about removal) I 
remember this was on the list just a few weeks ago but they're not in the 
archives yet, should have saved those.

Many thanks,
Brandt

little
