Subject: Re: [T2] Halloween Van Time

I am in Saskatoon, Sk, Canada.

Looks like there might be a slight change of plans.  No painting.
The weather is forcasted as being horrible.. rain/snow -2degrees celcius
and -12 on Saturday.  The paint would look horrible and I don't relish 
washing
it in the cold saturday.

Instead I have a bunch of Magnets I cut out of sheet/sign material. About 30 
or
so in all ranging from 2 big peace symbol signs (2 ft across) to flowers, 
hearts,
and splats. I'll probably paint them all funky psychadelic colors and stuff 
tonight.
The arms are tired from all the cutting with the utility knife. If I do more 
I might
just do some bubble-lettering and 'write' some neat messages :)

I'm a little dissapointed in the weather and not painting the van but also a 
little
relieved.  The music and dressing up while trick or treating in the 
afternoon is still
on.  I'll not give up on the kidlets for any weather.

I'll will take some pictures when it's all done up and post them for you and 
the list.

James
