I would still shift the shocks side to side.  Shock mount bushings going
bad can feel tight as a drum to hand pressure and still sound like this.
You just cannot exert the 3000 pounds of force that the bus can.
Shifting them costs nothing except some sweat and if the problem moves
with the shocks, then you know to replace.

installation.
