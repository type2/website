Jeff,

I have found some excellent replacements. I bought them from spaenaur -
http://www.spaenaur.com/. Speanaur does not sell online at the moment, and
they are based in Cambridge Ontario. The washers I got are made by "Metric
Blue" and they are a good match for the original, they are class 12.9 and
about 4mm thick. I also replaced the nuts with metric blue ones which are
the right hardness, extra deep and 15mm across the flats, just like the
originals.

Mcmaster-Carr sells metric blue products in the USA. They also will have
other washers that might come close to the original. The trick is to find
one that have the right hardness, thickness and outside diameter, most 10mm
washers will be too large on the OD to fit in the recess in the head. The
blue ones are perfect.
