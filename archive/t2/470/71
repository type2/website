Subject: Clutch ... it would seem.

Well, I was cresting the big hill by my place today and I pushed the 
clutch in, pulled it out of thrid and went to pop it into fourth but 
... hmmm, wont go into gear ... ok, clutch out, in again, into fourth 
... nope, back to third ? nope ... ANY GEAR ? Nope ... the clutch isnt 
doing its job here ... So I stopped the bus in the nice wide shoulder, 
slipped under .... the pedal is pulling the cable, the cable is pulling 
the lever at the tranny ... but its not disengaging the clutch 
mechanism. So being not more than 5 minutes from my house, I started 
her in first and we are rolling along on the shoulder and she is now in 
the driveway.


Any ideas what has gone wrong ? I am not looking forward to a drop, but 
I guess there is no choice !

Steve
