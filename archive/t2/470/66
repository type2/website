Subject: pics of functioning heater fan?

Anyone have good pics of a functioning heater fan and the associated wiring 
in a 76-78 bus? I would like to see what mine is supposed to look like, 
since I'm missing some of the wiring. It used to have the heat set up, but 
at some point it got pulled apart. I doubt they would have cut the wiring 
out - I wonder if it got tucked away or taped up. I'd like to see examples 
of what I should be looking for.

thanks
Mat
'78 bus
