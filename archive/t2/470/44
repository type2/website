Subject: RE: [T2] Distributor and vacuum advance

I will check out the links that you sent me. 

I got my information from my Bentley manual for 68-79 buses. It is on page
5-73, upper right hand side. It is under the "check vacuum advance cutoff".
I noticed this vacuum advance cutoff on my bus was not hooked up so I
started to see what it was used for. This page explains that it is used to
stop the vacuum advance from happening until in 4th gear or below a specific
temp.

I am finding out now that my stock distributor has a specific curve to it
that differs from the 009. I read the article on aircooled.net about how to
adjust curves (not something I am going to attempt). I guess it explains the
difference in the distributors, but not the use of this advance cut off. 

Does anyone else have this cutoff valve connected on their busses? Bentley
says it is used on all dual carb engines.
