The answer is that torque does not really depend upon bore or stroke.  Torque is more-or-less proportional to displacement and the 2.0 has more displacement.  Displacement is the highest-order factor in torque production.  The design of the intake tract is also very important.  Bore vs. stroke has a relatively minor impact on the amount of torque produced, although it is important in terms of where in the rpm range peak torque is produced.
