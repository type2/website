In my limited exprience crap and German are the only two choices so often I prefer German used to crap new when German items are overpriced. Items like a Mexican Hella taillight assembly are obvious exceptions.

- I'd get the Hagus OE mirrors from Bus Depot if they have them. Don't get substituted on for Mexican if they are out of stock. Look elsewhere but the price is going to be a lot from ($35-45). Personally I can't stand the ones with the black/white bead on them. I believe CIP1 doesn't even guarantee the bead color will match L to R.

- You can get a German bezel from OEVeedub but at $42 I'd probably prefer a junkyard unit in good condition.

- rear side markers and bulb holders only come in one quality. I haven't put the lenses a long term test but the holders are made in Taiwan and I'm wasn't happy with what I received when the BD website picture was of a genuine Hella unit.
