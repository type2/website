but the price is going to be a lot from ($35-45). Personally I can't
stand the ones with the black/white bead on them. I believe CIP1 doesn't
even guarantee the bead color will match L to R.

The Hagus mirrors are good, but after a few years the translucent bead
around the mirror tends to get brittle and let the lens go.  I put the
mirrors in the backings with industrial double stick foam tape and then
filled in the gap around the lens with hot-melt glue, leaving a drain gap
at the bottom of the lens.
