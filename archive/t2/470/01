Subject: Yeah! I found it! was Re: ...still won't idle cold

After Gumouting the aux air valve with no improvement and checking all
the hoses I was at a loss.

I found my volt/ohm meter and checked things today....

aux air valve was in spec.
AFM was in spec.

only other thing I could check was temperature sensor...

spec is 2500 ohms at 20 degrees C.

It was around there today....about 68 F

On checking it I found its resistance was 1150 ohms....way off....even
if the temperature isn't exactly right it was way off.

To test further I left the temperature sensor disconnected and started
the engine.  Started and idled okay with rpms slowly rising....I left
it go a while and shut it off.

With the sensor disconnected the resistance was infinite so that was
the other side of the spec.  I guess the computer figured it needed
more fuel with more resistance...in any case, it seems to be the temp.
sensor.
