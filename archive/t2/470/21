Subject: 79 Bus Rear End Noise - 2nd Post

Hi Folks,

I posted this message over the weekend, but didn't get any responses.  
Hopefully this one will generate more helpful advice.

Here's the deal:  My 1979 Westy has been making a noise at the driver's side 
rear wheel.  Over flat ground it goes rumble-rumble-squeak-squeak, but over 
bumps it makes a clunk each time the wheel hits something.  I have replaced 
the wheel bearings and both CVs on that side, and have no play in the wheel 
when I jack it up and wiggle it.  I checked the suspension components, and 
they are all tight.  In addition, I checked the transmission mounting 
points, and they are all tight as well.

Bentley does not offer much troubleshooting tips about this noise, and Muir 
does not help much either.  Does The List have any advice?

Thanks in advance for any help or suggestions.

Regards,
