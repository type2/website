Subject: removed heater boxes

So I removed my muffler and my neighbor is going to try to weld it.
While I was at it I figured I would remove my heater boxes and clean off 
some of the rust.
The muffler removed fine. I broke one of the studs when I removed the heater 
boxes from the engine though. How should I go about removing and replacing 
this stud. I was thinking liquid wrench and a pair of vice grips.
Any suggestions on how to inexpensively remove all the rust and keep it from 
returning?
Thanks,
Kyle
