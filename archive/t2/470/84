The inlet can be identified a number of ways. As you look at it when it's
mounted to the motor, the inlet is closest to the flywheel on the top side.
To double check, the inlet should have a small arrow cast into the body, and
is usually a larger diameter than the outlet. If the pump is off, pushing
the operating lever should suck on the inlet, and releasing will pump out
the outlet, you can feel this if you put your finger over each.
A further check is there is a brass cap there also, this is a small filter
on the inlet. Pull this out (a good idea to check anyway) and blow through
the inlet, it will be open to where the brass cap was.
The small fitting behind the diaphragm (pointing down when mounted) is just
a breather, make sure it's OPEN. If there is a small brass stem on it, you
can fit a short piece of vacuum hose to it and have it rest just inside the
lower tinware. If the tinware is original there will be a small hole to push
it into.
