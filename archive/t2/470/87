This is one of the few places where I like the aftermarket chromie
stuff better than OEM. The "dress up" part picks up more of the threads on
the shaft and has a bigger "acorn" nut to get your wrench on.  The stock
nut always seemed a bit thin and wobbly to me considering the relatively
high torque to which it was subjected.  Consider this while shopping.
