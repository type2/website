Subject: Cylinder Head Washer source

Hi All:

Anyone know where I can find a source for the cylinder head washers on a
type IV 2.0L. Mine are too rusted for me to use. The part number is N
900-855-02. I have tried Bus Depot but they cannot get these.

Will any 10 mm washer of the appropriate thickness work (3.5mm I think),
or are these harder steel?

Regards,
