Subject: Temp sensor spacer

Ever wondered what item #14 is in the parts fiche?

Item #41 is the temp sensor II for the FI system but I didn't know what the
other item was until recently because ETKA always listed it as NLA.

As it turns out, it's a spacer that goes between the temp sensor and the
cylinder head...

...and I came across mention of it in the Type II fuel systems service
manual from VW that was referenced on the list last month by Terry K. The
manual is very good BTW.

It shows the spacer and states:

"A temperature spacer 022 133 079 is available for cars which run well on
initial start-up and when fully warm, but have performance problems only
during warm-up. This spacer does not affect the resistance values when the
engine is cold or when it is fully warm, but it does delay the change in
resistance during warm-up, The spacer temporarily insulates the temperature
sensor housing from the heat of the cylinder head".

It took me ages to get my hands on one but my dealer actually located one at
another dealer that had one on stock.

So why care? Well, I have the problem described in the service manual: the
bus runs better than ever when warm, vacuum is good and it starts
effortlessly but it seems that after the aux. air regulator closes the idle
speed drops quite low and slowly recovers.

I put the spacer on and it makes a difference but doesn't fully correct the
problem. Instead there is a much longer delay before the idle speed drops
and the engine doesn't run as rough during warm-up which is good.

I've checked over the components looking for this gremlin but this is as
close as I've got to fixing the warm up enrichment problem. It's not a big
deal but it would be nice to fix it. I'm tempted to re adjust the valves for
the hell of it even though they are hydraulic and I performed the adjustment
only 8,000 miles ago when I put in new genuine adjustment screws.
