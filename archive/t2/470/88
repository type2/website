Dr. Tim makes some good points.

In terms of bolt-up it does work. The m10 x 1.0 threaded hole for the
cylinder head temp sensor (FI) is in a different place on the 1.8 head and
you must machine a new hole for it, that is the only assembly issue to deal
with. The more important issues are tuning ones. The larger valves on the
1.8 heads will alter the engine's state of tune and one would have to make
adjustments elsewhere to compensate. The compression ratio will definitely
be altered from stock, as the 1.8 head has a different shape and size of
chamber than the 2.0 head. All of these issues are well within the scope of
a technically minded engine builder, but stock may be easier and better for
people with less experience and technical know-how.
