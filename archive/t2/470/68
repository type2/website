I'll usually take out the #1 spark plug and stick the eraser end of a pencil 
down in the hole to verify #1 is all the way up. I do remove the valve cover 
and usually watch both valves to see whaen they are both shut. Sometimes I'll 
rock the engine back and forth a little to make sure that I'm seeing what I 
think I'm seeing as far as the valves go. 

I did get the Bus cranked up one time since all this began and it ran like 
crap, wouldn't stay cranked without a little coaxing and backfired like a 
240G at a cyclic rate.
