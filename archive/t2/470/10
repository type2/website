Subject: torque

Hi list,

I need your help! I have something but I don't know exactly what I have.
It's a 72 loaf/Westy with loose heads
In the OM it says 1679cc, 90mm bore, 66mm stroke, two downdraft carbs. Maybe
the gaskets are gone (over heat?) or some of the bolts are broken. Anyhow,
to repair this I need to know the torque for the bolts/nuts.

Thanks for any input

KARL
