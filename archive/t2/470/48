Subject: name that engine

Well,

I spent most of the weekend under the bus and emerged more confused 
than enlightened.  I was in the process of chasing down exhaust leaks 
and was not very successful.  The PO said that the bus (a 76 
Adventurewagen) has a 79 engine.  It is a 2 liter engine so that jives 
but it has the 75-78 exhaust on it so, what does that mean? The car was 
from California so I am assuming the exhaust system is a sacrifice to 
the gods of smog.

My problem is that it is getting cold and I want to have the bus be 
quiet and somewhat warm in the coming months.  I am willing to replace 
the existing heater boxes with 79's and replace the rest of the exhaust 
as well but I have to figure out what I have.  Is there any way to tell 
what the heads are without pulling the exhaust off or do I have to pull 
it apart to check the ports?  Would the oval port manifolds fit (even 
badly) on the square port heads?

All help is appreciated,

Thanks,

Dave Williams
