VW doesn't really explain what to do about the channels. Grease is a good
idea, lithium grease is a little too liquid and will come out and make a
mess. Oil is a mistake.

VW says to put two drops of motor oil in the oiling holes of the hinge
regularly. The hinge in under a lot of spring tension and when you depress
the handle the door should pop out and start sliding on it's own (especially
if you are on a slight decline, or have a sagging rear suspension).
