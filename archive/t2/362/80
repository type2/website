Is that data correct? Just curious about what seems, at first glance, to not 
make sense.

Bridgestone: 195 diameter is .1" smaller than the 185, and is +14 revs/mile.

Yoko: 195 diameter is .1" larger, and is only 1 rev/mile different.

The Yoko 195 is LARGER? And while a .1" change produces 14 rev/mile 
difference in the Bridgestone, it only yields 1 rev/mile diffrence in the 
Yoko?


If there are more variables that need to be taken into account, that's fine.

Bridgestone 603v
185/14  25.7" dia  811 rev/mile
195/75 14 25.6" dia 825 rev/mile

But
Yoko 356
185/14  25.7" dia   808 rev/mile (C)  809 (D)
195/75 14 25.8" dia 808 rev/mile
