Subject: Ignition OFF=Lights ON??

I am working on a 72 deluxe that has been sitting in a
barn yard for about 3 years. A strange thing is that
the headlights will only come ON when the ignition
switch is turned to the OFF position, obviously it
should be exactly the opposite, the lights should come
on only when the ignition switch is on. So, is
something wired backwards? Is it likely a headlight
switch problem, an ignition switch problem, or bad wiring??
