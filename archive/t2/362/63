Subject: stripped bolt....

OK...so I was finally able to get my 2.0 liter air-cooled engine dropped solo
(only after snapping the ground bolt off my starter trying to loosen it as
well as cracking the plastic release bearing guide sleeve in the bell housing
of the tranny) but now I have one last bolt to get the exhaust system off and
its stripped. Any advice on how to get this bolt off? Vice grips will not fit
in the space and neither will my dremel to cut it. It seems that almost every
component has at least 2 or more different size bolts/screws so someone has
tinkered here before. Thanks in advance.
