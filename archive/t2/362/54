The tire technology has changed.  The "common knowledge" is that you don't
reverse the rotation of radial tires.  With bias ply tires it wasn't a
problem, but with radials reversing the rotation could result in throwing
a belt or the tread.  I don't know if this applies with really modern
radials, but I see enough "road alligators" out there to believe that it
makes a difference.

Now, if you _really_ want to swap a tire from the right side of the car to
the left side you can do it.  All you have to do is flip the tire around
on the rim so it rotates the same direction.  I used to do this on an old
P*ntiac that always wore out the outside edges of its tires no matter how
it was aligned.  I'd wear the outside edge halfway, flip the tires around
and swap sides, and get reasonably even wear out of the set.

I like the idea of keeping the spare out of the rotation.  I usually put
the best used tire in the spare slot.  Sometimes I'll get rock damage to
one of the "running" tires and the spare ends up taking over for it while
the new tire sits in the spare slot until the next tire change.  I usually
replace tires in pairs, putting the new tires on the front and moving the
fronts to the back.  I don't rotate them at all using this method.  It's
rare that all four tires will wear out at the same time.
