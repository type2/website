Ack.  That's how mine was.  The two little fingers on the concealed end of
the arm were broken off.  I had to replace the switch.  Not too difficult a
job, and not all that expensive.

I do have one question for the list, though.  When you re-install the
steering wheel, does the turn signal canceling tab go to the left or to the
right?  (I sort of forgot to notice when I had it apart, and can only find
one of the marks, the one in the center of the shaft.)
