Subject: 68 mirror stock

hey guys, i have a 68 rear view mirror stock only that
i picked up on accident at the junk yard last week. 
cost me 2$ so i'll let it go for that plus whatever
shipping is unless you want to swing by my hose in so
la county this weekend and pick it up.  it has some
pitting but is in good condition otherwise and with
some sanding and some silver paint woul dlook pretty
nice. it is missing the mirror but that is easy enough
to grab off any bus at the junk yard.  anyway, write
me and tell me if you want it.
