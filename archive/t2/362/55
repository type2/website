Take any steel instrument with a sharp square edge (medium screwdriver is
fine) and remove the burr on the outer side of the snap ring groove.  Then
the pistion pin will slide out easily.

You can make a very satisfactory and gentle extractor from a piece of
1/4 inch all-thread, an 11mm socket, a piece of PVC pipe slightly larger
and longer than the piston pin, a fender washer, and a couple of nuts.

Put a nut on the all-thread.  Run the socket on the all-thread from the
long end and seat it on the nut,  run the all-thread through the piston
pin, through the PVC pipe, and through the fender washer.  Add a nut,
center the whole thing up, and start tightening the nut by the fender
washer.  The socket will push the pin into the PVC pipe.
