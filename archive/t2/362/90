Subject: Re: [T2] Tire size

How, exactly, do two circles of the same diameter turn a different number of
revolutions over a fixed difference?!?

A 2.57" diameter implies a 25.7 x pi " circumference, which means the center
of the circle will travel 25.7 x pi " every revolution!

Actually - in reality I bet given the rigidity of the tire, the bottom of the
tire spreads different... So your tire pressure could actually change your
revs per mile...
