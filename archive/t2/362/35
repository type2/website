Subject: FS:  Vanagon engines, tires, tranny, interior parts

I posted a parts list to sell recently, but nobody was into picking up 
everything at once.  My laptop then died leaving me without emails from 
people requesting certain parts, so if we were negotiating, please email me 
again.

These items are going on eBay for 3-day auction.  Starting prices super low. 
  Remember to cut and paste both parts of the eBay URL, or just use the item 
# at the end of the URL.  Thanks!

Sean
