Subject: Pistons pins removal, Any trick!

Hi guys,
Well, as expected (same on my other engine) all pistons pins are 
somewhat stuck, they turn freely in the piston and in the rod bushing 
but they won't come out easily pass the C-Ring. The one my my other 
engine were a pain in the but to remove, i had to bang those one very 
hard, i don't want to do the same with the one in my working engine.

I have a few puller and extractor but nothing soft enough so i don't 
damage the piston!

Any trick, or you just bang those one until they come out (NOT).

I can leave the pistons there, it's not a big problem as i am not 
changing those but still, i would have like to check them up close 
before puting the heads back.

I did measure them in place (Ring, pistons and cylinder are well in the 
wear limit, they even look nice).
Overall this engine doesn't look very old, but a dum PO never adjusted 
the valve. my head are being rebuild as we speak, new seats, valves, 
guide, spring and studs.
Crankshaft/rods side play is.35mm, camshaft looks very nice too, no 
pitting on the lobe.

Any trick or tool for removing the pin would be appreciated.

Cheers, Ben
