Subject: RE: no brake lights

My bus has ten fuses, 4pin E-flasher, wires matching the 69-70 diagram except 
the master cylinder and horn harness (that looks more like a 72), all the 
switches from the 69-70, 4 pin high/low relay, NO door buzzer or switches, NO 
rear side marker lights, NO in line fuse (S1) for the back up lights (looks 
like factory wiring). 
Tinkering last night still trying to get the brake lights to work and had one 
wire left that was not connected to anything, it was the solid green wire that 
runs from pin 15 on the E-flasher switch to the fuse box. This wire in question 
originally had one of those VW style butt connectors (looks like T? on one of 
the diagrams with the long male end). Took the long male end off and put a 
female on and ran it to the same fuse that had the black wire on it (goes to 
instrument panel) that was hooked to in the diagram. Brake lights came on and 
stayed on.
