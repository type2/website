I don't know I find mine to be quite tossible finding it easy to swing the 
rear end wide on slick surfaces easily. On dry pavement I reach BIG lean 
angles before either end breaks loose. Maybe I don't dry as hard as you 
do... <grin>

The factories (I'm told) lean towards understeer to satisfy their 
non-technical driving customers who apparently find over steering more 
scary than sliding straight forward. I like neutral handling myself.
