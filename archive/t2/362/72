Hello List:

I am getting ready to order tires. I have settled on the Yokohama Y356. I 
am trying to decide which size to order. My choices are 185/0R14 D (max 
load 1850) or 195/75/14 (Max load 1710). My instinct is to go with the 
stock size and higher load rating. Is the stock size the best choice. Any 
reason to go with the larger size? Your help is always appreciated. 
Thanks,

James



I just installed the Yoko's replacing larger 195 Michelins. I also did an alignment at the same time. My experience so far is the bus rides and drives smoother and is quieter. It was engineered for the 185 tires.
