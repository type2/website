Subject: Re: [T2] Sway bars

Richard, I ran the 7/8" front and rear sway bars for a couple of months. 
Wound up getting rid of the rear, keeping the front. The rear bar did not 
seem to make a diff. on my '78 Westy, and for my uses, the reduced ground 
clearance was not worth the seemingly insignificant handling improvements 
provided by the rear bar. (For what its worth, I traded the rear bar to Greg 
Potts for a Hurst shifter a couple of EveryBusses ago). But the 7/8" front 
bar is the cats ass. Very big improvement over the stock bar. I'm also 
running BFG 27X8.5X14 A/T ko's, and KYB gas up front. The rear are air 
shocks, and my front suspension is in showroom new condition. Get the front 
bar. You won't regret it.

PS Nice letter to the VW Rag. Their reply was a complete Waffle Job, if I've 
ever seen one!
