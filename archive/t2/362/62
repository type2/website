Sigh.
There is nothing on a typeIV that requires banging - please don't do it.

Use a large (12-inch or longer) C-clamp with a piece of wood and an appropriately-sized deep socket to press out the pin.  The piece of wood is for the end of the clamp that sits on the piston, so as to not scratch it and also provide grip.
