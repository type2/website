"You don't have to take anything off to change the sparkplugs. Remove the 
wires and use a sparkplug socket on an extension and a handle. 20 minutes 
when you've done it before. Several hours the first time.
 
Do this when the engine is cold. Make sure that your spark plug socket has 
a rubber insert in the socket to hold the sparkplug in it as you remove the 
socket from the hole. Try a new plug in the socket before you get started."



Clara Williams (barndoor Clara) taught me a great time saver for spark plug
changing on the type IV:

Go to the Flaps, and get a piece of rubber fuel line big enough to fit
snugly over the ceramic part of the spark plug. the you use the fuel line
to get each plug started. It alllows you to feel the thread and aply torque
at the angle required. Dont over torque them with the wrench either.

In addition:

I always used a 3/8" ratchet wrench with a 3" and a 6" extension to get the
plugs in and out. That way you can use different combinations for each
plug, as they all have different levels of stuff above them. If your lucky
enough to have the overhead access panel, be happy as my '72 left me
wishing that my arms had a spare set of elbows to get the #1 and #3 plugs
out. (my new bus has the hatch...yeehaw!)

One of the most common FLAPS mistakes was giving me the wrong spark plug
(type I plug) so dont forget to compare the old and new unless you get them
from a VW-minded establishemnt.
