Can the list verify this: the brake switches are fed 12 volts, if one or 
the other switch closes 12 volts are passed to the rear of the bus through 
the bulbs and then to ground?

If this is correct - just look for 12 volts at each point. Work front to back.

B.S. if you open it up, bleed it completely. Your life and my life (I share 
the road with you) are on the line. You die and the store isn't going to 
feel any pain.
