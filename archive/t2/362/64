So here is the scenario--

The head of a buried bolt is stripped--
You can't get to it with a vice grips, or a cut off tool--so this means
you can't get to it with a drill either --right?

And if you can't get to it with a drill, this means you can't get to it
with a torch, so I would have to say--your doomed.

How about an angle die grinder, with a cut off disc?

Why don't you try and force an American socket on it after you heat it
up cherry red, so it will work loose ??

This is really tough to imagine--a bolt that is totally inaccessible-

OK...so I was finally able to get my 2.0 liter air-cooled engine dropped
solo (only after snapping the ground bolt off my starter trying to
loosen it as well as cracking the plastic release bearing guide sleeve
in the bell housing of the tranny) but now I have one last bolt to get
the exhaust system off and its stripped. Any advice on how to get this
bolt off? Vice grips will not fit in the space and neither will my
dremel to cut it. It seems that almost every component has at least 2 or
more different size bolts/screws so someone has tinkered here before.
Thanks in advance.
