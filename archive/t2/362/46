Subject: Sway bars

Does anyone have experience with sway bars? There's only one up front and I
measured it to be 11/16" bar.

EMPI makes both front and rear sway bars. They are HD size, 7/8" and about
$95 each. Bugpack sells them only as a pair for (choke) $280 but I hear the
hardware kit requires no drilling and is superb.

My question is can you upgrade to the rear 7/8" bar only and use it with the
stock front 11/16" bar or will this upset the handling? Right now the front
seems fine, but it's the rear that's flopping the bus over on turns.
