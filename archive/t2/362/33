Eron,

If it was the original, it should work "ok"...make sure the fins a 
straight and *clean*.  Fin combs at the hardware store(I think).

Make sure the fans work well and the a/c(even in a bus) should be ok.

Used to work for VPC where we made them....I think my condensors in 
mine(78) are larger than 3x3 though.  I really haven't looked yet.

My buddy that was the engineer on the VW bus a/c projects was just up
a couple of weeks ago and said he would get me a sanden compressor from
his supplier as a "sample".<thank god for college buddies!>

Cheers, dave
