Specifically, the radius of the circle that is being rotated is the distance
from the center of your hub to the ground, straight down. This distance varies
based on the tire size, amount of air in the tire, and rigidity of the walls
of the tire. So, if you have a flat tire, the radius will be very close to the
radius of your wheel - regardless of your tire size!

One can assume that the 'revs per mile' is calculated at the recommended tire
pressure and at a specified temperature (remember, gases change volume based
on temperature).
