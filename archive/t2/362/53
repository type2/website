Subject: Re: Dumb Guy Needs Help

I crawled under after work and it's the exposed part of one of the studs
that's stripped, so I think I'll try to get a vice grip on it and replace the
stud, just one more dumb question ( just one??). How do I tighten the new stud
without screwing up the threads?? Thanks
