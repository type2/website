Subject: Re: [T2] heat exchanger to cooling shroud cover on g 1.7 

From: <stonemanvt(-at-)adelphia.net>

Thers are two covers (caps) that go over were the heat exchanger and the
cooling shroud meet ( they are just to semi-seal the two) and there are
flaps(non air return flaps) underneath. Are these crucial. I am finishing a
rebuild and am missing one cover and both flaps. Any advise would be great.

Nope, VW wasted a ton of money designing them, making them, and installing them. You don't need the tin, the 
seals, the thermostat or any of that crap.

Now think about what I wrote.......

YES, you need them. Well, the channel covers anyway.

If you look at the position of those flaps, they close when the engine is not running. Just like the flaps in 
the heater fan above the engine. The heater fan flaps in the blower unit open only when the fan is on. When 
the electric fan is off and the engine is running, the air put out by the engine fan blows into the heater 
boxes thru the channels and out the flapper valves whether they are open or closed. That air will also go up 
the two heater tubes to the electric fan and stop because of the flaps.

Now the 2 flaps in the base of the fan housing are a different story. The only time they would need to be 
closed is when you have the engine off, key on, and the electric fan running. This way the air flow would not 
escape out the big hole in the fan housing. But why in your right mind would anyone DO this?!? On the early 
bays, the engine has to be running with alternator output to close the electric fan relay. 76? and up just 
needed the key on.

I have not figured out the reason or value of the lower flaps......

But I have channel covers if need them. Left and right are different.
