I did not mis-read what you wrote, nor imply that you said something you
didn't.  I merely made a statement and shared some information.  You said
that there was a risk, and I said that experience has shown that the
risk was negligible.

You are a valued member of the list and I hate to see you go.  However, in
the present situation I think you are being a bit oversensitive.
