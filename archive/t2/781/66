John, from my brief look at the seat brackets on the '72, I imagine it is 
not that simple.  The driver side z-bed bracket is connected to the driver 
side wheel well with some different bracket arrangement that the other side. 
  Same for the passenger side bracket on my '78,  It is not an even side to 
side swap.
