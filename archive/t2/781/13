Subject: Re: [T2] New axles too long?

You may be right about the auto tranny shaft idea. I checked and there are 
no ridges on the axle. I believe these are new axles, not rebuilt. I think 
the axle shafts are manufactured by the company that sells them to Bus 
Depot. The box that they came in has no manufactures label, the CV joints 
are EMPI. I hope the last.

I Emailed Ron and he responded promptly. Does that guy ever rest? He says he 
will get me the right axles before next week end. This is why I buy most all 
my parts from Bus Depot. The few times I have had problems with parts, Ron 
has always made it right, ASAP.
