Subject: Re: [T2] How difficult is welding ?

Someone must have taught themselves, how tough was
it ?

Bought myself a mig welder years ago when I bought my first Westy (around
1998, I think) and took an evening adult ed class in welding-only $90.00 for
the class, money well spent. I used my welder in the class (thought it was
defective at first, then the instructor used it to show me it DID in fact
work!). I used it  just a few weeks ago to build a utility trailer. It's not
all that hard, but welding  body sheet metal is tricky, since it's so thin.
