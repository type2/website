Subject: Re: [T2] Wax

Mine was an Eagle brand wax at NAPA. Just something on special Saturday. I have used Zymol and it was beautiful but it did not last. Have used Mother's paste and it was beautiful but it did not last either. FWIW my daily drivers are outside 365 days a year here in TN. It maybe that nothing is going to last 6 months. I try to wax them every 3-4 months but life or procrastination often gets in the way. 

Yeah, the Westy is not going to be fun to wax. I have done it many times but it requires real conviction and devotion! <grin!>
