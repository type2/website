Subject: non-standard repairs to my dying muffler

Volks,

As I posted last week, my one-piece replacement muffler for my bus ('76-78
exhaust system) is dying.  The specific cause is that the nipple for the
EGR rusted off.

I have ordered a replacement from Ron.  I had posted last week that a look
at the Bus Depot site had not turned up one of these but on looking again,
I *did* find one and (for a wonder) it is US made.  I ordered one of these
both because I don't trust the EMPI/Bug Pack that others are selling and
because I actually want to see a piece of formed steel that was "Made In
USA"...  it's been a while :-)

While I am awaiting the replacement (and letting the Kroil soak in :) I
decided to do a bit of emergency repair just to allow runs to the store
without killing the engine or getting a ticket.  When the EGR tube breaks
off there are two issues.  First and most obvious is the noise.  Keep in
mind that a 7/16"x3/4" bolt taps right into the hole in the muffler.
Quiets everything right down for a week or two.

SECOND, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY: When the EGR tube breaks off, it HAS to be
sealed up before you drive the bus!  It is *supposed* to be carrying
de-oxygenated exhaust gas back into the intake.  When it breaks off, it is
carrying regular air up there AFTER the AFM...  This is what we call A BIG
BLOODY VACUUM LEAK!!!!  and it will kill your engine!  but it's subtle,
since the EGR valve up top is closed at idle it will not prevent the bus
from idling, as a normal vacuum leak this big would.  Anyhow, take my
word, that tube has to be sealed either by inserting a paper gasket or a
piece of tin can or by bending the broken tube over or *something* but do
not ignore this end of the exhaust leak.
