Phil,

I am a professional outdoor sculptor. Not small art-fair trinkets, but big
steel and aluminum dangerous-if-done-incorrectly stuff. The only way I got
to be a success was to swallow any inhibitions and went back to school to
learn HOW to fabricate.

You can't teach yourself safe, structural automotive welding. Oddly on this
and every self-help forum most people recommend "do-it-yourself". This is
one area where I recommend you don't do it yourself without a measured
amount of preparation and investment.

Anyone can buy a hobby welder and "weld". But there are so many different
facets of welding that it is not worth endangering your safety and the
safety of your passengers and other drivers by making a mistake.

Putting in a patch panel and then smearing it with plastic body filler is a
job a monkey can do. Welding in a pre-fabricated replacement panel to
factory safety specifications is totally different.

My advice: Go to your local equivalent of a Community College (You may
substitute a trained, careful certified welder here) and enroll in an
evening welding and fabrication class. Take careful notes and Practice under
the watchful eye of your professor. Use their facilities to perfect your
technique and then tackle your issue at hand.

Also, don't skimp on your welder if you purchase one. There is a MASSIVE
difference in quality between models. Ask your professor, he/she will guide
you in the correct direction.

You will find that fabrication is one of the most gratifying feelings you
will have when you do something that is "perfect" because by that point you
will know the difference!

Good Luck!

Jon
