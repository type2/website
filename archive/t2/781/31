Subject: Re: [T2] New axles too long?

I have a manual trans. I think the axles I received are for a Vanagon, per 
the dimensions that Karl posted. Ron at Bus Depot responded promptly last 
night indicating they would quickly rectify the problem of the wrong axles 
being shipped. The boxes the axles were shipped in had no part number from 
the manufacture so I understand how the error happened. Did you get your 
axles from BD? do you recall if the boxes had part numbers on them?
