Chris,

This stuff is *the* *hots*

http://www.zainostore.com/

Buy the right kind for regular or clearcoat.  Learned about it from a guy 
here at work.  Tried it out.

It does *not* make the rubber seals or black plastic turn white!

It is incredibly easy to get off.  It makes water fall off the car better
than rain-x.  I used it on one panel on the 78 after it was painted and it 
made water come off faster than brand new clearcoated paint.  Some folks 
claim that after they use it, they just use a leaf blower to dry their 
car....might be a real plus in a bus!

You do have to get used to using so little of it when you put it on as it 
is hard to see going on.

You can use it in the direct sun light.

It makes my eyes funny after I have used it and try to look at the 
car...it's like I can't focus on the surface, only the reflection in the 
surface!

I quit using nu-finish as it was(at one time) #1 on the consumer reports 
list.  Otherwise, for "orginal" bus paint, anything with lots of *real*
carnuba wax...it will only last a few months if driven on a daily basis.

Cheers, dave

 Waxed our cars this weekend with a liquid and thought 
it worked well but am curious if it will hold up like 
the paste waxes I have used in the past.
