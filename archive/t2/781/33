What brands are you folks using? Paste or liquid? 

Waxed our cars this weekend with a liquid and thought it worked well but am curious if it will hold up like the paste waxes I have used in the past. 

Both cars (daily drivers and outside year round) were sorely overdue... I try to do a wax every 3 months but it's been considerably longer this time.
