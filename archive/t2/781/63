Subject: Re: [T2] How difficult is welding ?

Lincoln SP-175+ is a good starter welder... I learned to weld in a week on a BIG NICE Miller MIG but it took longer than that to learn to weld on thin sheetmetal like found in a car body. Takes some experience to know things spread the heat around to keep from warping the panel... 

Self-taught with some proper study is a GREAT way to learn. Better yet would be if you could get an experienced welder to look over your shoulder for a few hours and give you some pointers. Definitely a good machine pays off. Make sure you get the right wire diameter for the job. I wasted alot of time and scrap trying to weld with flux-core wire. Great for repairs to my utility trailer, not so good for body panels. Requires too much heat to properly flow. Makes lots of holes. PRACTICE, practice, on something other than your car. Get a bad door and practice on it. Cut a section out and weld it back in... 

You can do it with an oxy-actelyene torch but that is an art... My father prefers it and can do it well. I prefer a MIG because I make fewer mistakes. 

I also recommend joining an internet forum for welding or for bodywork - I used to belong to one - as they can give advice on the go just like Type2. The one I belonged to had some very good Hot Rod guys on it.
