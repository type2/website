Subject: Re: [T2] Battery good, radio plays, lights come on, motor won't

I've been going through this for years. Just solved it. Take the push on 
terminal
from the ignition switch off the starter, put a voltmeter on it. Get someone
to turn the key up front to start. Read how many volts are coming to that
terminal. If it is less than 12 (mine was 6.3 volts) then run a new 12 or 10
gauge wire right from the ignition switch back to the starter motor. My bus
starts beautifully now, first time in years. It wasn't my starter motor at 
all. I bought a rebuilt one for nothing.

 Tonight, while running out for Chinese it would not.

 Radio works. Lights work. Interior electrics work. Battery is good.

 When I turn the key to turn the motor over, the generator light dims
 slightly, and that is all. No sounds of a starter turing over or
 anything.

 Thoughts? I perused the archives, but didn't find what I needed.

 Starter issue???
