Subject: Re: [T2] beetle muffler on bus

my 2 cents: I gave my girlfriend CO poisoning once from riding in the 
back when I had a beetle muffler and a bad rear hatch seal (for about a 
year I drove that way).  it could have been worse, but it is not healthy 
regardless.  would I use a beetle muffler in a pinch now that I replaced 
the seal? probably.  but someone makes an outlet tube that fits in the 2 
holes and directs the exhaust to the side--this is probably a retrofit 
worth finding.
