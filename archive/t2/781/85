Subject: 70A Alternator parts

These 70A alternators sure are a pain in the butt. They cost too  
much, the core fee is outrageous and the parts are hard to find. I'm  
going to try to source them through the local alternator rebuilders  
because I can't find any online.

Anyone know a source for any of these parts? I checked the archives  
and there was very little info.

* Cooling boot

The cooling boot is NLA and I found a NOS one through Porsche. Just  
thought I'd mention this one.

* Brush holder

This part is going brittle and the connectors are hard to clean in  
this configuration. I might have to take the q-tip with acid to them.

* Weatherproof plug

Unlike the 55A plug which is behind the rear cover plate, the 70A  
version is a weather proof style because it's on the outside. There  
are no markings on it and the terminals inside are extremely rusty.  
If I have to I'll cut it open and replace the terminals but I'd  
rather find a replacement if anyone has seen one around.

* Battery cable plug

This is the cap for the battery cable on the alternator. It's gone  
hard and cracked when I removed it 18 months ago.

* Pulley with fan

My pulley has a wobble and the I think the jumpy belt is contributing  
to the bearing wear. I'm pretty careful not to put the belt on too  
tight. Does anyone know if the Vanagon fan and pulley which are  
separate items will fit the baywindow alternator?
