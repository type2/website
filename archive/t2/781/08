Subject: New axles too long?

Been trying to get my 75 back on the road again so I can meet some of you list
members at the Jerome weekend. Spent last weekend installing new brake hoses
and front wheel bearings. That went well. This weekend I removed my rear axles
in order to install some new ones complete with installed cv joints and boots.
I thought this would make things easier. Well, not quite the case. Turns out
the new axles are over 20" long. Wonder what they could be for? I suspect they
were drop shipped from the manufacturer, not shipped from the folks I ordered
them from.

I'll keep you all updated as to the outcome. I have Emailed the supplier and
am most anxious to get this resolved. Has anyone had this problem before?
