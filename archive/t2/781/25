Hi Michael.

Missing covers are crucial because vital cooling air escapes there.
You can temporarily use duct tape to wrap around the joint. Use some
aluminum tape first to get the duct tape to last longer. Better yet,
get the tin snips and make your own. There is originally a gasket
there to seal it. Can use hi temp RTV if you'd rather.

The flap is less critical. It maintains heater blower pressure at idle
by preventing heater blower air from blowing back into the fan shroud.

 rebuild and am missing one cover and both flaps. Any advise would be great.
