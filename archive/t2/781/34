Dan,

Either the solenoid on the starter hung "on" or your ignition switch did.

Running a starter for two minutes or so will make things very hot as it is 
a pulls *big* amps.

Probably the best thing was that the engine did *not* start with the 
starter hung on.

I liked the part about "dilemma ensued"....for me it would have 
been...mouth drops open and have a semi freak out making fast decisions 
about what to do first....

Hmmmm....not sure why the alternator wires would have melted tho...

Mechanic doesn't have the right equipment?????!!

Drop the engine, pull pressure plate off and inspect?

All it takes is a jack(or atv type lift) for the engine and a 13 or 14 mm 
socket to pull the pressure plate off.

See one here that I used:   http://www.shockwaverider.com/newengine/

You didn't mention that it runs and shifts ok after the parts 
replacement...I am guessing no?...since you want to pull engine to inspect 
the clutch?

If it drives and shifts ok, then the clutch is probably ok.

The only other thing that might have happened is that the relay 
pints going to the starter got so hot they welded closed....but if you 
replaced parts and it starts and shifts well, then you are probably ok.

Lesson to be remembered....never start in any gear....that way you can 
release clutch and go get battery unhooked quickly!...But I bet you 
already figured that one out!


Cheers, dave

 Ran around to rear and popped open the engine compartment.
 A fair amount of smoke but this was smoke from melting
 wire.  Got battery out and disconnected, but burned my
 hands on ground strap.  Had it towed and, ultimately,
 have new starter/solenoid, new ground strap, and new
 wires to alternator which had melted.  This bus does
 have the aftermarket relay that shunts power to starter
 without the round trip to the front end/key.
 
 Looking for root cause, my mentor/mechanic recommends
 pulling engine to see if clutch is somehow in bad shape.
 Says he no longer has requisite equipment for some part
 of that operation, leaving me to seek another mechanic
