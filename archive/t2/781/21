OTOH, thousands of folks have used beetle mufflers with no apparent
mortality.  I used to run one with an "iffy" rear hatch seal and my CO
detector card didn't detect any excess CO.

In fact, the only time I smell exhaust is when reversing with the heater
on, and this only happened with the correct bus muffler!

The best advice is always to run the correct "bus" part, but if you happen
to have a beetle muffler around it will serve well.  You could even get
creative and have a muffler shop fabricate two "bus style" exhaust tubes
for it.  You could pass it off as a 1-year-only South African dual
exhaust!  :)
