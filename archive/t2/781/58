Subject: How difficult is welding ?

I have need to replace the heater channel, half a floorpan and front 
bulkhead on my beetle. I see early signs of replacement needed on the rear 
valance of my Type 2. I've just had a bit of chassis welding done and I 
think I'm sorted to for a while but you never know.

The bug is sitting in the workshop of my friendly mechanic, but he's not 
getting around to it - because he has so much work on. Mainly air cooled 
buses that the owners need to keep on the road for camping. Normally this 
would be a good thing since every time I go round to chase progress I see 
more buses :-)

But there is no progress. So I wonder about doing it myself. It would be 
cheaper to buy the gear and I'd have it forever. I could work in our 
garage - it would be tight but just about do-able. What scares me a bit is 
the welding.

Now I'm a pretty good modelmaker (www.pagenumberone.co.uk for photos) and 
like making things as a rule. So I'm not completely useless with my hands. I 
can borrow books on the subject (college course isn't an option at this 
point). A bit of me really fancies having a go.

How tough is it ? From reading old messages it looks like I would need a MIG 
welder with gas. An angle grinder to tidy up the welds. Some metal clamps to 
hold bits together. Safety gear (googles, gloves, fire extinguisher) and 
seam sealant.

Would the smart move be to get some old bits of car, hire the gear for a 
weekend and have a go ? Someone must have taught themselves, how tough was 
it ?

Thanks
