Subject: Re: [T2] having a nice looking extendable thermostat is not 

Hi John ,

Excuse my French John !  ;-)  I was not very explicit. My problem is that 
despite the fact the my thermostat looks very nice and expand very well 
when hot in boiling water. Once installed in the engine, It is not strong 
enough to pull the flaps shut while cooling , the flaps string (which 
maintain the flaps open) is too strong compare to the capacity of the 
thermostat to pull the flaps shut. So my question is : Do I need to 
change my thermostat ?

Thanks

Chris
