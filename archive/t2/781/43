Subject: Re: [T2] High oil temps

Darren,

1'st culprit...is the oil temp gauge **really** **really** right?
     Does it read 212 or so in a pan of boiling water?

2'nd culprit bad thermostat, blocked oil cooler(air or oil), air flaps 
	not really letting air to the right places?

3'rd and more...out of tune, timing too retarded or advanced..advance
	on distributor not working, no engine seal, recycling hot exhaust 
	for cooling?.....The list goes on...

Cheers, dave
