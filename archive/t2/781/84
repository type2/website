Subject: How difficult is welding ?

Interesting subject you brought up.
After 50 years experience of welding with OX Acetylene, Mig, Tig, Arc,
Plasma I can safely say that anyone that isn't afraid of the fire in
Acetylene or the Arc in general welding can quickly learn to weld.
I'd suggest that you FIRST rent some minor wire feed welding machine from
your local Tool Rental and just get some nice clean 16 and 14 gauge clean
steel scraps and start practicing.
You can count on making lots of mistakes as first but within a few hours
you'll get comfortable with the process.
When working with rusty parts it's important to thoroughly clean (grind) the
parts for good welds.
Often you may need to Pop Rivet a backup plate to your joints that you can
grind off later if you just can't stand ugly work.
After you've rented the cheapest equipment you can rent better equipment as
your pre-fitting progresses and keep your rental costs down considerably by
having everything ready to weld in before you pick up the equipment.
Safety is important so wear gloves, your welding hood and cotton shirt and
cotton pants.
Weld in a safe area away from you lawn mower fuel supply and anything that
might smolder and flame later.
If you have welding near your fuel tank, make the extra effort and remove
the tank away from the work area.
Welding in your garage is very risky so try to avooid it.
Have fire extinguishers handy (big ones) and keep a water hose near by.
