It just cost me $28.50 to fill up my '97 VW Cabrio today.... Those micro-mini cars are looking appealing next to my gas guzzling (35 mpg) Cabrio... <grin!>

I've seen a Robin Reliant on the road in Italy and at the Lane Motor Museum in Nashville (http://www.lanemotormuseum.org/). No, I want a REAL car like the Fiat 500... <griN!> 

The $2.50/gallon gas is still better than the time it took $50 to fill up my '84 Rabbit 'vert in Rome in 1994... About $4.75 back then. $6+ now. Beware the free universal/socialized medicine programs. It is HUGE taxes on gasoline that pay for it in Italy. Nice idea, expensive to operate.

'78 Westy 2,7L - a full sized motorhome next to a Fiat 500 - the perfect car to tow along...
