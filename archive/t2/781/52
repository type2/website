$745 at Pelican Parts for the distributor... The reg cap was $70 each x2 implying the $745 distributor is required x2... Did not see any sign of the RSR cap... YOW!

<Ask your friend to price one of those Porsche RSR dual plug distributor caps: it will make him feel better.>

I think I'll stick to VWs and Fiats... A Fiat 500 is different, cool, retro... And would lose in a drag race against a Honda Passport 50cc scooter... The Fiat 500 I drove/owned would go 50 mph... A Beetle can still be driven on normal streets and go normal places and still fun to be seen in...
