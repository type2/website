Subject: Re: [T2]76 Shiftrod etc... restore from bus depot

thank you very much all in response..........
 
i went today and picked up the parts but got a couple other things as well...
i got part number 211711182(front bushing) and part number 211711179 also suggested by karl.....
 
he also sold me part number 211711185 B which says for a 62-67 but his book also said for my year 76 as well....
and then i got the rear coupler 311798211 whcih needs much attention once solving the shifter problem....?
 
taking the shifter apart i havent noticed anything out of the ordinary but will be crawling under tomorrow to inspect omn where exactly the front bushing and others goes hopefully...
 
if i overlooked it somewheres.. whcih ones or one of these bushings will i have to take the engine out to install?
 
thanks for all the help so far on this project... i wil take puics tomorrow and post them up .....or try to... if everything goes as planned.....
hopefully of my findings...?
 
ohh and karl....

to make sure i am understanding you correctly...? the shift coupling at the nose of transaxle...
the rear coupler right....? you weld it to the shift rod? does this elimate having to use the wire method tieing to screw? am i reading you right? just making sure before i go diging in...

I found that the replacement center shaft shuttle cock
bushings don't fit and are worthless. Probably nothing
wrong with yours.

Here is a post I made back in 2002 on replacing the
front bushing:
