Subject: [T2]Pleee for help please shiftrod 76 bus

ok i have had one or two replies  on my problem here and really really wished if someone that could help me here could please..?
not a requirement or anything but really could use some help on this one....
 
ok i took the stop plate i have that is cracked and broken and had it touch welded so that at least its one piece even though its a crappy weld....
 
i am going by the bentley here cause i have searched the type 2 archives and only came up with ratwells site which still doesnt help me answer my problem i am having,...
 
the bentley says that by the schematics on page 10 of the transmission and rear axle section suggest that there is a stop plate and a stop plate with lugs showing in the picture both of them...?? one is turned upside down above the spring??? and then the other which i have is under the spring and against the floor....?
first off i dont see how the spring can have one on top of it and think that this may be misleading me in the bentley...? the one on the top is actually the bracket with guide not a stop plate as stated in the bentley/.././../
 
also i have done the trick with putting it into second gear and sticking a screw driver against the plate while tightening....the lugs on the plate that holds it all together....
i can find third and fourth but barely and also reverse is nowheres in the picture still there is no reverse and only a 2nd when looking for reverse....? so am i putting screw driver in the wrong place before tightening????/
it does not say where to stick the screw ddriver just tp use one...
[quote] using the tip of the screwdriver, position the stop plate against the gearshift lever as shown in fig 3-18 then torque the M 8 bolts to 2.0 mkg(14ft lbs)
 
one more time can someone help me with this without thinking i have done this 1000 times before...?
 
again the bentley says there is a 9a stop plate with lugs and then it says there is a 9. which is stop plate....
 
so am i suppose to have both or am i being mislead by the heat and ???????????????
 
HELP Please i cant continue not to be able to get anywheres this is my daily driver and it seems i havent gotten any replies to this but one or two thanks karl.....and robert....
 
Not only that the part the stop plate is 1.76 part and i cant find anyone with one from a good neighborhood....?????????????????????
 
cost me 5 bucks to have this one welded this morn and it is not going to last long before it breaks in same spot again.... still confused about there being one or two stop plates??? i think there is only one but the bentley is saying differently in picture...
 
thanks to anyone that should happen to want ot give me a hand here with the knowledge of how to get this fixed....
 
time and time again i have been there for folks now please someone give me a hand here.... please????
 
 
this is got to be a simple thing and just a bad adjustment on the stop plate but how can i get it right.... third and fourth are sloppy and reverese isnt there at all? just second...
 
also why wheni have the gearshifter in fourth can i spin the gear shifter the whole gearshifter in my hand towards the passneger door... almost like maybe the little key at the bottom of the shifter has came out of the front shift rod key slot and is ableing the gearshifter to completely turn.....???
feels like its unscrewing (threaded)???? got to be the key coming loose on that one...?
