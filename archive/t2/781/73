Well, I couldnt get enough boiling water into my engine to get a good
reading. :)   I thought about maybe the sender not being correct.
I'll try to check the oil temp with another thermometer to see if
it's close. I don't think this is the problem though.

Dead thermostat originally, flaps in default open position. Installed
new thermostat, flaps close when engine cold and open when hot...this
is based on the position of the attach point of the cable to the flap
rod. When the flaps should be fully open, the thermostat cable attach
point is vertical. When closed, about the 10 o'clock position when looking
at it from the drivers side towards the passenger side. What I don't know
is how the flaps attach to the rod. Is it possible the flap is on the
rod incorrectly?

Engine runs fine...dwell/timing/idle set, vacuum good. My CHT seems
normal, bus drives just fine. I just have high oil temps. It takes
awhile to get that high...like 20 mins at 65 mph...ambient temps 90+,
but sometimes high 70's.

Should I be able to visual see the oil cooler from under the drivers
side of the engine?  Just wondering if I'm missing tin or something.
I'll have to check Bentley when I get home.
