Subject: RE: [T2] How difficult is welding ?

    Oh, also, welding is allot like like painting in that the more prep you 
do the better the welds turn out.  If your metal is absolutely clean and 
free of paint or dirt, and there is no gap at all between the two pieces of 
metal, and your in a comfortable position with lots of light, you are MUCH 
more likely to acheive success.

    An auto-darkening helmet is even more helpful to beginners than it is 
pro's, and you won't find too many pro's without them!  I reccomend making 
it one of your initial purchases rather than even waiting to see how you do 
without one.
