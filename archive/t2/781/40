Subject: High oil temps

Ok, I'm really baffled. I'm suffering from high oil temps, but
normal head temps.

1979 Federal FI 2.0L
3200 rpm
65 mph
oil pressure 40-45 psi
head temp 435F
oil temp 255F
vacuum 15" at idle

Even driving around town for an extended time where my head temps
average 375-390F, my oil temp will still climb to 255F gradually.

I have two theories. I'm interested in what you guys think is
going on.
