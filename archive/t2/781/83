My $.02 - my '79 had totally dead oxidized paint when I got it last year.  I
spend an afternoon cleaning and polishing:

Step 1 - Wash to remove all the road dirt and stuff
Step 2 - Polishing compound to remove dead paint
Step 3 - Wax with Turtle Wax - hey, it seventies paint, so why not use
seventies variety of car wax.

It came out great... like I said, just my $.02
