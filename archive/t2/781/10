sounds like you got Right side auto tranny shaft....Auto tranny is offset
to one side and half shafts are two different lengths, right side is
almost exactyl 20inches.  505mm.   manual tranny half shafts are only
476mm long.

check the half shalf does it have a ridge on it about midway.  this ridge
designates an auto tranny half shaft.
