 is it ok to use a beetle style muffler on a 70 bus?

Sure, if you want to risk dying from carbon monoxide poisoning.

And George replied:

 OTOH, thousands of folks have used beetle mufflers with no apparent
mortality.  I used to run one with an "iffy" rear hatch seal and my CO
detector card didn't detect any excess CO.

I did not say you would die. I said "if you want to risk dying".

And not everyone dies from have 1100 lb tires on their Westy either.

Some people get lucky.....

If you mis-read what I wrote as implying that you will die from using a bug muffler, then you need to re-read 
what I wrote. It seems like every time I reply to a post, uncomprehension rears it's ugly head. This is the 
last list post I am replying to, to the list. I am tired of this.
