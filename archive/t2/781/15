Subject: starter hanging up

Took a short stop after 40 miles at highway speeds.

Tried to start bus with clutch depressed and transmission
in reverse.  Cranked but did not fire.  Released key, 
paused a second, and tried again.  Still did not fire.
Released key but starter kept trying to crank.  Could
not get transmission to neutral, i.e., stuck in reverse.
Turning key had no effect either to get engine to fire
or to get starter to cease trying to start on key release.

As could not get get out of gear, a dilemma ensued.
Continued to hold down clutch for about two minutes until
cranking slowed to more or less nothing, put emergency on
and full released clutch.  Starter still engaged, but
emergency brake stronger.

Ran around to rear and popped open the engine compartment.
A fair amount of smoke but this was smoke from melting
wire.  Got battery out and disconnected, but burned my
hands on ground strap.  Had it towed and, ultimately,
have new starter/solenoid, new ground strap, and new
wires to alternator which had melted.  This bus does
have the aftermarket relay that shunts power to starter
without the round trip to the front end/key.

Looking for root cause, my mentor/mechanic recommends
pulling engine to see if clutch is somehow in bad shape.
Says he no longer has requisite equipment for some part
of that operation, leaving me to seek another mechanic
and/or invest in whatever it is that he is missing.
Seems like a long shot.

What do you think?

a year old and, no, the hammer whacking tricks had 
no effect ]
