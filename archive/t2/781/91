for sure, mine is about 5 years old and the darkening time is measured in
microseconds.  I have never been able to see the arc.  sometimes when the
arc is sputtering (you probably never have this problem) the lens is like
a strobe light lightening and darkening so fast.  Have seen new ones that
use the arc to recharge the battery for the strobe...never goes flat in
the middle of a job.

the old nod doesn't work too well when upside down under a bus...never
could get it to work right, finally tighten the hood up enough for it to
stay still, part of my problem was when at an angle it would move enough
so it wasn't in front of my glasses and then I "Really" couldn't see what
I was trying to do........
