Subject: Re: [T2] How difficult is welding ?

Having made the mistake of watching my father arc weld once - he usually shooed me away and I sneaked a look, I can tell you, don't do it. Took quite a while (hours) for my eyes to "come back" to normal after an extended look-see. Now I'm the Dad and away I shoo the children, dogs, cats, and other critters... Eyes are non-replacement items... Take care of 'em. My wife came into this world with poor vision and she'd sit you down and give you quite a lecture... <griN!> 

<but could not believe how they weld with NO hood, just looking away when they made contact!!!!!!!!!!!!>

FWIW we've got an OLD auto darkening hood in the family and it is slow to darken. So maybe the newer hoods are worth the extra cash over something vintage or used. I try to strike the arc (stick welding) or pull the trigger with my eyes closed and reopen immediately when the hood is dark when I have the pleasure of using an auto-hood. Personally I still use a normal hood. Setup the weld, a nod of the head and the hood pivots into place, and then start welding.
