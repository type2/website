Roy -

Then we must agree to disagree on this point, at least on the dusty, grimy
or oily part.  Dirt, which is not translucent, will of course block the
optical infared (I may have gone out on a limb here in the "dirt" dept).
But with several grimy VWs and a very grimy 72 Toyota Pickup, all of which I
used the XR700 in the past 30+ years experienced no aberrations in on and
off-road use.  On the other hand, a sand rail I had a 79 Calif Hall unit
installed on a Type 4 1700 over 15 years ago gave me nothing problems, what
with dust and grime in the distributor (even with one of those aftermarket
"dust boots" attached).  I switched it to a Federal 093 distributor,
installed an XR700 and had no running problems afterward.

But then again, it may have been just pure, dumb luck ;-)
