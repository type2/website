Subject: The KONI Shocks Have Arrived!

For those who have been anxiously awaiting the long-promised additional
custom run of Koni Bus shocks (of original "group buy" fame), the shipment
Koni promised me 3 months ago showed up at my door today.

For those unaware, these are considered to be far and away the best shock
you can put on your Bus. They are user-adjustable for rebound ("firmness")
and carry a lifetime warranty from Koni, so they're literally the last
shocks you'll ever have to buy for your Bus. They had been long obsolete
when Richard Atwell convinced Koni to do a special run, culminating in a
Type 2 list group buy that I put together. Since then, Koni has on-again
off-again agreed (then not agreed, then agreed) to do another custom run for
us. The fronts fit '70-79; the rears '68-79.

As before, this will be first-come, first-serve, web orders only. No list
discount applies (although they do count toward the $50 minimum for your
list discount, so any additional qualifying items on the same order will get
the discount if you use the  list1e  referral code).

The links are below. I will do my best to pull them from the site
immediately once sold out, to avoid anyone who places an order being
disappointed.  I'm sure they won't sell out overnight, but if you do go to
one of these links and it's dead, that means you missed them.
