 My little Mityvac gadget has a nice pressure/vacuum gauge on it. I
 use this to measure the level of vacuum in my 43 PICT-3  carbs which
 have a port for advance and one for vacuum. Any pressure gauge which
 reads, say, 0 - 20 psi will do.

 Here are the measurements that I got.

 At the port on the left side of the carb:
At idle: 5 psi
Off idle:  values up to 15 psi
At the port on the rear of the carb:
At idle:  15 psi
Off idle:  < 15 psi

 If I measure manifold vacuum anywhere on my engine, I get a value of 15.

 The port on the left side is the vacuum advance port. Off idle, it
 provides a healthy vacuum to the can on the distributor which in turn
 advances the timing.

 The port on the rear of a 34PICT-3 is the retard port. At idle, it
 provides a healthy vacuum to snap the points' plate to its full
 retard position. Off idle, it's vacuum is overtaken by the vacuum
 from the advance port.

 These are my readings and conclusions. Hope this helps.

Vacuum is underpressure. Underpressure is measured in inches of Mercury.

There is no way a 0 to 20 PSI gauge will measure inches of Mercury or a vacuum. Once the needle drops to zero,
it stops. A PSI gauge uses pressure to move it. A vacuum gauge uses underpressure to move it.

[technically, vacuum is a lack of pressure in a container, i.e a vacuum reservoir like a brake booster.
'Vacuum' formed at the throttle plate is underpressure]
