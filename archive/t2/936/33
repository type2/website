Subject: GPS recommendations - think I've got it

Had my first encounter with a Garmin N|vi the other day.  Beautiful day and 
splendid scenery went largely unnoticed as we focused on commands from the 
voice-synthesizer.  I guess if I had to deliver pizzas for a living I might 
want one of these in my car, but for pleasure cruising I'm not convinced.

OTOH, when the price comes down in a year or two, having one in the family, 
that we can move from vehicle to vehicle as needed.... well, might not be a bad 
thing.  I certainly wouldn't want a factory built-in.  Apart from the price, if 
the sun is shining over your shoulder, you can not read the display.
