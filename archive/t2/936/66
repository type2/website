Subject: [T2] plastic brake hose 76 bus

ok i need to know what the plastic brake hose that comes from the resovoir(under seat) to the resovoir on the top of master cylinder is made of besides plastic....? 

my dilema is my old brake resovoir that went on top of master cylinder was broken.... so i got another one and now the tit is the other way on it so the plastic hose wont reach from top of resovoir(under seat ) to the one that goes on top of master cylinder.... 

i can not use blue braided brake hose the hose is not wide enough... and i will not jerry rig my brakes any longer.. 

i can however buy plastic pvc braided hose from lowes that looks to work but i dont wont it if it aint safe.... 

can someone tell me what the vw original plastic hose is made of....? and most of all ?? 

where the heck can i get it from .... 
i need about 5 more inches to make it to the tit LOL... 

anyone know? 

thanks
