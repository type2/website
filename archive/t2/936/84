Chai,

Email Chris at BustedBus and get the correct reservoir. Trying to make up
the gap may be difficult to match.

ok i need to know what the plastic brake hose that comes from the
resovoir(under seat) to the resovoir on the top of master cylinder is made
of besides plastic....? 

my dilema is my old brake resovoir that went on top of master cylinder was
broken.... so i got another one and now the tit is the other way on it so
the plastic hose wont reach from top of resovoir(under seat ) to the one
that goes on top of master cylinder.... 

i can not use blue braided brake hose the hose is not wide enough... and i
will not jerry rig my brakes any longer.. 

i can however buy plastic pvc braided hose from lowes that looks to work but
i dont wont it if it aint safe.... 

can someone tell me what the vw original plastic hose is made of....? and
most of all ?? 

where the heck can i get it from .... 
i need about 5 more inches to make it to the tit LOL...
