My little Mityvac gadget has a nice pressure/vacuum gauge on it. I 
use this to measure the level of vacuum in my 43 PICT-3  carbs which 
have a port for advance and one for vacuum. Any pressure gauge which 
reads, say, 0 - 20 psi will do.

Here are the measurements that I got.

At the port on the left side of the carb:
	At idle: 5 psi
	Off idle:  values up to 15 psi
At the port on the rear of the carb:
	At idle:  15 psi
	Off idle:  < 15 psi

If I measure manifold vacuum anywhere on my engine, I get a value of 15.

The port on the left side is the vacuum advance port. Off idle, it 
provides a healthy vacuum to the can on the distributor which in turn 
advances the timing.

The port on the rear of a 34PICT-3 is the retard port. At idle, it 
provides a healthy vacuum to snap the points' plate to its full 
retard position. Off idle, it's vacuum is overtaken by the vacuum 
from the advance port.

These are my readings and conclusions. Hope this helps.
