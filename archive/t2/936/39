Subject: getting rid of points

I read yesterday in some FAQ

"So you've bought a CDI or Pertronix or upgraded your ignition system 
and this has increased your mileage."

the same article says it could go from 16 to 26 mpg!

I'd be happy to increase it a few mpg!  does installing an electronic 
system really help and if so, which is recommended?  And the cost 
woudl be about $180. (I thought it would be about $100) Also, do I 
need to get replace my distributor, the lobes have worn down.

Thanks
