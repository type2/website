Ah, but it is NOT a "Hall" Ignition System.  Allison/Crane XR700 units have
been an infared-opto-trigger beam style for the past 30+ years.  The beam is
broken by the slots in the rotor disc installed on the distributor shaft
just below the ignition rotor.  The nice thing about the opto-trigger beam
is that dust/dirt does not usually affect it, unlike cheeper Hall "magnetic"
style ignitions.

But it is still classified as an Electronic Ignition System.
