I would assume by the time I got back the muffler would be a problem 
so I would replace it before the trip. Rule out a problem.

Perhaps just replace the valve cover gaskets and pushrod tube seals.

First, reset the valves. Try just 1/4 turn in from contact and see 
how the compression tests then. I would not head out on a road trip 
with the weak cylinder. Just asking for problems in a snow storm over 
a pass. Not the place to address a failure.

Yes, put on good snow tires and have chains for sure.

Flush the brake fluid and exercise the calipers, then inspect for 
leaks behind the caliper boots. If the fluid is nasty, 
rebuild/replace the cylinders and calipers. Other maintenance. 
Replace the trans fluid. Verify steering gear adjustment and steering 
links/ball joints. Check all lights. Wipers. Play in front and rear 
wheel bearings. Replace all old fuses with new ceramic bodied spec type.

I would verify all maintenance given in the Bentley before any long 
range travel. Lots cheaper to fix now than to fail when out of town.
