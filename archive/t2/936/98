Vacuum is a pressure below atmospheric. It can be measured in absolute (pressure above a perfect vacuum, atmospheric is about 14.7 PSI), or gage (relative to atmospheric). You can use mm or inches of mercury, or PSI, or kilopascals, or any other unit of pressure one desires.

Unless it is an absolute pressure gauge, instead of a gage pressure gauge. From the description, it appears to be indicating "negative" pressure = 0-15 PSI of vacuum.
