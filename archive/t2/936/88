Yep.  However, like the 72-on Bay Window, US sold 411/412s were (I believe)
lower compression engines.  914s & 912Es tended to have flat or domed
top pistons for higher compression depending on the model.  European
411/412s (at least those with Dual Carbs) had flat-top pistons, based on the
part numbers in my references.
