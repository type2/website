Subject: No vehicle inspections in Saskatchewan

All of this talk of emissions testings makes me thankful I'm living in
Saskatchewan, Canada.  No emissions testing.  No safety inspections
(unless the vehicle is used and has never been registered in Saskatchewan
before).  Studded tires are allowed year-round (no jokes about them being
required year-round).

Of course, we have to pay for that with a long cold winter that keeps most
older or unmaintained vehicles off the roads anyway...
