Hello, List well yesterday it happened. I brought
home a 1975 Riviera, to add to my 78' Westy, and 79'
standard bus. The body and interior is in good shape,
but the PPO thought he heard a Knock in the motor so
he tore it down then gave up on it. Then the Po bought
it and tried to rebuild it and then gave up, but he
did atleast store it in the garage for 7 years before
I got it.

So now it is in my drive way. Waiting for spring when
I can start to fix the motor. The PO put the motor
together as a longblock then installed the motor
without the cross bar mount. I don't have anyplace to
pull the motor or store it indoors, so I am planning
to fill the motor full with fresh oil, hoping that
will keep it good until I can rebuild it. Also it has
no heater boxes on it so I am going to stuff some oily
rags up in there to keep them clean.

Now I just have to wait until spring. In the mean time
I will be making some parts lists, and start ordering
when I have extra cash, that way I will be ready for
the rebuild.

Or I will keep my eyes open for a good running 2000cc
motor to put in it. So if anyone has a spare motor in
the southern Idaho, Northern Utah, or surrounding
areas let me know. 

Thanks,
Shawn R.
