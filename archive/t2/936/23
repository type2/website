Subject: OTP - GPS recommendations - think I''ve got it narrowed.

OK, this is off topic, but who better to ask than users. I think I've narrowed
down what I can afford around the 300 dollar mark. The Garmin i3, the Garmin
C320, or the older Garmin 2610. They all are around what I can afford, but I'm
open to ideas for units around that price that can let you plot waypoints. the
i3 and C320 sort of do, the older 2610 can for sure. I am wanting something
like these types of units that suction cup to the front window and have voice.
It would be neat to have optional extras, but don't really know what I need as
I'm a GPS rookie. These ones just seemed to be about what I'm after. What
about Lowrance, Magellan(I hear they suck at support), or there are no-namers
like Prima and Nexus??? Would appreciate input here.
Thanks in advance,
Courtney
