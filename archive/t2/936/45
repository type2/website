Mark is absolutely right about the Crane (formerly Allison) XR700 - it is a
far better unit than the Accu-Fire, Compu-Fire or Pertronix that has been
available.  The best reason people buy the these three Electronic Ignition
conversions are that they are CHEAP.  But that doesn't mean they're as good
or better.  I've used nothing but Allison/Crane XR700's since the early 70s
on most any VW I've converted with much better relaibility and results.
Yes, I have installed the other three at one time or another, but always had
reliability and efficiency issues and always went back to the
Allison/Crane.  Sure it's a bit spendier (around $150), but it's worth it in
the long run.
