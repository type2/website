Subject: Re: [T2] fixing value tube leaks

Scott, et al,

I just reinstalled the engine in my 79 after replacing the 1/2 head  
(new AMC head).  My push rod tubes were in poor shape all around and  
I replaced all 8 of them at the same time.

At this point, the push rod tubes are leaking on the head side on the  
new head only.  I used new green o-rings that came in an engine seal  
kit.  On the side with the old head, the push rod tubes don't leak a  
bit; only on the new head.  On the leaky side I replaced the green o- 
rings with red viton ones yesterday, but this didn't fix the problem;  
the seals on the head side are still leaking.

I purchased some Loctite 565 today from an industrial hose supplier  
here in Tucson and it is about this that I am writing.  When you  
install the push rod tubes with loctite 565, how long do you allow it  
to cure before running the engine?

Before I use this stuff I'm going to get out my dial calipers and  
compare the push rod hole size between the old and the new head.  Do  
you know if 565 has any gap limit?  The tech spec for it does not  
specify a gap limit, the size of the gap that it will successfully  
seal, only that it will take longer to cure with a larger gap.

Thanks a bunch,
Zack
