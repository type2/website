Here in Phoenix we can sit in the passenger seat, and the tester drives the
car.  I have heard that with some persuading we can drive our own car.
Bless you and thanks, uj

Mine just passed our lax local emissions test.  They didn't do a run-up test
like that, idle only.  But they would not let me out of the vehicle.  I
started to walk away and just let them handle it and the lady said they were
not allowed inside a customers vehicle.  So stay put and you will be in
control of the gears.  Cheers...KR

When you bring your VW into Emissions, tell the driver NOT to put it into
4th gear. They only have to maintain a 30 MPH speed. If they up shift to 4th
gear your motor will load up. This is bad because after this test, they do
the idle test. This will make it difficult to pass on idle. VWs are famous
for failing on idle. 3rd gear is all you need for 30MPH. !!!
