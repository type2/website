Mid America Motorworks sells a kit to do just that. Saves the hassle of
scrounging up the parts. However, don't expect them to fit perfectly since
they would be aftermarket.

Subject: [T2] Dog house oil cooler & pedestal questions

I'm building a franken motor for my '70 bus out of a bunch of 1600cc.

I purchased a doghouse oil cooler & pedestal in hopes of converting
everything to dual port.
Only problem is that they did not come with hardware.
What do I need to install this?
And now that I am looking at it, I am confused as to how to mount it.
Help! hehe
