one interesting and little known tidbit is that no test statiion that I
know of anywhere in the USA  is allowed to drive a vehicle equipped with
modifications for handicapped drivers.  I think it probably has to do with
insurance, the stuff is so expensive, so custom, and so easy to damage
that they don't want to touch it.  In Md if you have such a VW, all you
get is the static tailpipe test and I have heard it is that way in most
(all) other states.  might be cheaper to buy a set of hand controlls and
have you disabled friend drive to the test station.
