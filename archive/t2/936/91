How's the best way to check to see what kind of vacuum I'm getting from the carb?  It is not plugged as far as I can see.  What kind of vacuum should I expect?  Wouldn't be any good buying the SVDA if I don't have vacuum.   Cheers...KR

I'd start with the SVDA first.  The difference is huge and you'll get 
better performance.  When I first bought my 78, the PO had an 009 
installed in there and I instantly knew something was wrong.  Luckily he 
had the original vacuum advance distributor and it made a world of 
difference in drivability.

The main advantage of electronic points is that you won't have to ever 
adjust your timing as long as you don't move your distributor.  My 
timing has been rock solid without any adjustments for the past 50,000 
miles.
