Subject: Re: [T2] In defense of points

Amen, John.  I've never had a problem.  Any time I have any issues at all, I replace the points.  Cheap.  But they've never ended up being the problem.  (Except for maybe once)  I can't imagine my bus running any better than it does now.  With a 009!  Right now it's just not worth making the change with all of the time involved in getting it to work, resetting the timing, etc.  That's what I've decided after reading all about SVDA, electronic ignition, etc.  Maybe someday, but not tomorrow.  I'm just not that convinced yet.  If it ain't broke...OK, it ain't but I'm still thinking about it.  Maybe I'll start cheap with that Hot-spark set-up.  The price is right.  Cheers...KR

simple, uncomplicated and inexpensive. I've never had timing problems with  
them or anything else.  Just check and and adjust every once in a while.
