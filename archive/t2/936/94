 k, I just realized my brain was stuck.

 The cooler sits upright, what had me stumped was the two studs on the flange that go into the case. I just
realized they are nutted from below.

If you are using an early case, the 3rd holddown hole will be 6mm. The doghouse adaptor hole is 8mm. I use a
stepped stud: 6 to 8mm and screw it into the case.

You will also need the correct stepped seals that go between the case and the adaptor:
