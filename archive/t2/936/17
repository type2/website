Many times, buses will get a rust through spot up
inside the front wheel well, right behind the wheel.
Then when you drive the bus, the tire throws all kinds
of crap up in that spot (which is probably why it
rusted through there in the first place). You may
start by laying on the ground and looking up in there...
