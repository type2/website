Go to this weblink on Crane's site - this is for stock VW/Bosch points
distributors, NOT 009's:

http://www.cranecams.com/?show=browseParts&lvl=8&prt=1920&action=partSpec&partNumber=700-0231

Their PN is 700-0231

maybe I'm missing something on their website but all they say that they
will work with is the 009 dist, what about the stock vacuum units.  I have
looked at em and I hear you guys but before I plunk down that many bucks I
want to know it will work with the proper advance etc.  especially
important since I have an automatic which tends to be more sensitive to
those issues,  I had an 009 in it when I got it and it was horrible
finally found a decent stock dist and the difference was amazing, I don't
want to give up that to get the Crane
