my late wife absolutely refused to drive my bus so I got her a 74 412 and
she loved it.  never had many problems with it and while the brakes could
have used bigger disks the 412 was a great kid hauler.  she really cried
when it got hit (while parked) by a drunk and bent the chassis and it
could not be repaired and we couldn't find another one.

I always thought the 412 was one of the most underated cars ever
