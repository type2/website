Subject: Re: [T2] In defense of points

Hey Guys   Now I have both in any of the 13 VWs and porsches that  I have on 
the road. In defense of points yes they are cheap but as in any  ingnition  
replacements there are cheap stuff and good stuff. I ran into a  bunch of bosch 
points that were pure junk, reconized by the white rubbing block,  these were 
either breaking the block or just quitting all together,  USA  made points 
aren't much better.  So I asked the formual Vee guys what  points they used as it 
is required for them and they sure didn't want cheap  points failing on them. 
They all use the 01 030 bosch points reconized by the  black/white lead wire. 
Now I am sure there is going to be a pile of people on  here telling me that 
the cheap stuff works great for them . :)  So be  it  you guys use what you 
feel good with ,ME I think I will use what works  best and lasts longest and 
that would be bosch 01 030 points and the Crane XR700  unit  later  Mark Dearing
