Subject: Re: Dog house oil cooler & pedestal questions

hmm... I also have an external oil filter and external cooler from another
motor...

Where is the best place to mount the external oil cooler?

I suspect this will be the better way overall to go, plus! I have the
hardware for this.

Wish I thought of it before I spent too  much money on the internal cooler.
