Oooooooooooo, 80psi in one cylinder brings back bad memories of my Ex-80
Vanagon.  Had the same thing in #1 and it lead to a burnt valve & dropped
seat.  Not fun, happened about 50 miles from home, but I was able to limp
back.  Ever try replacing the right side head (#1 & 2 cylinders) with the
engine still in?  It can be done, but not without a lot of cussing, skinned
knuckles, blood & sweat.

Try the valve adjustment procedure that doktortim outlines to re-check the
compression in the 80psi cylinder.  If it's still 80, pull the head, check
and replace valves (and maybe the seat(s)) as necessary.
